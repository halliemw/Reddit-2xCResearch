t3_24whhb,"Boyfriend says he probably won't stay with me if I have an abortion. I want one. Help?","I(24) just found out I'm pregnant. I'm not ready for a baby. I don't have enough to support it, plus, my career is just kicking off. It's simply not a good time. I used the pill and condoms but somehow it still happened. 


My boyfriend (25) and I agreed before sex that if I were to be pregnant we'd abort. Two years later here we are. He says he can't bear the thought of it and that if I abort he's not sure if we can stay together. I love this guy to death. We were planning on getting married in the next year. That he would break up with me over a clump of (life ruining) cells hurts, but I know he doesn't see it that way. Still I feel cheated that he changed his views. I know it's different when you're actually experiencing it, but still. 


With our income combined we make over six figures, so whenever I say we can't afford it he brings that up. But ideally I'd want to have much much more in my savings before bringing a kid in the world. Plus like I said, the timing is awful. I'm not ready to be a parent. Three-four years-sure. Now-no. 



I'm very conflicted because I really want an abortion but I also love my boyfriend deeply. I try to explain to him why I'm not ready for a kid but he remains steadfast.



 On top of worrying about my relationship's future I also have to worry about getting the actual abortion, because my parents are pro-life and I don't really feel comfortable asking my friends to go with me to something like this. My boyfriend refuses to go. I can't go alone, since I'm getting anesthesia (unless I wait in the hospital for hours while it wears off.) I at least want him there with me, but he absolutely refuses. 



Sorry if this is jumbled, I'm pretty stressed. I feel like the clock is ticking and on one hand I want to get on with my life asap, but on the other hand I don't want to hurt my boyfriend, who I thought I'd spend my life with. Help?  



Tl,dr:


-Used 2 bc methods, got pregnant anyway (I was on an antibiotic for a few days and I think a condom may have broken once (*once!*). In retrospect it was stupid, but at the time I thought I was covered and it was fine.)


-I don't feel ready for a baby, financially and maturity wise. My boyfriend of 2 years does. 


-He says if I abort we'll probably break up because the thought of it disturbs him so much. I say I just can't have a child now. 


-I haven't scheduled an appointment yet. I know I want to but I keep waiting, hoping he'll come around (even though I know he won't.) What to do?",28,20140506171851,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24wtve,"I have just started at a small law firm, but I want to quit due to a lot of red flags. Am I being over dramatic and all firms are like this? Sorry if wrong subreddit, but I am paranoid.","EDIT: I already have another interview lined up. Although some are whispering in my ear to simply leave without notice, I don't think I could do that unless it got way out of hand. Thank you so much for your kind and reassuring words. Telling him is going to be hard but I'm going to do it after my interview if it goes well. Thank you all again. I feel much better putting it all on the table and really analyzing the situation.

I was going to post in /r/LawFirms, but now I am terrified that he uses this site and goes on that subreddit. He has made me paranoid.

It's one guy. Somehow he has been running his firm by himself for months. I was hired spontaneously despite my utter lack of experience (I have education, but no practice). I know that it's important to not make mistakes since we're dealing with clients and court, but every time I make even a very minor mistake that would take a second to correct, he flips. He does not give constructive criticism, he tells me in a very annoyed/angry tone that I need to ""pay attention and get it together"" and by him having to fix my mistake (he makes me get out of my chair to fix it even though I tell him I can type it in but then he says he can't trust me) I'm wasting his time and then goes on a lecture of either how much other stuff he needs to do or why his system works.

He told me in the beginning that the people before me had quit on him. Now I find out he fired them. His whole team. At a law firm.

Also, he's paranoid. He goes on how other firms are jealous of him being able to do so much by himself so they're hiring people to call us and set up consultations they'll never commit to and ""waste his time"".

I am constantly on edge. I have only worked there less than a month, but I have never felt so stressed out in my life. I feel like I am making all of these mistakes because I am so terrified of making mistakes. I know my memory isn't that bad but for some reason when he gives me the simplest of instructions I completely freeze up.

Are most firms like this? There are other things I don't agree with, such as he is SO rude to people on the phone and cusses in front of clients. He does get the cases done, and he is rated very well, but the inside goings on just don't fit well with me.

I was paranoid that it was because I wasn't fit for this kind of job, and was bummed because I've wanted to work in a family law firm for a very long time.

Any thoughts? Sorry my thought process was so jumbled. I'm just so emotionally out right now. My boyfriend says I should look for something else, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't overreacting.",4,20140506193618,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I went back home for the weekend and talked with my dad for a bit. He mentioned that things with my mom and my stepdad are not going well. At all. A few weeks ago she came by to pick up my sister, and she had a black eye. Last week, Mom and Stepdad got in a fight, and he kicked her out of the car in the middle of an unfamiliar part of town; she had to walk around and find a church, no phone, no purse, nothing.

Both my mom and my stepdad have serious alcohol problems, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're both a danger to each other. But simply due to the size difference, I think my stepdad could pose a serious physical threat to my mom. He's also a hunter, so he has guns.

I'm really worried, I don't know what to do. I'd try to set her up with some info but I know he goes through her phone. I don't know if I can call her and not have him overhear. I'm worried that if I try to help her, I'm going to get her in even more trouble. My dad has encouraged her to get a divorce but she doesn't really listen to him.

I'm desperate for advice. What should I do? (If it helps, she lives near St. Louis, and she is very religious so I'm definitely open to finding church/Christian help for her. Even if it's just a Bible verse that I can text her.)",0,20140506193507,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24wtyk,"I lied and I need some advice.","I'm posting here because you ladies are always understanding, I'm sorry that this is not the most relevant post. So growing up, I got into a habit of lying as it was a safe, easy way of diffusing conflict. However now I'm at a point where it is safe to be honest, but my mind still jumps to lying first and I have to deliberately think about it if I'm going to tell the truth. 

So at work I have to apply to register for this federal scheme so I can get this paperwork which is important to doing my job. I had a total mind blank and didn't register before applying for the paperwork, so naturally I got back a polite rejection. 

My boss came in and I told him how I got rejected and would be reapplying, and he asked why. And instead of the sensible ""I forgot to register first"", I said ""I entered my registration number wrong"". I don't even know why I said that. So now I'm worried that this is going to ruin our good working relationship. 

So should I just let it slide and hope he doesn't find out, or should I go to him and tell him I misunderstood and here's the truth, or straight out tell him I lied, apologize, and tell him the truth. I'm just worried that the admin people will call work and he'll be caught out not knowing the whole story. Or I'm worried that my coworker will bring it up with him (if it werent for gossip this town would collapse) and then I'll look even worse. 

Tldr: lied to boss, should I tell him the truth or just let it slide.

But some of the parking lots I go to to pick up a quick dinner or stop at the pharmacy are a little sketchy. I don't have any big issue with people soliciting for money. Everyone has to get by in some way. But when I'm walking alone in a parking lot, and in my car, do NOT APPROACH ME AND ASK FOR MONEY. I feel trapped! A month ago I was in my car waiting to pick up a pizza when I man tapped on my CAR WINDOW and said something along the lines of ""Hey pretty mama how bout some change."" I was shocked.

How to deal when something awful happens and you do all you can to stop it and now it's out of your control?","So I'm crying and crying, and I have a final tomorrow and I haven't even opened my book yet.  Tomorrow my school is out for the summer.  There are a lot of cats in my school.  I was going to adopt [this one](http://imgur.com/a/v7zzq), I had named him popcorn.  Popcorn already used to come to me meowing, and he waited for his treats and food everyday. I had the chance to take him home last weekend but I didn't because I wanted to do everything right and talk to the school first.  They have been living in the same place for years, there was no way I could have seen this coming.  This morning, I went there to bring them some food and saw to my horror that their house (a hole on the ground) had been cemented and he was nowhere to be found. I started asking questions, first to the professors who feed them as well, and found out that they too were looking for answers.  I called / emailed the physical  planning of my school several times and no one took my call or replied to me.  I called the animal shelter to see if they had received any cats from campus, they assured me they haven't.  During the day I wasn't too worried cause I had hopes they ran and hid (but the hole *was* their hiding place), so I just stayed by the computer and the phone and went there several times to see if maybe they had escaped before the hole was cemented.  But none of them came back and they know that's where the professors and I put their food, so they should have come back by now, which means they were probably trapped there and are either dead or dying.  I was *so* sure he was coming home with me tomorrow!

The horror of it all just hit me, that they were probably buried alive, and it came along with another horror - the realization that people simply don't care.  I'm sorry if this is too silly, but I don't know how to handle it?  It seems like I should be doing something, cause I know that he (and the others) are there probably fighting for their life, but I don't know what else to do.  I told everybody, I asked for help, I *begged* for help.  He is probably dying and I know where he is and I feel like I **have** to rescue him but no one listens to me.  I can't just go there and break the cement on a private property and I don't even know what I am feeling right now when I imagine what he is probably going through.  Please tell me what to do.

t3_24wovj,"Sexual Assault, Alcohol, & Attire: Giving Advice While Avoiding Victim-Blaming","Hi everyone, I'm looking for some guidance/constructive criticism (and hoping to avoid a flame war).

I help edit a blog for a local non-profit -- all bloggers are volunteers, including me, i.e., we're not all necessarily media-savvy pros. One of our writers put together a great post with advice for women going on vacation. However, there is one paragraph that is bothering me, but I'd like some input from other smart people before I go back to her with constructive criticism for how to change it.

She advises readers visiting other countries/cultures to avoid sexual assault by dressing in accordance with cultural norms and avoiding excessive drinking. I'm uncomfortable with those kinds of unqualified statements, as of course they can be interpreted as blaming the victim. I'm wondering if I should ask her to omit this paragraph completely, or if any of you think there are ways to advise women on ways to decrease their risk without entering victim-blaming territory.

I believe that the only people responsible for rape are rapists, but when we live in a world where most rapists are empowered by their surrounding culture to get away with their crimes, I think there must be ways to teach self-protection in ways that don't perpetuate these cultural structures.

I have really been working hard to get better at communicating my needs in my relationship. I always thought it was my fault for not being clear, but I just recently emailed my boyfriend and I feel totally stuck on what to do next.

[First part of what was said](http://imgur.com/qomB3UQ)

At this point I regrettably lose my cool [and this is what I say next](http://imgur.com/K6WvsA8). At the end, I'm still left feeling like my problem isn't really resolved and only a few days later he again acts like what I said I didnt like in the email.it's like watching a 2yr old throw a tantrum the way he treats me when he doesnt want to talk.

I'm just so sick of not being able to find the right way to reach him, to have things made into my fault, to have my concerns completely ignored, to be treated like the problems in this relationship are all my fault.

Before you guys ask, I am with this person because we do have so much fun together and I enjoy being with him. But when I come to him with a concern it's like a switch flips and he's a totally different assholey person. Edited to add that he will not bring up concerns he has with me until I bring something up with him. He told the counselor ""I just feel like it's a good time"" and even the racist&sexist counselor told him that's not normal. After him doing that (feels like he's steamrolling me) so many times I feel like he does it on purpose, you know?

And yes, I have been to counseling a few times but it didn't work out and I am out of money and literally out of options in my area. The sessions were so incredibly unhelpful that I feel twoX is my last resort to figure things out in this relationship, at least for myself anyway.

I am 75% sure I am going to break up with him because after 4 years of the same ignoring me, being a jerk when he doesn't want to talk instead of using his words, making me feel like everything is my fault I am just so worn out.

So WW2XD? Could someone ""grade"" my activity in the emails I linked above? I.e. what could I have done better to get him to listen, tips to avoid letting the frustration show up.

The description of TwoX the side bar says ""Welcome to TwoXChromosomes, a subreddit for thoughtful content - serious or silly - related to gender, and **intended for women's perspectives**.""


Bearing that in mind, I have noticed that anyone submitting a pro-choice statement is pretty well left alone, or upvoted. 
Anyone submitting a pro-abortion statement is upvoted and supported, and anyone submitting an anti-abortion/pro-life statement is downvoted or receives backlash in comments.


Why is it OK to be pro-abortion and not pro-life in this sub? When did we decide that only one opinion could be had in TwoX? Isn't that what r/prolife and r/prochoice are for?
Is that the ""perspective"" we're supposed to have, abortion should be OK becuse I am a woman? That the choice not to agree with abortion is wrong, and goes against how we should feel as a woman?


And in regard to Emily Lett's video (the lady who filmed her abortion to show that it's not scary), I think that it sends a dangerous message. 


**While there are legitimate reasons for abortion** and it is much safer than it used to be, I think that this video sends the message that, ""If you get pregnant by accident, having an abortion really isn't a big deal.""


I feel that the focus should be on prevention rather than ""dealing with"" an unwanted pregnancy once it has occurred. As safe as abortions may be now, contraception is much safer, both physically and emotionally.

As much as we don't want abortion or unwanted pregnancy to affect our lives, and as much as we say it's our choice and noone else's, the fact remains that a pregnancy can affect others as well as yourself. If you are in a committed relationship, accidentally fall pregnant and don't want to keep it, there's a chance the woman's decision not to keep the fetus may be different to the man's opinion. And as much as it's YOUR body, it's HIS child too.


It oculd be that pro-choice is so massively supported in this sub because we feel that abortion is such an unpopular subject outside. In this day and age, while there is still a stigma attached to abortion, there is a lot of support for ladies who fall pregnant by accident.
We don't need to bash pro-life activists to support pro-choice. 

We have the choice to decide whether we do or do not want an abortion, and noone on this sub should be told they're wrong for not agreeing with someone else's choice.

Our dad is emotionally and physically abusive, and Claire (my sister) seems to take the brunt of the abuse. My dad loves our youngest sister (Elisa, 12 almost 13) and it's very obvious she's the golden child. My brother (Tim, 13 almost 14) seems to be okay. My parents seem to like him, but since he's a boy they've made him go to work almost every day he's been free, including after school, since he was two years old. I'm not exaggerating about how much he has to go to work on the farm with our dad. He has literally no free time to hang out with friends because he has to work so much. 

Anyway, back to claire. She's quite a bit heavier than us, and my dad never lets her forget that. He makes fat jokes about her daily, which I participated in until I realized how fucked up it was. Tim and Elisa still make fun of claire as far as I know. Example of a joke: we were watching animal planet and there was a whale on a sling that had to be transported to a hospital, and my dad said ""hey look, it's claire."" 

Claire won't hug or touch anyone, or let anyone touch her, which would be fine, but I think it's because she has never felt loved by her parents. She won't even tell anyone she loves them. She's very cold towards others, but I know how much she hurts. I can see it in her face when my dad makes fun of her. The only emotions she ever shows are fear, anger, and sadness. 

She has crippling social anxiety.. She can't even order her own food at restaurants, or check out at a store by herself. She won't go on school field trips or go to field days or anything. She never has friends over or goes to hang out with anyone. My parents told her she can't get a car until she's 21. I told her she can leave my parent's house and live with me when she turns 18, but she said she ""can't just leave,"" as if she has to be stuck there forever or something. 

During one of our dad's ""outbursts"" as I like to call them, Claire called me to tell me what was going on, and I called the police and told them the situation and that there was possibly going to be child abuse if they didn't go get involved and calm him down. The police got there and said there was a ""disturbance of the peace"" call, my dad said everything was fine, and the police left. That made me fucking furious. But I don't think he's had an outburst since, and it's been a year since that. Claire later told me ""thank you for calling the police. I'll go to that stupid therapist thing you were talking about."" Prior to then I had been talking to her about getting mental help. Not that my parents would allow it, but I told her when she's 18 she should go. 

I'm worried about her mental health and how she's going to function in the real world. I don't know what to do in this situation. ",35,20140507053856,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

When my best friend and I decided to graduate a year early, that kind of left a lot of people behind. We both moved away as well, so while our other friends were still in HS we were out living our own lives. We always kept in touched and ended up living fairly close to each other. We had been best friends for 6 years up until probably 6-8 months ago. We both started getting a little more serious with the men in our lives. She moved in her with hers and I was usually staying with mine. Naturally we started spending less time together and more time with our SO's. We'd still talk occasionally. Then the talking and meeting up for dinner once a month stopped. I tried speaking to her, but she was so busy with her SO she didn't have time for me. So for the past 8 months the only person I've hung out with is my SO. Which I'm okay with, he's my best friend, but I have no other friends. I have co workers I talk to and hang out with maybe once every two months or so and he has friends that I see when we all hang out, but I don't just have a friend to talk to and hang out with. I'm moving out of state in January so it's almost pointless to try and make a new best friend here. I think it would be nice and just fun to have a pen pal. Someone I can write and tell my stories to, someone who can entertain me with their stories. If anyway is interested you can send me a message and we can exchange emails!

My boyfriend and I just got engaged and we want to marry as soon as possible (perhaps that's odd but we want to do it within the next two months, it will be a very intimate ceremony in the mountains with only a few loved ones).

We are both poor but madly in love and I want to have a gorgeous ceremony without breaking the bank. 
The most important things I feel confused over are...rings...I don't really understand if we should buy matching rings or something or what he would want. 

and the dress...I want a beautiful dress but I want a cheap dress and I don't really care about it being perfect. 

I also don't know what else to account for. 

we're both writing our own vows and we are not religious so the ceremony is mostly going to be about an exchange of words.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to make the ceremony even more special while minimizing costs? or what did you do at your wedding that you enjoyed that isnt too extravagant? I don't really care about the wedding itself, I just want to be married to the love of my life, but I do want the ceremony/ritual is slightly important to me, I want  it to be beautiful and memorable.

What do you guys think?

Note: I've never been to a wedding so I really don't know what I'm doing.

A little background: I have been working in this line of work for a while now (3 years at my present company, seven years total professional experience). It's a male-heavy industry, but I am one of two women in my specific department. The issue I'm confused about here involves being a 32 year old woman who looks approx 10 years younger than I actually am. Normally, I'm pretty pumped that people see me as younger, but my co workers are all below the age of 25. I've been thinking more about this lately, especially since we just hired a new person right out of college. He's 22. 

Aside from feeling a bit like Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused (I keep getting older while they stay the same age) I am wondering if looking much younger is hurting my career. I'd like to move up and be given the opportunity to grow, but feel like I can't because my superiors might think I ""lack experience"". Not everyone knows my work history. But I feel like I am to blame for letting my bosses think I'm a 22 year old newb because I'm viable parinoid about my actual age, rather then reminding then I'm been working for 17 damn years, and in this industry for 7. 

I'm also a little ashamed because  hiding my age is such a ""woman"" thing (ugh) that is to be expected. 

I'm sorry if this is not the right place, but it's such a weird situation and thought some other woman has had this sort of thing happen, and how the hell do I deal with this conflict in my head? 

I guess that I should mention that every time I bring up my age to anyone, ANYONE, they don't believe me. I still get carded at bars and when buying wine out. Last week when I told a fellow female worker in another department that we are, in fact the same age, after she condescended to me she demanded to see my damn drivers license. I have no idea how to handle this in my professional life, sorry for the rant. Please help :(

EDIT: wow, I just got off work and am very happy to read your helpful, honest responses (despite the weird random downvotes). I do ask for projects lately and am now lead in two specific tasks that I volunteered to lead just recently. As I've said though, I've just started doing this and will definitely continue.

t3_24yk2c,"I'm on the pill and my periods have suddenly gone totally off the rails. Advice/Insights appreciated, ladies (also posted on r/birthcontrol)","Sorry this post is so long...!

I started taking Loestrin 24 FE in September of 2013. The first five months or so were perfectly normal (typical light spotting issues the first month or two as are common when starting the pill, so I consider that to be ""normal""). I still got periods, but they were significantly lighter than what I'd had before.

The fifth month is where things started to get weird. I normally take my pills at night before bed, but forgot to one night, so I took it first thing in the morning -- about 12 hours later. According to my pill, that's perfectly fine. Two weeks later, spotting, and I was 5 days away from the 4 placebo pills. Period came as normal.

Then, the next month, I spotted very very lightly in the first half of the pack... followed by no period at all during the placebos. Again, fell asleep before taking my pill just one time, but took it first thing the next morning, well within 12 hours.

After no period at all during the placebos, I started the next pack. 6 days into the new pack, I started cramping/bleeding... was light at first, then much like a regular period... and it lasted nearly a week. I've also been kind of queasy some mornings. Nothing that keeps me from eating, but sometimes I'm not as hungry as I used to be when I wake up.

My boyfriend (he's clean) and I just use the pill as BC. I've taken 2 pregnancy tests after not bleeding on the placebos -- both came back negative.

I've been a bit more stressed than usual the past 6 weeks, and I've changed my diet/exercise regime slightly the past few months. But I'm just a little paranoid that something could be up. Obviously concerned about the possibility of pregnancy even though the tests came up negative (the internet has lots of scary stories about this happening). I went to the doctor, told her all this, and her conclusion was to up my dosage starting on the next pack.

Any thoughts or similar experiences would be super reassuring to hear.

t3_24zaqd,"Possible allergy to long-term Paragard? Thoughts please.","Hi everyone. I've had a paragard for 3 years. I wonder if this is related or not. My question is as follows:

I keep getting infections. For the past 4 months, every month before my period I get a yeast infection or BV. Usually they go away when my period starts, but not this time. I'm actually itching *inside* (Also outside). It burns when I pee & I itch continuously.  

I also have begun to spot before & after my periods. Last month my period was 2 weeks late (it came the day after my husband came home from the oilfield, haha whoops), which I chalked up to stress. It started right after we DTD.  I had a really light (for me) period, but it lasted *12 days* (So no more fun times & then he had to leave again!). I use a Diva Cup & that's practically unheard of for me (I usually can't leave the house the first two days). 

A year ago when I got my pap the iud had migrated to the side (not sure why). The strings are so short I have never been able to reach them. When I went to the dr they brushed off my concerns & said it was just the iud adjusting. Since it is non- hormonal & it's been 3 years, shouldn't my body have adjusted by now? 

I am also very allergic to nickel (I break out & get a weeping itchy rash from copper plated nickel, silver plated nickel, etc). I know that the paragard has a nickel core (just a tiny amount). Could I have developed an allergy to my iud? 

I am not averse to getting it out, it's just really expensive w/o insurance. 

Note: I am not eating processed sugary foods & am eating a ""keto"" diet (basically very low carb paleo).

**Tl;dr: period is wonky, constant infections, is it paragard or who knows what**

I never experienced any spotting nr disturbances with my period. Had it normally for two cycles, although lighter than it used to be when I didn't take the pills.

Luckily, my mother had a great job that opened up doors to promotions and as I went away to college, our small family was pretty financially stable.  

As a child, I saw the financial struggle my mother was in and would joke around by saying, ""Someday I'll marry a doctor and never have to worry about these things.""  My mother was less than pleased with that statement and continued to stress the importance of financial independence, education, and finding a good job.  

I recently graduated with my master's degree.  During that time, I starting dating my current boyfriend.  We have an awesome relationship and I could easily see us together for quite a long time.  We've lived together for a few years now and every expense has been divided 50/50.  

Well, after graduating comes job hunting and subsequent huge life decisions.  Both my boyfriend and I had been searching for jobs throughout the country.  Luckily, my boyfriend was offered an awesome job just outside of a big city that I love.  Because they wanted him to start his new job so quickly, we've been living apart for the past week or so.  I'll be heading down to our new apartment this weekend.  The distance hasn't been a big deal (although I absolutely hate having to pack everything up on my own) but as I sit here, surrounded by our boxed-up lives and cleaning supplies, I'm starting to panic.  

I haven't been financially dependent upon anyone since high school.  Except for the small amounts of help from my mother throughout my college days, I've done pretty much everything on my own.  Now, all of a sudden, I'm going to be dependent upon someone else for my finances... at least for a little while.  I've been searching and applying to jobs in our new city, but have gotten nowhere.  I have a pretty marketable degree, decent experience, and a lot of passion, but no job.  

I think the panic I feel is coming from the worry that, for some unknown reason, my boyfriend and I will break up and I will be left poor and alone.  I am also finding myself equating a paycheck with self worth and am feeling pretty down about the entire situation.  He proposed getting a joint bank account and has set up direct deposit from his job into that account, but I just don't feel right spending his money.

t3_2501ay,"Freaking out about a creep shot taken of me...and scared there could be possibly others","This may not be the best time to post after all the talk with TwoX becoming a new default sub, but I'm really having a moment. This weekend I spent the night over at the apartment of someone I'm currently sleeping with who I truly thought was a nice guy until this happened. Sunday morning as I got out of bed to put my clothes the flash went off on his phone as he tried to take a picture. I freaked out, told him to delete it, and asked if he had any others. He told me no but refused to show me his phone. I'm terrified that there could be other pictures in worse situations with even my face in it. It's all I can think about, and I'm terrified that he could leak them or show them to his friends or anything. 

I'm so unsure right now. I don't trust him enough to take his word and we're not in the sort of relationship that I would be okay with those kind of pictures being on his phone. What do I do? Thanks in advance.

**Edit:** I just read all of everybody's comments and I want to say thank you all SO MUCH. It's really helping me to see things I can do that I couldn't think of myself. I've told one of my closest friends what happened and we came up with a plan. I've texted him and asked him to meet me for coffee somewhere and I'm going to do what /u/VGwritesalot has written. I made sure it's legal so I'm ready to go. I just want to make sure I have something I can use if I ever find any pictures of me online or anywhere else.

I talked with my SO this evening. We ended up having an hour long conversation where I told him honestly that I didn't think I could be a parent today-some day in the future (with him hopefully) but now I was not equipped. I asked him for his feelings and he said he felt like I was rejecting a piece of him and abandoning a child-our child. (Which honestly made me feel very guilty. Not guilty enough to justify bringing a child into the world though.)



I told him I felt differently but that his feelings were valid. But I decided to get the abortion because I'm just not ready to be a mother now. I hope to be someday, and I don't want to have a child before I can devote myself entirely to it. He said he sort of understood but still felt as though we were abandoning a child. I apologized to him. 



I asked him again if he could go with me to the clinic because (I know it's selfish) I really want someone I know well with me. He said he'd think about it and get back to me. I made an appointment for next week. 



So I'm not sure where our relationship will go from here. He still hates the idea of abortion but I think he hates it a little less now. I'll have to see how he feels afterwards. 



I'm really glad I made the appointment though because the thought of being a mother scares me even more than him leaving, although that's a really hard choice to make. Thanks to everyone who wrote. I appreciate it. ",45,20140507200517,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_250lbe,"What it's like as a woman having thin hair [a rant].","I have thin hair. Not only thin, but fine and smooth. Let me define those terms.

Thin hair means I have not a lot of strands on my head. 

Fine hair means the individual strand width is not big around.

Smooth means each strand has little friction against the others.

I have my hair highlighted blonde because bleach damages the hair strands and makes them a little frizzy. This helps with body.

I never use conditioner.

So I have little hair which is small and lays like silk against my small melon (head). Not only that, the back of my head is pretty flat, so if I don't poof it out at the back I look sort of like a half melon stood on end. 

In addition, I have a wide neck. So if I cut my hair into a pixie cut I just look out of proportion. Like Zippy the Pinhead if you're familiar with that comic. The best look for me is a turtleneck (which have, unfortunately, fallen out of fashion somewhat) and during summers I am SOL. I wear v-neck shirts exclusively which helps, somewhat.

All of this means if I want to leave the house each morning looking halfway decent, I HAVE to wash and blow dry my hair. Every day. If I shower at night and want to 'get up and go' the next day it requires a hat. 

I am constantly asked why I keep my hair short. It's because I cannot grow it long. First of all, it stops growing when it gets to my shoulders and second, it gets stringy at the bottom long before that point. I would grow it out and put it into a ponytail but that exacerbates the smallness of my melon and the ponytail is only about half an inch thick. The Asian women at my work exclaim over how small it is. I have yet to come up with a witty comeback.

Google ""fine thin hair"" and you'll find photos of various celebrities **including Jennifer Anniston**. Are you fucking kidding me? She's GREEK. You'll also find a lot of photos of people with huge heads and thin necks which can make short hair look pretty good.

Everyone thinks they can give me advice despite the fact that I've been living with this hair for over 40 years. ""Oh, you should try this"" or ""My friend did that"", all of which assumes I don't know or understand how my hair grows and what looks best on me.  They all ""know"" what will look better despite never having worked with my hair, head, neck or face. 

When I had extensions they were so very pretty. People smiled at me, held doors for me, hit on me. I was dating at the time and I posted a pic online and within a day or two had over 200 responses. Before I had the extensions I had maybe 15 over a week. 

Guys who can't grow beards know my pain, to an extent. They understand what it's like to want something that others have but they cannot have. But... imagine if 99% of actors had beards. If every guy on a magazine cover had a beautiful beard. Imagine if it was universally accepted that beards were attractive and no beard was what older or less-attractive guys had. Imagine if every woman they met was taken with beards and most guys could grow beards and beards were the absolute norm. Yeah.

I do the best I can. /rant

Lately she's been having a rough time with school, friends and boys. There's also been conflict with her parents. I think some of the issues she's encountering are normal for someone her age but there are some other factors at play. She was adopted and has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

She has admitted to ""doing stuff"" with her last boyfriend but says they stopped short of having sex. Now she has a new boyfriend and recently told me (and her mom) that she doesn't understand the big deal about sex and doesn't see many reasons to wait until she's older.

She and I get along well and I feel she values my POV more than that of her parents because she sees me as more relatable (I'm in my mid twenties). She thinks her parents want her to save sex for marriage because they are religious so she discounts anything they tell her. I've tried talking to her about the consequences of having sex but I don't think any of what we discussed will deter her. We talked about pregnancy but she thinks the biggest negative would be getting kicked out of her house (I don't know how realistic that is). I tried talking to her about the emotional impact (what if they have sex and he decides he doesn't want to see her anymore? Could she handle that?). I don't think she has much foresight and I don't know how well she understands the consequences of her actions. 

She's been bullied at school and is very hurt that other girls call her ""slut"" behind her back. We talked about how unfair this double standard is (no one says anything negative about the male party) but it doesn't make this any easier for her to deal with. I'm really worried about the possible implications of her having sex (especially her getting hurt and the bullying getting worse). She doesn't have good coping skills as is and I'd hate to see her go through worse. I'm totally at a loss for what else to say to her from a sex-positive point of view (or am I not being sex-positive by thinking she's too young to have sex?). I welcome any ideas/suggestions.

I've just received a huge promotion and will be the assistant manager in a store with over 60 associates. I will be in charge of teaching, leading, correcting, and assisting these associates. I've been in positions of leadership before, but not to this level.

I was originally confident that I would succeed, but my training has shaken that confidence.  I am young, and look younger than I am.  Many of the associates I will be in charge of have worked in that building longer than I've been alive, and have a reputation for challenging fresh meat.  Despite that, I felt ready.

However, all the people who have been training me have assumed I am not confident, saying things like if I don't toughen up, I will be ""chewed up and spit out"".  This was based not on my prior leadership skills, because they haven't witnessed those, but based on how I present myself in my interactions. I'm shy, soft spoken, and very quiet until I feel comfortable. The people I've worked with for years have no doubt in my knowledge and skill, but there is a discrepancy in how I am read by those I don't know well.

My question is: what are some tips to exude the confidence I had without coming off as a know it all? What are some tips for addressing or correcting people old enough to be my grandparents, who know as much as I do about our industry? How can I not appear afraid, but not seem naive to the challenges I will face?

1. Is there anybody here, at all, who thinks that becoming a default is a good idea or supports it? I have seen nothing but comments saying that this is a terrible thing and that we are doomed. (I know the reasoning, I know that there are plenty of people out there who will not add anything relevant to the dialogue, but I think this can be a good thing as well)


2. I know that many men are already posting ""Oh but not all men are like that!"" comments, and it seems like people are already getting fed up with it. I am not sure why people are annoyed by this. It seems to me that you should be happy to clarify your view with someone if they are legitimately interested. Not be upset with them for trying to share their point of view with you. So can you please explain why this influx of new visitors who care about these discussions is a bad thing?


3. This is not actually related to our new status, but a question in general. And more of a curious ""how this place works"" than anything else. This will sound like I am trying to be a jerk, but I swear I'm not. At one point I saw a post on here about someone that had just accomplished something great. (I THINK it was graduating college, but I can not quite recall what it was. ) It was a great accomplishment, but it had nothing to do with being a woman (as far as I can tell). It was simply ""I achieved this great thing, just so you know"". I asked how this post was relevant in the guidelines ""4. Relevance: Please submit content that is relevant to our experiences as women, for women, or about women"". I did not get any explanations, just a ton of downvotes.

I've been a member of 2X for awhile, but I'm a little bit embarrassed so I've made a throwaway account. Just a little context: my long-term boyfriend is honestly so amazing, attentive, helpful, and caring, he means so much to me. I've been upset with other areas of my life which doesn't help, but for the last few months I've been having nightmares of him dying of various diseases/disasters. I'm now constantly worried when I'm awake that something bad is going to happen to him. Being upset with other areas of my life, hes been a huge support, but I feel like me being constantly upset, I've been a burden to him. He's assured me that I'm not a burden, but I can't help but feel that I am. This feeling of being a burden has made me start looking into everything he's doing as a sign that he is getting bored, or can't handle me anymore and is going to leave. 

Its hard because I find myself relying on him more than I ever did, which doesn't help, because it makes me that more afraid of losing him. In the end I'm causing more damage than good by worrying. 

I'm wondering if any 2Xers have gone through a similar experience and if you know how to get yourself out of this rut? I feel like I'm going in this bad circle, and I just don't know how to pull myself out of this way of thinking.

I tried getting my phone to work but it died so I took his phone, he then started telling me to put ""the numbers in a computer"" I just ignored him since he wasn't being very clear and I kept telling him I was doing that. He then got furious and started yelling for me to look at him and since I didn't he grabbed on to my wrists and wouldn't let go. I got really scared specially since he had never done anything like that to me ever . I started screaming and yelling for him to let me go and I got one hand loose so I smacked him and he then slapped me back so hard. Then I started crying and I didn't know what to do so I called his mother and told her I was taking him then he tried to grab me again and the phone fell so I ran out the car and when he tried to follow me he fell and he calmed down. I then grabbed the phone and told his mother he hurt me but that he was calm so I'd start driving. On the drive back he kept yanking the seat belt and he tried to put it around my neck but when I yelled he moved back. He then started saying really weird things like how did I hurt you if you don't have feelings and ""is it OK if I rape you"". At that point I was close to his home so I felt like I was in a trance so I got off and helped him to his door. His mother answered the door and asked what happened but I couldn't even talk and the whole time my parents had been calling me so called back and they said they were on their way. His mother offered me a ride but I told her no since I didn't want to be near them. She then took him inside and he kept ranting about how he was afraid of me and how he didn't trust me and when I went near him and he yelled not to touch him, everything exactly how I had told him on the road moments prior. So she asked what I had done and I just walked out in time to see my sister in the front door. I ran to her and she hugged me and asked me what was wrong I told her my so had hit me and she them tried to run inside but so's mother wouldn't let her and she told my sister I had no idea what I was saying and she told us to go home. My father tried to talk to her but she said we had to hear his side of the story. So I went home with my family. My family was furious because they had trusted him and they were mad at his mother for her behavior towards me. The next afternoon he texts me that he's sorry but doesn't remember a thing and that his mother asked what I had done to him so I explained to him the same story and he felt bad and said he wanted to talk to my parents. I told him to clear things up with his parents because I thought it was unfair that they put the blame on me. He waited until the next day and he came over after that. Now I was raised to believe that men don't hit women and I always told myself I'd leave whoever laid hands on me. So he apologized and asked why I had let him drink so much and he said it wasn't him that he'd never do anything like that but I couldn't even bear sitting next to him because I was so scared and I felt like he didn't understand how terrified I had been that Saturday night so I told him to leave. Before he left my mother asked him to talk to her so they sat down and she (surprisingly calm) told him she was disappointed in him and that his mother owed me an apology earlier  he said his mother wasn't mean to me but my sister explained to him what happened and he said we were right. And this is where I'm not sure I did the right thing or not because even though he seemed sincere I told him I didn't want to be with him. My mother told him to try to get me back and now I'm sitting here in my bed not knowing what to do and I'm too embarrassed to ask for advice from anyone. sorry for the rant and thanks for reading .

t3_250zjw,"My husband is a sexist asshole who harasses all the women that work for him.","I usually browse more than post, but I'm going to use a throw away anyway to avoid being identified.

My husband and I have been married for a year. We're both pretty young - I'm 21 and he's 22. I'm in graduate school and he graduated from undergrad last year.

He opened up a restaurant 6 months ago. For those of you that don't know, the restaurant business is pretty terrifying. Like 99% of new restaurants fail. But he's doing okay. Business was really good for the first month and has trailed off some, but it's held steady for a while and it's good enough to support us comfortably.

The issue is he's a sexist pig. He treats all the waitresses very poorly. He's very belittling and treats them like they're idiots. Just as an example, some time ago he started calling the waitresses ""his girls"" and himself the ""pimp master"". It's gotten to the point where he purchased a purple suit and cane that he wears when he's at the restaurant. 

He claims it's okay because they don't mind because he's paying them well (they make $15/hr + tips). But that makes it worse - most of them are college students (we're located about a 2 minute walk from a very very large university. Most of the people that live/go here are students and it's where all the good restaurants/bars are), so they're just willing to put up with being harassed because, like most college kids, they need the money.

I figured that after a little while customers would see his behavior, get mad, and he'd be forced to not be a douchebag and that'd be the end of it, but it hasn't happened. The customers don't give a shit. 

His behavior is also a bad example for the customers. The average customer is a drunk 20 year old (the restaurant is right by most of the bars - literally 50% of the people that come in are drunk. Peak hours are between 10pm and 3am on Friday and Saturday, as an example.) Seeing him be an asshole to the waitresses encourages the customers to do the same, making their job even harder.

He's also an asshole to all the female customers, but to a lesser extent.

In high school, I met my friend and ended up getting along really well with her family. 5 years later I can hang out and the mom is pretty comfortable with me.

So I have spent the month here, because my friend just had her baby and she wanted someone around to keep her company at home. 
While being here my friends mother was talking about wanting to end her Marrige because she is very unhappy in it. He is emotionally abusive, extremely controlling and,  mooches off of her with no job an does basically nothing around the house outside of telling everyone else what to do and the ""right way"" of doing it. 
The problem is, she is afraid to do it. In the past he had a drinking problem and ended up beating her up pretty bad. He quit drinking and they ended up getting back together. She is stil afraid of him and during some arguments he kind of threatened her, IMO. For example she brought it up in an argument and he said ""that was mostly my fault and partly yours. I was mad and was drinking and you kept giving me mean looks like the one you are giving me now. You only bring this shit up when there are other people in the house, like you are trying to provoke me into hitting you. I only did that cause I had alcohol, I won't hit you. If I had alcohol it might be another story..."" and so on.

She really doesn't want to involve police or anything like that. She is stuck trying to think of a peaceful reason to end things. Recently a pretty shocking thing in his past came up which is pushing her at the edge. Whenever she brings it up he immediately dismisses it. 

TL:DR Friends mom wants to end Marrige, though due to past abuse she is afraid.

She is in a committed relationship with my best friend, and I have no intention of ever wanting to get with her, but I do want some advice on what to tell her.

So basically she is a fairly popular, musical theatre, Starbucks kind of girl, and insanely pretty, even though she doubts me when I tell her that. But anyways, she has some pretty bad.. Habits? For lack of a better word. She is bulimic, and anorexic, but some how maintains a healthy, sexy weight. But she also cuts and burns her wrists, legs, and breasts. I'm the only one that she has ever told, and I try to relate with her as best as I can, and spend as much time talking to her and hugging her through it, so she's never tempted to purge or self harm. However, I'm really running out of things to tell her. It doesn't seem like she's going to stop anytime soon, and I try to tell her that she's strong and to just fight it, but it's impossible for her it seems. I tell her that she's beautiful everyday, and that she has no reason to do this to herself, but she always tells me she just can't stop, and she's scared of gaining weight so she purges. And then to keep her mind off of how hungry she is, she burns and cuts her skin until the pain is unbearable and she has no choice but to think about how much her arms and legs hurt. She hates it when I tell her to stop, because it's not something new to her, she knows she should stop, but simply cannot.

To top it all off, she recently told my best friend ( her boyfriend ) what she does to herself, and why. He told her how disgusted he was with her, and that their entire relationship is now a disappointment to him, and that if he didn't love her so much, he would leave her. That sent her spiraling out of control, and I find myself now talking to her all night until 5am, or having someone knock on my door at midnight to stay the night, and all she does is cry her self to sleep in my arms. I feel like I've told her everything I can, and I've even googled some things that I find fitting to tell her, and this sub reddit seems like a perfect place to get some new POVs and things to reassure her with.

I love her to death, and it almost brings me to tears to see my friend of 15 years debilitating before my eyes. So I need someone to help me, just anyone who has an opinion, I would greatly appreciate.

**Original Post**

I really think this rule could help matters in keeping this subreddit from turning into a total shitshow in light of this change.

Sexism affects women on a personal basis. We all know this. But having uninformed new subscribers arguing hypotheticals with the intent to derail, claiming ""not all men are like that"", rambling about the man's potential/theoretical intent for the female OP's experiences that they themselves were not present for, ""why are you getting so riled up about this"", ""where are your facts""... (edit 4) **in personal experience posts in particular, not in news articles or opinion pieces, are damaging to this community and unnecessary.** I don't want to force all men to shut up forever by any means, I just want them to step back, breathe, think about whether or not their comment is necessary, whether the OP probably already knows whatever devil's advocacy point you are trying to make, if it will be constructive at all, and maybe x out of the page if it isn't. (/edit 4)

These dismissive comments of women's experiences are all inevitable, and it feels like several huge steps back for our pre-default community. 

If being default is permanent no matter what, no matter how frustrated the community is with the decision, which it seems to be, we need to mitigate the people who come in here totally uninformed for the sanity of the women who post here if we actually expect to keep any women around.

This rule could help in terms of how many women are jumping ship upon the sub going default.

Thoughts? Help with rephrasing? Agree / disagree? Why? Let's have a discussion - it seems more productive than me rambling to myself in the shower about how annoyed I am.

---

Edit: The operative words here are 'for the sake of it'. I have never taken issue with men participating in 2XC, but I do take issue with men potentially flying into personal issue/experience posts with those sorts of comments when they do not add much to the discussion at hand.

A lot of posts on this subreddit are not about news discussions, but personal issues or experiences faced by women. Playing devil's advocate for funsies in **those** threads is what I am most bothered by.

---

Edit 3: /u/AsteroPolyp made this suggestion that I think is very astute and much better phrased than my initial post.

>I ABSOLUTELY AGREE!! But say ""newcomers"" instead of ""men.""

>Some subreddits put big red boxes above the ""leave a comment"" box telling you about the subreddit rules. I think we need that. And the rule can really be as simple as you said: this isn't the place to be a smart ass and argue for the sake of it; this is a supportive place.

>Rule #1 says ""No assholery"" which I think was written specifically about the issue we're talking about. But it needs to be much more prominent now.

I honestly think that is a very good idea. However, right now we are in a stage where we need to throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks, and we need to protect the basis of this subreddit's existence - women's perspectives.

My kneejerk reaction to this thread blowing up and my less than perfect phrasing was 'oh god, delete it', but I'm keeping it up. This discussion is important and I want to hear other suggestions - otherwise we can't figure this out and move forward.

I do not want to discourage men from contributing at all, but this subreddit, despite it being a default, is not geared towards men. It is for women's experiences, and many guys get too excited about getting into a debate before they think about the emotional impact their 'devil's advocate' posts might cause the OP on, say, an abortion thread, a rape thread, a sexual harassment thread, a period thread... **where the woman is asking for advice, support or help.** I am not trying to hamper discussion over topics where both men and women could have a say, like news articles, opinion pieces, etc. I see where it sounded like that, but that was not my intent.

There are times and places for discussion between men and women, but I do not want women to lose their platform in our own subreddit just because we have become a default.

Edit 5: I get the feeling that if I try to clarify or delete the (admittedly) badly worded first part of my post, I will be accused of backpedalling. No idea why, guess I must be psychic. Regardless, I admit that my phrasing is dismissive of men as a gender and that that detracts from what I want to accomplish, and what 2XC intrinsically stands for. 

I wanted to spitball with you guys here, but I simply do not have the time or energy to reply to every single person. If you want to believe me to be sexist, that is absolutely your right to do so. At least the discussion is starting.",960,20140508131650,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I love this sub. It is a fantastic community and I really think it's one of the best ran sub that I subscribe to. That being said, I was at first really upset that we went to default. This community that I sincerely care about is being opened up to a massive audience, the heartfelt stories that I connect with are going to be met with pervy and misogynist comments! How could the mods do this?!?

But as I've thought about it, and from the content that's being submitted so far, I don't mind. Why shouldn't we be a default? Our experiences and our content is just as important as anything else that's on the front page, and if anything, I think we are doing more harm to our community if we all jump ship. As women, we shouldn't fear being heard. If we stop posting and commenting, all those who are out to do nothing but troll are getting exactly what they want. The mods have heard up their end of the deal, banning and deleting comments that don't follow our rules in the sidebar. And from the backlash posts I've seen, it just shows how much the users care about this sub. So it's going to take some diligence on all of our parts, report users who are here for the wrong reasons, and KEEP POSTING AND KEEP USING THOSE ARROWS!

t3_2529um,"My ex thought I was repulsive and I don't know how to get past it.","Throwaway because ex checks out Reddit.

Two years ago, I met a man online and we hit it off instantly.  He was in the process of relocating to my city, so the first couple of months were long-distance.  Soon we were talking on the phone at least an hour a day.  We had so much in common we both found it remarkable--similar temperaments and past experiences, same sense of humor, so many common interests it was scary.  Conversation was effortless.  He is very emotionally literate and it was amazing to talk with someone not only about our backgrounds and interests, but also about our thoughts and feelings.  After about a month he used the ""L"" word, which maybe seems crazy, and maybe it was.  But I felt the same way.  After several unsatisfying relationships with guys who weren't really compatible in retrospect, I'm not gonna lie--I had serious thoughts about a future with this person.  He told me he felt the same way.

After a few months, he had relocated and we made plans to meet.  We were both really excited.  We had exchanged pics; all seemed well.  But the day I met him turned out to be one of the worst, most humiliating days of my life.  We'd made plans to meet at his place.  When he opened the door, his face fell.  He was visibly not attracted to me.  But I was so caught up in all the feelings of recent months that I couldn't register his lack of attraction.  It just didn't compute that our romantic relationship, such as it was, was now over.  I went to kiss him; he kissed back, but without feeling.  We talked a little, and, god help me, we ended up in bed.  I wish more than anything that he had stopped me in my delusion and shut it down.  But there I was, undressing in front of this man I (thought I) loved, seeing but not processing that he didn't like what he saw, and losing what little scraps of dignity I had left.  

This craziness went on for the whole evening and into the next day.  We had sex several times (pity fucks, in retrospect); our conversations became increasingly interspersed with him snapping at me and literally cringing and moving away when I tried to touch him.  Eventually--it's so fucking humiliating that it took me this long--I asked him what was going on and he said, ""I'm just not attracted to you.""  I stood up, went to the bathroom and threw up, packed my bag, and left.  He called and sent emails asking to still be friends; I said no.  And that was it.  All I wanted was to crawl into a hole and die.

I'm the stereotype of the chubby girl with a pretty face.  I honestly thought this was clear in my pictures, which were current and accurate, but I only sent shots from the waist up, which obviously was the worst kind of mistake.  Apparently the whole of me, in the flesh, was not a package he liked in any way.  (To be fair, he sent similar shots, from years ago, so he was older and bigger in person.  I didn't care.)  We didn't Skype, I should have sent more pictures, I was an idiot, I've obviously learned my lesson.  It's so painful to think he was so disappointed and even that he perhaps even felt I misled him, which I didn't mean to at all.  Even now, it makes me nauseous to think about it.

I've had my share of failed dates and relationships but Jesus, I've never gotten the sense I was literally repulsive--I'm well-groomed, look after myself, dress well for my body type, etc.  Maybe you're thinking there's some gross thing about me I'm not telling you, but I truly don't think there is (and it's not like I haven't spent agonizing hours thinking about it).  Since this happened I've gone back to the gym and gotten into lifting weights in particular; I like that it makes me feel strong, I'm more toned, and I feel more confident in my day-to-day life.  But I just cannot get over what happened two years ago.  I feel so profoundly humiliated, as a woman and as a person.  He took one look at me and it was over for him.  I was so pathetically love-blind I couldn't see what was happening right in front of me.  I went to bed with him.  I took my clothes off, and can't bear to think now of what must have been going through his mind as he looked at me.  I became so repellent to him that he winced at my touch.  And then it was over.

My question is, how can I get over this?  I haven't been with anyone since then.  My romantic self-confidence, shaky as it was, is now shattered.  This has really broken me.  I thought a good man loved me, and then he saw me, and I was repulsive, and that was it.  I'm okay in my day-to-day life, but I still lie in bed some nights, and the pain is so electric I cover my face and cry.  Goddammit I'm crying now.  

I don't know what it will take to move past this, but I'd appreciate your thoughts.  Please don't be an asshole.  Unless you're blind you can see this is excruciating enough for me as it is.  Thanks.

t3_251p4a,"How to normalize women on reddit; or why this subreddit becoming a default is a good thing.","Hey, ladies and many-more-gents-than-previously.

Maybe this is redundant to make this post, but the other major default discussion thread here contains mostly anxious comments. So I thought I'd put up an alternative point of view.

A lot of the complaints going around are that this subreddit was a safe haven prior to it becoming a more ""publicly accessible"" default. It was a place for women (and men) to speak candidly about certain aspects of their lives. Now, the fear is that this outlet and culture is either bastardized or gone. Potentially vulnerable or sensitive discourse will be open to a wider, more unfamiliar audience than intended.

Well, perhaps the change is a necessary sacrifice. 

reddit has been [called ""anti women"" before](http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2012/07/why-reddit-so-anti-women-epic-reddit-thread-counts-ways/55080/). I think there's some truth to that. With the addition of /r/twoxchromosomes to the defaults, obviously the admins wanted to change the general perception of the site. They want to say that reddit welcomes women. Prior to this, there were no predominately female driven defaults. /r/aww perhaps came the closest, and even that was around a 50/50 distribution, if that.

So. My opinion is that /r/twoxchromosomes *should* change its focus in order to make reddit more open and tolerant, and just plain *more interesting*. Here's why:

- It can now can act as a broad net, catching a large amount of users interested in or curious about women's issues, and then direct them to smaller subreddits if they eventually feel something is lacking here. 

- Female oriented topics will more frequently appear alongside ""general posts."" Eventually, I hope they're normalized here. More men can contribute to the conversation, or just learn to ignore it rather than having a negative reaction from seeing it. Maybe they'll have their views changed through simple exposure.

- When you're showing your friends reddit, you can point Two X as a default directed at women. That wasn't possible before. Then tell them to check out the list of related subreddits, because there *are* many more. 

Of course there are going to be people who fuck with the subreddit. But the mods can handle it. If trolls prove too overwhelming, Two X can always leave the default status.

Really, the point of this post is not what's lost, but what reddit is gaining. In order to change how reddit works, things have to change. I don't know if what I've said above will happen or not, but either way, maybe this will settle once and for all whether or not reddit (*as a whole*) can be open to both genders.

It's worth a shot.

t3_251iny,"Boyfriend broke my trust in him, how should we salvage our relationship? (we have too many mutual friends for me to speak openly about this)","The other day I decided to download Snapchat. I had it on an old phone, but the only people ever talked to was my best friend and my boyfriend (whom I'll refer to as ""A"") . I was getting reacquainted with it when I noticed Snapchat has a feature I didn't remember: it shows a user's 'score' and the top few people they talk to. And I didn't recognize any of the three people A was apparently interacting with often. I had a feeling one of them was his cousin (spoiler, it wasnt) so I decided to Google them. 

One had a twitter account under the same name. She lived far away, was a few years younger than us, and one of those cute little petite brunettes that always make me feel insecure. Worse than that, though, was the fact that she had uploaded a screenshot of MY BOYFRIENDS FACE from Snapchat to her Twitter and it had the hashtag of ""man crush monday"". 

My first reaction was, naturally, OH HELL NO. 

I want to murder her, but to be honest she probably has no idea he has a gf. So I closed out her Twitter and popped open a bottle of wine (Line 39 Petite Sirah, if you're curious). 

After I calmed down, I texted the boyfriend. He immediately acknowledged he was in the wrong, shouldn't have done it, he kept saying ""I don't know what I was thinking"", and that I deserve better, especially with what happened between my ex-fiancé and I (long story short, he was constantly emotionally abusive, tried to cheat on me (but was kind of a stereotypical neckbeard so he never got out of his self-imposed friendzones) and basically tried to change me from who I am to some meek little girl who did his bidding. I think the worst part about this was that A knew all this, and still chatted with other girls without telling me. 

He crossed a boundary, one that we've discussed I am not okay with him crossing. So it isn't like it would've been a surprise that I'd be upset if I found out about it. He probably thought he could essentially stay anonymous and anyone he was talking to out of his real life. 

Now, there are two reasons why I'm not going to break up with him. 1) he has always been a little naive when it comes to relationships. He only has had two girlfriends and lost his virginity at 20, when most people I know lost it under 18. His first gf was a normal relationship, they just realized it wasn't working out after a couple of years and parted ways fairly amicably. The second was a ridiculously hot girl who has guys throwing themselves at her left and right. She essentially used A for half a year to drive her around, pay for her pot, and then ignored him for an entire winter, before coming back into his life for another couple of months before A realized what was going on. He has been picky about dating ever since, and somehow we never crossed paths until a year and a half ago, despite having quite a few really good mutual friends. We clicked instantly, and it's safe to say that he is pretty much me with a penis. 

That's actually why I can understand WHY he'd want to talk to other girls. I'm not gonna lie, I like attention. I dress really well, and I'm the type to get free drinks from bartenders. I don't think I'm beautiful, but I think I have a friendly disposition and a nice smile that makes people like me. I even did that stupid /r/rateme once because I was curious what other people would say about me (mixed reviews, and a lot of creepy pm's. Learned my lesson -  I don't need THAT kind of validation). The difference is my boyfriend is fully aware of these things. They aren't surprises. When a bartender bet a free drink that I couldn't do a cartwheel, I told my boyfriend what I was doing. The same with the rateme subreddit. It isn't that I wanted permission and I don't necessarily want to give him permission, but I want his honesty. 

And I consider lies of omission as dishonesty. I probably would be a little uncomfortable if I knew he was talking to other girls, but I think him making it clear he has a gf would have been all I needed if he had told me he wanted to connect with other people across the United States. I honestly think it didn't occur to him what he was really doing, and that it mattered. Or fell under the boundaries I previously set. 

2) He absolutely started bawling when he thought I was going to break up with him. He isn't the type to show or speak about his feelings really. He likes to touch me a lot, just nonsexually, a caress here, a little squeeze there. He says stuff like ""I love you"" and has expressed that he sees a future with me, and would like to get married and have children with me, but nothing poetic, emotional, etc. We've actually been working on that aspect of our relationship, to decent results. But I digress; so he burst into tears. He didn't try to gaslight me or act like he didn't do anything wrong, like other people do. I must admit it was pretty satisfying watching a 6'2"" semi-athletic manly man type break down and throw himself and his future at my mercy. 

My parameters are that he can never, ever do this before. He knows I've stuck to my guns in past relationships regarding  that concept. I also told him he'd have to really work at his communication, and we'd have to repair our bond quite a bit because of how overwhelmingly disappointing this infidelity was. I also warned him that it would likely be a while before we had sex again, because frankly once I've developed an emotional bond to a sexual partner, I can't remove that emotion from sex. And of course I'm still in love with him, and hurting too, so having sex with him is going to cut me up, no matter how good it is. I also said I was going to look into ways to rebuild our relationship (I'm pretty big into psychology, though I know it isn't a perfect science) and that if I found something that I thought might help, I'd want to try it. No idea what I even really mean by that, to be honest. 

So yeah. That was a terrible day. My relationship, once so very great, hit one hell of  speed bump. It can't be swept under the rug, but I'm not going to let it be the elephant in the room nobody talks about. He is more than willing to take the time and effort to help me heal. He accepts that it'll take time to heal. 

Mostly I just had to get this off my chest, and I was wondering how other relationships survive inappropriate flirting, cheating, and/or infidelity. I don't accept the excuse ""boys will be boys"", and I don't accept stupid ""biotruths"" that men are going to always want other women. I'm not saying that can't look, I certainly do, but I believe in communication and honesty, and consider this a breach of those. Considering that this sub is now a default, I'm aware this will likely get down votes, but I'm hoping that the normal audience of TwoX will see this and comment as well. I really just want support and advice on how to get through this. I absolutely do not think this is something I should break up with him, unless he does it again. 

**Edit: oooo that downvote brigade is ROUGH**",90,20140508090833,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_251wcp,"Why do you think there are so few women on reddit?","Clearly from the amount of down votes this subreddit has seen in the last few hours, there are a lot more men on reddit than women. Or people who disagree with these views of women anyway. Most comments in default subreddits also appear to be from men. Could it be that the default subreddits are catered more towards men's interests? Or because women are more hesitant to make themselves known or express their views? Or is it that women don't see such forums like reddit as attractive and would prefer to browse websites that cater towards their specific interests? 

I can see why the mods and admins would make this sub a default. Maybe they're trying to make the readership of reddit equal in terms of gender and increase visiter numbers. Maybe they just wanted to stir up some controversy. However, I do think they could have picked a better subreddit to represent women or even create a new one. I used to lurk on this subreddit to see what the women of reddit were up to, to read articles where women were having their rights abused (i.e. Feminist articles) and read a comment section that was interesting and, where there were disagreements, people were respectful of others opinions and not aggressive and rude in their rebuttals. Also the illogical 'lock to open many keys' and 'what about the men's experience in this situation' and 'victim blaming' arguments were absent. Also it was great to read about periods and feminine hygiene, knowing you wouldn't be ridiculed. 

Many women would post personal problems on here, some that were related to their gender, others not relating to their gender at all. Most responses tried to be helpful and were sensitive to the poster's feelings. I personally would not post such a problem on this subreddit anymore. The readership went from 8000 to 170,000. The chances of someone identifying me and insulting me have now increased enormously. Anonymity of opinion was one of great pulls of this subreddit.  

The new default status of this subreddit brings up some interesting issues about the gender divide of reddit, so maybe it is positive in that regard. Thoughts anyone? ",79,20140508113152,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_251xe9,"Husband and I have been arguing a lot lately. I scheduled an appointment to see a counselor. I don't think he approves.","Ever since I have become pregnant (I am 20 weeks), husband and I have been arguing a lot more than usual.  Right now we are both under a lot of stress due to him leaving a high paying job he hated to one that pays half of that.  We are kind of struggling financially but we are doing our best, along with the unplanned pregnancy things have been really stressful.  

I believe our arguments stem from lack of communication.  When I ask him to do something sometimes it will come off as me having an attitude and he no longer wants any part in our discussions and will shut down.  This morning things got out of hand and things were thrown.  Not at each other...it started with me throwing a little food I was cutting, walking away, to him just going completely biserk and throwing food too.  I had never seen him that angry before.  He was yelling that he was tired of my shit.  I didn't say anything back really because I was just shocked.  We spoke again and we both agreed that we are tired of the same argument happening over and over again.  He is tired of me saying sorry and never changing my attitude so me saying sorry again doesn't do anything for him.  I looked up counselors that covered our insurance and told him about it.  He told me he thinks it is overboard, that I just need to work on thinking before I get angry at him.  I told him that that has been the solution before and it has gotten us no where and our fights have worsened.  I do not want to see it get worse from this morning.  I love this man and when we are good we are wonderful.  When we argue it is arguing for 3 minutes tops and then we go hours not speaking and I am sick of it.  I do not know what to do and I do not have ANYONE to talk to.  I already made an appointment and told him but he doesn't seem too thrilled.  I told him that I think it's good I will be able to talk to someone that will help.  He gave me no response.  Am I overreacting going to try to speak to counselor?  I literally do not know what else to do.  I have tried bettering my communication but obviously I am unable to do it on my own.

I was out of town when it happened so I only saw the aftermath - I didn't actually witness the fire or anything. They have the guy on a home security camera setting another fire and at least one witness who saw him in the vicinity of my burning car. He also lives less than a block away from me (though I don't remember seeing him around, I don't have much interaction with the neighbors).

I've read through the subpoena a bunch of times and it seems pretty straightforward - show up, get called, answer questions. But I get super duper nervous talking in front of more than like 5 people, and when I get nervous I start to ramble, and apparently you're not supposed to do that in court. And I guess the defense is allowed to ask me questions as well, which isn't what I expected.

Obviously it's been a rough week for me, and this whole witness thing is adding an edge of anxiety that's really hard to handle. I'm hoping someone can share their experience to take some of the fear out of this.

So, I have been living with my best friend for the last 6 years. Although (naturally) she gets on my nerves at times, I love living with her. We have a sweet apartment that we share with our cats (she has one, I have one) and life is overall very good. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for almost six years as well. He is at the point now where he wants us to move in together. He's been very patient with me up to this point, but this is it for him. And I completely understand that. 

I am ready to move in with him. I want to. I know our relationship needs to take this next step. 

My roommate and I have discussed earlier in the year that obviously at some point I am going to move in with him. She was actually the one (I'm pretty sure it was her) who brought it up. Just as a ""oh, well I've been trying to mentally prepare myself as I figure you two will end up moving in together at some point.""  I told her she's not wrong, and that it's probably going to be sooner rather than later, but that I would still give her ample notice and whatnot. 

So, what I need help with is, how can I ""give her my notice"" in the nicest, kindest, friendliest way possible?  Like, if your best friend that you've known for 15 years was to tell you that she is no longer going to be your roommate, how would you want to be told? What scenario or setting is best? What exactly should I say? I know this isn't going to be totally out-of-the-blue for her, but it's still kind of news. 

I'm not sure why I'm so worried about this. She is a kind and rational person. And she has stated that she will likely stay in our apartment even after I move out, so I know she doesn't need to worry about finding another place to live. I just...I don't know why I'm so afraid of telling her. And I don't know how I can deliver the news in the best possible way. 

I realise that this seems like a way bigger deal in my head than to anyone reading this, but please help me.  How can I approach this topic with her in the best way? What do I say? Should I bring a bottle of her favourite wine or something when I do it? Do I try to make jokes to make it less awkward (for me)?  How would you want to be told?

She's 15, really pretty, really impressionable, a bit.. I don't know, I wouldn't say naive, but she's had some shitty boyfriends in the past and has some trust issues, so she tends to look straight past the bad in people and just get attached to them, if that makes any sense.

He's always calling her princess, comparing her to goddesses, and just generally being a bit of a try hard. If I'm understanding it right, they also started dating while he was also dating somebody else, which is when all this princess stuff started.

The way he talks to her is like something out of one of Shakespeare's plays, she gets all giddy and googly eyed whenever he's like that, and it just seems really odd.

The first time we heard anything about him was when he was calling her a goddess, saying that she was more than that, it just screamed player to us.

t3_251ovr,"Some perspective on the new default status of twoX","I've been on Reddit for over a year now and while I don't post much, I spend a lot of time on the website just learning new things related to my interests or seeing interesting things that people have experienced. As a woman, it is sometimes hard to love reddit because of the frequent misrepresentation of women and the misunderstandings that happen so often about women. 

I'm well aware that there are subreddits like /r/feminism but I was afraid of subscribing because I didn't know if the subreddit was full of women wanting to support feminism or if it was a bunch of man-haters looking to circlejerk in the opposite direction. I had no idea that twoX existed until it became a default and it looks like exactly what I need in terms of a female perspective subreddit. I also find that it is probably what the entire reddit community needs in terms of a default subreddit to represent what women have to say. 

While it's true that putting the community on public display means that you're going to have to deal with trolls and misconceptions on a regular basis it's also the case that people that are not women will now have the opportunity to hear what women have to say. It's also the case that women on reddit will discover that there are many other women out there that they can relate to and talk with. 

It's true that its hard to talk about being a woman with people that are not women. Every person has lived a very different life from everyone else and sometimes it's hard to feel as though there are people that are actually taking your perspective seriously. While these conversations are extremely hard to have and often frustrating they need to happen. People need to stop perpetuating false notions about women (or all genders for that matter). This subreddit can help to do just that. And when trolls come along, report them. It will be hard to not take what they say personally but don't take it personally. That's exactly what they want you to do. 

Anyway. tl;dr I think this should be a default because reddit needs more women voices. And it's going to be hard sometimes but we should put ourselves out there. ",0,20140508101709,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

We were discussing a few days ago what we think marriage should be.  He was baffled and disgusted by what I had to say.  He kept telling me it was so wrong and horrible.

Here's what I had to say:

""I don't believe in premarital sex (he knows this, we've agreed on it).  So sex would be primarily for procreation (that's how I've been raised, it's a cultural thing that I firmly believe in).  If my husband asked, I'd agree.  I want to be a good wife, part of that is meeting his sexual needs.  I'd lie down, spread my legs, and let him do what he will.  If I don't satisfy him, I'd offer an open relationship.  He should be able to fulfill his desires to any extent, as long as he doesn't hurt me or anyone else.  This is because I love him and want him to be happy.  Marriage is about give and take.  I'll give him my body, he'll give me happiness and companionship.  (I mean, men get married for free sex, right?  Let's not kid ourselves here).  I wouldn't care much for foreplay or any of that after marriage, it's not about me.  Men don't need that to enjoy themselves, why should I?  Other than sex, our relationship would be fun, loving, affectionate, intellectually stimulating, supportive, etc.""

He kept going on about how awful that worldview is and kept going on about love and intimacy and mutual pleasure.  I told him to cut the crap.  I know how much he wants sex, I know all of this is BS to cajole women.  He was very hurt.

Is what I believe so wrong and perverse?  Is it bad that I want my marriage to be this way?  I'd like the perspective of fellow women.  Thanks!

t3_251ff6,"Can we please give the mods the benefit of the doubt?","I know a lot of people are freaking out, but can we give the mods the benefit of the doubt?  I think they’ve earned it.  Their hard work and diligence was a large part of turning TwoX into what the regulars know and love.  It’s not like they all plan to go on vacation and throw the sub to the wolves.  They realize there will be extra work for them now that this is a default sub.  I’m sure if it proves too much, they will get TwoX removed from the default list.  

Sure, there will be some growing pains.  I’ve seen a lot of people worrying about RedPill users coming to troll, but it’s not like they didn’t already know about TwoX.  Ironically (or perhaps not since I don’t know what irony is anymore, damn you Alanis!), I only know of RedPill from hearing about it on TwoX.  Having multiple top posts in r/all asking how to remove TwoX from default is just going to encourage trolls.  Also, downvoting into oblivion will also encourage trolls.  There’s no perfect solution, I suggest keeping troll comments and posts to 0 votes and reporting to the mods.  They’ve always done a good job removing those.  When trolls aren’t fed, they move on.

And lastly, you don’t have to ask everyone about related subunits.  There’s been a list of them in the sidebar for as long as I remember.

t3_253r1w,"[UPDATE] For those of you that have had an abortion, which option did you choose (pill or procedure) and what was your experience like?","Obligatory apology for the length of the post.



So recently you may remember me asking you all for advice about which path to take with my abortion after finding out that I managed to fall pregnant to my boyfriend despite being on the pill.



A lot of you provided some excellent, sound advice and I would like to thank everyone of you that contributed to the making of my decision.



Now that it is all over and done with, I thought that I would share my own experience as a lot of people were asking for me to update them if I was feeling up to it.



I reside in Australia so this is most relevant to other Australian women but overall the experience should be relatively similar.


So, I had my mind changed from initially wanting to take the pill to having the procedure. I also took the relevant advice on board and had an IUD put in place at the same time which was very easy.



I had my initial visit with a nurse and doctor and during this visit they explained the procedure, the possible complications as well as got me to provide a urine sample to check for chlamydia and something else (came back negative) and a blood sample to see what my blood type was as they have to treat negative patients differently to positive. However, lucky me, ended up with the most common type O+.  I also had a quick ultrasound to confirm gestation, of which I was 8 weeks, was written a script to get my mirena, was given a small pill which I needed to take 3 hours prior to surgery in order to prepare my cervix and had my procedure booked for 0815 Thursday morning.



On my arrival Thursday morning they told me my test results, gave me another quick run down as to how everything was going to go, put a wrist band on me and then ushered me into a large bathroom stall so that I could get changed into a theater gown.  We're coming into some cooler weather here in the more southern parts of Australia where I am and it was lovely that they had left a gown draped over a heater for me to put on. Once I was changed I rang a bell to let the nurse know I was ready.  They gave me a stretcher to lie on which was also lovely and warm before inserting a IV drip and giving me a couple of pain medications. Once all the doctors were ready, I was wheeled into the theater room and had to scoot over onto a different bed where I put my legs in stirrups much like those that they get women in labor to put their legs in.  I said ""cya"" and ""thank you"" to everyone in the room and that was the last thing I remember.  The anesthetist was amazing and had me out in less than 2 seconds after that.



The next thing I remember, I was being stirred by nurses in recovery and they said that it was time I got up and went to the lounge area to recover a bit more.  They mad me a cup of tea and gave me a couple of biscuits which I consumed quickly while my boyfriend had his coffee and kept making fun of my state of drowsiness.



My perception of time here was very skewed now so anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes later one of the nurses gave me my clothes back so that I could get changed and I had a final consultation with a doctor before leaving the clinic.



All in all I had a fabulous experience.  If I had to go through with it again I definitely know what I would do.  I know it's not an easy choice to make at all, and while I knew what I had to do, it wasn't emotion-free and I felt a little conflicted at times and cried a little bit the night before.



I do not regret my decision and I am so glad that I had my boyfriend and his wonderful family who supported me 100% throughout the whole ordeal.  The nurse and doctor staff were beyond amazing and incredibly professional throughout the whole process.



Women need to feel far less ashamed of what they decide to do with their own bodies and I would like to thank everyone again for their advice because I couldn't be happier right now and it's great to be feeling somewhat normal again.  



I've barely bled (yet) but post-operative bleeding is just part of the whole process and I've had the odd short-lived but pretty bad cramp (nothing much worse than an average period cramp) but my experience was still much better than I could've ever expected and I wouldn't have changed my decision if I had to do it again.




**TL;DR** Had a fantastic experience with my termination, as far as you can, when having a termination and am very happy with my decision.



Edit: for anyone interested in the cost, for me, in Australia, the procedure was completely free. If I were to have opted for the medication it would've been $50, otherwise about $15 with concession.  My mirena was only $37 as well which is a small price to pay for 5 years worth of birth control.",87,20140508232352,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_253ak2,"I find myself not letting myself go outside, I find it hard to exist","I have developed a really really high level of anxiety for the idea of leaving my little studio apartment.

Every single time I step outside, I get either yelled at/catcalled or grabbed/groped or followed by cars with men hanging out of the window, etc. Or any combination thereof. 

Men will say terrible things. Disgusting things. Viscous things. Things I don't want to repeat.

I'm not exaggerating about this. No one seems to take this seriously if I mention it. I don't mention it much because the reactions from friends or family or SOs aren't nice. Sometimes they don't believe me. Sometimes they think I'm overplaying it for attention. Or that I'm like bragging in some weird way about the attention I get. They imply I secretly enjoy it. Or say I should find it flattering. Sometimes my SO says I'm exaggerating to make him jealous.

I don't live in a ""bad neighborhood"" where people expect this stuff to be happening. This happens everywhere. All types of people do it.

I'm sobbing as I write this. I just want someone to realize how fucked up it all is. I want someone to be on my side.

I've developed an aversion to touch. An aversion to people.

I have tried everything to get this stuff to stop. I dress very conservatively. I don't do anything but minimum makeup. I keep to myself. I don't make eye contact with people. All the stuff I can change. It's not like I'm incredibly attractive anyway.

I can't change my gender. Sometimes I catch myself hoping I could and I hate myself for it. 

The only solution I have of not getting harassed is to not go outside. 

It's affecting my entire life. It's ruining my life.

What's my fault for going outside? Why does this happen? Why am I faced with such malice just for existing in public?

Every time I think about going outside now, after years of this, I find myself with a huge amount of anxiety. It takes me hours just to get outside and then I'm nearly exploding as I'm making a beeline for wherever I have to get to.

I wear big headphones. I wear a hoodie. I wear sunglasses. I intentionally wear sunglasses that have mirrored lenses because I'm secretly hoping that when someone bothers me, they'll see their reflection in my sunglasses and be embarrassed about themselves.

I've talked to therapists about this and the responses I have gotten are not okay. One told me to ""just act crazy in public so then they'll leave you alone."" Another said ""look and dress uglier."" And another said ""don't put yourself in that situation."" These are their solutions to this issue. Two of these therapists were women themselves and the last one was a man.

Why do I have to change who I am in order to exist without getting harassed? I'm not even doing anything wrong. I try to live a good life.

If, on the flipside, someone complained of not getting enough attention from men, no one would ever say: ""act more normal, it's simple, change who you are"", ""look prettier and dress better, instead of what you want to look like"", ""put yourself in those situations, it's easy, just do it"".

I'm sorry for this incredibly long sob story. I just need any support. I don't know what to do. I'm not really looking for solutions or answers, I just needed to say this somewhere I wouldn't get judged. I hope you understand where I'm coming from.

So this is a comment I've seen a lot of today:

""Women's rights? Why can't they just be called gender equality rights? Things aren't always fair for men either!""

Instead of getting frustrated at these kinds of comments (which is my personal reaction, although I realize that not all TwoX users would react this way), or spending tons of time replying to them in an attempt to educate users on several decades (centuries? millennia?) of history, I was thinking we could provide some key links to educational websites/articles on the basics of women's rights and related topics so that users can educate themselves on their own. I think it would be useful to have good resources easily accessible for newcomers to this sub--they don't necessarily have to read them, but we can at least recommend them for the curious. 

I tried to Google for sites I knew I'd seen before, but nothing came up that seemed useful and I can't think of any off the top of my head. Any suggestions, folks? 

Apologies in advance if I've offended anyone--my intention isn't to call people out, but to provide streamlined access to basic information so this sub isn't flooded with the same comments/posts from newcomers. 

Also, I realize that any resources on this topic would ultimately be opinion-based, and that the range of answers/acceptable resources would vary even for regular users of the subreddit, but I still think that some basic links for people whose only question is, ""Why feminism tho?"" would be useful. 

Edit: [This article](http://bitchmagazine.org/article/everything-about-feminism-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask) about the basics of feminism is an example of what I mean.

- A public announcement of what the decision making process was for this change, and what the decision making process will be in evaluating whether to stay a default

t3_253jfr,"A lead on my team (not my manager) is trying to get me fired by any means necessary","
Hi guys. I think I need some help here, and you've always been incredibly level-headed and helpful when people come in, so I'm sending out my own S.O.S.

Like the title says, a lead on my team (that is not my manager, but is above me) has decided that he does not like me and is in the process of trying to get me booted. I work in the recruiting department of a large corporate office as an RC (I pretty much just set up interviews all day), and he has recently changed my entire process to something not conducive to being able to consistently keep up with my work because he doesn't think the corporate SLA (service level agreement, aka when I get things done by) is quick enough. These SLAs are followed by everyone within the company who does my job, and he's decided I need to change process to suit him and the team. By not doing it exactly how he likes, he has decided that I am wasting time with candidates and I am the reason (out of everyone on the entire team) that we are losing them (which, let me add, we haven't actively lost candidates unless they don't want to move or they just aren't interested), even though I AM WITHIN SLA AND DOING MY JOB. Everything that is wrong comes back to me being the culprit, and he's taken this ""data"" to my recruiting manager as evidence that I don't know how to do my job. Let me add that I've been with said company for almost a year and the other lead on my team fucking LOVES me (feeling is mutual, he's great). 

The lead that I'm having issues with is relatively new to the team and has decided I am dead weight, and told one of my coworkers that ""my time here is up."" He's done this to others in the past, so his capacity to bite down and not let go until he gets what he wants is not something I want to just ignore.

I spoke with my recruiting manager today and didn't go in with a list of things, I literally just verbally vommitted on him and started crying (I know, I know, dumb dumb dumb), I was just so flustered. Before going to him, I spoke to 2 other, very respected former RCs who both agree with where I'm coming from, and agree that he's being ridiculous. I had great info from them to present to my manager, and then I just lost it out of being so upset. The lead, unfortunately, spoke to my manager before I could and so my manager was slightly biased while talking to me (he was trying not to be, but you could tell he thought I was exaggerating/being paranoid). We have another meeting tomorrow to go over the ""data"" this lead has come up with, and whatever else comes up. Literally anything he can scrape from the barrel he is bringing into this meeting. Even the fact that I won't make international calls when I'm WFH.

I'm at a loss, guys, I don't know what to do. I'm not the only one he bullies, he does it to everyone on the team, but I'm the one he's actively trying to get rid of and I'm dreading going to work and I'm just so...Sad. I'm not even at the point of anger anymore, I'm just sad.

TL;DR: One of my leads hates me, is actively trying to get me fired.",6,20140508215423,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Concerned boyfriend here. My girlfriend keeps hearing from her friends about diet pills, and she wants to try. I am a really skeptical person and have to have all the information before I make any health decisions. I want to support her to lose weight, but I want to steer her to lose it in natural ways (proper diet, exercise) as much as possible.

She wants me to support her to take the diet pills, but from the information I've gleaned from the internet - they have a lot of nasty side effects, and make you lose good fats and water content in your body as much as bad fats.

So I want to know your experience of any good information you guys might have on it. So I can make a somewhat informed decision whether to support her or steer her clear and put a lot more energy into getting her on the right track lifestyle way.

Now I should note she also plans to change her diet and get exercise, but wants to use diet pills as kind of a boost for weight loss. She doesn't want to lose so much just 5-8kg.

You ladies provide me with so much good information that I wouldn't be able to find anywhere else- information that helps me be more comfortable in my own skin, information that helps me stay healthy and safe, information that eases my mind of almost all the fears that stem from being a teenage girl.

I've even been able to post here when I had questions about birth control and insurance (something that honestly caused me to have a breakdown because I didn't know what to do). You ladies actually helped me through a difficult turning point in my life! I don't know what I would have done without you all.

Now I know that a lot of you are upset with the influx of people. No, we are not an obscure little club anymore. No, we cannot freely post here without any worry of being challenged anymore. Yes, there will be more asshats in here. But you know, that's just part if bring integrated into a new community. More people means more chaos, always. That just means we'll have to work twice as hard to make it the place it needs to be. Downvote, report, redirect, inform.

Just because we have to put in effort does not mean we should just throw our hands up in frustration.

I say this because there will be more girls like me, either misinformed or lost. Those girls need you ladies, and now that we're a default we can help more of them and help them become more informant and confident in their knowledge.

Honestly, I find it a bit upsetting that some of you are angry that you can't just reap the benefits anymore and will have to work to keep the community supportive. It's like high school cliques all over again.

Mine is far from traumatic, since I have an amazing family, but it still isn't an experience I ever hope to repeat. tl;dr no regrets and my best friend is amazing

 I found out I was pregnant shortly before my 18th birthday and the father was a fellow High School student.  I immediately decided it needed to be terminated and I had to face my mother.  Telling her was scary, but once it was out and I had her support I felt much better.  She helped me deal with the guy's family although in the end I just cut contact and got through it with financial support from my grandmother.

I got in for my first appointment shortly before I was supposed to go to Louisiana for two weeks, so we scheduled the actual abortion shortly after I would be back, accidentally putting it on the same day as my prom.  I went and learned piercing, avoiding what would have been two hellishly long drama filled weeks of school.

The procedure was short and relatively painless.  One of the nurses held my hand and I had an old stuffed animal in my bag that I pulled out and held on to.  I don't regret bringing her either, wolfy was a very supportive companion since I asked my grandma to stay in the waiting room.

Afterwards was when things got bad.  The cramping was kinda awful, like my normal periods, and I had to keep heat on my lower back.  I spent nearly the whole night watching movies and texting.  This was when I started to get ""drama.""  My boyfriend at the time decided to dump me via text about an hour after the operation for completely unrelated reasons despite having been supportive of me and knowing exactly what I was doing that day.

  I had kind of shut down and was flunking out before the whole situation though, so it actually had a positive effect in school.  I had made so many people hate me by referring to the fetus as a ""parasite"" (partially a coping mechanism) and being entirely unconflicted about terminating the pregnancy that I was only talking to my best friend (who is very religious, but was so supportive of me, I love that girl so much) and a couple supportive teachers and counselors so I was able to buckle down and finish the year strong with more credits than I needed.

Edit: Just felt a need to add that for me an abortion was really the only sensible option, it was entirely my decision, and looking back I would not be alive if I had been unable to terminate the pregnancy.  I am adamantly childfree so if I was unable to abort (and failing that force a miscarriage) I would have called the police then taken a knife to my own uterus.

**UPDATE #2: Hey gals. Just got home from the doctor. He said it's almost definitely a full-blown can't really get worse yeast infection (he said he couldn't test for sure because of my period). I just picked up all my prescriptions. I got a tube of terconazole, ciprofloxacin (he started a culture of my urine because it looks like I may have a UTI as well), and some more 200mg tabs of phenazopyridine. He said because I'm so swollen and the infection is so bad that the peeling is akin a diaper rash but can absolutely happen with a yeast infection. So here's hoping for a quick recovery!! :(**

Hi 2X. This is my first time posting here (I'm pretty shy and don't post to reddit very much) because I'm in desperate need of some help. I don't really have many lady figures in my life, and none that I'm comfortable talking with about this kinda stuff. I hope this subreddit is ok to post this in. If you know of a better one, I would be happy to be directed there!!

I'm not really looking for medical advice per se because I'm going to do my best to get to the doctor's tomorrow but I really need some advice to try and get some temporary relief. Maybe some TMI ahead.

To start off I am 20 y/o and I am sexually active with my boyfriend of two years. The last time we had sex was about two weeks ago. This week I had some pain while urinating and suspected a UTI. I took some phenozopyridine because I've been a bit too busy and knew I would be able to get to the doctor Friday if symptoms persisted. Then I started getting yeast infection symptoms (itchiness, swelling, redness and dryness, which I experienced with my first yeast infection.)

Yesterday, I took an extra prescribed diflucan pill from my last yeast infection. And today things went really, really south. As if it wasn't bad enough with all the other symptoms, I started my period. I am using a tampon because the thought of a pad was even more painful with being so dry. I'm not sure if the tampon might make things worse either.

Then, tonight, I go to the bathroom to change and clean up and realized something horrifying. Skin is peeling from from my labia minora, my clit and my hood. I am in so much pain and itchy and swollen and I'm so desperate for relief. I tried miconazole cream but only had relief for about 10 minutes. 

I am tearing up right now because I'm just so uncomfortable and I don't know what to do to help myself until tomorrow. Can I use an icepack or would that make things worse? Is there some mystery home remedy I haven't heard of that I might be able to do?

**TL;DR: possible infection, don't know what it is, skin is peeling off my clit and labia and I don't know how to relieve the pain and itching until I can see the doctor tomorrow. Please help if you know anything that might help!!! :(**

t3_253vki,"Sexual Harassment Needs to Stop...","Hopefully this is the only feminist piece I will ever write in my life. My main interests are bio, hiking, and fun so feminism is generally pretty far away from where my mind lies. I had never experienced any form of sexual harassment until 8 months ago, but suddenly it seems to be everywhere. What changed? Sure, I’ve been traveling a lot, but I’ve been traveling before. Is it just that I’m older so creepers think it’s now socially acceptable to hit on me?

Here are some beautiful, well-thought-out letters to the men who have been creepers towards me:

Dear the mf**king bastard who physically harassed me on the trolley in Istanbul,
I didn’t move away from you when you were standing so close to me because all my energy was focused on how I would punch you if you touched me again. I wasn’t completely sure that you had pinched me and, having never had anything like that happen before, I didn’t want to move because “nothing has actually happened, right?” But when the train cleared out and you didn’t move away, that’s when you showed your true colors. Too bad I didn’t realize that your presence was the sexual harassment. You suck.
	
Dear dude at the airport that followed me to my terminal, 
I was really upset that I had to pay the baggage fee because my bag was overweight. My problem is that my mother won’t let me out of the house unless I have everything I could ever possibly need ever. So remarking about how you understand my situation because “women need more stuff” just makes you an idiot. Telling me how you noticed me because I was “so pretty, so beautiful” also just makes you an idiot. You suck.

Dear creepy guard dude who I need to talk to to get inside this building,
You should have noticed a couple months ago my complete lack of response to you calling me “precious” and “beautiful”. I am not an all-powerful ring of doom and I am smart enough not to take those words as compliments. The Nazi tattoo on your hand also makes you a shitfaced insensitive person. I am only nice and polite and talk to you because I need to get to the room I’m staying in and I am afraid of what might happen if you realized how much I hate your guts. You suck.

Dear the men that try to provoke me when I am running, walking, or existing in the park,
Really? Really? What do you think you are going to get out of going “tssst tssst” at me? Or saying “Hola/Hello” for that matter? Given the noise you make, I have decided that you are all a bunch of cockroaches that aren’t worth my effort to try to step on. You suck.

Dear the egotistical bastard who tried to put his finger up my asshole and brush his hand against my v-jj when I was wearing makeup to go to an interview,
You should have no self-respect at all. Wearing make-up does not make me a slut, a piece of ass, or anything for your amusement. I’m happy I didn’t let you ruin my day. You suck.

On a more serious note, I would like to comment on how these varying degrees of harassment have changed my perception of others. I am less likely to trust men in general and am sadly reduced to evaluating men walking past me on the street to see if they present a threat. The last thing I want to do is to reduce someone to their gender, but it is a method of self-protection. I feel weaker because of these judgements and lie to myself by saying that a truly strong person would not judge a person based off of experiences with other people. But then I remember that a wise person would use his or her past experiences in order to evaluate the present ones. So if you are a man walking past me on the street and I choose to move to the other side of the street because I judge you a threat, please forgive me. I just don’t want to have my day ruined again.

Cheers!

I have been with my SO for many years (both 23). I have grown up with the idea of sex being ""bad"" and not what a ""good girl"" does (my family is *very* prudish). It took me a long time to move past this and I finally started feeling comfortable having sex (some of the ""guilt"" still remains - gosh, I even feel kind of guilty admitting that I have sex in writing here).  

We only use condoms, but we want to be safer and he especially does. He's been asking me to go onto the pill for about a year now but I just don't know how I feel about it.  
  

 Here are my reasons why:    

1. I don't want to pump my body full of hormones. I don't want to have to take a pill every single day at the same time and I don't want to accidentally have my parents come across my pill packet where all hell will break loose (I stay at my parents home on the weekends and holidays, I am not moving out until I graduate I don't live with SO yet).      

2. I feel like shit during my pre-menstrual time. I have bad bouts of PMS, I get angry for no reason, I hate everyone, I cry, I feel fat, I get spotty. PMS comes about due to the high levels of hormones, surely going on the pill will result in me PMS-ing *constantly*. Is this true?  
  
3. Side effects!!! I know ""most women"" don't have side effects but who's to say I won't be one of the women who do? My main concerns are: weight gain, the PMS thing I mentioned in point 2, decreased libido, having a ""cloudy mind"" i.e. not being as sharp as usual (I actually read this on reddit, another user's experience of going off the pill and immediately seeing benefits mentally).    

4. I am confident with NFP. I know when I ovulate, I know when the safe period is.  
  

I feel very pressured that I must start the pill and my SO has withdrawn all sexual activity until I start it. TwoX, please make me feel better about starting the pill?",31,20140509054045,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

They also have a security guard there many nights since it's on a rowdy college campus, and I have a fairly friendly relationship with him. 


So the other night I stopped by and this woman came up to me in the parking lot, saying she had a weird question and to stop me if it was too personal. She wanted to know what the name of that ""thing that goes up inside women to stop them from getting pregnant"" was. I said, intrauterine device? and she said yeah, where do you get one? I told her I wasn't sure, but my friend had one and I'm pretty sure you needed a prescription. At that she looked really sad, and the security guard came up and stared at her and she walked away. 


Later the guard and I are talking and he says I should stay away from 'people like her,' because it looked like she hadn't showered in weeks and was trying to get her hands on an 'item' they carried, and was probably a thief. I was really uncomfortable with how he was talking about her, because she hadn't seemed dangerous at all, just sad and worried. I wish I'd pointed her in the direction of some resources for getting free or cheap birth control, but I'm not sure how to have that conversation, especially with a security guard hovering menacingly. I'm really worried that she was homeless and having to turn to sex work to survive, and won't have access to make that work safer. 


I feel bad that I couldn't help her out, and bad that I didn't challenge the guard for saying some problematic things, but that's in the past.

t3_2542eq,"Just need to vent, I guess. (long)","I don't know if this fully fits here, but I'm not really sure where else to go.


So, in February I started university and moved into on-campus accommodation. I've made a decent little group of friends since and overall, I've been loving it, but there has been some stressful shit happen that I don't feel comfortable sharing with people I know in real life. 

The first, and worst, thing to happen was one of my new friends was sexually assaulted, I'll refer to her as 'Jane'. It was the night of her birthday, we went down to the rec room and she had a shit ton to drink. I enlisted the help of one of the guys to help me get her back to her room, we got her back, got her settled and I nudged him out of the room in front of me. We went down the stairwell right next to her room, I went onto my floor and he continued down to his - or so I thought. The next day, 'Jane' text me and told me that he'd doubled back after I'd left and she - recognising the voice and having a certain amount of trust in the guy - let him in. I'm not 100% sure of the details, all I know is there was no penetration and she was fading in and out for most of it. This guy hadn't been part of the group for long. Our first impressions of him had been that he was kinda creepy - real smooth talker, charming and a heap of inappropriate jokes.
The next week or so, 'Jane became more and more anxious and felt unsafe - to the point where she was feeling suicidal. Later, she admitted that at one point, I had gone to her room and knocked when she was at a really low point and was about to seriously hurt herself. She decided to go talk to the on-campus counselors and asked me to go with her. Afterward, we approached the security guard we know best and let him know what happened; a report was filed and all of the on-campus security guys, as well as the accommodation staff, know him and are keeping an eye on him. The guard asked her if she wanted to go to the police, and after some consideration, she decided to file a report. However, she didn't want to press charges, she just wanted people to be aware of him, to prevent it from happening to anyone else.
Everything that happened freaked me out pretty badly. I feel really guilty and like I let her down - if I had've taken her back by myself, if I had've stayed with her a little longer, if I'd made sure he didn't go back, if I'd listened to my instincts, maybe it wouldn't have happened.


A few weeks later, we made friends with a few other people. One of them is a guy, 'Luke', who has since become quite close to 'Jane' and I. When 'Jane' admitted that I had prevented her from self-harming at one point, he brought up his history of self harm. That discussion, weirdly enough, left me feeling kinda panicky, and ever since if I get a message or see a blog post from either of them that seems 'off', I worry about them until I see them again and can reassure myself that they're alright.

'Luke' also uses me as a sounding board for venting about his family - they really don't get along and fight a lot - as well as issues he's had with other friends.


It may seem inconsequential, but throughout high school (and currently), my best friend struggled with a multitude of mental illnesses - a severe anxiety disorder, depression, and she nearly died from anorexia. Throughout this, I was one of her main sources of support, outside of her psychologist/doctors and family. 
When I moved for university, I selfishly hoped to get a chance to... focus on my self, I guess? The last five years have been revolved around constant worry about my best friend - I spent most of my time making sure she was okay and defending her from the assholes who seemed to get some sort of sick enjoyment out of triggering her into E.D behaviours or panic attacks. Whenever I attempted to talk to her about any problems I was having - even if it was something petty and I just wanted to vent - she'd spin the conversation into a 'well, at least you don't have to deal with x, y, z...'

I just feel so selfish, and like I'm letting my friends down for not wanting to be their support system all the time. I also feel like though I care about them, they don't give a damn about me. This last week, there was a death in my family and naturally I've been upset. The most I've gotten has been a 'my condolences' and the offer of a smoke.

t3_254wh6,"By being a default sub, TwoXChromosomes is inherently a less safe space for trans women. The two - being a default sub, and being safe space for trans women - are mutually exclusive.","As a trans woman, I've always felt comfortable in TwoXChromosomes. I'm primarily a lurker, but I occasionally chime in. All in all, this is a community that has been actively supportive of trans folks.

(I want to take a moment to distinguish ""tolerance"" from ""support."" Tolerance is passive: I won't kick you out. I won't beat you up. I won't fire you. All in all, I won't be an asshole. Support requires action: I *will* use the correct name and pronoun. I *will* defend you. I *will* support you.)

I don't expect that support to change now that TwoXChromosomes is a default sub. But the balance of power has shifted. Take [this photo post from today](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2540mz/iff_first_bikini_ive_never_been_comfortable/). A week ago, I would have been surprised to see *any* comments questioning the poster's gender. Maybe a random troll had found the post, but they'd be in a tiny minority.  Today, there have been at least a dozen posts of that nature. To be clear, the response was overwhelmingly ""OP *is* a woman. Get over it."" And, shortly thereafter, the mods deleted the offensive comments.

But I'm not convinced that's good enough. By labeling itself as an inclusive, welcoming, supportive community, TXC is implicitly making claims about the tone of the discussion that will happen here. Those claims seem at odds with the amount of traffic any default sub will inevitably receive. 

[And the shifting balance of power is not just impacting trans women,](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2542pr/guess_i_wont_be_posting_on_here_for_a_while/) even if I suspect we're going to be the most viscously targeted.

I've read a number of posts from mods and community members about the positive value of increased visibility. They all make good points, and I can't really argue with wanting the safe space of TXC to be as large and inclusive as possible. I would never want to - for example - exclude people who identified as male, or disallow *any* sort of questioning or ignorance. But this sub - by its very nature - encourages posts that will be foreign to the majority of redditors, many of whom will be hostile to *any* women, let alone trans women. 

Placing this sub as default invites them in.

**EDIT AND CLARIFICATION**: I'm also an artist and educator by trade. My job is to travel across the country and talk about trans identity, and to help make sense of something that most people have never considered: Our identity and our body may not match, and that's OK. I have no problem with honest ignorance; in fact, it's how I make a living. Likewise, I don't find questions about trans identity - about how someone can have a penis *and* be a woman - inherently offensive. We're not born knowing this stuff, and even the best sex ed or biology is incredibly unlikely to discuss it. 

I choose to be an educator. I put on my educator hat, and walk into classrooms and theatres, prepared to share a part of myself with an audience. I want to be crystal clear that my problem is not with ignorance, or with people asking well-intentioned questions. Both have a time and a place, and the only way to learn how to be supportive of trans folks (or *any* minority) is a willingness to say, ""I don't know."" But that's not, so far as I can tell, the purpose of this sub. And it's certainly not the purpose of an IFF post, or of an entirely unrelated discussion about identity, personal experience, graduation, dating, body issues, or any of the myriad of other topics this sub has so beautifully encompassed.

t3_254mpj,"The most humiliating period","So this happened to me last week, and I'm so embarrassed I can't even think about it without bursting into tears: 

So I was admitted to the hospital for a thorascopic wedge resection of a lung last week. Basically, that means that they deflate one lung, put a camera and some cutting tools between my ribs, and cut out some cancer-y bits. This was my ninth cancer-related surgery in the last three years and my second thorascopic resection. 

The morning after surgery, I was off the ventilator, but still hooked up to an IV in each arm, an insanely gross drainage tube coming out of my chest and attached to this weird clear briefcase thing (hilariously labled ""OAISIS"" -- if your oaisis is full of my bloody lung soup, you have clearly annoyed the God of the Old Testament), and, of course, a Foley (pee) catheter. I didn't feel too bad; the intrathecal morphine hadn't worn off yet, so everything below my collar bone was a little hazy. 

But then I noticed that my parts felt a little...soupy. More than sweat could explain. I hit the call button and sheepishly explained to the nurse ""I think I might have gotten my period?"" 

""Let's see."" 

There was blood everywhere. Blood had soaked through my hospital gown and my sheets. Blood down my thighs to my knees. Blood covering the Foley catheter. A bloody thumb-print on the call light. 

""Okay, so what do you want to do?"" the nurse asked. 

I had no idea how to answer. I want this blood off of me. I want to go home. I want to never have another period. I want to spontaneously combust and burn to ashes out of embarrassment. I want you to be stricken blind for having witnessed my humiliation. 

The Foley catheter made it so I couldn't even go to the bathroom and clean up -- I had to lie there, bleeding and trying not to cry, until the surgeon returned a page with an order to remove it. It took an hour. During this time, my Dad came by with a cup of coffee, turned pale, and said he would wait in the cafeteria until things were settled.  

Finally the nurse came back with the order and a tech -- a male tech. They didn't even close the door before flipping up my gown to remove the catheter. I wasn't allowed my own underwear but instead was given these weird mesh underpants, kind of a softer version of the crotch of a pair of fishnets. There was so little actual material there that the adhesive of my pad couldn't stick to it, so I had to get up every 45 minutes or so to make sure that I wasn't leaking -- usually, I was. The nurse and tech changed the sheets, the mattress cover, and my gown with a kind of grim-faced efficiency that made me feel like a 150-lb sack of extra gross meat instead of a person. 

This is not exactly my first medical-related humiliation (so many chemotherapy shitting-my-pants stories!), but this one, for some reason, is an absolutely gutting humiliation. 

TL;DR: Made an accidental blood donation while tethered to a piss catheter.

Obviously, I want those Nigerian girls to be saved. But the people who took them are men and they are real. Just like the ""real women have curves"" campaign de-legitimizes girls who *aren't* curvy, it's a way to vilify these select assholes by dehumanizing (or actually, emasculating) them. The thing is, they are not exceptions. Human trafficking is so much more prevalent, and a lot of *real men* are doing it right now, outside of this specific issue.

It's great that the word is getting out, and, three weeks later, the US finally sent people over to help. But this isn't a singular issue, and this isn't an issue we can overcome if we treat it like an exception. *Real men* do buy girls, and it's a symptom of a much deeper problem. 

I don't think a solution will be found by dehumanizing these awful people because, well, they *are* human. It feels like they're writing off human capability to be that inhumane to others (which happens constantly in different forms all over the world). **We need to do a better job of teaching all men in all societies to humanize women, otherwise the problem will persist without abatement**.

""I saved the company $2K in overhead.""

A woman will typically use ""we"" statements, or any way to remove herself from the statement specifically.

""My team brought in 20$ more revenue in Q2.""

""Our new procedure reduced overhead by $2k.""

The way I read it is that purposefully 'TMI' posts are being created and upvoted as a means to drive out unwanted viewers who show up due to our new default status. And I don't really get it. I'm tired of the ONLY 2X posts I see focusing on the most irritating and to my mind least interesting/enlightening/thought provoking aspects of womanhood. 

Let me be clear. I absolutely think women should be able to post those topics and frankly find the TMI designation unnecessary in a community devoted to females and female topics. But it all feels really contrived right now. And it shows only an extremely limited side of our community. And it doesn't make me feel supported, intellectually stimulated, or empowered. It just makes me feel annoyed. I joined this community because I wanted to connect with other women, not because I need to talk about my period clots more. I am a much more interesting, rich, complex being than my menstruation details. 

I don't value purposefully alienating people just because they are new. I don't value cultural sequestration. It seems like we've taken drastic measures even before opening up to potential new and valuable members.

t3_254qvy,"Uncomfortable work situation","I have been in my current position for going on 5 years. I truly love my job. Without getting into too much detail, it is in the social work field (which is why this is really embarrassing for me to allow to happen).

 

I have a supervisor who has been acting inappropriately towards me and two other colleagues. I shamefully allowed the behaviour to continue for the past five years .... well honestly I am not sure why. I guess I didn’t want to “make a big deal” and I was kind of afraid no one would believe me. When my colleagues share similar experiences/feelings I guess I felt more empowered to deal with it.

 

Examples of some of the stuff that he has done are him placing his hand on the curve of my lower back, firmly grabbing  my arms/shoulders, rubbing my leg (happened once) and making inappropriate sexual comments/jokes (talking about is dick).

 

I was kind of worried to mention this to our coordinator because non-related issues between staff have been dealt with poorly in the past (like having accusers sit in a room with accused and confronting them).

 

Finally I got the nerve to bring it up to her in passing and she said to me “Why haven’t you told him to stop?” Looking back, I guess I just felt uncomfortable. He usually does it when other people are there and I feel like it would embarrass everyone present. I should have fully said “STOP” but it has happened so many times it would just be weird. I have distanced myself greatly and he started telling my boss that I am unfriendly and telling other staff that “She has changed”.

 

Because I mentioned it in passing, she has requested that myself and the other two women meet with her this afternoon so we can discuss it more seriously. I am really worried about how this is going to go down. How she is going to deal with it. How this is going to affect how we are treated from here on out.

 

I have a feeling he knows this is happening because yesterday a very uncomfortable situation occurred. One of the other females used to work at another organization and made a complaint against him in 2010 (four freaking years ago). She didn’t know him but was advocating on behalf of her client. Well yesterday he started telling her “I take care of my staff, I am so nice. I let you guys leave early. But you guys complain against me.” She thought he was talking about our meeting today and just said “I don’t know what you are talking about”. Then he printed out her complaint from 2010 and threw it on the desk. She didn’t know how to respond and he just walked away. She said she felt very intimidated. It gave me a very uneasy feeling too, to be honest.

 

I guess I am just wondering if anyone else has been in a situation like this and how it turned out. I am seriously anxious and nervous. I am worried because it happened so many times but I never wrote down dates. The other girls have written down dates because they are new and it has just started happening to them. 

Edit: to add to the situation, the other women are turning to me as ""the strong one"" and the moving force behind the complaint. That's a lot of pressure.

t3_255awf,"How to deal with harassment at work?","I have a couple of questions about harassment and I hope I can get some honest opinions about the matter.  I don't have many female friends I can talk to about this, so 2x is the closest thing I have to girl friends. 

I work at a large U.S. based bank, but not as a teller. I basically troubleshoot customer's bank accounts and do anything from tech support  to refunding  bank fees and disputing unauthorized transactions. All of this I do over the phone so I never see any of my customers face to face, it's nice in some aspects (I can wear what I want!) and in other aspects, people treat me so much worse because I'm just a voice over the phone. 
Anyways, recently I've been getting a rather large amount of inappropriate comments. I'm not sure how to handle it.  

For example: Yesterday I had to deal with two different men remarking how sexy I sounded, which led to them asking if I had a boyfriend. I then had a guy, who was almost ten years younger than me call me ""sugar tits."" I didn't react to that one, because I was so shocked. 

It's not unusual for men to ask if I'm single or for them to call me doll, sweetheart, honey, baby, and/or a million other pet names. I usually don't say anything, but it's just becoming so common that it's getting extremely infuriating. Like dude, I just refunded you over a hundred dollars in bank fees a simple thank you would suffice instead of asking me how I look. 

I had another guy ask me what state I lived in because he was in a middle of a divorce and another guy tell me if he ever leaves his wife, he'll find me.  I am just not comfortable with any of this, I understand that there are hazards with working with the public, but I am so fumbling and awkward that I never know what to say when these things  happen.  I just give a half hearted laugh and quickly bring the subject back to banking. 

I really want to say something to these men, but all of our calls are recorded and we cannot talk back to customers.  If our calls get really bad, i.e. screaming and being extremely abusive  we can transfer them to our escalation group. Usually, when I think of something to say (it's normally after I get off work) it's a lengthy tirade filled with things that would get me fired.

I just want to say something, letting them know it's not okay to speak to anyone like that. I feel like shouting at them that my name isn't honey, sweetie, baby, or sugar tits! I actually have a real name which I told you in the beginning of our conversation!  Is there any way I could politely tell them please call me by my name? Or that me having a boyfriend has nothing to do with the fact that you are overdrawn by $300.00? Should I just work on developing a thicker skin and get over this? 

Any suggestions, advice, or personal stories about similar dealings would be welcomed. This is also my first time posting here, I hope I did everything right.

My job was to get married and have babies, and that was what ""god"" wanted from me.

When my parents were married,  my dad practically worshipped the ground I walked on. He was the best dad. 


He married someone else with a daughter when I was 7. This woman never liked me or my two brothers. My dad never once defended us from her. He just stood by quietly. She did horrible things to us. I don't want to get into that too much. 


This woman always made sure my dad did not spend any time alone with him. Not that he was some defenseless victim, he went along with it. My dad became the perfect dad to my step sister. It was, and still is, devastating. My stepmother rubbed it in my face the last time I saw her. She was going on about my step sister's father in law and how good of a man he is. She said, ""She just must feel so good and secure having two wonderful dads."" She kept saying that. How great it must be for her to have a dad that loves her that much. I just left. I was shocked that she could  be that cruel.


Now, I'm an adult and have a baby. When I was pregnant I thought that he would try to have something to do with his grandson after he was born. I was wrong and I feel like a let down little girl all over again.


I'm angry with myself for ever getting my hopes up. I don't know why I thought it would be different. I just cannot kill my hope that someday he'll be the father I need.


I have never really told him how I feel. I don't know if I should,  or if I should just completely cut all contact with him and his other family. It wouldn't be hard, they never talk to me anyway. I don't even know what I would say. Every time I try, I just get choked up and stop talking.

Ive been to the gyno and she says it happens and to just keep lubricated but how much lube can one girl use before shes slipping off the bed?? lol. 
 We're in an open relationship (we're both bisexual so we can see other people of the same sex) But when I am presented with sexual activities with a woman I some how get in my bed I never take my pants off.

Lately she's been acting just like her usual self up until the point at which I stand up to her, then she caves so completely and utterly I am left standing there going ""wtf was that?""

t3_255lq2,"MENSTRUATION: discuss how we prepare for the crimson fairy's monthly visit and all the curve balls she throws at us.","On an average day of the week, when I'm not a menstruation-ridden zombie bumbling around the house, I normally wear panty liners. I discovered during my journey into adulthood that women often produce a boogery substance called discharge, and my mother introduced me to the life raft that is panty liners. They're like pads, only much thinner, and I use them to keep my underwear nice and clean. 

HOWEVER, on one day a month the crimson fairy arrives at my door. That sadistic bitch waves her wand and the hands of my body's internal clock hit *menstruation*. In my teen years my periods were fairly irregular, but now I can always trust they arrive on schedule. When this starts, the crimson fairy is courteous enough to warn me of what's to come with some light spotting. It usually appears in the toilet or in my underpants, and because I wear panty liners this isn't often an issue. But as I age, it almost seems like I'm developing a sixth sense for the arrival of my period. One day I'll get a feeling, and I'll reach for a pad. Then, a few hours later, the spotting arrives. 

I've come to think of this as the spotting day. Menstruation usually plays out for me like this: the first day is very light flow, and the second day is like a smelly, bloody tsunami. The second day is always the worst of it, and now that I have a sense for my body's workings I know what to prepare for. I take inventory on my pads, I stock up on dark underpants and I change my sheets. To prevent accidents from happening, I have a pair of old yet comfy pajama bottoms that I wear to bed. It's okay if I leak on these because they're made of a dark, thick, absorbent material. I get squeamish at the thought of tampons, you see, so pads have always been the way for me.  

But I can't put my life on hold for menstruation. I've got things to do, places to be. Warm days and summertime are particularly troublesome for me when I'm running errands, because it's difficult to tell if I'm leaking or if it's just sweat between my thighs. On days like these, I take advantage of mirrors to inspect my hindquarters for the tell-tale stains. Or if I'm with my mother, I'll turn to her and furtively whisper, ""Hey, can you look at my butt for a minute? Am I leaking?"" Camaraderie. 

Then there's that one thing that happens when we stand up after sitting for a while. You know what I'm talking about, right? I'll be sitting for an extended period of time and then, when I stand up, *that thing* happens. The dam breaks. It almost feels like I'm peeing my pants, and it's something I literally have zero control over. It's a terrible thing to endure in public, no matter how prepared I am. Not only do I bring two spare pads in my purse, but I also place no less than four wet wipes in a ziploc bag in case of an emergency. On that note, I'm curious to know how others cope with appearing in public when the crimson fairy pays a visit. Do you bring extra underwear? Wet wipes? Pads and tampons? 

I'm also curious to know about the quirks that other menstruating individuals have to put up with and the techniques they've developed to cope. Do you wear old, not-so-fancy undergarments or do you wear the sexiest undergarments in your possession to lift your spirits? Tampons or pads? Medicine, perhaps? Do you have mood swings? Do you have diarrhea or log shits? Scented or unscented? Cravings? Bloating? Cramps? Certain activities to improve your mood, like watching movies or reading books?

So I guess part two to the question would be, how often do you actually identify as women (or any non-male for that matter) in video games, if ever? ",6,20140509114731,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_255ej8,"My long and exhausting week (hi, venting)","I'm an introvert but I like to be busy, so I try to balance ""people time"" and ""me time"". This week I didn't balance things well, and I have two kids who are very opinionated (don't know who they get it from...) and talk ALL THE TIME. I live in a foreign (to me) country and I organise events for other immigrants to help them integrate, so I spend a TON of time in meetings, emailing, begging for space or resources or money. I'm currently organising a huge event for immigrant parents to learn about the school system here. Plus I just started my own business teaching kids programming, and ran my first workshop in April.

In short, I'm just completely out of energy, even for my kids.

Then yesterday I was waiting for the tram to come home and this drunk guy who's yelling at cars comes and sits next to me at the stop. He's rambling in his own language about Nazis and Aryans and then asks me what colours eyes I have. I ignore him. He asks over and over and *over* and I browse fb on my phone. He finally leans in and says, ""Blue eyes. Get out of here and go back to Germany!"" (hint, crazy lunatic man, not from Germany). Tram comes, I go home.

He was there today again, exact same place, same clothes, same cans of beer. Today he was harassing someone else, so I quickly fled, feeling bad for the older woman he was talking to but not wanting to get involved, either.

So this week has been a bit shitty, really, and my dear husband has banished me to the balcony with music, beer, ice cream and my laptop. No kids taking up my brainspace, no pressure to do anything at all except post to reddit. Thanks for being here today, TwoX. x",3,20140509135346,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_255tv1,"I finally called the police on my physically abusive partner. I want to share my experience.","Warning: this is long!

A few months ago, my boyfriend held me against the wall and punched me several times in the side of the head, then pushed me onto the floor and kicked me while I lay there. I remember him going into the kitchen and I was thinking “he’s going to get a knife, he’s going to get a knife and kill me”. This was at least the 20th time this had happened in our 3.5 year relationship. He tried to stop me from leaving the house, and when he realised I might call the police, he told me he would kill himself. So once I was outside, I took a few deep breaths, dialled 999 and said exactly what had happened - my boyfriend had threatened suicide and I couldn’t enter the house in case he hurt me again.

I was an idiot about the whole thing - I begged the police officers not to arrest him, I even tried saying I lied about him attacking me, I refused to show them most of the bruising under my clothes, and I gave a witness statement but said I would refuse to give evidence in court. But while he was being arrested, I sat in the police car with a kind lady officer who told me that I absolutely had to end this relationship, that nobody deserves to be hit. She talked me through what was going to happen, made sure I would be able to stay in my house, and before they took my boyfriend away they gave me his keys.

He was charged with assault later in the day, and it was explained to me that I didn’t have a choice in the outcome of this - the police had enough evidence to charge him and didn’t require my consent to do so. I said again that I didn’t want to go to court, but by that point I was already beginning to change my mind and realising that perhaps it was a good thing that he was arrested.

I honestly wasn’t prepared for how good I would feel when he was removed from my life. I was absolutely terrified of living without him, of sleeping alone, of being without the person who I thought I loved more than anything in the world. But the feeling of freedom I had was so amazing it's difficult to put into words - just knowing that I had nobody to justify myself to anymore, that I no longer had to worry about making him angry, that I no longer had to feel guilty for making another human being want to physically harm me. I did a lot of research on domestic violence while I was still in the relationship, desperately trying to understand what it was I was doing that was making him do this. It’s true that you can never see the full picture while you’re still in the situation. I never saw how much power and control he had over me until he was gone, and only then, it was immediately clear.

He pleaded not guilty, and a couple of weeks ago I went to court as a witness in his trial. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. His lawyer said I made up the whole thing to hurt him, and brought up the fact that I hadn’t showed the police any injuries etc. The lawyers and magistrates kept asking me questions I couldn’t answer - “How many times did he kick you?” “Between 5 and 10” “No, we need to know exactly how many”. Well shit, maybe I should’ve been keeping a tally while I was lying on the floor being attacked, but I didn’t. Sorry.

He was found not guilty. So as of now there are no more bail conditions, nothing to keep me safe. No grounds to get a restraining order. He is innocent in the eyes of the law and can turn up at my address whenever he wants to. I’ve found this difficult to deal with, if I’m honest. I find it hard to accept that his lawyer (who knows exactly what happened, and knows how my safety will be endangered) can stand up in court and create a lie to get his client off the hook. I know it’s his job. I know defence lawyers have an important place in society. I still find it hard to come to terms with, as a person who tries to live by a strong set of morals. Everyone in that court room knew he was guilty, and he was still acquitted. In my borough we have a specialist domestic violence court, where the magistrates and other staff are trained in domestic violence cases and there is a much better conviction rate. My case didn’t go there. I don’t know why, probably budget cuts etc.

The biggest issue I’ve had from people I’ve had to disclose this to outside of the police is the assumption that we must have “had a fight” and the police became involved. I often hear a statistic that most domestic violence is mutual, and while I don’t deny that that might be true, I can honestly say that whilst I wasn’t the perfect girlfriend (who is?) I never hit my boyfriend back. I never shouted in his face, I never called him names or even swore at him in an argument. I never, ever had any desire to hurt him, only to protect myself and to try to show him how much I loved him in the hope that he might understand what a real loving relationship is supposed to be like. About a year before all of this happened, I confided in a consultant clinical psychologist, the head of her department, whose response was ""In DV situations we always need to look at the woman and what she's doing"" and (I shit you not) ""I'm sure if you start having more sex you'll find this will stop"". I decided not to make a formal complaint.

He grew up in a home where he both witnessed and experienced physical violence and other forms of abuse, and so did I. Whether that is the reason we both ended up in this situation, I don’t know. He always had an issue with accepting responsibility for mistakes - his violent outbursts were always my fault, for interrupting him, for taking a wrong turn while driving, for “not caring”, no matter how much effort I put in. I did everything he asked of me, keeping a constant list in my head of things which upset him or made him angry, but the violence continued, and got increasingly more severe. He genuinely believed, and convinced me too, that in our relationship, I was the (emotional) abuser, and he was the victim, lashing out because he had no other option. I’m sure he still believes now that I called the police because I wanted to fuck up his life, not because I was so afraid for both of our safety.

Anyway, this has got long. The main reason I decided to share my experience was because I’ve read so many bad experiences of reporting abuse and violence to the police, and I want to share how good my experience has been. The police were helpful, professional, supportive, and non-judgemental from the moment I called for help. Please, if you are in this kind of a shitty relationship, if your partner commits a crime against you, please report it. The police are there for your safety and protection, it is their job to help you. The UK has a proactive prosecution policy towards domestic violence. This means that the police will always arrest the person who has attacked you and where there is enough evidence, they will charge and push for prosecution whether they have the support of the victim or not. I believe now that this is a good thing - regardless of the eventual outcome at court - had my boyfriend not been arrested, as per my request at the time, I would’ve gone straight back into a dangerous situation with someone who now had even more reason to be angry at me.

I won’t say that I’m doing well now, because that wouldn’t be entirely true. I have good days and bad days. I’m trying to keep myself occupied and distracted, and not spend too much time alone. I know that time is a great healer, so I’m confident that things can only get better from here :)",436,20140509163508,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_255zg7,"Question from a terminal dad about my wife and daughter","Hey all, I'm a long time reader of r/all, so I've seen a lot of your sub before it became a default, and I've always appreciated the care you give each other.  With that in mind, I have some questions about how to help my wife deal with my upcoming death.  

Some background first:

I'm a late 30's dad with terminal cancer.  My wife and I have been married for 14 1/2 years (and dated off and on for 8-9 years before that) and I’ve been in treatment for 6 ½ years now.  We have 2 children, 1 girl and 1 boy, who are just about to turn 7 and 10 respectively.  I am lucky as hell to have survived as long as I have, but unfortunately things point to me not making it too much longer.

My wife is a wonderful woman, who has gone through hell with this, but is much, much more emotionally reserved than I am.  She went through some rough shit as a young girl, and as a result built some damn high walls to protect herself.  She very rarely cries, and even more rarely lets anyone in through those walls she (when we got the recent bad news, her mom came to me to ask how she could help her daughter).  

In addition to this, with me being diagnosed with cancer out of the blue (and being in good shape, healthy, etc…) then our daughter being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 3 years old, and no family history for either one, she kinda feels like the world is out to get our family.  Combine this with a strong type A personality, and you get someone who wants to protect her family from the world - a situation that is bound to fail. 

She has told me many times that a major coping mechanism for her is pretending that I’ll just go on living, and she doesn't want to talk about her fears, etc.. much, and I respect that as much as I can, but I worry about after I’m gone.  I worry about her crashing with all the weight she carries, I worry about her sealing herself off from the world emotionally, and I worry about how this will affect the kids too.  

Any insight from the other side of the gender aisle would be welcome.

Additionally, I also wonder what I can do now that will be meaningful for my daughter as she grows up. 

(As a side note, dying sucks.  Especially when you have a lot of people you care about.  My advice: Do your best to avoid it.)

EDIT:  Thank you so much for all the responses!!  I will get to all of them, I am having a rough time with chemo right now, unfortunately...once the itching, bleeding, nausea and muscle cramps are done, I will read and respond.

But I know that eventually it will go away. 

Today I was sitting at my desk and I got the real cramps. And they hurt pretty bad (still do, as I'm writing this). I work in an office that is normally all female, and we tend to just say whatever comes to mind. We have a colleague working here from another branch and he's a dude. No biggie. 

I told my co-worker that ""My uterus hurts"" and the guy colleague came out of his office and was grinning uncomfortably and motioned that there was an employee in the testing room and obviously that they could probably hear me. I realized that he was uncomfortable because I had said ""uterus."" And then him being uncomfortable made me uncomfortable. No, not uncomfortable, I take that back--it made me irritated. Why is it alright to say that any other body part hurts but saying the word uterus is taboo? Come on, people! Seriously???

t3_256o4b,"My gynecologist won't give me an IUD - I'm in need of some advice.","I've been having a tough time with hormonal BC. I've been taking it for about a year and a half, but I've only started to experience adverse side effects in the last 6 months or so. I've had bouts of depression, mood swings, and a crushingly nonexistent libido. Since these effects have persisted consistently, I decided I should try to switch to a non-hormonal method of birth control. I should mention that I am 21 years old, in a long-term relationship, and have never been pregnant. 

I made an appointment to talk with my doctor, and right off the bat I could tell that she was not going to budge her opinion. Before she walked in the door, her mind was made up. She was not going to give me an IUD, and certainly not a non-hormonal one. She said that because I have never been pregnant, I would be at a much greater risk of infection with an IUD, and that my uterus would be too small. No examination, nothing. She said my best bet for better emotional health would be changing up my hormonal BC cocktail. She said that basically no matter what, birth control will always affect my mood, and keep my libido low. She gave me a new pill pack, and sent me on my way. 

If these side effects were minor, I wouldn't have even gone in to see her. The thing is that I no longer feel like myself. I can feel horribly empty and very *wrong* to a point where it's difficult to function. 

My SO is going away for the summer, so I thought I'd go off the pill for a couple months and see how it goes. But after that, I'm not sure what to do. Do I get a second opinion? How do I find a good doctor? Should I just try the new pill pack?

I'm at that age (28), where I'm being constantly bombarded with Facebook photos and pregnancy announcements. I'm honestly mostly immune to cute kid-baby fever, but I realize I probably should at least be thinking about a decision. I have some years left, but I no longer have 10+ years to mull my options. This, combined with ennui about not being as far along in my career as I'd like (ah, being a perfectionist), I'm suddenly panicking about my complete lack of certainty one way or the other. 

I'm married and my husband is awesome, but equally unsure. When we got engaged, we both thought we wanted to have one kid, but over the years, we've become less sure. I feel like we could be fantastic parents and absolutely could support a child financially. BUT, I've never been baby-crazy or a big fan of kids (though not rabidly anti either). I'm pretty sure my mother assumes I will never have children. I'm super passionate about my career. I love being independent and having hobbies and being my own person. All these logical factors seem to scream: don't have kids! But the analysis doesn't entirely convince me one way or another because I'm the awesomest at overthinking things. There's definitely a part of me that still wants to be a mother.  

We have four awesome bunnies right now, and they've been wonderful for us. In addition to being adorable balls of ridiculousness, I feel like they've made my heart grow, if that makes sense. If I were to have a child, I think that would be why--grow my heart some more. I absolutely know I could unconditionally love and care for a tiny person. But, I don't know if I want to make the sacrifices that being a parent entails. 

So, how do I become sure, pro OR con? Will I ever be sure? Is being unsure reason enough to NOT have a child? Is anyone else as completely confused as I am?

However, no matter which thong I try the string gets ""swallowed"" and is in direct contact with my anus. I had been told to expect the dreaded ""wedgie"" feeling, but instead what I feel is pressure specifically on my butthole, especially when sitting down or walking. I'm not sure if this is the norm, or if my butt is just made weird or what. So I guess my questions are should I be able to see the string of my thong, and should I be experiencing this kind of sensation?

I never get the number or set up a date to get coffee, it never feels like the right time and I find I'm never approached by someone else looking for friendship.

Do I have relationship/engagement anxiety?

Short version of my problem: A couple weeks ago, when I was aware my boyfriend of four years would propose in a matter of days and we were going to close on a house, I broke up with him because I was experiencing serious doubts about marrying him. I can't quite pinpoint why - we're best friends who love each other, we make each other happy, he's a great guy, we resolve conflict well, etc. But this doubt was overwhelming. I felt like I was walking to my doom. Suddenly, after talking about marriage for over a year, I was the opposite of excited to marry him - my insides were screaming at me not to do it, and I'd look at my guy and feel like he was the wrong person, somehow. So I broke it off and told him he wasn't the guy I wanted to marry.

Two weeks out from that, I'm not sure why I did it. I don't exactly want to go rushing back to him - I feel like the doubt would still be there. I did some internet research and read about 'engagement anxiety' and wondered if that could be a factor. The site 'Conscious Transitions' by Sheryl Paul keeps popping up in my search: http://conscious-transitions.com/category/weddingmarriage-transition/

t3_256giw,"My face looks manly.","I'm mostly comfortable with my body. Enough anyway. It's pretty in it's own way, and I can recognize and appreciate that. But my face, I just don't see the good in it. I'm not a very feminine person in general, but I've been working on that and have made progress in everywhere but my face.

I'm relatively thin, but I have quite a bit of neck fat (inherited). My face just looks really flat and without any feminine shape. I have some upper lip hair and I don't wear makeup. I try my hardest to shape my eyebrows into an arch, but they just refuse to get any shape other than flat (They naturally on the thicker side, and they can be kind of messy looking, but I keep them thinner and try to tame them). My forehead isn't exactly *big*, I don't think, but it is, erm, wrinkly? My skin is also oily and shines (not sure if a result of my actual face or the lotion I use on it or something else), giving me an overall greasier look. Combined with my combination dry and greasy hair, it gives me an unkempt, messy/manly look. 

My hair is terrible and certainly adds to my face looking manlier, but that's a problem for another day.

All in all, I'm incredibly insecure about my face, but I don't really know how to fix it. I clearly can't change the shape, but I figure I can change my skin/eyebrows/etc. I use an offbrand of Vaseline's hypoallergenic lotion. I wash my face once daily--in the shower using Cerave (recommended by my dermatologist--I don't think it really helps at all, though). I've recently attempted using a different kind of lotion, but I think it was starting a breakout, so I stopped using it. I've also tried coconut oil which caused a breakout. I don't really have acne-prone skin--it's mostly zitless on it's own--but I guess my skin is just picky about products. Like I said, my eyebrows refuse to hold an arch. They also look ""piece-y"" and don't lay nice. I don't wear makeup and don't intend on it (both out of a fear of causing a breakout and because I don't think I should use makeup until after I'm ok with my appearance)--the exception being maybe mascara/eyeliner in the future. The upper lip hair is where my biggest issue is. I won't use makeup, so I can't cover it up. And I refuse to shave/wax/pluck/whatever it because I fear it growing back darker (or thicker--point is, it'll *look* darker and more noticeable as personally experienced with my stomach hair). 

Sorry for the amount of text, but I'm at the point where I just don't know what to do about it anymore. Any suggestions on ways to bring out the more feminine side of my face? I'm not necessarily interested in specific products (different things work for different people--plus, I tend to prefer using more natural products where I can), but *types* (Ex: ""lotion"", ""cleanser"", etc.) are helpful since I'm fairly inexperienced with facial/skin care. Or just something in general that I can change, I don't know.

I tried to fit in as much background here as possible, but feel free to ask more questions in the comments if I left something out!

Apologies if there's a better subreddit for this.

t3_2561qm,"Thought Experiment: How to Achieve Equal Wages","This is a thought I've been playing with and I thought we could have an interesting (non-confrontational) discussion about it. This is also like my first post ever, so if I did this wrong... sorry. 


So, lets make a few assumptions that may or may not be true but I dont want to get bogged down in link-wars:

1. women and men without children in similar professions make about the same. 

2. women with children tend to make less than men in similar professions. 

3. women tend to choose lower paying jobs then men, including child care, teaching, nursing, elder care, etc. 

And these 3 factors account for the fact that on average, women make 75(ish)% of what men do. 


For now, I don't have a solution to the women-with-children-paid-less-than-men-with-children. There are a lot of factors here. 


So, in my beautiful, utopian philosophically-invented society, in order to achieve fair wages, it's not a question of MORE WOMAN ENGINEERS (or STEM high-paying-career of choice), because there are many women who are not interested in that. Most women, statistically speaking, want to be care-givers, to make the world better by helping other people. And that's a good thing. The world NEEDS that.


So the best way to achieve equal wages, to give women and men equal economic power, is to raise the wages of caregiver jobs. This means higher wages (and thus more jobs and better quality of worker) in:

Early childhood education and daycare

Elementary and Junior High

Nursing and nurses aids

Elder care

Human Resources

Minimum Wage Jobs (food/sales clerk, etc)



Basically, give Pink Collar jobs the respect and funding they deserve, which would in effect create a more nurturing, well developed society, with better adjusted and educated kids. This sounds awesome, especially in a time when a massive amount of people are going to retire and require more medical and elder care. 


The amazing thing is that this would be fairly easy to do (for a given definition of ""easy""). Many of these jobs are under the education and healthcare umbrella, who's wages are (at least in Canada, I know less about you wacky yankees), set by the government. Minimum wage, obviously also set by government. A few strokes of a pen and BAM, mission accomplished (after months and years of wrangling and a few scandals, of course).

I hate saying this story is a ""not me, it's for a friend!"" story but it is. Background: friend's younger and was scared of the judgement of buying plan b, so I offered to go with her or if she wants, I can just get it myself because it won't bother me at all. She asks if I can buy it myself and I obliged because I'm just buying some medicine, what's the worst that can happen?

I honestly didn't even think about people judging me because *I* knew it wasn't for me but when I couldn't find it and I had to ask a male worker, I saw the look of judgement on his face and realized exactly why my friend was reluctant to buy it.

I was getting dirty looks and second glances from kids my own age, middle aged adults, and old folks alike. I was mortified, which is ridiculous.

Why is bad that, for their perspective, a 17 year old girl doesn't want to have a child? Why should it be embarrassing that I'm trying to prevent a teenage pregnancy? Why is there a much bigger stigma around buying plan b as a girl than buying condoms as a guy? 

Maybe I'm just overthinking this but it was almost like a psychology experiment. What was their thought process? *that girl is so irresponsible for having sex in high school, she shouldn't be buying plan b, she should just have that child because she's so irresponsible!*

in the end, I don't regret buying it all. It was embarrassing at the time, but as soon as I walked out that door I remembered no one in that store matters at all. None of them know who I am. None of them know why I was buying it. Even if I was buying it for myself, none of them knew what led up to it.

When I brought this up as a teenager to my doctor and my step-mom whom I was living with at the time, they told me to suck it up and that it just wasn't that hard to take it, and that I was an idiot. (They were both awful people.) 

At first I was using the pill to regulate my periods, so missing a few days wasn't a huge deal, but eventually I started to become sexually active and I knew I couldn't be constantly worried about whether or not I was pregnant because I had missed a day (or three...). So when I moved out on my own I talked to my (new!) doctor about alternatives. I started on the Depo shot, which was amazing for the first while. I get the shot every three months and I usually only have one period a month, if at all. My periods are AWFUL so avoiding them entirely was a huge draw and I'm sad to have to go off of it.

But, I've gained a *lot* of weight and have been having other issues with it, so I need to try something else.

I know there has been drama here recently with becoming a default sub and I read the supposed gross out posts that people, correctly or incorrectly, thought were there to drive away new male visitors and as a honestly if reading about a woman's period is so traumatic for someone that they unsub, well they probably weren't mature enough to handle talking to you in a reasonable fashion and the sub will be better without them. I'm 30 years old and I stopped being grossed out by periods around the time I got my drivers license. 

Me personally I will be subscribing. Don't worry, I'll keep my comments to myself. I know this isn't a place where my voice needs to be heard and I will respect that and stick to read only behavior. I only made this post because, well I'll just say that today has been hard here in my real life. I found myself missing my mother pretty badly today. I needed cheered up and coming here and seeing your nice subreddit did that for me. So I'll just say thank you and take my leave. :-)  ",0,20140510034023,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_257aed,"Question about nausea while taking birth control?","I'm 22 and have been on and off the contraceptive pill for a few years now. I'm currently taking Femme-Tab ED 30/150 (which is a generic brand version of Microgynon 30 ED). The active ingredients are Ethinyloestradiol (30 microgram) and Levonorgestrel (150 microgram) in case that helps anybody. My question is regarding an ongoing feeling of nausea. I know this is a common symptom of birth control but I wanted to see how common it really is, especially since it's quite a recent symptom (read: last month or so, maximum) and I have not changed or started back up on the pill in that time. I guess I am trying to assess whether to attribute this queasiness to the pill or not. I was initially prescribed this version of the pill a few years ago as my mother took the same one for years (without side effects) so we tried that first up. As I never showed any negative side effects, I've been happy to keep using that brand. Is it possible/common to develop random side effects after a long period of time?

http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/24cffp/so_my_vagina_is_trying_to_kill_me/

After receiving so much support I wanted to touch base and let everyone who cares know how I'm doing just over a week after surgery.

The hysterectomy was scheduled to last two hours, but took more than twice as long as planned and I have a 10-inch incision from hip to hip, which is going to make for some badass battle scars for sure. 

I was slated to be in the hospital for 5 days, but was discharged after two. This isn't something women my age undergo very often (fortunately) and the nursing staff and doctors were astounded at how quickly I was able to get back on feet after such an invasive procedure. This has, however, been the longest week of my life. I've been in far less pain than expected but was unprepared for how tiring this would be. I've lost 12 lbs. and have been eating as often as I'm able. Literally every extra calorie my body is taking in is being used up for healing right now. 

Unfortunately, pathology came back revealing that the surgery failed to eradicate the cancer. Despite my PET scan and MRI having been perfect, it's spread to my lymph nodes. I will require radiation to try and stop it but it's extremely dangerous to irradiate healing tissue so we have to wait. My family has decided to fly me home this week, as soon as the staples, drains, and catheter come out, so I can spend some time at home recovering with them before starting the next phase of treatment. 

On a positive note, I've been forced to spend quality time with my mother. Life often get's in the way and while I see my family several times a year, I haven't had the chance to sit with my mother and talk, cry, and just hang out as much as I have over the last few weeks. While I imagine there are thousands of things she'd rather be doing for her Mother's Day, she'll be tending to me, laughing over spilled catheter bags, how bad I need to shave my legs, and watching me roll around in bed like a pill bug instead. 

This is my life now and I'm determined to enjoy my life. Since ignoring the cancer isn't a viable option, I will do whatever I need to do to beat it or die trying. Thank you all for your love and support.

(Edit/FYI - I have always gotten a yearly Pap. The nurse who performed this one originally advised that I was not due for a Pap for another 3 years. I insisted and if it hadn't been done, my oncologist assured me that there'd been nothing they could have done for me. Cervical cancer can be slow-moving...but that's relative and also not always the case. Mine is aggressive and Paps are not fool-proof. Get one yearly...just in case!",313,20140510115343,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_257ym2,"""You're so cute doing that!"" Anyone else get ""cuted"" when doing non-traditionally feminine things?","I'm not sure if I'm expressing this correctly, but it can sometimes be extremely patronizing. I wasn't really aware of how frequently it occurred until I was washing my car a couple days ago and my boyfriend goes, ""You're so cute washing that car!"" my original thought was, ""no... I'm just washing a car..."" Then I started realizing how frequently people will tell me that. For example, the lab coats are all too big ""haha that's cute"", try to argue a political point ""it's cute how you get defensive"". When my boyfriend does it it's fine because he does think I'm cute, but when other men do it; it really seems inappropriate.

Not sure what I'm looking for, maybe stories or validation? I understand that it's not meant in a malevolent manner, but it does make me feel disrespected when it happens. Any thoughts on this or a proper response? It's great people think I'm cute, but I'd rather not be cute and just be a co-worker or fellow student.

t3_257k1d,"Birth Control and You. What You Need to Know but Might Have Missed.","Way too often on reddit I see crazy things posted in relation to hormonal birth control. When you are prescribed it not many doctors will actually walk through what it is, what it does to your body, what's icky but completely normal, and what are giant fucking danger signs that you need to be on the look out for. Below are some things I commonly see, please add your own. 
  



 *Women who are on the pill and also use condoms who go out and get plan b if the condom breaks.* 

> [Plan B is basically a mega dose of progestin, which will prevent ovulation and hence conception if taken immediately after sex.](http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/plan-b) Assuming you are following the golden rules of birth control then plan b is just a waste of money and will screw up your cycle.  




 

*Women who think that they need to take the placebo pills/have withdrawal bleeding*
>The reason the placebos are in your birth control pack is that the creator of the pill thought that it would make birth control more [palatable to the Catholic Church. Seriously.](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/05/06/the-pill-and-the-invention-of-the-monthly-cycle/)  The simulation of a ""natural"" period isn't doing you any benefit. You may experience breakthrough bleeding if you stack pills, and any change can be unpredictable, but the option is there if you want to take it. 




**Golden rules of Birth Control**

*  Take your pill every day within as narrow a time frame as possible. If you miss one day, be safe and use other means of protection until you have 7 days of pills under your belt.   

* Don't take antibiotics, or other concoctions like St Johns Wort - Check whatever medicine you put in yourself for contraindications with hormonal birth control. When you do need antibiotics, tell your doctor what birth control you are on, and make sure it is safe. If in doubt, use backup protection.  
  
*  If you vomit after taking a pill, you need to take another, or again, take 7 days of pills while using backup protection. 

 

**What is birth control even doing?**

For oral birth control pills, it basically comes down to the [mini-pill \(Progestogen only pills, POPs\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestogen-only_pill) and the [combined oral contraceptive pills \(COCs\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill)

Progestogen only pills require you to take the pill within a very narrow time frame for optimal effectiveness. They do not contain estrogen, so can be great for people who experience whacked out side effects on COCs. They work by thickening your cervical mucus, so sperm is less likely to penetrate the fortress of your uterus. They also may inhibit ovulation and chill out the growth of cushy cells on the lining of your uterus for any egg to implant on. 

The classic pill, COCs, have a nice combined dose of estrogen and progestogen. It will stop you ovulating, as well as all the fun cervical mucus thickening progestogen brings to the table. The estrogen  may be able to help with other problems, like acne and crazy periods. Can noticeably effect your mood - please talk to your doctor about trying other pills if the one you are on makes you feel horrible. 

**DANGER ZONE**  

Pills have been studied extensively and they are very safe. However, very rarely birth control pills lead to serious problems. The following are the warning signals to watch out for while using the pill.

    Abdominal Pain (severe)
    Chest Pain (severe), cough, shortness of breath
    Headache (severe) with blurred vision, weakness, difficulty speaking
    Eye problems-vision loss or blurring
    Leg Pain (severe)

If you have one of these symptoms, it may or may not be related to the pill. It is important to check with your health care provider as soon as possible.

Blood clots are a rare but possible side effect of birth control. If you have a family history, you need to tell your doctor. If you're a smoker, you are safer on the POP than on the COC, but quitting smoking is the best remedy. Women have died from untreated blood clots, so make sure you check out any symptoms that might occur.

t3_2581nt,"(Off my chest) I'm really sick of people telling me I'm too young to know what I want.","I've known since I was 8 years old that I didn't want to have biological children. My logic then was ""if there are so many children that don't have parents, why would I want to bring another kid into the world when all these kids need someone to love them?""

My logic hasn't really changed greatly, and the reasons I don't want biological children have expanded and enumerated. I would have to go off antidepressants for up to over a year, which would kill both me and the baby, literally. That alone should be grounds for actually listening to me about this choice. My career field means I would have to take leave really early along, and that is just no, forever no. My career field (and my boyfriend's) also means I will never make enough money to support my pregnancy.

Don't get me wrong, I like kids. I currently work as a nanny while I get my degree, and it's the best and most rewarding job I've ever had. But pregnancy and birth? No thanks. I won't even babysit kids under the age of 3.

The only time I waver is, surprise!, when I'm ovulating. And I know it's solely hormonal, and once I think about being pregnant, my stomach turns. Nothing about being pregnant or being a mom to a newborn is appealing to me.

I'm 23. It's been 15 years I've known what I want from my babymaking parts, which is nothing. But no doctor will even discuss it with me, waving me off as ""oh you're young, you'll regret it.""

So?! If I regret it, *I* will regret it. It is *my* choice. It is *my* decision, and you, as my doctor should not let *your* conscience color your treatment of me. Stop telling me I don't know what I want, because I know exactly what I want. It's to the point that I have fantasized about threatening my doctor I'll go to Mexico to get sterilized. Which honestly sounds better that arguing with doctors up here.

If you're here just to comment and tell me the same things my doctors have, I'm sorry but you can just screw off. I know you didn't want kids and had a surprise baby and OMG you love being a mom. But you and I are different people. I might love being a mom, I probably will. But I never, ever, ever want to be pregnant and mother to a newborn. And I never, ever, ever want to have to deal with a surprise pregnancy that I will absolutely, without hesitation, abort.

If you're my age and managed to get a doctor to agree to sterilize you, tell me your secrets because I am friggin grasping at straws here. /rant

I know that's totally normal and I shrugged it off, but it never stopped, it just got heavier. I've had my period for 6 weeks now and it just keeps getting worse. I usually go through 2-3 regular tampons a day on my period and I just went through one in 20 minutes.

For the past few years, maybe now that I'm visibly not a ""child"" anymore, whenever I use ""ma'am"" or ""sir"" I get awful responses. Today I was at a dress fitting and two other women were there getting fittings as well. One asked if my dress was a bridesmaids dress and I responded immediately, with a smile ""Yes ma'am it is.""

They then went on about how I looked 17 (I'm 22) and just made me feel bad and uncomfortable for the entire fitting. 

Why is there a negative connotation with ""ma'am""? Why do we immediately feel the need to correct strangers by pointing out how young we are? Is this a habit I need to rid myself of?

t3_257s4s,"Troubled by a possible sexual assault incident with my ex-boyfriend (TW: sexual assault)","Hello, TwoXers. Serious post, with a trigger warning for sexual assault. It might be long, for which I apologise, though I sincerely appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it to the end. 

I'm a 17 year old girl (England, so the AoC is 16), and I broke up with my ex-boyfriend at the end of January this year. He is 19. I'm going to cut to the chase about it: I feel as though on more than one occasion my ex sexually assaulted me. On one occasion, it was ~3am and I was almost passed out with tiredness. He asked if he could sleep inside me. I was reluctant, knowing he would try and actively have sex with me if I said yes, but was too tired and too weary of his nagging to disagree. As predicted, he began to have sex with me. I began to cry. He asked if he should stop, and concerned that if I said ""yes"" he would confront me and try and keep me awake with emotionally manipulative jargon - he was a big fan of ""Why don't you want to have sex with me? Do you not find me attractive? Why don't you want me?"" and such kinds of rhetoric). As such, I muttered that he could continue. I quietly kept crying until at some point falling asleep. I can't remember when it ended - whether it was with him finishing, or me falling asleep. 

This was but one occasion. On another, I was already crying and upset, with lots of oral pain as a result of a tooth in need of a filling. He started attempting to seduce me, saying that if I had sex with him, I would feel better. Despite my tears and negative body language, he tried to have sex with me. I continued to cry. Eventually I was allowed to climb off of him. 

When I was ill with a chest infection/spells of vomiting in December, he came over for a couple of nights to look after me. Rather than looking after me, he spent the entire time complaining that I didn't want to have sex with him despite the fact that I was in immense pain and could barely move. At regular intervals he would try and kiss me, and then would finger me or try and perform oral sex upon me when I was simply trying to rest and watch something on Netflix.

There have been various other occasions. These are just the most distinct in my head. I felt entirely violated. At the time, I excused his behaviour, because he loved me, and he was my first boyfriend, and I knew no better. I stuck with him because I convinced myself, by way of low self-esstem, that he would be the only person who would ever love me - a ridiculous kind of teenage hyperbole, I know, and also untrue.

My concern is that I'm just seeing assault where it didn't occur, and that people would not take me seriously were I to confide in them whilst knowing contextually what our relationship was like.

Firstly, I'm relatively into kink pursuits and we did act-out rape roleplays from time to time. However, these were always consensual and the parameters were agreed upon beforehand. (Caveat: on one definite occasion, I distinctly remember he slapped me in the face during one such roleplay, despite a lack of my consent for such behaviour.) In this sense, I worry that both third parties and my boyfriend would think that I'm just being dramatic if ""that sort of stuff"" was what I was into anyway.

Secondly, I didn't actively and assertively say ""no"". On occasions there was a ""get off me"", at which point he usually did, but when I felt pressured into continuing (i.e., when I was tired and crying), I didn't say no. He thought it was acceptable to continue, because despite the fact that I felt completely violated, I said he could carry on. 

I don't know if I'm being completely unreasonable to feel abused. I have had nightmares about these events, and sporadic panic attacks. I feel humiliated and violated - on many occasions when I was with him, my body didn't feel like my own.

I don't know what to think or how to feel, and I would appreciate any light any of you lovely ladies could possibly shine upon this situation. If there's any information necessary to clarify anything, I will be most likely more than happy to provide it (unless it is very personal).

My mom is in her late 50's and hasn't had time to date while raising me. Now that I've been out of the house for a few years she is super lonely and wants a companion. My friend mentioned to me that she works with a guy my moms age who is super nice and we set them up to meet for coffee tomorrow. He has seen a face picture of her and knows she is plus-sized, but i'm super nervous because everyone has different ideas of what plus-sized is. 

She has survived cancer and has fibromyalgia, so her hair is shorter than the picture and she walks with a cane. She tends to clam up to people when she is nervous because she has social anxiety. He knows she has fibromyalgia and says he is familiar with it. She is really smart and quick when its just me and her but if she is nervous with other people she can seem a little slow in her responses. I'm scared that the guy is going to be rude or awkward cuz of that. 

He works in a big old folks home and she told me that she's afraid he will think she's like one of them, instead of a date. He is a little more ""hip"" than her, he has a phone that can text and he gets a  lot of current pop-culture and jokes, my mom, not so much. She is very liberal though. But she doesn't like ""rude humor"" like fart jokes and beer? (although she has this weird soft spot for Borat???) My friend assured me that he is easy-going and wouldn't walk out if the date was awkward. Can you give me any tips to give her? Maybe conversation keys, or good phrases?

She has lived all over the U.S. and it seems like he has too.  They are both in their 50's.

t3_258cr7,"A historical example of propaganda techniques and mass emotional manipulation of women","In 1929, a bunch of women marched down the Easter Sunday parade in New York, proudly holding cigarettes. This was heralded as a success of the feminist movement achieving their equalility with men by smoking in public.

But, there was propaganda and emotional manipulation of women going on in the background. The movement was called **Torches of freedom**.

Quoting from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom):

""Before the twentieth century, smoking was seen as a habit that was corrupt and inappropriate for women. [...] Women’s smoking was seen as immoral and some states tried to prevent women from smoking by enforcing laws. [...]""


""Cigarette companies began selectively advertising to women in the late 1920s. In 1928 [George Washington Hill](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Hill) the president of the American Tobacco Company, realized the potential market that could be found in women and said, “It will be like opening a gold mine right in our front yard.” [...]


""To expand the number of women smokers Hill decided to hire [Edward Bernays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays/), who today is known as the father of public relations, to help him recruit women smokers. Bernays decided to attempt to eliminate the social taboo of women smoking in public. He gained advice from psychoanalyst A. A. Brill stated that it was normal for women to smoke because of oral fixation and said, “Today the emancipation of women has suppressed many of their feminine desires. More women now do the same work as men do. Many women bear no children; those who do bear have fewer children. Feminine traits are masked. Cigarettes, which are equated with men, become torches of freedom.”

""In 1929 Bernays decided to pay women to smoke their “torches of freedom” as they walked in the Easter Sunday Parade in New York. This was a shock because until that time, women were only permitted to smoke in certain places such as in the privacy of their own homes. He was very careful when picking women to march because “while they should be good looking, they should not look too model-y” and he hired his own photographers to make sure that good pictures were taken and then published around the world. Feminist Ruth Hale also called for women to join in the march saying, “Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!” Once the footage was released, the campaign was being talked about everywhere, The women’s walk was seen as a protest for equality and sparked discussion throughout the nation and is still known today. The targeting of women in tobacco advertising led to higher rates of smoking among women. In 1923 women only purchased 5% of cigarettes sold, in 1929 it increased to 12%, in 1935 the percentage of cigarettes purchased by women was 18.1%, this percentage peaked in 1965 at 33.3% and remained at this level until 1977.""

t3_259230,"Reminder: Women can grow hair everywhere!","Whenever I read about body-hair positivity, it's often about women having the choice to not shave the most common parts of the body that grow hair after puberty (armpits, legs, vulva). I'm supportive of these choices, being that I am a hairy girl myself, but what I find is that there is usually a disregard for the other parts of the body that can, and do, grow hair. This has made it difficult for me to feel that I can fully relate to this type of support.

My mother is Russian and my dad is Syrian, which means that my dark hair contrasts greatly with my white skin. I’ve been insecure about how I look underneath clothes, because I’d always felt that my body was deceitful. It gives off one impression when I’m clothed, but once my shirt comes off, I thought I became significantly less attractive. It's always seemed that even if someone understands that there are women who do not shave their legs/armpits/vulva, they would still not expect there to be hair anywhere else. This has prevented me from trying to get intimate with others, because I've felt that no one would be able to look past my hair.

For those of you who may have light or unnoticeable body hair, ""dealing"" with body hair everywhere is not as easy as it sounds. I will use myself as an example.

Think about it like this: I have hair literally everywhere on my body. Obviously, some places are darker than others, but if you name a part of my external body, there is hair there, and it is usually at least noticeable. Let's say I were to start off with getting all the hair on my back removed. Gone forever. And it probably looks and feels nice. What about the rest of my body, though? Now there are clear separations between my hairy and hairless body parts. It would kind of look like if you shaved half of your stomach. It would look dumb and weirder than having a hairy stomach. You either shave the whole thing or leave it hairy. I'm choosing to leave it hairy, because my skin gets terrible when I shave, but also because I am very lazy haha.

I’ve been learning to accept my body in its natural state, and accept that there are people who can like this body, but whenever I look online, I still have trouble finding hardcore body-hair positive posts. In fact, I really don't think I've read a single one. I've posted NSFW images of myself, and more often than not, there are people who are surprised that I have hair in the places that I do. This saddens me, and I hope to remind people that hair grows on every part of the body, not just the ones most commonly spoken about!

I mostly wanted to write this to show my support to women with hair that is noticeable on every part of their bodies, because when I was younger, I didn’t have anyone tell me that I can still be attractive and hairy, and so I didn't think I could be. Every girl or woman with the same situation I have had should know that she is still beautiful, and she that shouldn’t let body hair hold her back from being confident! I really, really do hope this helps some ladies feel more comfortable, body hair or not!

t3_258ul4,"[Rant] Sex Ed","I'm taking a required health class in my school  and I'm fairly distraught. I know I'm only sixteen, but I feel strongly about this. 

We've had three guest speakers come in to class so far this semester. Every single one of them preached the same thing, abstinence. We have never once gone over birth control or safe sex with our teachers or speakers in my high school career. This most recent speaker irked me the most. 

She told us that if a teenage girl has sex, that she will probably get cervical cancer. Most of them do, according to her. Condoms aren't effective, and they don't protect anyone from STDs or pregnancy at all. (I understand that they're not 100% effective, and nothing really is. But they're not useless.) They ""trick"" you into thinking you're safe. She didn't acknowledge oral BC or any other contraceptives. 

According to her, people that have sex before marriage are generally ""users and losers."" Essentially, if premarital sex makes you a bad person. If you marry a non-virgin, they will likely have an STD, which can (and likely will) kill you and your baby you'll be popping out soon. 

Having sex with more than one person makes you unable to love somebody. You lose the ability to love someone. It's compared to duct tape, you ""lose your adhesive."" She ripped duct tape off of a student's arm to demonstrate. 

I called her out on the premarital sex making you a loser, and pointed out that I had no plans of marriage. She got really upset and started yelling, most of it directed at another kid that asked a question and I. She said she was just helping us not ruin our lives. 

I'm very frustrated with how everything was handled. At the end of the presentation, she reassured us that this wasn't a scare tactic; everything said was true.

t3_258osi,"Reflections on losing my mother at 15, for Mother's Day","My mother died when I was 15, quite unexpectedly.  Sunday, we were shopping, and on Friday, we accepted there was no longer a sentient being inside her body, and took her off lifesupport.  in between, she lay in a bed in the ICU with a tube down her throat, so we never really got to ""say goodbye"".

When you lose your mother as a child, what everyone is concerned with is the remainder of your childhood, and the missed milestones: graduation, wedding, having children of your own, and the like.  But, now that I have been motherless nearly half my life, I realize that those things were not actually the biggest tragedy.  Yes, I wish my mom would've been there to support me through my first finals, and sit in the front row at orchestra concerts, and help me pick a college.  Yes, I missed her when I got married, and wish she could have met my husband.  Now, though, my perspective has helped me realize:  The bigger tragedies are the disconnect from my origins, and the fact I will never really know her.

I feel like I am missing so much context for my childhood, and there is no one to tell me the stories.  I don't know when I took my first steps, or what the circumstances were.  I never thought to ask when she was alive, and my dad doesn't know.  There is a picture of me as a toddler, dressed as a clown, standing full-on to the camera, grinning widely.  In the background, on her knees, is my mother with her forehead in her hands, and a huge exasperated smile on her face.  I want to know more about this picture.  Was it halloween? What had I done to cause her to look like that?  There are so many questions about my own past and my family's that I can no longer get answers to.

I will never know her as a fully-realized person: only as a mother, and through the lens of beatification accorded to the dead.  I want to know her stories, and what she hoped and wished for outside of her role as a wife and mother.  After she died, we found a box on the top shelf of her closet, filled with clippings of pictures and stories of ""someday"" dreams -- a super-modern house (in contrast to the rambly old house I grew up in), travels to exotic locations, recipes clipped that my father would *never* have eaten.  And looking through the box, I realized that my mother was a stranger to me -- a list of bullet points of likes: Mystery novels, quilting, baking, chocolate, children.  But that is a caricature, not a portrait of a real person.  I want to know about her own teenage years, and the struggles she went through in her life but that will always be a closed book.  In my dad's eyes, she is perfect; they had a perfect marriage.  She was always happy and there were never problems.  I know the reality is more complicated than that, and I wish I could ask her about it.

I did not have my mom to look after me for my few remaining years in the house, and that was sad, but it is over.  I did not have my mom when I graduated, or got married, and that was sad, but those events are over.  But everyday, for the rest of my life, there is an empty space where an adult relationship with her would have been.  From that hole, a thousand unanswered questions fracture like spiderwebs across my life.

Those of you whose mothers are still living, and you have good relationships, appreciate it.  Tomorrow, tell your mom you love her, for those of us that cannot.",64,20140510180415,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Honestly, I just need to get this off my chest and it may seem kind of insignificant to even make a post about it. But I just finished my second year of uni, and I don't think that college is or will be my prime/""best time of my life"". 

The odds were against me from the start. I go to college in my hometown and still live at home and will continue to due to financial reasons. There was never that ""Oooo new city, new me"" feeling. Trust me I've made the best of it and tried to make it as new and exciting as humanly possible and at times it was. But at the end of the day I look back and go, ""Meh, it wasn't that special"".

I have met some really great people who I think are admirable and entertaining to be around andchill with, but I don't ever feel close enough to them to take the friendship step. I also got burned a lot freshman year by kids using me for my car in exchange for what I thought was friendship. So needless to say I have no ""besties"" male or female.

I don't know what to do. I have been having the worst period of my life for three weeks. I have contacted both Planned Parenthood and my normal doctor's assistant (my actual primary care provider is unavailable for weeks) and they have both given me vague answers. I've started taking the minipill on my period but this period has lasted for two weeks, bringing the total duration of this period to three weeks. I'm an otherwise healthy 24-year-old female, not underweight or overweight. The longest period I ever had prior to this was seven days long. I haven't had spotting since I was sixteen years old. I have never been pregnant.

I started taking the progestin-only pill when I had a slightly long but not terrible period. I'd been bleeding pretty normally for seven days and my period was, I think, coming to an end when I started on the minipill. I was prescribed this pill at Planned Parenthood. I can't take estrogen-only pills because I am prone to severe and frequent migraines. Implants are also advised against because of the migraines. When I asked about possible side effects of this drug, I was only told that ""you may see some spotting or breakthrough bleeding for the first three months. It's rarely a problem.""

I have been bleeding heavily for the last two weeks. My period has now lasted for 21 days. I am miserable and terrified. I called Planned Parenthood after I had been on my period for ten days because I was already frightened. The woman I spoke to on the phone was dismissive. She again told me that ""some spotting may happen in the first three months."" I asked how long I should expect to be bleeding. She repeated her previous statement.

I went to my primary care provider's office a week ago, when my period had lasted for fourteen days. My usual doctor isn't available, so I saw a doctor I've never seen before. She was more polite but also gave me no clear answer. I asked at what point should I contact her and/or Planned Parenthood again. I told her (as calmly as I could) that I'm scared and in a lot of pain. She gave me the same answer about ""spotting"" and ""breakthrough bleeding"" with no suggestion about when to get back in touch with her.

I'm scared and I feel like I have nowhere to turn for help. I've searched webmd, wikipedia and this sub. The only suggestion I've found is from the NIH (National Institute of Health) that says I should contact my doctor immediately if I have ""bleeding that lasts a long time."" I think that I was bleeding for ""a long time"" a week ago - at this point, I'm past thinking that this is ""bleeding for a long time"" so much as ""bleeding for what I think is an intolerable length of time."" I want to stop taking this pill even though Planned Parenthood told me to ""stick it out for three months if all you see is spotting."" I want to stop taking this because I'm miserable and scared. No one I've talked to addresses my fears. I was refused a pelvic exam even though I asked for one at my doctor's office. Has anyone experienced symptoms like this on the minipill? Has anyone stopped birth control abruptly and if so, was it as bad at Planned Parenthood made it sound? If anyone here has medical experience, will I put myself in more danger if I stop this pill right now? 

I'm sorry for posting another birth control question on this sub; I know you see a lot of them. I've read through the latest posts and searched for related cases but haven't been able to find anything. I feel like if I contact my doctors again they will continue to be dismissive and I'm in a lot of pain, frightened and alone. This isn't related to my medical problem, but my SO (the reason I started taking this awful drug) has stopped talking to me. I don't know why he's ignoring me but he did say that he thinks I'm lying about how long this period has lasted. My best guess is that he thinks I'm cheating on him but hiding behind a fake period. I have never cheated on him or anyone else. I hate this pill and what it is doing to my life.

TL;DR - Took minipill at the end of a seven-day period. Was told about ""spotting"" and ""breakthrough bleeding"" but never warned about the possibility of a continuous period that lasts for multiple weeks. I am having the worst period of my life and it has now lasted for 21 days. Doctors won't answer me. I'm scared and want to stop.",5,20140510172554,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_259xof,"I have no friends here... I'm lonely.","Hello TwoX,

This probably isn't the best place to make this post, but I would like some advice. I'm sorry if this is long!

I'm a woman in my mid twenties. I moved to another state about 4 years ago now, and I have no friends here. Not even male ones. I've always had some difficulty making female friends. It's cliche, but guys were just easier, with the exception that most of them want(ed) to get in my pants.

I do have some close relationships, but they're all long distance now. Only one of them is a woman.

I know everyone says to pick up a hobby or something, well I would love to but I cannot afford it at this moment. I am in the process of finding a new job (I really hate not having a job). This is a stress in my relationship with my boyfriend. He says I'm not interested in making friends, which isn't true! (Also, I find that hypocritical because its not like he's some social butterfly) So he feels like he has to be with me all the time, which I've tried to tell him I don't need him around all the time. I really don't. It's nice when hes here since he is my only ""real"" human contact, but I grew up in a solitary environment, I'm used to it. He just doesn't believe me.

There were two women I was trying to cultivate friends with, I thought I had succeeded, except now one of them doesn't respond to me (we used to have game nights as couples) and I don't have a clue why. The other... some stupid drama over not returning a game my boyfriend and I let her borrow. Besides that, she's too wrapped up in the rest of her life, which I understand.

I am lonely though. I want to be able to get out of the house and have fun with some people too. I find it hard to connect with many women my age, because they all seemed concerned with engagement/marriage/babies. I know not ALL women are like that of course (I have no interest in children as an example) but it just makes it so hard to connect with them, because those are major life transitions that we couldn't bond over.

Has anyone had similar problems? Is there any advice other than ""get an outside hobby!"" Believe me, I'm not a shut in by choice. Funds and lack of people is mainly why I am always home. I like to go walk in the park, and I go work out but these aren't really activities to find friends with, unfortunately.

Any advice would be appreciated!",33,20140511072642,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_259eup,"""It wasn't your fault, but you could have prevented it.""","Hey there TwoX. I need some advice. I'm tired of talking about this in person to anyone - strangers on the internet seems so much more appealing to me as I am worn the fuck out from social interaction. 

I was raped in October. I went to a friend's house, and he had sex with me against my will, knowing that I didn't want to. This really fucked me up. I'd only been with my boyfriend before that - I'd given him my virginity when I started to rebel against my conservative upbringing and we just happened to stay together. Suddenly, I wanted to have sex with a million people. I wanted to have a choice. I wanted to be free from God, from my boyfriend, from anyone telling me ""No you can't have sex"" and I wanted a choice because I had had my choice taken from me that night. 

So I asked my boyfriend for a threesome, for a girlfriend. He said no. I showed up at the peak of my mental ill health with sliced up wrists and said it was eating me alive. He said something ambiguous. I took it as permission. I had sex with someone else. 

Later, I realized he had not given me permission. Well fuck. This tore me up, too. 

He ended up finding out. He said I was lucky that he didn't leave me. That I was naive for going over to my friend's in October, and if I hadn' t been there, I would never have been raped. That it wasn't my fault, but at the same time, it was. That I could have prevented it. That it was hard to support me, because he had a hard time looking at me the same. Etc. Etc. Also, I had had sex with him a week after the incident - it was his birthday, I felt like I should, - and afterwards, he said I was cold and emotionless. He said sorry later, but that still bothers me. 

I feel pretty unhappy. There is truth to his statement. DUH. Of course had I not been present, I wouldn't have been raped. But..... But..... I don't know. I feel like these ideas are.... Bad. I don't want to break up with him, but I don't know if these are healthy ideas. If they are good. 

They hurt me. 

But.... they say truth hurts, no?",8,20140511000101,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_259np3,"I don't know if I was raped or not (Trigger Warning)","A couple days ago, I had a nightmare about my ex-boyfriend trying to rape me. It was terrifying and in the dream, I was screaming for him to get out of my room and leave me alone. This made me reflect on our relationship and realize how unhealthy it was, and how towards the end, something that happened could or could not be classified as rape.

Even the first night that we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, he tried to initiate sex with me and when he was trying to make out with me, I kept pushing him off but he still kept trying to kiss me. He eventually started taking my pants off and going down on me but it was so awful and uncomfortable that I told him to stop. He did and I started crying, he said he was sorry.

I used to wake up to him feeling my breasts while I was asleep and feel really violated by the fact that he was touching me without my consent, because I was sleeping. But I never said anything. He also used to jack off in bed while watching porn on his phone while I was sleeping. Technically not a violation of my body, but just something that made me uncomfortable.

He was always groping my breasts and butt in public when nobody was looking. I told him to stop, but he never took it seriously. I honestly didn't know what to do or say because I felt like if I complained about it, people would probably just say, ""Well, you're his girlfriend..."" but I still felt violated.

We broke up because he yelled and screamed at me for the fact that we hadn't had sex after being boyfriend and girlfriend for two months. The way that he was acting me was really scary, the way he was yelling at me. He also started yelling at me and saying that we wouldn't have this problem if I wasn't so awful at blowjobs. I dumped him after that. He begged me for me to take him back, said he would change. I believed him and took him back. 

 We started having sex after we got back together. One day, he was on top of me and doing it from behind. I was bored and not into it so after maybe about 15 minutes, I tell him to stop and that I don't want to do it anymore.

He stops and gets off of me. He starts jacking off and I try to help him by jerking him off, as well. Then after about five minutes, he said, ""Turn around."" I didn't know why he wanted me to turn around but I did it. and he started penetrating me for a couple of minutes before he came inside me. I froze because I didn't even know what to do or say. 

I said, ""I told you I didn't want to do it..."" and he said, ""Whoa...I'm sorry..."" I just ran out of the room and went to sleep because I wanted to pretend like it didn't happen. 

I'm really inclined to say that I wasn't raped because one, I literally hadn't even remembered that this happened and also, I technically had consented at first. But this whole experience just doesn't sit right with me. Truthfully, it felt as if our whole relationship, I was just a sex object to him. 

I don't know what to do. Maybe I was raped and just have blocked it out of my head because I didn't want to think about it. Maybe I'm exaggerating the situation. I talked to my best friend about it, she's the only person who knows. She gave me what I think is pretty good advice which is that I have to decide for myself what I think happened and then proceed on how to deal with it. 

I guess that's true. I just feel really awful and confused.

One school morning, I woke up, and I went to wake her up and she was gone.  She died the night before of a heart attack, at the age of 38.  Everything after that was a blur of funerals, custody discussions, and moving.  In the move, a lot of my mother's things and my things were lost or misplaced.  This past Fall, I was cleaning out some boxes, and found my baby book.  It was one of the best days of my life.  My mother had written down the story of her pregnancy and my birth.  It was as if she knew she wouldn't be here to tell me the story.  I just wish I remembered what she sounded like, so that I could hear it in her voice.  

Upon hearing my heartbeat for the first time:  ""I believe that moment was the single most exciting in my life.  All of a sudden you were very real.""

My dad ""helping"" during labor:  ""They hooked me me up to the fetal monitor so they could graph out the contractions and monitor your heartbeat. Dad sat beside me holding my hand and giving me a play-by-play on my labor pains.  The stronger a contraction was the higher the reading.  He would say, 'That was only a 28, it couldn't have hurt too badly.  That was a 42!  You probably felt that one!'""

When I wouldn't cooperate: ""Doctors arrived and it was decided that an ultrasound was in order.  That was the first time I saw you!  I was so thrilled, I didn't even notice the look of concern on the doctor's faces.  The doctor explained the situation.  You were in a foot down breech position which would be a difficult and dangerous delivery.  This was the first time I felt scared during the entire morning, and looking at Dad I could tell he was too.""

On my birth:  ""You arrived at 12:57pm.  A beautiful and healthy GIRL!""

I miss my mother every day.  On my wedding day, it was particularly hard, but it really is every day.  On this Mother's Day, I wanted to share my story, and maybe connect with other women for whom mother's day is also bittersweet.

I have been dealing with the trauma of this event for the past two years. I filed a police report and nothing happened. I have decided to speak out about this because I am still suffering, and have had no closure. I still have triggers, I still have problems with sex. This is my story. This is my closure. Hopefully I have posted in the right place...

This guy sat down and was talking to my friend and me at a party. Eventually we left for the club. Originally, a bunch of people were going to go, but that didn’t happen. Several minors came to the party and they divided the group, so it was just me, the guy, and my friend going to the club. I didn’t suspect anything at the time, because I was under the impression that my friend and he were good friends. We arrived, and went over to a couch while he went to get us drinks. We were talking for a bit and I drank my drink, and then went to the dance floor. He was dancing up on me a lot. I don't know how long we were dancing for... I realized that I had been falling over almost, and that he was holding me up. I couldn't even walk without his support for a while. It felt like it had been a long time. Some more time passed and we went down the stairs to go back to the car...I barely remember getting in the car. Time went quick. We went back to the guys’ apartment again for a while. I remember looking in the mirror in their bathroom...walking to a bedroom. I fell asleep or passed out on the bed for a little while. I feel like I must have been drugged because I have NEVER been that inebriated and disabled from alcohol. I was slurring something and woke up with him there at my side. My friend came in and said we were going. He followed..I wondered why, but assumed he was just catching a ride to his home. He said something about needing to be in another town that morning for work and that it would be more convenient to catch a ride at night than to leave and get there from the party location the next morning. My logic and thinking was incredibly cloudy. The ride back to my friend’s apartment was a complete blur. I remember him kissing me at certain points. My friend was assuming this was all normal. Somehow we were then in the apartment parking lot and he was still there. This confused me and I felt upset and wierded out from it. Unfortunately, I had trusted all along that since he was a friend of a friend, there was no threat. Then we were in the apartment living room and he was going to sleep on the couch in the living room. I planned to sleep with my friend in her bedroom. I vaguely thought I'd say goodnight before heading to sleep with my friend. He kissed me, and I told him we were not going to have sex. I still felt really out of it, and just wanted to make it a quick goodnight and then go to my friend’s room. The whole time I was questioning why he was staying at our apartment in the first place. The next thing I know, he was down there, pulling off my pants, then going down on me and thrusting his fingers in me, asking me if I liked it.  I was completely out of it. Then my pants were off completely and he had taken his penis out and put my hand on it. I don’t know if I put my mouth on him or not. I remember him being on the couch at one point, and me being kneeled there beside him. I would suddenly and realize his penis was about to go inside me. I'd grab him and push him away. He would grab the base of his dick and pull his penis away from my hand, then move his penis down again pushing my hands away, as he was trying to penetrate. I said, “No, I don’t want to. I don’t want to have sex,” but I was so out of it, and struggling to do anything. Suddenly, I had felt the head of his penis touch the opening of my vagina, starting to penetrate. I grabbed his penis quickly, keeping his penis from penetrating or touching me again. I would realize I was successfully escaping from everything, pulling my pants back on and putting my socks on even. Quicker still, he would pull them all off again and I would be putting his mouth on me or his hands inside me. He asked me to call him Papi. I felt so disgusted but I couldn’t even move. After so many times of him trying, he finally started to give up, complaining about how I had lead him on, and I how I was a tease. I had been fighting him off the whole time while barely conscious! He was very persistent. I remember falling asleep just barely on the couch, thinking it might be over. He would pull my arm, pull me off the couch all together, or pull at my legs, begging me to sleep or snuggle with him. I kept fighting him off. I realized I’d been trying to fight him off for a few hours. Finally he slept and the snoring kept me up. In the morning I had a sinking feeling. My friend slept in, and he kept sleeping too. When he woke up, I wanted him to leave but he kept making stupid excuses for why he couldn’t leave yet. My friend finally woke up, and we got him to leave.

Frankly, he was terrible and I was blamed for his sloppy work. I felt weird reprimanding him (which is a whole other issue). I had hired him because after we originally worked together he was hired onto a great show, making insane money.


A few months later, I ask for his resume to forward on to something he would be good at. I was so shocked to see
how he described his work on my show. He took credit for way more than he did! And he used such strong language to describe his roles. Where I would have said ""assisted the production team"", he wrote ""produced"". I felt like a fool for years of not writing strong language in my resume where less deserving people like Brad were out there getting calls for great jobs because...I mean even though I was his boss and worked on this for two years, the way he wrote his resume, he was the clear better hire.


I cant blame him because hes just doing his best to get work but damn if that isnt frustrating.

I live in a pretty nice condo building that's close by to a school. A lot of Saudi students live here as well. I've noticed a lot of them being obnoxious/rowdy like typical college students before, but it's usually pretty tame. The exception is that one of this group had been arrested a few months back for raping a female student at the university they all attend. 

Yesterday I was waiting to go downstairs when the elevator showed up, with 8 or 9 Saudi guys in their twenties on it. At first, no one would move to let me on, until finally one of them did while the rest snickered and chattered in Arabic. Eventually one of them started trying to talk to me in English and when we got off the elevator began following me out asking me if I'd ever thought about what it'd be like to be with 8 arab men while his friends laughed and egged him on. I mumbled whatever and walked away and that was the end of it.

I get that this isn't a huge deal and it definitely isn't something that should bother me this much, but now I'm really anxious about running into them again in the building and even more stressed that it will be when I'm with my husband who was ready to go looking for them yesterday. I feel like I should at least tell the building management about this in case they've bothered other people. I'm not sure why I feel like I'm making a bigger deal of this than it really needs to be. I've had other guys do similar things, but for some reason this felt really predatory and all the previous times were when I was in a public place I could get away from.

In the near three years he and I have been apart, I would say he has spent a cumulative total of about a solid 10 days of time with her. We live in the same city, I have told him multiple times I would take her to see him any time he wished. 

I've received a total of 120$ in child support from him in the last (almost) three years. Half the time when he is watching her, I will get a call and have to leave work or school to go get her because ""He doesn't want to deal with her anymore."" He did this again yesterday and I snapped and went off on him (Not in front of our kid, I never talk crap about him around her). He basically told me, not exaggerating, ""You should just marry your boyfriend and have him adopt her if you think I'm such a bad dad."" I asked him (because I was curious and shocked) ""Are you saying you would relinquish your parental rights?"" and he said ""Yep.""

My ex husband is not dangerous, he's just lazy. He's expressed to me several times about how sometimes he just wants to be done with ""all of this."" Still, he won't actively try and relinquish his rights, he was just saying that if I perused it, he would not stop me. 

I'm getting a lot of conflicting advice from a lot of people. I don't want to be the reason my daughter doesn't know her dad. I also don't want him to keep jerking her around and hurting her. If he did give up his rights, she would miss him very much for some time, but eventually, she might start healing.

First of all, what do you think? Is this a thing? Do women often wait instead of going to the bathroom immediately? And secondly, my theory is that women have to pee more than men, (because we have smaller bladders maybe??) and so to prevent spending *way* too much time on the toilet, we just hold it more often. Does this seem true?

I just want to let my boyfriend know that it's OK if I don't rush to the toilet every time I have the slightest sensation of a partially full bladder.

But I'm open to anything! Let's discuss peeing!",4,20140511135342,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25algi,"2 months of Pain, possible Endometriosis, Cysts, weird Periods and 4 Gynos...","First off, I just married last year and I wish to have children if possible soon. Also I moved from Germany to the Caribbean last year.
I do have some diseases, like Absence Epilepsy, Asthma, Allergies, Tremors, Hypothyroid and have had Meningitis when i was 5 years old. I do take medication for those, though I don't take anything for my Epilepsy anymore since 3 years.
So I'm already not in a very good shape I'd say, I know that and I'm already trying everything to get better in any possible way I could.

So all this started I guess a few months back, beginning of January I didn't have my period anymore and I was a bit freaked out by it.
The months before that were already weird, as in only spotting and no real period. I do take the pill though and i knew that those things could happen from time to time.
Though, a bit more than 2 months ago I had a sharp pain on my right lower abdomen and it increased over 2 days. 
So I decided to go to a gynecologist right away.
The doctor used ultrasound to check and said the only problem she sees is that the bladder seems always full and I'd need antibiotics for a bladder infection. 
As soon as I took the antibiotics it got very bad, I couldn't even get up anymore from the bed or chair and the pain seemed to increase from day to day. After one week it got tiny bit better for a day or two. 
Then I had my period, which was unbearable and I didn't see much blood, but instead there was a lot of brown stringy stuff coming out. Right after my period it got better again and the whole pain started back with my ovulation, where the brown stuff came back with the sharp dull pain. 

I decided another visit by another gyno would be a good decision. Since the ""bladder infection"" never felt like one, there was never any burning when I had to pee. All it was, was that I had to pee all the time and whenever I used the bladder every organ around it hurt like a bitch.

So the next gyno checked also with ultrasound, he told me the right Fallopian-Tube was full with tissue, which might be scars and it's very swollen. So he said it's PID and gave me 2 very aggressive antibiotics for 10 days. So it was another 2 weeks of no energy and a lot of pain. Then my period was gonna happen again. I had cramps and pain and nearly fainted sometimes from it. The blood wasn't there again, but even more stringy brown stuff. Right after my period it got much better again, though the pain stayed. Another week of antibiotics followed. Which was my 4th and 5th antibiotics in 2 months now. I didn't help.

Another gyno I went to, said it's only stress and he didn't check on anything. Sooo 4th gyno after 2 month, she checked and said there's absolutely no swelling, not tissues and only 2 cysts on my right ovary. Though, those cysts weren't there just a few weeks ago. And I also couldn't see any empty and normal Fallopian-Tube on the screen like she told me. I felt the swelling and the pain just like the whole time. Both of them said it could be Endometriosis, though they aren't sure at all and it would only be visible if a surgeon used laparoscopy. 

After all this, I decided to go back to Germany in a week or two, to finally have a real result of all this. I can't take this pain, the waiting on a final result and depression I get from this. So my questions here are, does this sound familiar in any way to you? or do you think it's something completley different? What would you do in my position?


***td lr*:  Pain, discomfort, no periods to painful periods with stringy brown stuff for over 2 months. Five different antibiotics and four different gynos. Possible Endometriosis and 2 cysts on my right ovary. No real results and still in pain.**",0,20140511130057,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25a0uy,"So, I keep getting BAD menstrual-esque cramps when exercising. Does anybody else experience this? Should I be worried?","Sorry if this isn't the right sorta thing for this subreddit!  I couldn't find a more general health advice one and I figured this is pretty female-specific.

Basically what it says in the title - I find myself getting moderate to severe cramps that are literally exactly like period cramps - same place, same sensation etc - but regardless of where I am in my cycle.  This usually happens when I'm doing cardio in an upright position (e.g. running/on an elliptical), not so much if I'm cycling or doing weights-y stuff.  They can be REALLY bad.  A few times I've had to stop and sit/crouch down and just wait for them to subside before I can physically do anything.  However they always go away after about 10 minutes and then I feel right as rain again.

I have no idea how common this is, I've told both my closest female friends and they have never experienced it. I also don't know if its anything to be concerned about.  Interestingly, I came off the pill a few months ago and I feel like its been a more prevalent problem since then, although I've definitely experienced it when I've been on it as well.

Any advice/wisdom/shared experiences would be awesome!  If it sounds like something I should see a doctor about that would be cool to know (I'm only not doing it already as the wait times for an appointment are RIDICULOUS right now and the drop-in clinics are always rushed).

You can read the whole story [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/21r7sp/how_to_tell_someone_you_have_no_dating_experience/) He was pretty awesome about it. Last night, we hung out with two mutual friends at their house and I realized that he never tries to touch me or even invade my personal space. I make an effort to do those things to show I'm interested in him, even though I'm not sure what the hell I'm doing.

At the end of the night we walk outside and he says we had set a precedent to kiss at the end of dates (he was just joking). I was kind of taken off guard though because he seemed so uninterested earlier. I'm also unused to kissing people and find it very awkward. At our last date I used a bet with my sister as impetus to kiss him. As in I told him ""hey come here and help me win a bet."" He didn't respond to that so I figured he hadn't heard me. But of course he brought it up last night. And I felt kind of like an asshole. I'm not in lust with this boy (I'm not sure if it's because that's all out of my realm of experience or what), but I do like him.

My questions are: any suggestions for getting over this whole lack of PDA in general and how do I become more comfortable with kissing?

In pre-ACA days, I remember asking my insurance provider for a list of what birth control they covered. Nope, they don't have that and wouldn't provide it. I had to research what was out there, then contact them to see if it was covered. If it was a name brand and not generic then I was paying more or they wouldn't cover at all.

To start off, I'll tell you now that is about sex.  I've always been pretty cautious about sex, because I have been assaulted in the past, several times.  I finally found a man that I can feel comfortable with, and it's amazing and everything is great.  I've also had a few abusive relationships, and this relationship is nothing like those at all, ever.  He's so sweet and kind and works with me when I have flashbacks and nightmares.  We want to get married in the next few years.  Everything is great.  

A few months ago, we bought a vibrator to use together, just to shake it up a little bit.  It's been great, again, but then something happened about a week ago.

We went to a sex shop, and I bought another vibrator.  He bought a pocket pussy.  That's the part I feel uncomfortable about.  I know I shouldn't be uncomfortable about him using a toy when I have my own, but I am.  I told him this and he said that it didn't matter, and that I was being rediculous.

I feel like I am being stupid, but I just..  If he ever said that he felt uncomfortable with me using a vibrator, I would get rid of it right away.  But when I say that I feel like that, it's just nothing.  It's giving me horrible anxiety just thinking about it, too.  Like, panic attack level.  I just feel like my words and my opinion doesn't matter, just like I felt when I was in a past abusive relationship.

What can I do?  Do I just suck it up and drop it?  Am I really being rediculous or stupid?... Please help me, ladies, I feel like I'm going nuts! :(

Thank you for your replies.  I understand what you're saying, and I really appreciate your responses.

We called 911, but when they got there they were not very understanding and unsure of what we wanted their help with, so I told them, he is not himself, he needs to see a doctor.  Finally, he said that he would come with the paramedics, so we all walked out of the bedroom (me, two paramedics, and a cop) when he slammed the bedroom door and shot himself.

God only knows how many school demerits and failed tests of mine she was forced to put that same signature on or how many times I tried to forge it.

She was, by no means, meek or shy, but the filigree of her finely-wrought frame, genteel demeanor, and her angelic soprano voice were a stark contrast to the clumsy, booming impenitence of her younger daughter. Especially when I was little, people never quite believed we were related, and, as I grew rougher around the edges and endlessly stubborn, it also became very hard for us to see eye to eye, especially about my desire to become a musician.

She was a braver woman than I could really understand when I was a teen. She looked death in the face with tireless compassion during her days as a hospice nurse. She studied forensics and law ravenously and became a PI to help protect those in danger and right the wrongs of the world around her in the best way she could. Even at that age, I couldn't help but think she deserved her name to be carved into the face of the earth, that her soft voice and her dainty wrists couldn't do her own story justice.

The last time I saw her, I was 18 years old. She had never heard any song I'd written before and she was perched upright on a terrible foraged sofa in my dilapidated shack, with impeccable posture, a glass of red wine, and a look on her face that read, ""Allll right, Lily. Let's see what it is, exactly, you've thrown your college education away for.""

I played her a song, a song about how I wished people would stop trying to ""fix"" me. I was so terrified, I could barely bring myself to look at her while I ham-fistedly beat out my very primitive rhythms and wailed in a tone I knew she'd never heard from me before. When I finally looked to her, I saw her posture had broken and her eyes were full of tears. 

She came to me and said, ""there *is* nothing to fix."" She said that, this time, she truly heard my voice and finally understood why I had never quite fit into the life she saw for me. She said that she knew, then, the life she wanted for *herself* was one in which she got to hear me sing, just like that, always, in a way she never could.

It was was through her acceptance, and her devastating passing, I realized how wrong I had been about her. Her voice, while different than mine, held a magic I could only hope to, one day, attain. Her story never *was* in danger of being lost. Her charm, her grace, her unstoppable wit, and her flare for performance had never even left *this* realm or all the lives of the people she had changed and helped, even in the next.

Rosalind Nelson Jewett, I am the flicks of your hand in your cutthroat capital R's, the sharp peaks of your curling O's, the conviction in your lowercase D's, the flourish and triumph you used every time you struck through those final two T's, blooming from the tip of your pen, streaming from your delicate wrists, onto all of the detention slips you had to sign.

You were the most beautiful woman I ever knew, in every way possible, and you loved me for who I really was. I promise I will spend the rest of my life forging your signature, this time, out of steel, for all the world to see.

Anyway, last night was my school prom. I go to a small school with roughly 50 per grade. The only after party that was being held involved lots of alcohol and drugs, which neither my friends of mine or me felt like dealing with. So I asked my parents if I could have a small one at my house. Just me, my boyfriend, my best friend, her boyfriend, and a good friend. 

We go to my place after prom. We decide to watch Frozen. We began watching and my boyfriend, single friend, I are so tired that we fall asleep within 20 minutes of the movie beginning. At the end of the movie, I wake up and my best friend and her boyfriend are gone. So I begin wandering around looking for them. 


They are in MY bedroom making out on MY bed. 



Now, this upset me for multiple reasons. 
1) My parents and in the next room, along with my brother, and roommate across the hall. 
2) Both of them knew that boys are not allowed upstairs. I made this very clear to them before. 
3) My parents trusted me to have friends over without supervision. This betrays the trust of them and could cause them to say no more friends over without constant adult supervision. My father is strict and I would not put that past him. 
4) She and I have been on thin ice lately because she told her friends everything sexually that my boyfriend and I had done, which made me really upset.
5) She constantly does things that hurt me and uses the excuse ""I forgot"" or ""I didn't think about it""

So I walk in and they pretend nothing happened. I tell her boyfriend to go downstairs because it's against the rules. He does. Once he leave, I help my best friend get her makeup and hair products together. Here's out direct dialogue:

""You can't bring boys up into my room, while I'm asleep, and make out with them. My parents would be upset and it's not okay.""
""Yeah, sorry. I didn't think about it. He was helping me get my things together. We were only up here for a minute.(Nothing was cleaned. Clothes and products were everywhere still)
""Still...my parents aren't okay with boys upstairs.""
""Okay, but you know when there's just so much sexual tension? There just needed to be a release of it"" (I'm not kidding, she said this)

I was too tired to argue. Everyone leaves soon and I sleep. The next morning, my mom comes in and asked me what happened last night. She heard rustling in my room. I didn't want to lie to her. I tell her exactly what happened and she was very angry. She decided that she would call her parents later because it's obvious that my friend has no respect for rules. My relationship with my father is rocky as it is, and when he asked me, I didn't want to make it worse by lying.

So here I am, upset and confused. She hurts me a lot, and what she did hurt me. She doesn't realize that her actions affect others. She made me choose between telling my parents that truth and risk my privlege of unsupervision taken away, or to lie and have them possibly find out later and make me feel bad for lying. Plus, how can I trust that she hadn't been there for much longer than she said? Everyone was asleep and she's proven that I can't trust her anyway by her telling people my personal information. Also, she tells me that it makes her uncomfortable when my boyfriend kisses me on the cheek and tries to cuddle with me when we are in my home, but I'm supposed to be okay with her sneaking into my bedroom, bringing a boy who I don't know super well with her, and making out with him on my bed?

She's a close friend, but I can't handle her betraying me anymore. She's had second chances and she's blown all of them. I feel like she doesn't give anything to the friendship when I've been giving 100% to make things better. I'm so torn on what to do and I could really use some advice. Sorry for the wall of text also....

I went straight home after the event. When I got home I wanted to just hug him, kiss him, and be with him because I really missed him. He was not as excited. I don't know what happened, but i told him i missed him a lot. he blocked my hands from hugging him and he started saying that if I missed him so much then why didn't I come straight home to see him, why did I go to the event? I started telling him how I felt like I needed to support someone and how it was part of my job. There was no obligation for me to go, but I wanted to support someone there. Anyway he started saying how I was lying, that I said I could blow it off and now I was saying that it was an obligation! I don't like arguing over things that get you nowhere. So I stopped trying to argue. Eventually I started crying. He asked why I was crying. And I told him that I was eager to come home and be with him and how he does not believe me and I don't know what to do. He didn't reply. He is passive aggressive. This was last night. I slept from about 6pm-8am. This afternoon he started getting ready...and then about 5 minutes before leaving, he asked me if I wanted to go to lunch with his mom. I said no. I feel like every time I see him be so cold with me I cry, so if I go I'm just going to cry. I really just needed to vent and wondering if anyone else has been through a similar scenario? Usually these things blow over and I can't wait for it to blow over because I still just want to hug and kiss him.

t3_25c4qe,"Wanted to share an epiphany I had relating to how we police each others bodies and how it probably relates to the fact that so many women and men get raped","so I was standing at the buss stop the other day and a little boy with his mother was standing next to me.  A girl walked past with curly, bright blue hair.  


THe kid: ""mommy, why is her hair blue?""

Mom: ""because it is.""

kid: ""But WHY? it looks bad""

Mom: ""well she likes it, so she dyed it blue""

kid:  ""but it looks funny!!!""

mom (getting annoyed):  ""so what if it looks funny? She likes it and it's her hair.  She can do whatever she wants to it.  Stop worrying about it.  It doesn't affect your life and it isn't hurting anyone""

Kid: ""why is that person fat?""

mom: ""because he is.  Now stop worrying about that stuff and enjoy the nice sunny spring day.  Doesn't the sun feel nice on your skin mason?""

Kid ""cool!"" (reaches out to touch a the sweater of another man who was waiting for the bus)

mom: ""NO! You can't just touch people without asking them, mason!  Remember like in daycare?  Everyone has a bubble....""


Kid: smiles mischievously, laughs, mom gives him a stern look and he mumbles ""i know i know but it was soft and fluffy looking....""



Then the bus came and everyone got on.  I sat down and overheard two college girls discussing someone in one of their classes: ""omg did you see her hair the other day?! you can totally tell that she has extensions.  She's kind of a skank I hear....""


Then I realized that people seem to think that other people's bodies, particularity women's bodies, are public property, and that we have a right to have an opinion on them, to judge someone's character based on their body, and even to touch their body.  How many times have you over heard people criticizing celebs for getting plastic surgery?  


And then we wonder why people don't seem to  know what consent really means when it comes to sex?


I'm glad their teaching the bubble thing in day cares.  Of course they also teach about teamwork at daycare when I was a kid and that didnt seem to help us - everyone at my office always seems to compete with each other instead of working together to get shit done. :/


I think that what people don't understand, is that PEOPLE DO NOT OWE YOU EXPLANATIONS FOR THEIR ACTIONS/EXISTENCE/PREFERENCES/ETC, UNLESS IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS YOUR LIFE.  I get asked all the time why I dont want any children in my life - badgered about it, as if I owe someone an explanation for a personal decision that doenst even affect their life!!

TLDR: People think that other people's bodies are public property, and that they are ENTITLED to an explanation for other people actions/decisions/ beliefs, even when none of that affects their life personally.  People are individualists in all the wrong ways - ie team work is for 'suckers', taxes are for 'socialists' but they still think that other peoples bodies or thoughts are communal and up for discussion.

A woman came up to our table and said she was sick in the restroom, and my friends said I should check it out, since I'm technically biologically female and wouldn't get in trouble. Well I walk in and there's people taking pictures under the stall door, so I ask them to stop taking pictures of my friend and kindly fuck off. I ask her if she's okay and if I can get her water or anything, and she says she's not sick or drunk, just trying to get rid of all the food she ate. She comes out and is talking about how she's upset she wasn't able to throw it up and will have to live with the guilt now. I had no freaking clue what to say, I didn't want to make her feel weird about it so I just kind of... kept nodding sympathetically and said I was glad she was okay.



I have no idea if my reaction was alright, or what I should do when hanging out with her in the future. She said her roommates already know, so I don't feel a huge burden of responsibility, but I'm worried about saying or doing something triggering in future interactions. Like is it insensitive if I talk about how I'm having trouble gaining weight lately? Should I react any differently when she wants to go out and get food, or is encouraging others to buy lots of food so she can share it, or if I notice she's purging again?

I made this friend in a class, and he also knows my boyfriend partially through me and partially because we are in the same community on campus.  My friend is openly gay and well aware that my boyfriend and I are not only dating but that it's a very serious, committed relationship.

I am 26 years old, I don't live at the house anymore, but my younger brother and sister do (edit: they are 23 and 20 years old, not underage, sorry for not clarifying before).  We have heard them arguing for hours on end throughout our lives, so it's something we generally tune out.  However, last night my sister heard my mom yell ""stop choking me"" and walked in their bedroom with my dad straddling my mom with his hands around my mom's neck.  My sister yelled at them to stop and left the room.  They eventually calmed down, and after a few hours of anxiety attacks, my sister felt comfortable enough to call me and tell me what had happened.  My sister has heard hitting before, and has seen my mom with torn shirts, on other occasions, but this is the first time any of us has been an eye witness to physical abuse.

I immediately got my brother to come home, and the three of us went into their bedroom (me via facetime actually) and saw my mom crying and shaking, sitting next to my dad on the bed, splotches of blood on the sheets and both with a cut or two on their faces.  My brother starts ripping into my dad, while my dad sat there and either downplayed or flat out denied everything.  I threatened to call the police, and to this moment a large part of me still wishes I had.  We eventually got my mom out of the room and she said down with us in another bedroom.  She claims this is the first time he's ever hit her (I don't believe that) and that she had to hit him in defense (I have no idea, she might be an instigator as well).  She spoke like a textbook domestic violence victim - she gave excuses, said it wasn't going to happen again, said we were welcome to call the cops if it happened again but just not tonight, etc. I pressured her and said things like ""you're afraid he's going to retaliate, which is even more of a reason to get a police record...in ten years will you THANK ME for not calling the cops..."" etc.  And she kept pushing off police involvement.  My hands felt tied. I told my sister afterward that the next time she hears them fighting at this level (not even waiting until one of them threatens violence), to call me immediately and I'm going to call the cops and say that my parents have a record of domestic abuse and they are arguing in such a way that I feel unsafe letting them continue without police involvement.

In addition, my dad is a massive alcoholic (averages 8 drinks a day if I had to guess).  He generally becomes dimwitted and acts like an annoying 5-year old, but doesn't get verbally or physically abusive to any of the kids.  I'm not sure if the alcohol was a major player in this event or if it was just a nudge in that direction.

I have no idea what to do from here, especially because I live 3 hours away.  My mom thinks what happened is serious, but is obviously not at a place where she thinks it's worth it to make any major changes.  My dad has refused alcohol therapy for decades and makes excuses to no end when shit goes down when he's drinking (for example, traisping blood around the house for twenty minutes when he was so drunk he didn't realize he needed stitches after dropping a bowl on his foot, to which my sister had to make him get in the car to go to the walk-in clinic).

Can you force somebody to go to a detox clinic?  He's already seeing a therapist (non-alcohol related) but who knows if he's lying to them - family counseling?  Can you get the state involved to force him to take bigger steps?  How can I get my mom to take this A LOT more seriously instead of just talking with him about it after the fact?  I'm at a loss, but I don't want to let this continue without a fight.

Well, the place I went to told me to take a few IB Profens beforehand and I'd be good to go. Well, that wasn't the case...I really have no pain tolerance at all apparently. Which I thought I could handle it since I've gotten a Colposcopy before and that wasn't too bad. But, this was WAY WORSE.

So, now I get to come back next month (so I'm doing the pill thing until then) and I've been prescribed Percocet and Xanax which I""m supposed to take an hour before I attempt to get it inserted again. My wonderful fiance has agreed to drive me there for when the time comes. 

My question, ladies, is will it hurt as bad with the pain pills as it did without them? I know pain is relative, but has anyone here ever gotten the IUD inserted without having children before and having taken prescribed pain meds beforehand? I really want to go the IUD since it is so effective and I won't have to remember to have pills on me at a certain time every day. 

I feel like a big pansy, but I couldn't handle the pain of even getting a measure of my cervix and that wasn't even supposed to be all that painful lol, the IUD was supposed to be worse, but I stopped the procedure before it got to that point. 

I am looking for the truth so I can use this month to prepare myself, because I still plan on getting it during my next period. I am hoping that with the pain meds beforehand it will be rather less painful. 

Thanks!!!

Anyway, on to my desperate plea for ya'lls help. My boyfriend and I have been dating for about two years now. He is 30 and I am 26, we live together, have a dog, we know each other's families well (we have traveled with them, gone to holidays with them, done weddings, reunions, etc.). We have discussed our future at length, including buying a house and getting married. We are very happy together and we both know this is what we want. 

So now I guess what I am coming to the group for advice with is not all that unusual a ""problem"" but I really am at a loss as to how to deal with myself (as in, the problem is me and my own self)

1. I can't stop feeling a little tinge of jealousy when it seems like every person I have ever met, younger, older, or whatever is getting engaged every 10 minutes. -what can I do to just feel happy for everyone else and stop feeling like there is something wrong with me?

2. (and more importantly) How can I stop putting an expectation on every nice, romantic thing we do? I would especially like to remove this association habit with our upcoming summer vacation. I really don't want to think ""is this it?"" during our whole trip, and then feel any sort of disappointment when I don't come back calling my boyfriend ""fiancé.""

I am happy with our relationship, I don't have any reason to believe he is ""dragging his feet"" or won't propose when he is ready to. I know this is just something I need to stop obsessing over, and I really think part of the obsession stems from the fact that we are both at ages where a lot of our friends and relatives are getting married (we have been invited to 9 weddings over the course of the next 6 months). I know that it *will* happen, I just need to somehow distract myself and stop thinking about *when*. 

**TL/DR:** How can I stop googling engagement rings? Any advice would be so appreciated.  

**ETA:** thanks to everyone for your advice and suggestions. It seems like most comments have been focused on telling me to talk to my boyfriend about getting married/get on the same page about marriage and getting engaged/propose to him. I appreciate all the consideration, I really do. I just want to point out that we have very openly discussed *everything* from life goals, to timelines, to cake, locations and color schemes (all hypothetical of course). I am in no way worried about what he is thinking, whether we will get engaged, if we will get engaged, or if he wants to or doesn't want to. All I am really looking for is ways to live more in the moment and, as I analogized it in one response, stop behaving like a kid looking for Christmas presents in my mom's closet. Thanks everybody!!

I'm also tempted to call the police over to her house while I'm there-- she might be more likely to file a report if they're present.

Advice? Is there anything I can do to help show her she's making a deadly mistake?",6,20140512101708,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25cw2l,"My relationship just ended and I'm lost and hurt and confused, I don't know what to do.","My now ex boyfriend and I had been dating for 8 months. We met online and clicked immediately. Our first date was beautiful and lasted for almost an entire day just because we didn't want to leave. For six months out relationship was great. We went out together all the time, discussed plans for the future (including kids, careers, where we wanted to live), and although we both had very busy schedules and lived in separate states (NY and NJ), saw each other as often as possible and never had any apparent problem with the distance.

Two months ago we took a vacation together that he described as ""the best week of my life"" simply because we got to spend the whole time together. He said he felt more at peace than he had in a long time and wished we had a place together so we wouldn't have to travel so much. We discussed budget and the search for an apartment began.

Not long after this, maybe two weeks, he started to spend more time with his friends from work. This coincided with my boss becoming very ill and me having to work more hours, so I had no problem with it and encouraged him to go out and have fun. We were still looking for apartments and discussing the future.

This was around the first time he mentioned her.

A friend of his from work (R) was sort of seeing a woman named (K), and they would all go out drinking several times a week together. K brought her friend G one time and my boyfriend (D) mentioned her when talking about how the night went. I expressed some concern about him drinking so much because he had admitted to using alcohol as an escape and would get blackout drunk almost every time he drank, but he assured me that he wasn't drinking much and everything was fine.

Around this time, he began asking me more and more often to take sexy pictures for him and if he could film us having sex. I hesitantly agreed to the photos, but never actually got around to taking them because at this point he was seeing his friends so often, I was only seeing him maybe once a week.

The drinking and going out increased. He started drinking more often by himself at home, and calling me at all hours telling me that he didn't know what he wants to do with his life besides just have fun. He was rethinking having kids, all of his work friends were telling him it was too much effort and life should just be about having fun. He stopped talking about the future (""I don't want to worry about tomorrow, I just want to enjoy today!"")and seemed distracted when we saw each other.

One night he got very drunk and we got into an argument. He grabbed at me several times and said he never wanted to have babies, that I was a bitch trying to control his life and he missed being single because he could do what he wanted. I cried and said if he wanted us to break up then we would, and he began to cry and apologize and say he didn't mean it. We agreed to discuss it in the morning when he sobered up and I went to bed while he stayed up to watch tv for a little while.

I woke up to the sound of him on the phone, talking to G and saying he wished he could have gone out. I got up and asked who he was talking to (I don't know why, I had heard it) and he waved me off. I heard the woman on the other end ask what he was doing and he said he was just hanging out. I asked why he wasn't mentioning the fact that he was at his girlfriend's house and he ended the call, told me to fuck off, and went to bed. I sniffed the cup he had been drinking from and it was pure alcohol, he had snuck off to my liquor cabinet after I went to sleep.

The next morning I confronted him and he said G was just K's friend and he had wanted to go out with all of his work friends the night before and had forgotten we had plans, so he was bitter and angry but didn't mean and was sorry. I accepted the apology but told him if he ever treated me like that again, we were through. He accepted and things seemed to go back to normal, almost.

He complained about being so busy with the end of the school semester that he had no time for anything. I went to him more often to try and make things easier, but sometimes last minute he would break plans because of his final project. I tried to be understanding, but my stomach was in knots. His phone was always on silent now and he would take a long time to get back to me, but always had it at the ready when we were together. We used to show each other things we were doing (playing games, reading articles), but now he put his phone away if I looked. On his twitter account, G started following him but had no posts of her own. He made a snapchat and said it was so we could chat more, but his top friend was always the same as G's twitter handle. When I asked he said she sent him stuff when the rest of them went out without him. I never saw any pictures and didn't know how to push more, so I let it go.

At this point we found an apartment and were going back and forth with the manager about setting up a viewing. He was excited, I was worried because it was near him and I would be uprooting my whole life to move there. After a couple of days of contact, D told me he thought it was a scam and told me to stop contacting the manager, so I did. This was maybe 2-3 weeks ago, now.

A little over a week ago I was at his place and on his computer was a folder with my name, he said it was all the pictures I sent him. I looked in the folder and there was another one that said sexy [my name], which he said was anything that showed more cleavage or he thought was hot. He sat on his phone and I looked at the photos, making little jokes until I found pictures of me topless and naked. During FaceTime conversations, I would sometimes get changed for bed. He took screenshots of that and saved them. I was upset and said I wanted them gone, he said he wanted to keep them because I still hadn't taken sexy photos for him. He ended up deleting a couple but I was still upset. I felt like I was making a big deal and he was getting upset, so I let it go. 

From then until just a few days ago, we decided to wait until our schedules were a little less hectic to continue our search and discussed plans for another vacation and my upcoming birthday. Thursday he came over and we went out to eat, said cheers to the semester being over, and talked about plans. When we went back to my place he grabbed a couple of things I had been asking him to take home, since I had work early and he wouldn't be staying over. He seemed distracted, but when I asked what was wrong he said he was just tired from doing double shifts at work and going to school at the same time. Again I let it go, but on the way to the train station when I dropped him off he wouldn't speak to me, wouldn't hold my hand and when I went to kiss him goodbye he pulled away and claimed he wasn't feeling well.

When he got home he called me and we finally had the conversation that I had been dreading. I told him I wanted to know what was wrong and I wanted an honest answer. He told me that he had fallen out of love with me a long time ago, that he had been planning this for a very long time. He wouldn't outright say that he was breaking up with me until I asked if this was his way of doing it. I asked why he wouldn't do it in person and he said because he was afraid of me getting violent, that he was actually afraid of me. I never even raised my voice to him let alone a hand.

Finally after some back-and-forth I asked if there was somebody else. He said it didn't matter if there was. I persisted. He admitted that he had met somebody else and I demanded to know her name. Again he said it didn't matter that I didn't need to know her name and I said I already knew her name but I just want to hear him admit it. He said G. I asked him how long it had been going on and he said for a while. He told me that he really cared about her and that she was special and he wanted to be able to give her a fair chance, not sneak around anymore. I told him something along the lines of they deserve each other, I don't quite remember because honestly I was so upset I couldn't even see straight anymore let alone keep my hands still. He said he would ship my things to me and hung up.

Now I'm left with this problem. He still has those pictures of me. He still has my things. Saturday I asked him when he was going to send them and he said that since he hadn't been home since he left my place that I would just have to wait. When I asked if he had been with her the whole time he wouldn't respond. I asked if they had been having sex and he said no, not yet. I asked if they had been doing other things. He said I didn't need to know that information because we weren't together anymore. I asked again and asked if it had been going on while we were together. He refused to give me a straight answer. We never used protection. I'm on the pill and we both said that we had tested clean, and me being an idiot took his word for it. My friend says that I should warn this other girl, especially about the pictures. I'm torn. I just want to get my things back and move on with my life. But I don't want somebody else to go through the same thing that I did. But at the same time I have a feeling that she knew about me the whole time and just didn't care because I know that he talked about me on Twitter and she did definitely follow him.

So what do I do? I told him I want those pictures gone and he said it wouldn't be a problem, but I can't believe a word that comes out of his mouth anymore. I want to know the truth about what was going on between them but I don't at the same time. This is the third relationship in a row that I've been cheated on and I'm giving up on the chance of ever finding somebody who will be faithful. I'm definitely getting tested but I'm going to be losing my insurance and I'm not sure how I can go about getting tested again in a few months time to be sure. I'm afraid of those pictures getting out. I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid of the fact that I still love him. I don't know what to do anymore, I need help.",2,20140512083926,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

This was partly due to me being 'loved up' and wanting to spend my time with him, and meet his family etc. She soon began giving me the cold shoulder, and bad mouthing me to our mutual friends. Once I had clocked on to my bad friend behaviour, I sat down and apologised to her and explained I recognised what I had done was wrong. I made a real effort to try and rekindle our friendship, meeting up with her lots, just calling every now and then and checking how she was, and I even  tried not to be with my boyfriend in front of her when we were together at social events because she got so funny about it. *She has a boyfriend too by the way*

It is now 3 years down the line, and me and said boyfriend are still together and very happy. But me and my friend have never been able to rekindle our friendship. She is very judgemental, and has not been supportive of me when I struggle with anxiety and panic attacks. I feel like our relationship is very fake. I know that I am to blame for the start of our friendships downfall, but I apologised sincerely and really tried very hard to make things right.

To make it short.
I'm 22 years old. In my senior year of uni currently working non stop on my thesis. I am also running 2 of my father's companies that are currently at the peak of their success. I work 9-5 and go to uni at night most of the days of the week. My weekends consist of working on homework and my thesis which is to be finished around october this year. So basically I have no time for anything other than my education and career. And in the free time I do have, I am just so exhausted that I don't want to even think about exercising. 

So due to this amount of stress and no time for exercise, I have been gaining weight. 
I refuse to take a break since I am so close to finishing and I honestly can't leave my job unattended. 


However, I really need to do some changes to get back to where i was. 

I am not a heavy eater. The problem is that I am so busy that sometimes I forget to eat lunch, and then have a big dinner. I know that it is extremely unhealthy and probably the main reason for my weight gain.

So does anyone have any advice on how to deal with my situation? 

Any advice is appreciated.",0,20140512133621,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25eaxw,"I regret my abortion.","It's been a month. I've regretted it since the next day. 

When he came inside me I knew. We always used either a condom or he pulled out, and we've never had this scare before. We got too much into it and couldn't lift me off him on time. He came inside me, and I knew what it would lead to. 

For days afterwards I wondered how to tell him. I hoped he'd be happy and love it as much as I already did. I'd wanted a child so badly. He'd mentioned to me that he wanted one, too. Even though when we started dating he said he'd never have one. He thought I'd make a good mother and that changed his mind. 

It wasn't until a month later, March 17th that I got the test done, because I was about a week late. I took the test he had from the dollar store in his bathroom ""just in case"" for years. Positive. I ran out to Rexall and bought a $20 test. 4+ weeks, it said. 

I drove to my sisters house with the test, beginning to panic now. No one would be happy for me. Everyone would say 21 is too young to have a child. My family would disown me. 

My sister was so happy for me. She touched my belly and coo'd. And for once, I felt like this might happen. She offered me all her baby hand-me downs and told me if I needed anything i could count on her for support. My others sisters reaction was the same. She came over to my house and sat beside me on the couch with her hand on my belly. And even though it wasn't big enough to even show, the little thing still had presence in my heart and mind. 

When my boyfriend came home I told him, hoping so badly that he'd want this as much as I did. He didn't. He told me he thought we should abort, and I sadly agreed to it. I'd always promised him I wouldn't be one of those women who don't care about the fathers right. I promised him if we were to get pregnant, he had just as much say as I did and I was not going to go one way while he wanted the other. 

I did a lot of crying. He kept telling me ""I had to make a decision"" and I'd yell back at him that the decision was made, even though I was clearly against it. He told me he'd support me in anything, and even though he didn't think it was the right time that if I had to have it, he had to know ASAP so he could quit schooling and find a career that could support us. I told him no, that I wouldn't go back on my word and that I was just sad. 

We went to the appointment to see how far along I was. They wouldn't do the abortion without knowing for sure. I wasn't asked to see the monitor and I didn't want to ask, but I was angry that he was allowed to see and I wasn't, from where he has. All the movies the mothers get to see the monitors. They point out features, they smile at you and tell you it will be okay. But this wasn't like the movies, and there were no smiles. 

The abortion was planned for a month later. Scheduled by the clinic on his birthday, April 11th. He seemed indifferent to that, just mentioning that it was an odd birthday present. 

The next month was unbearable. My morning sickness was so bad I needed to go to the doctor for a prescription to help it. I threw up all morning all day. I couldn't get out of bed, and I couldn't go anywhere in my house because somewhere, a smell would set me off. I started to get angry at my body. It didn't have to prepare for the pregnancy, it was going to be done soon! I just wanted it all to go away. I got severely depressed, my boyfriend supported me in any way he could but i just stayed in bed and slept. I had to miss a week of work. I work with food, and couldn't smell anything strong without puking. I was driving to the store and had to pull over to throw up. Got it all over my legs and steering wheel because I couldn't get out the door on time. 

Near the end of this I passed out in a bank. I woke up on the floor with women surrounding me asking if I was all right. I was led to a chair, given cookies and water and the first question the lady asked me was if I was pregnant. I said yes. She told me I should go to the doctor just to make sure the baby is okay. I started crying and told her it wasn't necessary. I was due to terminate in a weeks time. People were a lot less thoughtful then, and I drove home. 

My sister drove me to the abortion. I was 9 weeks by this point. My boyfriend held my hand during the whole two hour wait. He had to go to the bathroom before the ultrasound, so I got to ask for a picture. I wouldn't have asked if my boyfriend was there. 

The questionaire they had me fill out asked me who's decision this was. I wrote in big letters ""MINE."" It didn't feel like mine. 

The procedure was painless. He held my hand for the needle and I remember feeling very uncomfortable with her seeing my vagina, but I don't remember anything else. Then they brought me to recovery and had me sit with a pad to soak up the blood. I felt immediate regret. I ate cookies and water until they needed the spot and sent me home. My sister drove me. When I got home, I went to bed. 

All evidence of what happened to me is gone. All except the birth control pills they had me start the next day. Each time I take that pill, it's a counter of how log it's been since I lost that chance at a child. Each night I have to hold back tears. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm fine. I'm not. At work I see babies all the time, and I feel immediate regret all over again. Mother's Day was so difficult. My step dad was mocking me the whole time- ""this will be the new mother next year, huh?? Your turn!"" He doesn't know about the abortion or he would be more careful, I'm sure. 

I miss the fetus. It would have been about 13 weeks by now. I think I'll regret it forever. Counting down my destroyed baby's would-be-birthday and milestones.

t3_25esx6,"Small victories are sometimes the best","As a female only child, I was expected to do certain chores around the house growing up.  I did the laundry, put away the groceries, and some other odds and ends.  My father did everything outside.

He was not the best father and never bothered to teach me things like how to throw a football or fish.  And he certainly never let me near any of his tools aka man toys.  So I never once mowed the lawn or trimmed the hedges.  The thing is I'm not at all a girly girl and I would have loved to do that stuff.

My father passed away last November.  I'm absolutely fine with that since we had a terrible relationship.  Life is actually better now for both me and my mother.

The only issue is, now there's no one to take care of things outside the house.  He bought a brand new push lawn mower last year.  Used it exactly once and just left it in the garage.

My mom was ready to call up and get a landscaper to take care of the lawn.  But she's on a fixed budget and there was that brand new mower in the garage.  So I thought about it and decided, what the hell, I'll do it.

So today I drove over, opened the garage and pushed the mower over to the lawn.  I tried the push button, nothing.  I tried the pull cord, nothing.  It would sound like it was about to start and then just die.  A quick check and I realized it needed gas.  Ok, that's easy.  Came back and started trying to start the damn thing again.  Nothing.  It sounded like a car with a nearly dead battery.  It would try to start, then just die.

Of course the man didn't keep the manual.  I'm on my phone trying to google how to start a mower.  I felt like the stereotypical helpless female.  I HATE that feeling.  I'm far to independent to fail at something as simple as mowing the lawn.  

My mom is standing in the door telling me to go to one of the male neighbors and ask for help.  UGH!!  NO!!!  I was determined to do it myself.  I had gone inside to help her with something, and cool down a bit.  When I went back outside I jokingly said, ""say a prayer"".  We are the least religious people around.

I walked over to the mower and tried to start it and again the fucking thing would just not start.  I was literally ready to give up.  She's standing in the front door laughing at my frustration.  Finally I pushed the start button one more time.  HALLELUJAH!!  The damn thing started and stayed started!

So I managed to mow the lawn, or the weeds really, on my own for the first time in my 40 years.  It was one of the most satisfying things I've ever done.  Was so inspired that I went home, grabbed the cordless drill and hung a new window shade.  

Now to learn how to tile a floor.  That will be my next victory.

t3_25epgq,"My experience with an (almost) date rape","In our time, it is not uncommon to meet someone and form an almost instant friendship. You've either met them in person or online, and upon carrying a conversation you think to yourself ""This person seems really cool!"" Next thing you know, you've exchanged numbers or agreed to hang out.

In my case, I met him at the park while we were both jogging the trail. He was attractive, college age, and shot me a friendly smile. As I came around the trail a second time, we met again and he asked if he could jog the trail with me. I was in a public setting in broad daylight, so I agreed. He asked for my name and carried on a small talk conversation about fitness. 'What a pleasant jog! What a pleasant conversation!' I think to myself. He has now earned my trust and offers me a ride to my car, which was parked further away. Hot and tired, I agreed. During the ride, our conversation continued. He parked his car next to mine and asked about my interests. He played a few songs from his band and asked for my feedback. He asked for my number and hinted on a future date. Then, he started telling me how beautiful I was and what a great time we'd have on our date. He commented on how I was a shy girl and he would get me drunk on our date to get me out my shell if need be - wait, what? PAUSE. I let out a nervous chuckle ""Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen."" Feeling slightly uncomfortable, I start searching for excuses to leave. He then asks me for a kiss, making the situation more uncomfortable. Feeling completely uneasy, I firmly tell him I have to go. He begs me for a kiss on the cheek, to which I just respond a firm goodbye and head for the door. On my way out, he forcefully reaches out and grabs my breast sitting there with a smirk on his face. At this point, I am making the most frantic exit back to my car as possible. The fool has the nerve to say ""I guess that means you don't want me to call you, right?"" All I can think of is how lucky I was to get away and speed the entire way home. It's easy to feel guilty as if it was my fault for being naive and getting into his car. It was my fault for trusting him. It was my fault because I was initially attracted.

NO. I want you to know, it's not your fault. Since when does getting access to a ride mean access to your body? Just because you've earned my trust enough to get me back to my car on the other side of the lot a few thousand feet away safely does not mean I trust you enough to touch me. Situations like this go about unreported because it is easy to feel at fault. This happened about two months ago and I let him get away because I thought the police would just dismiss it as nothing, besides, I also had a warrant for my arrest at the time for a traffic violation I haven't paid. I got away from the situation, but to this day, I wonder how many other women have fallen victim to his act.

Ive expressed my distrust about her in the past but he refuses to stop talking to her stating they are good friends. To complicate the situation, we both live in my ex's house, but my ex, my bf and me aremutual friends.

I'm a fat 19F. I've spent most of my life hating myself and how I look. I yoyoed from 360 to 230 to 280 again. Now I'm at 270 with a light diet, but unfortunately have developed an eating disorder. I cant eat more than once a day without having horrific self hatred.

However, with my clothes on in certain outfits I feel like I look nice. I carry my weight well and my legs are muscular from sports as a kid plus walking several miles a week. My boyfriend lovingly insists he finds me ravishing and regularly kisses my belly when I feel glum. But in general, my clothes are old, ill fitting, and ratty. Not something a young starting business professional type person should were. (I'm considering myself an entrepreneur and an artist) 

Today, another plus size, older friend of mine took me clothes shopping. I had no idea what I was doing and she helped me pick out bright, workplace appropriate clothes that I felt pretty in. I sold my 3DS and pokemon X [ :( ] and had some money to play with. She took me to a thrift shop called 'one more chance plus' an d she helped me pick out cute business professional clothing since I had got a very awesome internship at a very notable art gallery in my city. And I got so many pretty things to wear. Two button ups (with no gaps on my boobs), light, flowy shirts, a perfectly cut to my size plum blazer, a black pencil skirt, a black a line dress and pearls. In total 8 or 9 garments that I can mix and match with my exisiting wardrobe to have a fun, business casual look that I so desperately want to achieve, all for about 100 dollars. 

And while trying on those clothes and looking in the middle, I hardly let my eyes linger on my stretch marks, or my floppy boobs in ill fitting bra (I know I'm not a DD, but I can't afford bras that fit), or my arms and the way they swelled.. instead, I saw how these cute outfits I thought girls like me couldn't wear, totally wearing it.

When I'm having PIV sex I sometimes reach the point that I can feel myself building up and getting close to having an orgasm. However, whenever this happens my boyfriend almost always ends up finishing before I can climax.

For some reason if I can't orgasm (and I'm close) it feels like a wave of sadness crashes into me and I involuntarily start to tear up and...cry. It's not because I'm consciously upset that I couldn't orgasm - I love my partner, and I love having sex, and not finishing is something that I'm used to. It's the act of *almost* getting there, but not being able to that makes my body react this way.

I attribute it to the build up of hormones and not being able to find a release, but I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else? I can't be the only crazy one out there, right?

I end up feeling awful because of the emotions I can't help but feel, but also because I need to comfort my boyfriend and tell him it isn't his fault. It's the worst of both worlds - I've reached the point that I would almost rather not try for an orgasm than almost get there and experience this.

Now there is a 9 year difference between us but it really doesn't feel like it when we're hanging out! 


Now I was definitely taken by surprise by this and I felt kinda bummed about it, but I didn't and still don't want any kind of relationship with this guy. We have a good time and I know he enjoys my company.


Well, the other day he texted me again out of the blue, commenting on one of my snapchat stories. We texted for a solid 2 hours and sex didn't come up until the last maybe 10 minutes of our conversation. I proceeded to ask him why he was talking to me again as he said he felt it was ""time to move on"", he responded with ""I was with a 28 year old and she was really boring in bed, and in general we should have some fun."" I wasn't thrown by this because I know exactly what we are to each other, booty calls for sure. I was actually kind of excited that I was so good that I stuck out in his mind!


I have yet to hang out with him since he started texting me again even though I'd really like to. But my friends have me questioning if it's in my best interest to see him again! He's a great fuck and we can actually talk to each other! Unlike some of my other FwB. Am I being too ""easy"" (I hate that term) returning to him so quickly? Or am I truly being ""too college""? Getting with him again wouldn't mess me up, emotionally, I know that is for sure. I would just love some opinions from ladies outside of the situation!

I am writing to say I for one am super happy you have become a default sub.  Although I have an account, I often don't sign in because I often like to see what's happening in the main stream of reddit.  [Today upon opening up the front page I found this TwoX story about abortion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25dh62/tomorrow_i_am_driving_my_ultraconservative_anti/).  And it reminded me of how hard it is to be in this world for women.  So I clicked on the TwoX link and started reading some of the other stories here.  I laughed and felt grossed out by [dog and the tampon story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25c3eq/oh_god_my_dog_ate_my_tampon_and_then_shat_it_out/). Read with horror about the couple of domestic violence stories and many of the other stories in here.  

My point is that the more that we XY people hear from you about your lives and what you go through on a day to day basis, the more women's stories become human stories.  And I know that there will be a spike in troll activity, this will soon die down.  And reddit will be on it's way to becoming even more of the humanist site it is, where many different groups of people can have a strong representative voice.

t3_25f0qo,"I don't believe my new FWB actually got STD tested","I may be completely wrong on this and I really hope I am. But I do not believe the new guy I am dating went and got tested even though he said that he did. Backstory: I have been seeing this guy for 3-4 weeks and the condom breaks and neither of us noticed until he was finished. I could immediately tell that there was cum inside me and asked him to check the condom. He told me it was fine but I said that he needed to check again because I could tell. He comes out of the bathroom and tells me it was split when he looked at it. I tell him he needs to get tested and he says he will. 5 days later he went to planned parenthood and got tested. He told me they charged him $160 and would not take his Humana insurance. I find this strange because all of my friends and I have never been charged more than $100 even without insurance. Am I just being paranoid? How can I confront him about this. PP does not give you a paper copy of the results so I can't ask to see that. 
FYI: I am on BC and was STD tested 2 weeks prior to incident. Also I plan on parting ways with this guy once he gets his results. My gut just does not trust him.

Edited: I will be getting tested myself too. I would just like to know his results so that I don't freak out while waiting for the incubation periods to get my tests.

EDIT 2: As previously stated, I plan on breaking up with the guy because I don't trust him.

UPDATE: After 45 minutes of calling, PP answered the phone and informed me that testing IS $160 for new patients. So I feel a lot better knowing he at least told me the correct price. And they will print results if he goes back in and signs a waiver. Now my question is, how do I ask him to go and get me printed results without offending him?? I am not worried about losing the guy, but I would like to have proof before/instead of him getting pissed off and ignoring my request.

I would love to contribute and be a part of this community. I want to learn from women who care about and are affected by these issues, and I want to contribute my own thoughts, as someone who is making an honest effort to be aware of problems faced by women today.

If I'm being honest, though, I've been too scared to post or comment so far. I'm afraid of saying something that might offend someone, or coming across as misogynistic by not using sensitive/appropriate language. I have a friend who brings up gender/feminist topics at a lot of our friendly gatherings, which is great, until I bring up an idea that's different than her way of thinking and get yelled at for being insensitive. I am in no way insinuating that she is a reflection of feminism or women as a whole, and I'm not even trying to say that I'm right, or that she's wrong.

I (24F) have been in a committed relationship with my partner (25M) for two and a half years now. We live together, and plan to do so for the foreseeable future, but we are both open to the idea of having sex with other people as long as we practice safe sex and communicate with each other. I have a long history of low self-esteem and self-harm: I have been raped and I have used meaningless sex to make me feel better about myself. 

My partner is fairly anti-authoritarian and has a great disdain for police officers. I am currently employed as a 911 dispatcher, so I spend a great deal of my time in communications with police officers, ensuring their safety in the field. This has led me to get very close to an officer with whose ethics I greatly identify, a quality that is rare for me to find in the police officers I dispatch. He also happens to be single, attractive, and very much interested in me. I would like to start seeing this man outside of my job (he hangs around the dispatch center when I am working and he is not busy), and I know my partner is okay with me sleeping with other people, but I think he would take issue with me sleeping with a police officer. 

I don't know if I want to sleep with this man simply because he wants to sleep with me and I am going back to my old habits from before I met my partner. I respect him a lot as a person and it is refreshing to work with one officer that I can really identify with. The officer knows I am not single and has not backed down, so I'm not sure if he is trying to pressure me to leave my partner (absolutely not an option), or if he would be okay with sleeping with me without me leaving my partner (possibly an option but only with my partner's consent). having said all of that, I do not know how to explain to my partner that I want this man partially because he is a police officer and I have no one else with whom I can connect in that part of my life. My partner is the most loving and compassionate person you could ever look for, but it takes a huge toll on him to hear about my day at work because what I deal with is often darker and heavier than anyone outside emergency services can really grasp. I need someone with whom I can have sex and share in the darker side of the job. I truly believe that I could have that with that one man I work with, but I don't know how to explain to my partner that I want to have sex with a police officer.

**TL;DR** Committed, semi-open relationship with one man, intense interest in another that my partner may not approve of. Unknown if pursuing the other man would be return to old ways from dark and twisty past, or if it would be helpful to deal with the stress of my current life that I can't share with my partner.

Please help me,
Desperate(ly), devoted dispatcher

**Edit** -ed to add that sex with my partner is generally good. I don't think it's the two and a half year itch, ,or anything like that. We are communicative about our sexual needs with each other and understand each other's need for sexual experiences outside our relationship (i.e masturbation, sex with other people). My only complaint about sex with my partner is that his own past issues often lead him to ejaculate prematurely, and that's not really a big deal usually, but sometimes I just need longer PIV sex than he can manage so that can on occasion get frustrating.",0,20140512172328,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Because I've never been able to use a tampon, I've never felt like a normal woman.  It feels great overcoming that hurdle.  :)",37,20140513130635,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25gr7y,"A year ago, my girlfriend had an abnormal Pap result. She has taken no action, and is reluctant to get another Pap","I forget the exact results, I think it was [Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)](http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/Health-Notes/WomensHealth/ScreeningsProcedures/Understanding-Abnormal-Pap-Test-Results.aspx).  Her HPV test also came back positive.  She declined a follow up colposcopy.

She has stated that this is the 'single hardest thing she has ever gone through in her life'.  She feels shame, anger, distrust, unworthiness.  She feels like she fucked up.  She feels like the Western Medical system is *not* set up to make people healthy, but to make people feel like there are things wrong with them.  The doctor does not feel like a safe place to her.  It has taken a toll on our sex-life, we have had sex maybe a half-dozen times since her result a year ago.

Now, a year later, I encourage her to *at least* go get another Pap.  I know that they are uncomfortable tests, and that I cannot really know that discomfort.  I know that she feels shame, and that I cannot really know that shame.  I worry about her health.  I feel uncomfortable not knowing what is going on with her body.  I feel bad for pressuring her to do something that she does not want to do, for asking her to do something with her body that she is not comfortable with.  I feel like her behavior is self-destructive.  I feel like I should have encouraged her to get another Pap six months ago.

Jacob, Kristen, and I went out to drink, but we were all a little drunk. Jacob said I could stay with him and Kristen didn't mind at all. I had also taken a benzo per my prescription for anxiety, so I was loopy and very tired. Jacob was very drunk.

We went to the same place, and he insisted (even Kristen who trusts us fully) that I just share the bed with Jacob to get sleep and not drive drunk.

I did, thinking nothing of it. I've been going through a lot and Jacob is a good friend. I passed out next to him and he had his arm around me, but I felt safe because he was my friend and my best friends boyfriend. I feel into a deep sleep almost instantly. However, I started to stir because he was stirring, and then all of a sudden he was pushing himself into me. I looked down and my pants were at my knees and he had be pushed up against the wall. I didn't know what to do, I was still so heavy and tired and confused. I didn't tell him to stop, not right away. he moved me around and put himself on top of me. I started to think I was somewhere else, that this wasn't happening. But I still didn't say stop. Until i did. And then he pushed harder, so much that it hurt so I screamed but I think he thought I was enjoying it. Finally, he does stop. And then he starts slurring that he thought I was Kristen.

I know he was really drunk, but he was lucid enough to tell me not to tell Kristen. 

I don't know if this was rape, but I didn't want it. I also didn't really fight it. I feel disgusting and scared and I don't want to tell anyone. I'm so confused because we are all a close group of friends.

I came home and took a shower and self medicated until I couldn't feel anymore. Today I called out of work because we ALL work together (Kristen, Jacob, and Sean). 

I need someone to talk to. I need to know if this was rape. I need to know what to do. I've been sexually assaulted before, I can't go through this again. But was it assault?

t3_25gets,"Do you Care to Stand up for Women's right to Body Hair and the inherent Femininity/Womanliness that it Embodies?","(Kind responses only please) EDIT: this doesn't mean I only want to hear people that agree with me, just be nice about it if you don't, because this issue is about body shame and I would like a thread of comments that don't contribute to more shame.

I am a woman who loves and leaves all my body hair, but then I am not too hairy. I am not concerned about myself, but rather the many woman who feel they have to remove it to be accepted. I am interested in hearing from both women who like and keep hair, but also from woman who may love to remove it, but are still able to stand up for our rights to be ourselves and who can speak positively about their bodies even when they prefer another option, in the effort to support everyone. 

As hair restrictions become more intense, people have become less comfortable with all their body hair. When I was in High School in the 1990's, bikini line waxing wasn't a thing, and we all let it hang out, just like our mother's and aunties had done. Do we need to exercise our rights to keep them? Is this a use it or loose it situation? I let my few hairs that stick outside my bikini line (like 30 of them), stick out because I care so much about standing up for this right. Even when I waxed bellow, I made sure to let some hairs stay from my mons so that on my special trip to Hawaii with my husband, I could proudly brandish my bush flag. 

I do this because I know there are women hairier than I and I want to say - this hair is OK. You are OK. I believe it is time for a hair revolution, not to stop waxing, but rather to say WE CA DO WHATEVER THE F WE WANT TO and WE ARE STILL WOMANLY AND BEAUTIFUL because HAIR IS NATURAL ON WOMEN AND THUS IT IS INHERANTLY FEMININE. 

Is there anyone who does what I do, wears their hair like a badge of honor, and are there more of you willing and brave enough to do it sometimes?

Who is confident enough to do it with pride?

Is there anyone like me who feels their body hair is soft and beautiful and sexy and prefers it?

Are their any hardcore waxers who are willing to speak only positively about hair, even on their own body, or in the privacy of the bedroom with a lover, so that body love is spread rather than body hate.

Again, this isn't anti waxing or shaving, it is just pro freedom of choice.

Last year I saw a young girl with hair that grew from her temples onto her cheeks and towards her chin. It wasn't like beard hair, but rather more like soft head hair that extended way down her face. I thought she was exquisitely beautiful and that her hair was super fitting. She kept it trimmed short, but not shaved off. I wanted to tell her I thought she was gorgeous, but hesitated because I didn't want to put her on the spot. Have you had experiences like this and should I have said something to promote positivity?

Am I alone in my interest in creating a world in which our natural bodies are accepted and cherished as beautiful, even while we maintain our rights to choose to do whatever we like to them?

t3_25hapz,"Need some POV on my bf's ""hobby""","He's always been a car nut.  Fanatic.  I thought it was cute.  Last year he was finally able to afford a nice flashy car that he adores.  Keeps it in showroom condition and has sunk money in for new tires/wheels, exhaust, with plans to do more.  This is money he sets aside from his paycheck plus he has taken out two loans against his 401k.  We're not married but tentatively talk about saving to buy a home, although we're not doing much of acting on that plan, obviously.  I put my entire check into the bank, aside from what goes into my 401k.  

He does a kind of racing (time trials only, no wheel to wheel) EVERY sunday, driving all over the state to participate so he has entry fee plus gas, plus occasionally hotel.  I frequently work weekends so it is not an option for me to go all the time, nor do I want to...I am not a car person, plus it isn't really a spectator sport.  Its out all day in the sun on asphalt watching cars go through cones.  We barely see each other when he isn't racing anyway.  He does well, but I don't feel I should have to go to every one.  He wishes I would, but he understands.

So I don't know why, but I feel kinda resentful about this in some way, because having a full weekend together with him is pretty much not an option.  He's even said as much...barring a vacation out of town or whatever, if there is an event, he wants to go.  It makes him happy and he shouldn't have to not do what he loves.  I agree, but I don't feel that asking for a Sunday every now and then is too much.  I don't know why he has to go to EVERY single one.  He says ""Because I enjoy it.""  He says we get plenty of time through the week and Saturdays, why am I begrudging him what he loves to do?  

I wouldn't ask him to stop for me, or to choose me over racing, but I'm feeling neglected here.  He never forgets a racing event, or scheduled things for his car, but our anniversary was a month and a half ago and I have yet to receive anything - and I mean anything - dinner, flowers, even a card.  This is the first one ever that this has happened.  This is a man who always has been really thoughtful and sweet with special occasions.  

As a side, I don't have any large scale hobbies myself - I like photography and reading and travel - but no one obsession like he does.  I would gladly go out and do my own thing on Sundays, but the thought of him NEVER being willing to give up his time for us, is...unsettling.  As in, rethinking my future with him unsettling.

Thoughts?

TL; DR:  BF obsessed with Sunday car stuff, how much is too much?

t3_25go71,"Long, non-painful ""period"" I can't get rid of... help?!","Prior to the pill and even during, my period was very light. 3-4 days long, no cramps or symptoms and maybe a tampon or two a day. A box would last me months and I never bled through. 

I had a large ovarian cyst in early December and when I went for a checkup in late January it was gone. When I was at my checkup I was on day 16 of a ""period"" that was a fairly steady flow. The practitioner at the clinic recommended I do a pause on my pill and let it bleed out. I followed her advice and it eventually stopped a few days later. 

Ive been taking a break from the pill since then. Also haven't had a period since then, but know they can be irregular after the pill. Monday the 5th (8 days ago) I started spotting. After a few days it got VERY heavy and I was going through like 5+ tampons a day, which may be usual for some people but definitely not for me. 

My boyfriend and I went shopping the day before yesterday and we were gone maybe an hour and a half and I started bleeding through my shorts... I stayed in the car while he finished, maybe 20 minutes... and by the time I got home the shorts were pretty red in that area. 

Then yesterday my puppy got into the bathroom trash while I was napping (boyfriend forgot to close the door) and when my boyfriend woke up I guess the puppy had scattered tampons and bloody toilet paper all over the house. My boyfriend didn't mention it until today cause he said he didn't want me to be embarrassed that he saw all that and cleaned it up. I mentioned that I'm annoyed its taking so long to end since we have a wedding to go to in three days and doesn't seem to be letting up  and that its a lot of blood and he agreed. He said he is worried about blood loss from what he saw (was only two days worth, but it filled my little bathroom trash. He's also a nurse if that matters, but he probably has no clue about periods lol so not sure what to think of his comment). 

Anyway, my main question is what is going on with me?! Will this period ever end?! There is no pain, lots of blood (some wet and some clots) and it seems to soak through everything so fast.

I had a mutual breakup with this guy, we'll call him Dave, a little over a month ago after dating for 4 months. We broke up because it was bad timing and I felt like he was pulling away from me. All I wanted to do the day we broke up was tell him I loved him, which I had never said before, but didn't because it would only make things harder.

Fast forward a month and he tells me he wants to talk. So we meet and he tells me that the reason he was pulling away was because of timing (he is a graduating senior in college and I am a junior) but mostly because the relationship he used to be in, which lasted 7 years, was with someone who was not only emotionally abusive but once hit him so hard in the face it fractured his jaw. And so when he started realizing he really cared about me and loved me, it brought all that back and started to scare him so he tried to pull away to feel safe, even though that wasn't what his heart wanted. 
 
So, it is finals week and I am stressing about grades super hard and now I'm hanging out more with Dave and he tells me he loves me but he is leaving in less than two weeks to probably live at home as he is not yet employed. And I enjoy time with him but Im scared that I don't know why I like him, and that maybe I loved him before because I just loved having a boyfriend?

On Saturday: My SO and I tried to have sex twice, and our communication completely failed, leading to our only huge fight in months. There was yelling, crying, and a shit ton of distress all around.

On Sunday: My SO and I had an 8 hour drive up to a city where he had a job in framing to start on Sunday, where I go to college during the school year, and where I plan to start working ASAP. We'd had some car troubles (just some vibrations), but had them checked out by TWO mechanics, who both said they couldn't find anything wrong and sent us on our way. The vibrations started up again during the drive, about 4 hours out, and we spent four hours trying to find a mechanic, driving away from our destination in no-man's-land, WV. Nothing. We put on a spare tire. Didn't fix it. We pulled off again and decided to switch back to the regular tire. While the car was jacked, we looked underneath and saw a HUGE chunk of plastic falling off the bottom of the car, such that it would hit the ground and cause the noise we'd been hearing. We cut it off and the sound was gone. 

That Sunday night we were supposed to move in together, into a room in a townhouse that I had checked out a few weeks earlier. I had noticed the house was a little messy and dirty, but I thought it wasn't too bad; we only needed a place to stay for 3 weeks. Well we walk in and it is absolutely filthy. There's hair everywhere, there are bugs, there's dirt, people's shit is all over the bathroom. We unpack as best we can at 11 o'clock at night. 

My SO was royally ticked at me. I was supposed to look at this place and give it the okay, but I didn't look for warning signs and now we were fucked. So he didn't touch me, look at me, or talk to me all night, while 3 hours earlier we were perfectly blissful in the car.

On Monday: He gives me a kiss on the cheek before he leaves for work. Progress. I spend all day unpacking even more and 3 hours cleaning the bathroom trying to make it a livable place for us. He gets home and he's sunburned (he's working for a construction company), sweaty, and miserable. We half-heartedly hug, and I give him some food that I ordered. We shower together, and he finally touches me when we switch who is in the water. Yay. The rest of the afternoon was miserable; we tried some ice from downstairs, and I swear, I think it actually poisoned us. Our throats were irritated, we couldn't stop coughing, he even threw up. So we said fuck it, and got the hell out. We went to a nearby park and talked in the car for hours about why he'd been so cold to me. We worked through it (though he's still angry with me for betraying his trust when I gave the apartment my approval). 

We get to bed that night around midnight after cuddling (at this point we haven't had sex since Friday, while our norm is daily). He shakes me awake around 1 am (keep in mind he has to wake up at 5:30 for his job) and there's FUCKING WATER dripping out of the ceiling onto him. We hear a huge thunder blast, knocking out the electricity for a few minutes. The water is still dripping out of a bubble on the ceiling. So we move the bed, stick some towels under the leak, and get some sleep.

Today: Today was looking up. We found another room to rent (much more expensive) that we will move into tomorrow. We are staying in a hotel tonight. We also scheduled for me to meet him for food 15 minutes from now. Unfortunately, I just went outside to my car, and lo and behold, the battery is dead. My SO had turned on the lights inside the car when we were unloading on Sunday, and he had left them on. I didn't notice either for the past 2 days. So now my car is dead, the one we need alive to move our stuff out, the room I'm in is hellishly hot and filthy, I haven't felt clean in days, I'm horny out of my mind, I'm guilty as hell about all of this, and I haven't eaten anything all day because we haven't had time to go buy groceries.

So to start off I am 23F and in a very happy relationship with an amazing guy. We have been offically together for about 4 months but have been very close for about 10 months, and Ive known him for over 7 years.

The problem I have is that he is waiting until marriage to have sex. Now I admire him for this, the amount of resolve he has to keep his morals is amazing, but I feel bad because I cant keep my urges under control.

For example, if Ive had a bit too much to drink I accidently try to take advantage of him (and my inhibited sense of judgement) and try to get it on. Usually it ends up with him sternly keeping me at bay and me being an emotional wreck, crying and whatnot. And we all know that feeling of when things get heating up and common sense and decency get pushed aside. 

I dont think any of this would be a problem if my previous relationship wasnt so different. I was in a relationship for almost 7 years, he was my first (pretty much first for everything), and we became sexually active with each other pretty early on in the relationship. Because if the length of the relationship and the amount of commitment we had for each other, it wasnt rare to have sex more than once a day. (that relationship though is entirely over)

**So my question now is** how do I deal with myself? I want this relationship to work out so I dont want to compromise it just because of this one issue.

I'm a condom-only girl precisely because I can see exactly when it's failed and can take steps to deal within hours (I know the emergency pill isn't 100%, but it's a step you can take, y'know?). I know most birth control has 97-99% success rate, so theoretically I'd be fine, but if it failed you wouldn't realise until you were into abortion territory (if you even noticed that early - what do you do if you have a ""silent"" pregnancy with a BC that stops periods and don't realise until you're out of the legal termination window? Or am I being crazy?). My boyfriend mentioned years ago that he'd like to go without a condom just to see what it's like, and when I explained why I wasn't keen he said it made sense and hasn't asked since. We've had a couple of failed condoms, but a morning-after pill later and it's all good (though I was shitting myself a little until my period started). I kind of want to be trusting enough to go for it so he gets the full effects of sex, but... eep...

t3_25h5qn,"Experiences with medical professionals?","I finally decided to talk to my Nurse Practitioner about terrible neck aches I have been getting for years. About two years ago, I told a different NP about my neck pain and her response was ""Just be glad you don't have chronic pain that affects you daily"" and rather snidely said she could refer me to a physical therapist. After that, I just decided to deal with it until this past month where the pain became a weekly thing. My new NP actually asked me questions about my pain and finally told me that I suffer from tension headaches. She gave me stronger pain-killers and some muscle relaxers as well as suggesting ways for me to reduce stress and loosen my muscles. I'm so relieved that she took my pain seriously and am really frustrated with the other NP who just brushed off my concerns. Has anyone else had similar experiences? What do you do about a medical professional who won't take you seriously?",0,20140513150055,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
