I've become a guru of removing blood stains because I have a feeding tube in my belly and the stoma seeps blood when irritated.

It's ok to let it sit even up to a week and dry before washing, (though if you're near a sink a cold water rinse before tossing dirty laundry won't hurt)! Before washing, place all soiled garments (moms and dads, this works on poo, pee, and vomit too) in a diluted cold water/hydrogen peroxide mix. Agitate lightly and let soak for up to an hour. Apply a paste of borax, dish soap (dawn is preferred by some but if I have a coupon, screw that), and water to any conspicuously stained areas and rub in gently. Throw everything in with your normal wash cycle (we use tide pods, but when broke I've used the dollar store brands) adding borax to the load per instructions on the box for the size of your washer/load. (Even on a front loader, put borax directly in with the clothing, not in the dispenser). We also put vinegar in the fabric softener dispenser, but stains should be gone by then so it's not necessary. We just have crappy hard water and vinegar is the only thing that keeps our laundry from feeling like steel wool.

From the point of view of your employers taking a female to a strip-club is a *Massive* liability in regards to a sexual harassment claim. I'm not suggesting you'd file that claim, but from your point of view if you insisted on going, made it clear you were fine with it and *then* got sexually harassed your argument would look weaker because you'd given prior consent and the defendants would suggest that you had insisted on going along to make the allegation up.

Not taking into account the legal implications of taking a person into an environment known to be unsafe for him or her, he honestly is trying to keep you safe.  

Also, from a business standpoint it's a bad idea.  If you have a potential client that's a known racist, you wouldn't send two black people to represent your company if you want to make a successful transaction.  Likewise, this potential client is a known objectifyer (Is that a word? Sorry!) of women.  If your business wants to be taken seriously, they should send people the potential client will see as actual people rather than brainless meatbags.

20140430155755,TheLeaderIsGood,"Hi

I proposed to my boyfriend and we're married now almost 8 years :D

> 1) I've always pictured the guy proposing... but don't actually have a problem with 'stepping up' and doing it. Women who've asked - does this stupid standard ever bother you in the back of your mind and you kinda, sorta wish you'd've waited for him to do it?

No way. I don't tend to wait around for someone else to live my life for me! I wanted to marry him, I thought we were ready and I wanted to give him a really great memory.

> 2) Will he be offended that I didn't wait for him to get the courage?

To be honest, if a man is offended at this beautiful and most complimentary gesture (highest compliment you can receive really), then wtf? What is wrong with him?

> He's very introverted but super romantic. I can tell he's genuinely thinking about it because of the glint in his eyes whenever the topic comes up (on tv, in our jokes, him really wanting my very intimidating dad to like him, etc.), but our first ""I love you"" story is of me stealing the words from him (I knew he was about to say it, he was teary eyed and nervous) and he says he was relieved. Not sure if proposing marriage is something he'd be relieved about if I beat him to it, too....

I don't think considering it a race is a good thing :) You're not 'beating him' to anything - you want to marry him, you love him, you want to tell him, you want to be married... it's a beautiful thing. Do it because you want to. You are two adults of equal standing in a loving relationship - there aren't roles you have to adhere to. 

> 3) How did you do it? Did you have a ring? Did you drop to one knee? Did he repsond the way you expected?

I gave him a day of spoiling for his birthday, which was the day I did it. So I took him shopping to buy him something nice to wear that night (thank you credit card), then went to the ballet in the Royal Opera House, then went to dinner (all on me, of course) and then afterwards we went for a walk down to the river and halfway across the bridge, I proposed. I didn't go down on one knee because I don't like the idea of one person begging or prostrating themselves when it's an equal partnership. Also I was wearing white :) He responded by saying yes through laughter and hugs... so I didn't hear the yes and had to ask him to say it again :)

I didn't have a ring because I guessed he wouldn't want one. We talked about it but neither of us could see anything good in one of us having a ring and one not having one - didn't really go with the 'us' and 'togetherness' of marriage. We also looked into the significance of an engagement ring and decided we didn't agree with it for us.

We've always had a very open & honest relationship and we knew one of us was going to propose at one time or another but neither of us knew who or when :) I HIGHLY recommend it - it really is a beautiful thing to be able to do for someone else. I love spoiling him and making him feel amazing and loved and I love that I was able to express my love for him in this way.",5,t3_24bpq4
20140430193249,sapzilla,"Excellent! I agree with all of your reasoning. I don't doubt that if I do ask, it'll make his *life* and will be the most romantic thing I could ever do in comparison to his constant gestures. 

I'm definitely not thinking of it as a race, though - wrong wording on my part. This is obviously something that needs serious thought and 100% good intentions, not just trying to beat someone to it. I'm really looking forward to it and just want to make the right decision for us (on whether I propose or not).

Anyway, love it! Very good 'story' and great memories! Your grandkids (if you have kids and such) will hopefully share that story during a show and tell or something, like I did with my grandparent's stories when I was little :)

Was that your experience?  How did you find out you are estrogen intolerant? Did you have different side effects with different pills? 

Sorry for the 20 questions, I'm just so sick and tired (ha... literally) and I want all the info I can get before going to see my gyno.",1,t3_24b9jl
20140430091111,letsgetknockedup,"Yeah, you know, if they're giving you issues like that, I say it's time to find another method, rather than give up birth control altogether.  =) 

I constantly had severe nausea, headaches, and eventually I developed atypical migraines.  The left side of my face went numb, then it twitched uncontrollably for weeks.  I had strange issues.  I wound up at the neuro who was convinced I was either having mini-strokes or that I had the early stages of MS.  It was terrifying, man.  

Turns out that's what estrogen does in women who are estrogen intolerant.  I'm at a very high risk for stroke if I take estrogens, or if I eat lots of soy.  Immediately got told to stop taking those pills and I got switched to the mini-pill, progesterone-only kind.

Night & day.  No more headaches, very minimal nausea, no more issues at all.  Migraines disappeared pretty much within 2 weeks, as expected.  

And yep, I did have different side effects from different pills.  It's been like, gosh, about 15 years since the first pills I got prescribed (which landed me in the urgent care clinic, I was so sick) but it was generally just awful altogether.  None of them but Micronor (minipill) and the depo provera shot have ever been good for me.

Depo isn't for everyone, but for me it was a life saving medication.  I had been bleeding for weeks and weeks, no sign of stopping, and I have really bad PMDD.  Depo about stopped the bleeding overnight, and I spotted for a few weeks (which is normal).  Then nothing for as long as I was on the shot.  I didn't gain weight, I didn't have any negative issues.  It was a dream, and *no period* to make me writhe in pain.  =) 

Hopefully this helps, and seriously, ask away!  I truly believe nobody should have to suffer through this stuff.  There's a solution for everything and you deserve to feel good!  ",1,t3_24b9jl
20140430111730,everysingletimegirl,"My concern with the depo shot is the going back in every three months. How down to the wire is it? Do you know? My gyno always books way out so I don't wanna have an accident because I couldn't get an appointment on time, ya know? 

It seems like the longer I'm on any given pill the more symptoms I have from it. Was it like that for you? Nothing bothers me when it's new to me. It's almost like it builds up too much in my system or something. 

I didn't take my pill last night and though I can't say I feel different, 
I am less bloated today, which is nice though possibly just coincidence. 

",1,t3_24b9jl
20140430112059,letsgetknockedup,"You have about a 2-3 week window where you need the next shot, so it's not like one day specifically.  My OB's office was great, and I'd schedule the next shot right after I got one.  We always went for about 2 weeks before the next shot was due, just to be safe.  Then if somebody got sick, or I had to be out of town, no big deal.  

So it's really more a range than anything.  =)  

And yeah, it was worse the longer I was on the pill, but everybody's different.  I think when we start realizing things are not going well, we become hyper-aware of the issues and that can make things seem worse.  ",1,t3_24b9jl

I'm on generic OTC (Tri Sprintec) and have been really happy with it (and is free through my insurance plan).

Definitely try the IUD, but know that it might not work for you. I tried it and bled for almost a year straight (full-on period, not just spotting).

2. Think it through. Could this possibly hurt your career later on? I know it sucks and is stupid, but there is still a stigma around stripping. Some professions do not look kindly on it, would it surface. This is of course also dependent on where you live but please consider it at before hand. 

3. Be realistic. Stripping has lately been painted in quite glamourous light. But just like being a MD can be mentally taxing or being a freelancing journalist is though there is the other side of stripping too. You may meet a lot of men who treat you like crap, you will meet women with very sad stories and quite possibly drug addictions.

My point is that sure, these are factors that should be considered, but some of these points are like they are fishing for a reason the article isn't true. They're trying to confirm their bias--it may not be true, but it was just the way I read the comments in the section. ",2,t3_24bzo5

Also, women don't end up in as many stem related fields which shows that there is some type of disparity going on. When we assume that girls don't do as well maybe there is a correlation that they can't get jobs in those fields.

That's where I think we really need to help girls. STEM does not need embody male dominated fields. That would probably also assist in the income disparity between men and women. STEM jobs pay better",2,t3_24bzo5
20140429222732,Noble_toaster,"I don't think high school grades are a very good indicator of knowledge. Yes an A student is almost always better than a D student but there's a lot more going on with grades than tests. Girls probably do homework, participate, and build relationships (or kissup) more than boys do. A guy with a 100 test average that's incredible at physics but doesn't do homework and sleeps in class will most likely get a worse grade than a girl with a 90 test average who does all her homework and tries really hard in class. In my experience girls are better students but guys are more knowledgeable. Grades are a fickle thing.",-8,t3_24bzo5

It should come as no surprise that after being branded as baby making machines for so long, we celebrate the fact that we can be as good as boys in every field.  Good grades generate pride, a feeling of self-worth and it could encourage more girls to go into stem related fields, if only society would back off from pressuring girls to get married and reproduce, and if people would just celebrate their grades instead of assuming that they come from ""kissing up.""

In addition, it has always been my position that girls simply don't care when it comes to science because they are discouraged by just about every single TV show, peer and family member they get in contact with, every step of the way.  Girls are still being groomed as wives, even if we want to think differently, they are.  Little girls still get toy kitchens and washing machines for their birthdays, instead of telescopes.  They are still conditioned from age 0.  And the person giving the gift is not even being an ass, because that is the general vision/perception of girls from the get go: that they will grow up to be someone's wife, and someone's mom, and we better get them their little toy kitchen so they can be trained and conditioned, despite all the accomplishment.  Why dream of being an astronaut and fight all the way, every day, with family disappointment, and face unjust competition, misogyny, suspicion (like yours), and have to prove yourself 400 times more than a man would have to, when you can just get married and make everyone happily shut up?

True, I don't think that grades are very good indicators of these types of things either, but I'm not sure where you are going with ""girls probably do homework"" and ""boys do this other stuff"". There is no objective way to test this.

To me, the best ""gift"" on Mother's Day is being able to get all of the good parenting stuff without having to do any of the work for the day. I like to be woken up to the kids climbing all over & to breakfast in bed. I like to sit outside with the family while they play but not have to wash their muddy hands and wash off their muddy boots when we go in. Also--this might sound really odd--I really, really enjoy the idea of everyone else doing the chores for the day. I'm a stay-at-home mom, so I don't think my husband's ever had to do the dishes or laundry or sweep. I ask him to do the chores on Mother's Day because it usually results in getting some compliments for just the daily jobs I do. It makes me feel appreciated. 

Growing up, I remember asking my dad what he'd want on Father's Day. He'd always say, ""For you kids to pick up your rooms."" We always groaned at him. Now, as a parent, I realize he really meant it! Maybe we should have cleaned our rooms...

I know that answer seems like a cop-out because none of those things are presents, but I think that's the best gift for a mom with kids at home. Give her a day where she doesn't have to do work around the house, but all of the work gets done. Let her just enjoy the good parts of parenting! 

In terms of an actual, literal gift, I'd go with flowers. It's the perfect time of year to plant some annuals. Go get some packs of flowers that she can plant (if she likes that kind of thing), and maybe the kids can help her plant the flowers. :) ",1,t3_24b9dv

My compliment does draw attention to the makeup or clothes, that's true, but I think it's more positive than directly asking why.

My step sister is fostering kids, and my baby sister is pregnant, and so it's been on my mind a lot, that when I'm ready for kids I may not be able to have them on my terms. ",2,t3_24d3ic
20140430144253,jrl2014,"But the BRCA mutation doesn't guarantee that you'll get breast cancer and the cancer is related to multiple genes. 

I'm not saying that you're not right about your chances, because your family history suggests that you are.

But its good you're talking to the genetics counselor because the BRCA mutation has become overhyped as deterministic.",2,t3_24d3ic
20140430154344,alli16_1,"I know it's not deterministic. And I know that even without a BRCA mutation I can develop cancer. But if I have one, Mr risks are much higher.

20140430203727,SJhelix,"I'm advocating to make sure that you are seeing a certified genetic counselor. The testing options for hereditary cancer have changed drastically over the past couple years. 


Given your mother's very young age at diagnosis, possibly considering testing for a panel of a number of hereditary cancer genes (including BRCA1/2 and others) may be appropriate for you. The genetic counselor will be aware of what panels are available for you. These panels may be called myRisk, or CancerNext, as an example, and include testing for multiple genes at the same cost as testing for BRCA1/2 only. 


If you are in the US, you meet any insurance company criteria for coverage of genetic testing - that I am aware of. Also, recent laws have gone into place to make genetic testing affordable for those who have not had cancer. It may be likely that there will not be any out of pocket cost to you ($0). The genetic counselor will discuss the testing process with you and what to expect and how the results could come back. If your results are normal/negative, increased screening for breast cancer may still be appropriate for you.

Best of luck!!


Edit: Disclosure - I am a cancer genetic counselor. I see patients in clinic, and do not work for any genetic testing lab. ",3,t3_24d3ic
20140501023457,alli16_1,"I live near a very prominent cancer research center. The appointment is with their genetic counseling department. I already know about increased risk I have for some other cancers, due to some other medical issues I've had, so not sure if I would want to be screened for more. I know knowledge is power, but it's already rough mentally having to worry about what I'm worrying about. But who knows, maybe it'd bring peace of mind. 

My first appointment will have some cost involved, and my insurance will cover more/less things depending on my decisions there. That's part of the rough part is knowing that if I'm positive and want to opt for mastectomy I'm on a timeline to have it covered at as high a percentage as it will be with my parents insurance. It's highly unlikely I'll be able to afford insurance nearly as good as theirs for the foreseeable future. It kind of feels like a now or never thing.",1,t3_24d3ic
20140501060322,SJhelix,"The decisions may not always be easy, but they are personal decisions. There isn't a right or wrong answer as to what to do (which test, screening vs. surgery) or when to do it (now vs. later) - it should be in your best interests for what works best for you, as long as it's medically reasonable/appropriate. 


With whatever the outcome and with whatever you choose, I wish you only the best. ",1,t3_24d3ic
20140430094109,letsgetknockedup,"Good for you.  

It's very difficult to get a doctor to take you seriously on this stuff.  I have a family history of ovarian and endometrial cancers, and even with multiple fibroids in both breasts and constant reproductive issues, it took until I was 30 and had a breast cancer scare to get the tests ordered.  I'm also an Ashkenazi Jew, which means I have genetic predisposition to a lot of things.  Thankfully my tests came back clear.  I got lucky. 

They were worth every damn penny I had to pay out of pocket for them.  Having that knowledge, especially *before* we started trying to have kids, meant a lot to me.  

I'm proud of you for taking charge of your own health.  You should be proud of yourself, too.  And I sure hope you get great results on the tests they give you.  ",2,t3_24d3ic
20140430183340,fireshine,"I'm 21 and last year found out I was BRCA + 

Like the other person said its not a death sentence you just have to be really careful and get a doctor that listens to you and doesn't dismiss you.  I decided that I will get my breasts removed when I'm 24 because I don't plan on having kids till I'm older and don't want to play the maybe Ill get cancer or I won't game. 

Did your grandmother or mom get tested? Because when I went to get my test they wouldn't test me unless they had results from both of them to look to see if I have either type of their mutations. In an odd way I was lucky(?) and had the same as my mother, who was a negative until she got cancer and it turned positive, so I'm taking the actions to prevent this. 

Don't get to stuck on doing it right away because its a whole lot to take in at once even if you knew about it forever. I figured I was positive since my mother passed when I was 13 and even getting the news I was freaked me out and changed a lot of things. 

But go find a doctor that specializes in this, I don't know where you life but I love my doctor I have she is perfect and does EVERYTHING she can to help me out. 

If you have any other questions just PM me :) I'm always willing to chat about it 

edit: Also screw your doctor refusing to help you get a mammogram, I just got one a month before I turned 21. It sucked big time but I came back clean :D",1,t3_24d3ic
20140501024104,alli16_1,"I definitely understand not wanting to play that game. That's why if I'm positive I'll likely opt for removal. It's so crazy to think about too though. So much if my identity and self image is tired to my breasts, which I hadn't really realized until I started seriously considering the what-ifs. 

 I've figured I was positive for 13 years, since my mom died. I'll be very surprised if I am not positive. And as I've said elsewhere if I don't do it quickly I likely won't be able to afford it for quite some time.  It's weird to go from keeping it on a side burner in my mind to having it be on my mind almost constantly.",1,t3_24d3ic
20140501032036,fireshine,"I saw in one of your other posts the concern of having children and passing it on, from what my doctor told me you can get your eggs removed and checked to make sure they don't carry it. I always thought I wouldn't because I don't want them to deal with this, but being able to know if they will/won't its awesome! 

The one way I deal with having to get my breasts removed is just think that they are one day going to try to kill me so I don't want them on me. I never really cared about them, I try to look on the positive and say hey I get a free boob job and no one can say shit about it! You have to turn the really shit situation into something positive!

20140501032923,alli16_1,"I'm sure if I'm positive I'll warm to the idea of reconstructive surgery. As I said elsewhere much of my identity, especially sexual identity, is tired to my breasts. so it's weird to think about losing that.",1,t3_24d3ic
20140501035023,fireshine,"It is a lot easier when it comes back with a positive. I cried like a baby and had a melt down in the doctors office but I had my boyfriend who fully supports me with all of this so it was way easier to face. Try to bring someone with you because they shoot a lot of facts at you and I found it easier to have someone to talk about that was there instead of relaying the facts later.

Another thing to do is to try not to see it as losing them, your just getting ones that will pretty much always be awesome and perky! I don't have much advice for that point because I don't feel that way but I know my mom had trouble after her surgery and never opted for reconstruction. As a little kid you don't notice that they don't look right because you don't have them/see others but thinking back I could see how it was an issue. 

Are you on birth control? If so YAY, my doctor says it helps protect your ovaries. I can't remember how exactly but its good to be on it if you aren't :)",1,t3_24d3ic
20140501040106,alli16_1,"My step mom is going with me for exactly that reason.

With reconstruction I'm worried about them requiring upkeep I can't afford. Plus depending on the type of risk reduction surgery, nipples may or may not be lost, and that kinda weirds me out. I also have fairly large breasts and wouldn't want to change that. Just a lot of different things that concern me. 

I'm not on birth control. My doctor told me it was less of a risk to get pregnant than it was to go on birth control because even though it reduces the risk of ovarian cancer it can increase the risk of breast cancer. I don't really care for my doctor and didn't like that she wouldn't prescribe it even though I'd researched it myself, but I'm not having frequent enough sex to fight that one because condoms aren't much of an inconvenience, and I've been dealing with other things with my OB so it oddly hasn't come up. I'd certainly like to go on birth control for the period regulation alone, but it's not been an issue worth pursuing.",1,t3_24d3ic
20140501045930,fireshine,"I understand the upkeep worries and the cost but I believe they last for a while, long enough for you to get insurance on your own. Most people have been able to save their nipples or you can get them tattooed on after or get something else in place of them. I have a smaller chest than you I can fit into a B but I don't fill it out. I'm also anti bras so I don't mind losing my nipples so I can always be bra free and not have hard nipples! 

I had positives from birth control, knowing when I get my period a little less acne. For some reason it didn't give me the positives like no acne and a lighter period but I just changed it so fingers crossed! I think it only increases your risk if it's hormonal breast cancer I'm pretty sure it says that right on the packet. There are also non hormonal types so I think you should start talking to a specialist on this subject. 

Have any of your other siblings gone and got tested? I have a sister who is a year younger than me and hasn't gotten tested yet. I feel like she hasn't because she'll finally have to face what caused my mothers death and that was hard on her since my mom was her rock. ",1,t3_24d3ic

So save that deposit and move out! It will be better for you in the long run, as the time **will** come that he gets a new girlfriend/FWB/fling/whatever. By that point, you either need to be emotionally ok with seeing him with someone who is not you **or** you need to be long moved out. 

As far as interacting with him, does he initiate any flirting/sexual contact? Have you guys had ex-sex/fooled around/etc since you moved in? If that has happened, and you don't want or can't handle it being no strings, you need to put an end to it.

I know one of the biggest challenges of moving was the loneliness of living alone. That being said, I now adore it.

* Read, read, read. Books are truly the best company. If you want any recommendations, PM me.

* Learning to cook. Pinterest has become my best friend (and my waist line's worst enemy).

* Exercise. This is coming from someone who *hates* running. But, I've been taking cycling classes at my local YMCA and doing yoga at home and I'm actually enjoying it. 

* On that note, yoga. [This girl](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjgXQkHWH453km2BpJqYHzmkUkkjH5IB) has a YouTube channel with a wonderful 30 day program, if you are interested. 

* Write. I'll blog till my fingers hurt! So great to vent with no inhibitions. 

* Listen to podcasts. Great background noise for mundane tasks like dishes or laundry. Comedy, literature, news, whatever (although, you can never go wrong with This American Life). 

* Practice improving my makeup skills. /r/MakeupAddiction is the best place for advice, tips, tutorials, so on. And it's fun!  

* LOTS of Netflix. Just finished House of Cards...for the second time.

20140430210704,Lisse24,"I want to repeat what Lil_Boots said in a reply so that you get proper treatment.

You have what is known as PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome, or PCOS.  It is a metabolic disease for which the biggest symptom is multiple cysts on the ovaries.  These cysts affect numerous other hormones, which is what caused the acne.

PCOS most likely affects one in ten women, however, because it often goes undiagnosed and is still largely ignored by the medical profession, it's hard to know what an accurate number is.  Personally, I was diagnosed at fourteen, but wasn't told that I was diagnosed until I was in college.

As Lil_Boots1 said, BC is often given to help regulate hormones, which the cysts throw off.  Some women with PCOS, however, feel that because BC does not solve the problem of the cysts, that this is not an ideal treatment.

PCOS has a strong correlation with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.  There is some evidence that treating the insulin resistance will result in reduced cysts.   These women eat a low-carb or diabetic diet, exercise, and take extended release metformin, as well as seeing an endocrinologist for treatment instead of just a gynecologist.

You can find reproductive endocrinologists who specialize in treating PCOS, however these doctors sometimes focus on women actively trying to get pregnant.

It should be noted that some women eschew medicine altogether and try to treat their PCOS solely through natural means.  I did this for several years when I was without health insurance.  However, now that I have insurance, I've been shopping around for a doctor that I feel comfortable with.

I hope this is helpful to you.  You can find more information and connect with other woman who have PCOS at [/r/PCOS](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcos) and [http://www.soulcysters.net/](http://www.soulcysters.net/)

In PCOS, we have LH being produced at a higher rate while FSH is being inhibited. This results in a build-up of androgens and an inability for your ovarian follicles (eggs) to be released and they eventually turn into cysts.

It was a different time though. My mother had them when she was younger but they went away after having children. I have no children and its only gotten worse as I get older. I have had many doctors inform me that if I was to have children it could go away completely or get worse. There is no way of knowing because they still don't understand what causes the condition. I have been dealing with it for so long that I have done a lot of study on it and even gone as far as to do a research project when I was in college.  I found that 2 out of 20 woman NEVER had ovarian cysts but the other 17 did at some point.

The company I worked for had obscure rules based on random Medicare policies published in god-knows-what year.

20140501065505,mundabit,"I had the total opposite issue in Australia, I was seeing a physiotherapist for continance issues and was paying out of pocket, I couldn't afford it so I hunted around, found a PT who was cheaper because she was only qualified to deal with sexual dysfunction, I figured 'better than nothing' turns out that she is covered by insurance almost completely.

I dug a bit deeper and found that the real reason the sexual dysfunction PT is covered and the continence PT is not is because the sexual function PT puts her claims in as ""preventative"" treatment because treating pelvic pain when its just pelvic pain can help avoid incontinence and prolapse. Insurance companies are more likely to pay for preventative treatments then they are for actually fixing an illness.

This isn't a big deal in Australia and doesn't normally effect rebates. What was effecting my rebate was that the incontinence PT was being processed as ""Gastroenterology Physiotherapy"", gastroenterology is covered by public healthcare, Physiotherapy Is covered by private,  ""Gastroenterology Physiotherapy"" is covered by neither. it was the horrible limbo of coverage. The sexual dysfunction Physiotherapy falls solely under physiotherapy and pain management, so it is covered by private.

I'm thankful because my funds are low and the few people I talked too about borrowing money have laughed in my face, saying that 'sexual dysfunction' is not a real thing and 'so what' if it hurts all the time, I'm a woman and my pleasure doesn't matter. (in not so many words)

20140430165513,fatedperegrine,"Your provider or the medical coder (if they have one) may not have used the correct diagnosis code.  The diagnosis code has to prove medical necessity for the procedure.


For example, a MOHS surgery is a specialized surgery for skin cancer and will not get paid if I send it out with a code for a benign (non-cancerous) lesion.

They need to go to the BCBS website and look up the CPT code and what BCBS states is medically necessary.  Or, most insurance companies follow Medicare guidelines.  They can look up Medicare LCD Guidelines and that will often show what diagnosis code is considered medically necessary.

NOW...they can't just change the code to something random to get it paid, but they can look at the information and then back at her medical record and make sure they coded it correctly.

Get your wife to call them and get more detailed information.  The first line of defense should be the medical office filing a Provider Appeal form through the BCBS website.  They can also file a BCBS Reconsideration.  THEY should be fighting this...not you.  

ALSO...make sure they filed your BCBS to the Local BCBS.  What this means is that if you have BCBS of IL but are currently in Alabama...they need to file it to the BCBS of Alabama...NOT BCBS of IL.  I get claims denied for funky reasons sometimes because we put the wrong address in.

I know this was a lot of jargon, but you can literally read this word for word to the coder if you want.  They SHOULD understand it.  If they don't...I'm very very sorry.

20140430193257,hmfn,"As a medical coder, I agree with the advice given.  Are you positive it was denied due to the diagnosis code?  If so, as previously stated, the billing entity in the office is able to review the medical history and provide another diagnosis.  Before just taking a shot in the dark with diagnoses x, y and z - they should research your insurance companies policies and what is a ""covered diagnosis"".  

Another possibility is that there was no authorization obtained.  Yes she is seeing an in network provider but for services such as therapy, they 9/10 times require a preauth.  For example, my boyfriend had back surgery in November.  Part of his post-op course included PT and the office failed to obtain an auth.  They tried to bill us for the services even though the fault clearly lied with them.  They obtained a retro-authorization and resubmitted the claims which were then paid.  The company could have even obtained authorization but failed to indicate the auth number on the claim itself.  

There are a large number of reasons it could have been denied.  Please obtain the denial code from your EOB or directly from a customer service rep.

20140430191054,laebot,"There are two kinds of codes that are submitted with any claim: CPT and ICD codes. CPT codes are for procedures/treatments. ICD codes are for the diagnosis. For example, if you get an X-ray because you have a broken arm, the CPT code would be for ""X-ray"" and the ICD code would be for ""broken arm"". 

Some plans have what are called ""exclusions"", where it is written into the plan what procedures and/or diagnoses are covered, and what aren't. It has nothing to do with medical necessity, it's just the plan. It is actually the *employer* who decides which plan you get, thus dictating the extent of your coverage. 

If the CPT or ICD code is just an exclusion of your plan, you are pretty much SOL. It could be that the PT submitted a combination that BCBS does not accept (""you can't do that treatment for that diagnosis"").

Exclusions are super frustrating and it's *really* tough to fight them, because there isn't a ""reason"" for it-- it's just the restrictions of the plan. It's also probably important to understand that this is not the *insurance company* creating the exclusion, it's the *plan your employer selected*. If you were on a different plan, BCBS would approve it.

I'm a speech therapist who submits to BCBS and run into this issue all the time. I've learned that you should NEVER assume that any particular treatment/diagnosis is covered without verifying your plan details first. Some of my BCBS patients are covered for stuttering, for example, and others are not. It all depends on what BCBS plan the employer selected.",6,t3_24dxxd

20140430232607,dateadvicethrowawy,"In regards to you being assaulted: I don't think they're employing a double standard or saying that it's okay, yet other stuff is not. You went through something traumatic and they're trying to reassure you about your baby. And they're right, your body is strong and meant to withstand a lot-- one kick is probably not going to hurt your baby. 

The difference between that and other restrictions you're facing is that getting kicked was an acute incident that was out of your control. The only thing they could do there was mitigate the consequences after the fact, which luckily turned out to not be harmful in the long run. However, it sounds like maybe they weren't sensitive to your emotional reaction to being assaulted and assumed that you were only fearful about your pregnancy.

Most of the other stuff you're being prohibited from doing are chemically related and are things that the doctors are worried are going to affect the development of your baby. So they are more long-term concerns that you have control over in a preventative sense.

Basically, people are trying to keep you as healthy and safe as possible so they're being overly cautious. However, I can understand how it would be incredibly frustrating to feel like you're banned from all of these things, especially when former generations did them without consequence.

I would advise you to just eat healthy and listen to your instincts when it comes to your body. Loosely follow those guidelines prohibiting you from certain things and if you're going to break them, enjoy them in moderation (or at a minimum). 

For instance, in Ireland pregnant women used to be told to drink a Guinness a day because the iron was good for them. It didn't appear to do any harm. And many women in France still drink a glass of red wine a day when they're pregnant. [Here](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/pregnant-women-glass-wine-day-fine-study-article-1.1375559) is a study saying that drinking a glass of wine a day when pregnant is fine!

So of course take care of yourself, listen to your doctors, and be careful not to go overboard, but use your best judgement when it comes to what limitations you place on your body.",3,t3_24eq40
20140430202210,Lil_Boots1,"It's not a double standard. It's recommendations that are made to protect you, your future child, and the spa's liability. Fetuses and babies are this kind of paradoxical mix of fragile and durable, and sometimes you can drop a baby from a changing table and they're fine but they fall on their backs from a seated position and they're hurt. So not only do we say ""Don't leave your baby unattended on a changing table,"" we also say, ""Put a pillow behind a baby who's just learning to sit up."" But 99.9% of the time, a baby will be fine in both situations.  

And just as we've gotten smarter with baby safety (think of people in my parents' generation who spent their first months living in drawers or laundry baskets and people in my generation who had those cribs where the side slid down that babies could fall out of easily) we've become more aware of what's risky during pregnancy. It's still up to you to make those decisions for yourself. I'm sure a PubMed search for the different things you want to know about will give you odds ratios and what the risk really is. 

The only thing is that you can't expect someone else to give you what you want when you are in a position to turn around and sue them. For example, if the spa gave you a massage knowing you're pregnant and you miscarried, then you could sue them because they knew massages increase the risk of miscarriage in first trimester pregnancies, so they're going to refuse service to all women in their first trimesters. But if there's something you really want to eat (aside from large quantities of tuna) then go for it, in moderation of course. ",6,t3_24eq40

You don't need to risk yourself getting sick right now.   And as you probably know some sicknesses will hurt baby.  If our parents or grandparents may not have worried about as many details,  but I know in my grandmother's generation about half the kids didn't live past age 5.    I'm old enough that my generation put in a car seat and our oldest car had no seat belts at all.  I survived but some kids didn't.   The safety guidelines are there for a good reason

There are only a few big things I think to be careful about.   In my case,  I had had to ask my partner to clean cat boxes (toxoplasmosis).  And I do miss the occasional beer.

20140502082832,_strawberries_,"I have two issues.


The first is that this study only measured girls who fell into one of two categories, either called fat by their parents or not. 18% of American children are obese, and 1/3 of children are overweight, and parents are *typically* not sadistic, so you know the pool of girls being called fat were collectively not thin. (You could go so far as make a very safe assumption that a large number of these children were chubby, but this assumption is not necessary.) Therefore, the study measured what happens when not thin girls are called fat---it does not measure how thin girls respond. Therefore the title is misleading because it implies all girls are influenced in the same way.


My major issue, though, is that the study can be interpreted in two ways. The first is that calling girls fat increases their likelihood of becoming obese (direct relationship), and the second is that a relationship was established between girls who are called fat and girls who become obese (correlation). 

The first interpretation says that the act of calling a girl fat increases her chances. No where is this proven. After this study, for all we know, these parents are simply noticing that their children are heavier and they would have grown up to become obese anyway. This could have been better proven by testing a group of girls who were not fat but were called fat by their parents. Would they also have a higher risk of becoming obese?


The second interpretation says ""Hey, we noticed a pattern, but better, more detailed research needs to be done before we can claim a direct relationship."" Because we can't claim the act is responsible for increasing the chances.",1,t3_24ffm5

You deserve to hear an apology, not the other way around.

 You might know that a Brown student recently held a press conference regarding the fact that another student who the university found responsible for strangling and raping her was [invited back to campus after only a one-year suspension](http://feministcampus.org/brown-university-a-safe-haven-for-rapists/) [trigger warning for sexual assault]. 

In response, Brown students have written 16 specific demands of the university for overhauling its sexual assault policy and education program. It's really important to put public pressure on this administration, which hasn't always been very receptive to students' suggestions.

I agree it'd be good for the university to hand down harsher punishments for people they *know* are guilty of serious crimes, but if they're just kinda, pretty sure, they kind of have to balance their certainty of guilt of certain crimes against the seriousness of the crimes.

> 1\. Require that all students found culpable of sexual misconduct be, if not expelled, suspended from the University for at least two years, or until the victim in question graduates; whichever is longer.

This kind of harsh punishment only makes sense in the light of rather serious accusations. And very serious accusations are criminal matter and need to be tried. 

> 2\. Adopt a definition of affirmative, inclusive consent as the standard for consent in the Student Code of Conduct.

Again, this is a matter of law. Universities have no business defining their own version of consent. 

This is a group of students, who have some power in their academic institution, trying to form their own paralegal system that they can have some control over. That's not how it works. ",7,t3_24ezgt
20140430210911,concerned_studnt,"Dude... the university is a private institution. It gets to set rules. **No one is legally entitled to a Brown education.** If you're found to have violated the code of conduct--for which there is a formalized process, and for which the standard is a ""preponderance of evidence,"" then you're subject to punishments. 

If you steal from your workplace, your boss doesn't have to go through the criminal justice system in order to fire you. Cheating on tests is not against criminal law, but a university can still punish you for it. 

Sure, maybe the university invites lawsuits for expelling someone, but that's true of all expulsions, and I'd rather the school put its students' safety before its fear of a lawsuit. 

I really suggest that you read up on the differences between the criminal justice system and a university's own disciplinary system, because they are very different--different processes, standards of evidence, and punishments, and there are lots of reasons why a survivor of sexual assault would choose to use only one and not the other.

Also--I think you mean ""pseudolegal,"" which I suppose is sort of what the disciplinary system is, but for good reason--you don't want your university disciplinary system to be the same thing as the criminal justice system. ",0,t3_24ezgt

I just got my Mirena put in this morning, so I don't exactly have much to comment on, but I can tell you about the insertion process since it's still fresh. The way I understood the drug that dilates you is typically more painful then helpful, increases your cramps, etc. They try to avoid prescribing it unless it's really necessary. As far as pain killers (vicodin or whatever you were thinking for after the procedure) are also pretty unnecessary. You shouldn't need more then some tylenol after. I took one 650 mg tylenol 45 minutes before, and one 3 hours later.

I asked the doctor to give me the cervical block, mostly as a peace of mind because I was completely panicking. I made it out to be 100% worse than it actually was. She started off with the speculum, then sprayed betadine. Next, she gave me 4 shots to numb me. Honestly, the shots weren't nearly as bad as I thought they would be. They felt like small pinches, nothing unbearable. She put the tenaculum on to steady my cervix. By this point, I didn't feel anything. She then did the measuring (sounding) which felt like a tiny cramp, but again, I was pretty numb. She grabbed the Mirena and measured it out, and said she was going to try to get it in. I literally didn't feel a thing, I thought she was lying to me when she said it was in. She cut my strings and then stepped out so I could get dressed. I got cleaned up, she had me make sure I could feel my strings so I knew what to look for, and I was done. I had some cramping around the time I got home and laid down, but it was nothing that another tylenol couldn't help. I took a nap, woke up, and have felt great ever since. I didn't take another tylenol, and I have yet to bleed. All in all, I was completely surprised by my experience and how badly I made it out to seem in my mind. I would honestly say that the speculum was the most uncomfortable part of the whole thing.

I would ask if you could get a xanax or anti-anxiety med to help calm you down before the procedure. Is it possible for you to find a doctor that could do the numbing? ",1,t3_24ezv3

You're not going to get much support for your actions, because they are selfish. You don't want to help these people, you are doing this for yourself. You want a relationship with Troy, possibly also to be a knight in shining armour who swooped in and saved the damsel in distress and the poor innocent little baby.

If you look at this objectively, you are not helping him, you are just joining in the pattern of him running from one woman who is in charge of him to the next. His mother, his wife, you ... and there will be another after you when things aren't all sunshine and kittens (and life is never all sunshine and kittens). It is *not* a healthy pattern to blame everything in your life on another person and sit there til someone rescues you.

Other commenters are totally right in telling you that you will just be another link in the chain - the first sign you'll get that something is wrong is when the new woman contacts you to tell you how you have ruined his life and she has saved you from him.

Consider this too - if he leaves the child in that house, what does that say about him? If he gets custody, are you willing and ready to become a stepparent to this child? You will have to deal with Molly and her family for the rest of your life if you do. And when the next girl comes along - you'll either be ripped from the kid's life, or left raising them as a single mother, along with any other kids you two have.

Is this the life you dreamed of as a child? Did you grow up hoping to find a partner who is so weak, so controlled by others, earning barely enough to support himself, and constantly getting into bad situations because he can't stand on his own two feet?",5,t3_24f294

You do not love a person when you contribute to adultery, divorce, a life separate from their child and encourage a mininum wage worker to incur 18 years of child support. Long after you are forgotten Molly will be a struggling single parent. Troy will be an impoverished, absent father and an innocent child will miss out on having a whole family. If you loved anyone you would be encouraging Troy to work things out with his wife. But that's the problem. You clearly don't love yourself let alone Troy. If you loved yourself you would want better for yourself. You would feel like you deserved a man who is single and emotionally mature.

20140501160456,playingdecoy,"Okay, I'm back.

For my dissertation project, I interviewed 30 pregnant or recently-pregnant (had given birth in the last 12 months) women who had, at some point in their pregnancies, used alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs (including illegal substances but also misuse of over-the-counter or prescription meds). I asked them to tell me their ""life stories"" or ""personal myths"" (not in that language, of course) and then asked them about key scenes from their lives, like low points, high points, turning points, childhood memories, etc. Then I asked them about some motherhood stuff, like their experiences as mothers and with their own mothers, who their motherhood role models were, where they learned how to be mothers, what they thought ""good mothers"" did/how ""good mothers"" behaved, ummm... oh, and then stuff about their experiences seeking and receiving substance abuse treatment and medical care, any barriers they encountered, how they navigated the medical, social service and criminal justice agencies they encountered, etc.

Beyond the theoretical stuff I was exploring in the dissertation, I tried to get at a lot of practical things. Relevant to the TN law, I found:

* The women I interviewed, especially the ones using what we'd consider ""hard"" drugs (like cocaine, heroin, meth) often had *horrific* histories of trauma and abuse. They were often homeless at a young age. 18 of 30 women in my study were victims of childhood sexual abuse, usually by fathers, stepfathers or other male relatives. Many women had gone on to be teenage or adult victims of sexual and physical abuse.

* Access to reproductive health care, especially abortion, was a big issue. Some of the women in my study were in extreme financial distress. When they found themselves pregnant, several women in the study wanted to get an abortion - one never wanted children and felt she was too young and unprepared to parent, another had three young children already and was struggling to pay her bills. These women wanted abortions but couldn't get the $570-ish together in time. The first girl I mentioned had a boyfriend who promised to get the money but then he didn't, and by the time all that was clear, it was too late for the abortion. She said they tried having him punch her in the stomach and throw her down stairs to cause a miscarriage but it didn't work. The second woman I mentioned, who had three kids already, just said ""You can't get an abortion if you can't pay your light bill."" I felt like this really represented the situation many women faced: at least if they had the child, they could get some social services to help with food and clothing. As pregnant women, they were kinda SOL.

* Treatment is more complicated than the public thinks. For starters, what is ""treatment""? Many types of treatment are not very effective - I'm not an addiction specialist, but I can say that many treatment programs have HIGH rates of relapse. It's part of the addiction cycle, and many women in the study who HAD managed to quit said that it was just a matter of them being ready to do so - they could go to as many treatment programs the court could send them to, but if they weren't ""ready,"" it didn't stick. Methadone treatment was a really good option for women who were using opiates, but it doesn't work for women who use other substances - those women usually ended up quitting by themselves (or not quitting). What became obvious as I went through the interviews was that there is only ONE residential treatment facility in my state that will accept pregnant women. Once the women in my study were pregnant, they were pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place: they needed to get treatment to stop using, but they couldn't find a treatment facility to take them (or they couldn't afford it, or had nobody to watch their older children, or had no transportation to get there, or didn't know how to find a facility) - but because they were pregnant, people would turn them away. Some women wanted to go cold-turkey and just have a doctor watch them while they detoxed, but doctors and nurses didn't want the liability, because withdrawal from some substances can cause miscarriage.

* People often police the decision of poor, substance-using women to have children. Some of the women in my study mentioned why they wanted to be mothers. For the women who mentioned it, they talked about how their children are the *only people* they have in this world. These women came, as I said, from backgrounds of trauma and abuse. Some of them had no relationships with family members anymore. It was really touching but heartbreaking when one mother explained to me that she intentionally got pregnant at 15 just ""to have somebody who would love me and who I could love back.""

* Another interesting thing I found was that several women had come into contact with the CJ system and faced consequences for their drug use *because they had been victims of intimate partner violence*. For example, one woman was pregnant and smoking marijuana - it was her way of self-medicating her depression and anxiety because she was trapped in a violent relationship. One night, she and her boyfriend got into an argument about him leaving his pornographic magazines where her children could find them, and he started hitting her. Her neighbors called the police, and when they showed up, they drug-tested her. She tested positive for THC. She was living in public housing at the time, so she got evicted (because of the police call - IPV victims are supposed to be protected, but nope), and the next day CPS showed up and took all of her children and put them in foster care. When she had her baby a few weeks later, they took him immediately and put him in foster care, too. It took her a YEAR to get her kids back - for marijuana use! Stories like this made women in my study hesitant to rely on the police for help, because they felt it was just as likely that they would suffer even *more* for having invited the police into their lives.",16,t3_24g6kn
20140501215929,MeloJelo,"Stuff like that happens fairly often in poor communities (and probably some wealthier communities less often).

20140501144113,tn_throwaway1,"Just to be clear this law does not apply to alcohol, as TN defines narcotic drug as:

> (17) ""Narcotic drug"" means any of the following, whether produced directly or indirectly by extraction from substances of vegetable origin, or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis:

> (A) Opium and opiate, and any salt, compound, derivative, or preparation of opium or opiate;

> (B) Any salt, compound, isomer, derivative, or preparation thereof that is chemically equivalent or identical with any of the substances referred to in subdivision (16)(A), but not including the isoquinoline alkaloids of opium;

However, they don't really define what an ""addiction recovery program"" is. I would think that it would depend on how the courts interpret that phrase. If I was a judge, if someone wasn't using drugs for the last 8 months of their pregnancy, I would find it hard to believe that they hadn't completed an ""addiction recovery progam"" given the law states no requirements for what an addiction recovery program is. It also states no requirements for ""successful completion"" of the program.

The ""generation"" of a progestin is meaningless - [Public Citizen asked the FDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desogestrel#Controversy) to ban 3rd gens (Desogestrel) because of increased clot risk. Public Citizen advocated for 2nd gen instead of 3rd gen.

'Progestin' refers to a class of chemicals which are sort-of similar to Progesterone.

I know a lot of women feel insecure about either the way their legs look (especially the knees. Why do so many people hate their knees?) or selfconsious about the whole breeze thing.

""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" is a joke (or anti-joke) because the audience is expecting some sort of explanation that is abnormal or interesting, but the banal answer of ""to get to the other side"" renders the entire thing into an absurdity.",-2,t3_24gfr1
20140501181033,funkless_eck,"Professional comedian here! 

A lot of writing is to establish ""callbacks,"" and even on one-liners what you're looking to do is create ""in-jokes"" with your audience. All comedy is something you can identify with. Mostly gags will get cut if not enough people can identify with them. 

No matter how oblique or surreal the gag: you're always the person on the outside looking in and thinking ""How WEIRD."" ",3,t3_24gfr1
20140501184754,Othello,"Yes, all true, but I think that using terms like ""identify"" are a bit ambiguous. When someone identifies with a joke, it doesn't necessarily mean they agree with the subject matter, it just means that they are familiar with it or understand it. Finding a joke funny doesn't mean that you agree with the subject matter at hand, or that you share a particular belief with regards to it. The idea that all jokes have an underlying moral message that you need to agree with to enjoy them is just... reaching.

I'm going to butcher a joke here for the sake of brevity in explaining what I mean, since today my joke switch seems to be off:

An angel brings a male and female statue to life in a park, winks at them and says they can do anything they want for the next hour. So they run to the bushes, from which sounds of mischief and giggling emerge, while the angel blushes. They come back out 15 minutes later and begin to thank the angel who tells them they still have 45 minutes left and grins. The female statue gets really excited, turns to the male statue and says ""this time **you** hold the pigeon down and **I'll** shit on it's head!""

The joke sets up the expectation that the statues are going to have sex and takes you by surprise with the punchline, as jokes are wont to do. It does **not** mean that I believe in angels, it does **not** mean that I think about statues having sex, it does **not** mean that I think it's okay to abuse animals, and liking this joke does **not** make me a bad person.

Now, one could make the argument that sexist or racist jokes are wrong as they perpetuate and remind people of terrible things. However, that is something else entirely from saying that finding a particular joke funny makes you sexist or racist.


Do you disagree?",1,t3_24gfr1
20140501185737,funkless_eck,"If a joke led you to believe it was going to be racist and then wasn't - that'd be comparable. Other wise racist jokes rely on the audience being sympathetic with the racism. ",1,t3_24gfr1
20140501190530,Othello,"You're sort of hand-waving my question here. You didn't address any aspect of the joke, you're just saying it's not comparable because of the twist. That's not true though, because the punchline isn't simply ""you thought this was a sex joke but it's not!"", the thing the statues are doing is in itself absurd.

In other words, this joke sprang surprise animal abuse on you. If you want to narrow the field of comparison here, a more similar joke would be a regular joke that sprung surprise racism on you. Now the argument put forth is that finding a racist joke funny makes you racist, so then it follows that finding a joke about animal abuse funny makes you an animal abuser, or that you think animal abuse is acceptable. The logic is faulty.",2,t3_24gfr1
20140501145315,Pixelated_Penguin,"To find ""why did the chicken cross the road?"" funny, you have to share the teller's assumption of a set of reasonable reasons a chicken would cross the road, and everything else is outside that set. Then, further, you have to share a cultural context, where jokes are expected to be unexpected. It's not a good example of a joke, because it's sort of a meta-joke... a commentary on conventional punchlines.

If you told this joke to someone who either had no experience with conventional English-language humor (or similar forms), or who had only the vaguest notion of what either a chicken or a road was, they wouldn't find it funny. They wouldn't find it *offensive* either, probably; the notion that ambulatory flightless domesticated birds might find occasion to change which side of the throughway they are on isn't, after all, offensive to most people. (Possibly it is to some birds, but squawk squawk squawk).

Here's another one for you: ""Why did the turtle cross the road? To get to the Shell station."" Finding this joke funny requires that you are aware that there's a brand of gasoline called Shell, sold in stations, as well as that turtles are an animal which has a shell. (It also helps if you're familiar with the chicken joke, but it's not strictly required... this is a pun that can stand on its own.) Without either of those pieces of shared knowledge, the joke falls flat.

The assumption of shared bigotry works in a very similar way as these much more basic examples of shared knowledge. Thank you for illustrating the point precisely.",13,t3_24gfr1
20140501151102,Othello,">It's not a good example of a joke, because it's sort of a meta-joke... a commentary on conventional punchlines.

>The assumption of shared bigotry works in a very similar way as these much more basic examples of shared knowledge. Thank you for illustrating the point precisely.

It's just intellectually dishonest is all, as is changing my point to make yours.

I mean most of your point here is that shared knowledge is required for a joke to be funny. And that's true, though incredibly obvious. You can't find something funny if you don't understand what I am saying to begin with. The dishonesty, which is what I was pointing out and which you ignored, comes from the logical leap required to conflate knowledge with consensus.

I had a feeling this is what you meant, but I wasn't sure (and I could still be wrong, my brain is being a little sluggish today, so feel free to correct me). The problem with that, in the context of this discussion, is that your assertion isn't a fact.

In other words, it seems as if you are saying that a blonde joke is A) funny to someone because they know blonds are dumb, while B) it's not funny to some people because they know that there are people who actually think this is true.

My issue is that you are treating this as black and white, that by not falling into column B you automatically fall into column A, whereby you think all blondes are dumb. While you may have a valid point that someone reciting a blonde joke may be doing something morally wrong by spreading this sort of stereotype, once again, my point is that telling the joke or finding it funny does **not** mean you actually feel that blondes are dumb, nor does it mean you think it would be okay to treat an actual, real blonde person badly.

A lot of it largely comes down to the distinction between fantasy and reality. A joke is fictional, it's understood that jokes are distortions, and enjoying one does not mean I would enjoy doing or thinking these things to or about a real person. It's the same exact argument that's been presented against books, movies, music, comics, RPGs, and video games, that acts within these creative mediums (of which humor is a part) are directly analogous to real life, that only deranged people could enjoy them or that they will corrupt normal people into this evil way of being, and it's never been true.

Again, certain arguments could be made that it contributes to a more lax environment, one which is welcoming to people with these prejudices or what have you, or that the jokes are hurtful to people in these joked about groups, but that is a different issue to the one which we are discussing.",1,t3_24gfr1

I have laughed at many dumb blonde jokes, despite the fact that I am blonde and not dumb and do not believe that being blonde makes someone dumb or that a blonde person is more likely to be dumb than any other person. The joke happens to be pointing at blondes, but overall is more about a funny situation or funny response to a situation that this fictional dumb blonde has found themselves in. I don't have to believe that blondes are dumb (and I don't) to get the humor behind a blonde joke, and I think the same can be said for jokes employing other types of humor. I don't have to think blondes are stupid to think the joke is funny, I have to think the situation or response to it is funny.

People don't have to like them and good for you and anyone else if they have never laughed at a racist, sexist, or bigoted joke, but I don't agree that you have to believe in the premise to find the joke funny.

I think he would disagree with you. He says as much in his quotation in the article. He will not apologize for jokes. Humor is subjective.

Hell, Dave Chapelle had a routine about Micheal Richards infamous use of the ""N Word"". He basically says that he sees himself as a comedian more than he does as a black man, and felt some sympathy when he watched Richards on stage. 

One persons offensive is another persons funny. There isn't anything wrong with his joke at the end, it's just that it was supposed to be an apology and not a comedy stage.

Over the past year, I have purchased three different cups and practiced ad nauseum and have had zero success. They seem like they are sealing but constantly leak, the tails and/or grip ridges rub uncomfortably, sometimes they press on my bladder and make me feel like I have to pee, it takes me 10-15 minutes to insert every time (inserting and reinserting to make sure it seals, which apparently it is never sealing hence leaks), underneath my cuticles gets stained brown from fishing around in my bloody vagina so much despite thorough hand washing, I think dumping out and wiping a bloody cup is totally gross, I hate having to bear down so hard to remove it that I inadvertently fart, I could go on and on about how much I hate these things.

Dude, even a very badly wanted pregnancy is HARD.  It's terrifying, it's physically taxing, it's emotional overload 24/7.  You're uncomfortable, you feel like shit, you're exhausted, and your emotions develop emotions of their own.  I'm 7w right now and I feel you.  Some days I just want to cry because it's too damn much.  My anxiety spins out of control sometimes.  

You definitely need to seek out a counselor and/or a doctor.  This is hard enough on us as it is, and you shouldn't have to suffer.  

It's really, *really* common to develop depression/anxiety issues during pregnancy.  It's something nobody seems to acknowledge or talk about, but it happens - just like post-partum depression happens.  

I'm so sorry you're going through this, but you are not at all alone.  /r/cautiousbb is a great place, and /r/babybumps has a lot of sympathetic folks, too.  But I definitely recommend seeking out your doc and a counselor to help you work through this.  You're not alone. <3 ",3,t3_24gf2v

I have eight children and more fear with each one because I KNOW how much it's going to hurt.  At times I feel like a walking time bomb.

20140704023938,janeylicious,"I've read that series! My husband loves Anne Bishop and convinced me to read it.

Spoiler alert >.>

I have to say it's pretty good - I'm not usually triggered by any violence - but I thought that it fell short of expectations. It was satisfying to read on many levels - reasonably strong women even if they're not as strong as I thought they should be, not all men are great and perfect (a problem with fantasy in general IMO), Bishop's not afraid to write whatever she wants, there's a bunch of erotic BDSM-y stuff going on (I liked Kushiel's Dart but not 50 Shades...ewww), she's a decent writer overall although could be better with her choice of descriptions........... but then I read the mess that was Tangled Webs. I really didn't know how to react.

Surreal was one of my favorite albeit minor characters of all time - everyone else including Jaenelle and wonderful Marian could gtfo - and Bishop completely just wrecked her story in that book. I have no idea what happened there. I like to believe everything involving her starting from that book just didn't exist. The strongest (in terms of her character, not in character development or jewel or anything) woman by far in the series with no real weaknesses to speak of that's assumed to be able to handle anything that comes her way, does a small Good thing with another Good person, and what they both get for it is that they are reduced to shadows of their former selves after being ""saved"" by most offensively, Daemon, followed up by Lucivar and Jaenelle (and maybe a couple more? I don't remember). If this doesn't scream ""damsel in distress"", I don't know what does.

This is very unlike characters like Cimorene in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, where her independent/strong streak is not destroyed by having a partner or a child or other people around her, it just felt like she was even stronger for it. She worked with it, instead of being saved. 

I'd be curious to know what you think about my dilemma - I felt pretty alone in saying that since nobody else around me really seemed to have a problem with what happened to Surreal. That basically put off the series for me - especially given the ending of the series (if I recall correctly, with the child, just seemed so odd).",1,t3_24gcnn

Like, yes, yes, many women have had periods, I think I'm solid on that topic by now.

But then I realized that, man, there really aren't a ton of stories about men dealing with gendered problems, like, you know, society's expectations of men conflicting with *their* own desires, or struggling to fulfill their position in society as men, or their first boner, or something.

He did some horrible things and at the age of 14 I actually started wishing he would die. Well, he finally did, about 15 years later. I was somewhat surprised about how I felt. For one, I actually cried a little, which I didn't see coming and second, I started feeling sorry for him. 

I don't know your dad, but knowing alcoholics I would strongly suggest that you forgive your self. He may have had good intentions on contributing to an upcoming wedding and your future but then again alcoholics make a lot of empty promises and attempts to be kind and generous that in the end run out in the sand. That's the sad truth. It is not the person, its the addiction and/or mental disorders often associated with it. Once it is the drink or someone elses well-being, it will be the drink that wins. Had he not died, the chances are great that you would have ended up disappointed and hurt. I am really sorry to say these harsh words, but I am fairly certain that's the case.

Never the less, he was still your father and feeling guilt, sorrow, anxiety etc is normal. 

The following poem was helpful for me, I hope it can be helpful to you. I think it really fits well with the death of someone one had a complicated relationship to.

""When I am dead
Cry for me a little
Think of me sometimes
But not too much.
Think of me now and again
As I was in life
At some moments it's pleasant to recall
But not for long.
Leave me in peace
And I shall leave you in peace
And while you live
Let your thoughts be with the living""",8,t3_24h3b5
20140501171410,doogood,"Hi there,

It sounds almost like this could have been my story exactly. My dad died of pretty much the same complications from alcoholism a year ago when I was 21. I was still in college and about to go abroad to study and it was a much more traumatic event than I had expected, mainly because he never really acknowledged that alcoholism was what killed him, it was always ""oh I'm sick"" or ""I'll get better"" even to the end. 

After he died I hated that he did this to himself, but I hated even more what he had done to me. He would never see me get married, maybe have kids, even graduate from college. He never once apologized to me or realized what he was doing but that doesn't really matter, I realized. I'm only now starting to see that there was nothing I could do, and it sounds like while your father was struggling you were fairly young as well. That was a time to focus on yourself, your studies, and your life, and it sounds like you're doing great. 

I think there's a way to come to something that is between forgiveness and understanding. I cannot imagine how difficult it is to deal with alcoholism, and it is certainly a lifelong struggle. I know my father did not choose to die and never see the rest of my life or my brother's life play out, and I don't think yours did either. Alcoholism is a downward spiral that seems tremendously difficult to get out of, and I feel I can still remember the amazing things my Dad did for me and with me, but still recognize him as a person who had a serious problem that ultimately killed him. 

Maybe this isn't helpful, but live well and happily and give yourself time. I didn't really start thinking about any of this until a few months after he died. The best of luck to you! ",5,t3_24h3b5
20140502072825,paularbear,"I'm so sorry for your loss.

I've had a number of friends lose their alcoholic parents. (I suppose it is no coincidence that alcoholics tend to die youngish.)

It's the same damn thing every time - awful mixed feelings, none of them good. And it boils down to this: every kid of an alcoholic privately dreams that one day, their parent will choose THEM over the alcohol. When the parent dies, that can never happen. It's a double loss.

The only thing I can offer is a phrase. When people ask questions (usually, ""Were you close?"") you can say, ""It was a complicated relationship."" People seem to understand that phrase - they know you're in pain, but you're not idealizing the person you lost. And they generally don't pry any further.

The reason I switched was because I suffer from extremely bad migraines. Many migraines in women who are menstruating (as in, the time span between their first period and menopause) are from the hormones. The pill, patch and nuvaring all have hormones that can affect the migraines. The insert in my arm doesn't have these and is a much better choice for someone like me. ",3,t3_24h6ca

Frankly, I was worried about not inserting the NuvaRing properly (as I don't use tampons and I'm not really accustomed to sticking stuff up there for extended periods of time), and having it fall out. I was also worried about having the patch fall off, so didn't choose that. I decided against getting an implant, IUD, or birth control shots because if any particularly awful side effects happened, it would be a pain to get off that particular form of birth control.

It also never affected my weight.

About a year ago, I started having weird headaches and vision changes while on my period. Then my husband read that it is dangerous to be on a combo pill if you have migraines with aura. So I went to my doctor and told her what was going on. She immediately recommended a progesterin-only pill. I started that and love it. No periods!!!!

I didn't know people still used that. Nuva Ring, etc? To me, it's much easier to remember something every day that every 3 or 4 weeks. Plus, the whole take it out when you have sex thing... eh just seems troublesome. The shot? From people I personally know, I have heard nothing but horror stories about it.

No really negative side effects - it's been more difficult to lose weight than before though which is a bit annoying. 

I have little interest in using the patch as I work out 6-9 times a week and the constant showering/chlorine/movement would probably make it fall off way too early, and just never really considered the NuvaRing.

I was on it only for acne related reasons from the age of 13-17, and then on it from 19-20 to try to regulate my cycle.

When I wound up in a relationship and I was not on it at the age of 22 i decided to investigate other options. I knew I had been pretty bad about taking it at the exact same time everyday in the past so I decided I didn't want that again. I ultimately decided on the merina IUD. It was a long term option that I wouldn't really have to think about.

I also had severe PMS.  I chose Yasmin because it was the least likely to make me gain weight.  I have been on bc ever since and have 4-7 day, light periods with PMS consisting of easy emotional upset (MUCH better than before bc).

Aside from a patch, I do not trust other forms of birth control in terms of safety.  I am very sensitive and would rather not risk cervical or uteran complications.  I also do not feel comfortable with the idea of reducing my menstrual cycles to only a couple/year.  Menses is another way by which women eliminate toxins.  It is healthy to menstruate every month.  

Back in 2007, I switched bc pills because my insurance was no longer covering Yasmin for some reason.  I switched to a version that only varied by a few mcg in Progesterone from Yasmin.  Within a month, and without any dietary/stressful changes, I gained 40+ pounds.  As soon as I went off of them, I began to shed the pounds.  Like I said, I'm sensitive. ",1,t3_24h6ca

I hated the idea of the nuva ring because I just..don't like to stick foreign objects up there for extended periods of time. It's way to fiddly, weird and mentally uncomfortable for me. So I went with the pill. In the end I don't regret it at all because it turned out to be a lot less complicated.

I never tried the nuva ring because I had trouble with tampons and thought that I  might have trouble with the ring too.

I mostly liked it, and kept it for three years before I decided I didn't want to be on hormonal birth control anymore.  

I got acne that I think worsened on the IUD, and some hair loss.  These things are anecdotal, but  lot of other women claim to have had similar experiences.

20140501162616,letsgetknockedup,"First - **get in counseling**.  If you're not already seeing a counselor you trust & feel comfortable with, FIND ONE.  I am not joking.  I attempted suicide many times when I was your age, and you *need* to get professional help.  

There is *no shame* in needing help.  NONE.  And I would rather sit here and yell at you to go to a counselor and you hate me than find out you'd hurt yourself or worse, taken your own life.  I've lost a very close friend to suicide.  It still tears me apart inside and I will never, ever stop missing him.  So even if someone decides to hate me for speaking up, I'd rather they hate me and be alive than I stay silent and they die.   

And if you're taking psych meds that are not helping, SPEAK UP.  At your age psych meds can cause bad side effects and you *NEED* to make sure your docs are aware of this.  Again, there is no shame here!  You're doing this to get better! =) 

Second - I want to make this super clear.  Virtually none of us start out confident and calm and collected.  We're scared, confused, fucked up, sad, you name it.  We *all* feel like ugly pieces of shit sometimes.  We *all* have days where we feel like we're fucking it all up, we can't do a damn thing right, etc.  We all have to fake it sometimes and put on the plastic smile and pretend we know what the hell we're doing.  Most of the time, I don't.  I fake it anyway.  So far, it works.  People seem to see me as confident & smart & professional, while inside I feel like a dipshit half the time.  

Third - I don't think many women would be able to just snap their fingers and ""get over"" someone they've been in love with.  I sure as hell didn't.  I've been there, man.  I've been fucked over, cheated on, treated like shit, and hated myself.  I have.  I have been doubled over in uncontrollable sobbing for days on end, wondering why I am such a shitty person to have made someone do this to me.  (Pro tip - it's *not* you, *he* cheated on you.  HE is the problem.) 

I won't sugar coat it.  It fucking sucks.  It hurts, it's humiliating, and you kind of just want to disappear it's so awful.  But focus on *you*, and getting *you* better, and one day you'll realize you don't need your ex or his hurtful behavior, and that really being in love with someone means they don't do this shit to you.  They treat you with respect and they don't deliberately hurt you like that.  And you'll realize you're awesome.  And stronger than you ever thought you were.  (Hint - you *are*.  You just don't know it yet.) 

So hey.  You're not alone here.  We all start out as people who aren't power and confident.  We all start out naked & scared & confused, and it takes a lot of time to become even remotely confident.  And even then, half the time it's just a front.  I'm nearly 32 and finally figured this out within the past 2-3 years.  It takes *time*.  It's hard.  

But it's worth it.  Suddenly I feel like a real person, a whole human being.  I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks, I love me for me because I *rock*.  I'll always try to keep improving, but I know now that even though life sometimes really sucks ass, it's worth it.  

And I know you'll get there someday, too, as long as you keep biting and kicking and scratching your way to being a happier, better, stronger, smarter, even more awesome than you already are kind of person.  The fact that you actively seek out help when you know you're struggling tells me you'll get there.

Sometimes it's so hard to fight my own thoughts, since they're sometimes so powerful and loud that I lose control, like today. I have the most loving friends, but it's like when I see him.. nothing really counts anymore. I try to shut him out constantly, but I just really don't know how I'll do that prom night. I wish I could hate him as much as I should.

And I totally do believe in you.  There's no reason whatsoever that you won't be able to leave these jerks behind and have an amazing, wonderful life.  You will.  

You graduate in a couple of months, right?  Believe me, *everything* is different.  My asshole HS boyfriend cheated on me and broke up with me about mid-April of senior year.  I had to spend the next couple of months around that piece of shit (seriously, he is *not* a good human being, our relationship aside).  I really do get this.  =/  It takes time to get to the ""you are *such* a piece of shit"" stage after something like that happens to you.  Don't beat yourself up because you're the good person here.  Of course you still care!  You built a huge part of your life around this guy and he basically shit on it.  It's awful, but that doesn't mean your feelings just disappear.   

So the next couple of months, focus on YOU.  Do things YOU like.  Ask your friends to run interference.  Keep him away from you, keep you occupied.  Do the stuff he didn't like to do but you did, go have fun with the people who care about you.  And if you don't feel like going to prom, don't.  I didn't.  I still don't care.  I mean, it's *one* dance that you have to pay a shitload of money for.  One school-sponsored event isn't that big in the grand scheme of things, especially if it means you'll be miserable if you go!  

And something I didn't say - I'm really sorry you're dealing with all of this shit.  You don't deserve it.  I see a lot of similarities in what I went through at the end of high school, and man, that is a raw deal.  But if I could manage to get through it, so can you.  =) ",1,t3_24hiai

Meds take a while to really work, so there's going to be a miserable adjustment period if you've just started them. There's likely to also be a lot of dose tweaking and maybe even some medication switching. If you're feeling unstable right now, you can avoid the hospital by being proactive and calling your therapist to see if you can get an extra session soon. You can also call a suicide hotline or a crisis hotline if you feel like you need immediate support. They won't send you to the hospital.

I'm sure you don't want to be back at the hospital, hospitals suck. But it's better than getting worse.

Pretend he is cancer. He doesn't deserve your love. You are so allowed to hurt, but you need to get some chemo for that cancer! Cut him out of your life. I did some things during a rough breakup that worked wonders for me. Delete his number. Even if you have it memorized. That way, you can make yourself think before you try to talk to him and hopefully catch yourself. If you have the strength, **block** him. Then you won't be hopefully awaiting those texts or calls.

Change everything about your phone, right now. Your ring tone, wallpapers, text tone, etc. Even your case. I know this sounds so ridiculous, but a change like that in your everyday life will help. If you can, move all of the pictures on your phone to your computer and delete them off of the phone. Pretend you have a brand new one. 

You're not expected to just get right over him, and that's okay. Needing time is okay. Time really is the best medicine, and I fucking hated hearing that when I had a broken heart but it's so true! Sleeping with someone else didn't make me feel better, crying provided temporary relief but was necessary, going out for the day only distracted me til I was alone at night. But somewhere in there, I stopped crying every day, I stopped thinking I wasn't worth anything, and I started working on myself. I lost who I was when I dated my ex and I bet you did too, we all do! So focus on loving yourself, because you are worth being loved!

If your meds aren't working, please tell the doctors prescribing them. Simply put, they aren't working and the doctors will help you.

20140501155129,Lil_Boots1,"There are more concerns than just fertility when it comes to hysterectomies. There's a risk of premature menopause even if it's not a radical hysterectomy, and there's a risk of things like organ prolapse and general surgical complications. It's not out of the question, but it's not something to take lightly, either. That said, if you feel your doctor isn't taking your concerns seriously enough, go get a second opinion. When it comes to fairly major medical decisions, it never hurts to get another professional opinion.",3,t3_24h75q
20140502145323,bkwaldo,"Thank you. I never considered that the removal could cause other complications which may be worse than dealing with the constant worry of cervical cancer. I'll keep that in mind.",2,t3_24h75q
20140502152426,Lil_Boots1,"I know, it seems like removing a useless organ (if you don't want bio children, that is) wouldn't be a big deal, but it has some definite risks. If your doctor isn't willing to talk to you about exactly what those risks are and what your odds of cancer are, you should probably find a new doctor. That said, considering that you're young, there's a good chance that the risks of surgery are greater than your risks of developing cancer from these pre-cancerous cells, and your risks of developing actually invasive cancer are very low if you continue to do all the screenings you're supposed to do. 

Abnormal cells don't turn into invasive, deadly cancer overnight, and really the most aggressive cancer treatment you're likely to need is a hysterectomy to remove a cancerous cervix. So basically, a preemptive hysterectomy would likely be essentially doing the most radical likely treatment if cancer develops in order to avoid having to treat the cancer when you might not even develop cancer.

Many things can cause the abnormal cells and if left long enough they can *eventually possibly* turn to cancer but it's not a guarantee. As long as you continue to go to your appointments you should be alright because they'll continue to remove abnormal cells if they need to. And just for reference, although yes I only had 1 LEEP, I'm now pregnant and haven't had any fertility issues.

20140502094339,Maggiemayday,"This will be my 14th year on the playa, the Home began in 2005.  I'd had gift racks before, those were fun, but not fulfilling.  I paint miniatures for dollhouses and wanted to display them, but realized people would want them.    Put the two ideas together, and the Home was born.  I paint, beg for donated art, gather bad art and found art, and recycled art.  I am not a very good artist, but prolific. I also have added a Gifting Box, for the things which don't really fit onto/with the Home.  

Yes, it is a true giveaway. People can adopt and keep any piece of art, they only have to fill out a small card.  I accept donations of art, supplies, and such, but never money.  In nine years, I have only sold one painting (off playa of course).  Last few years, we top giving away over 500 pieces of art.

See the trailer?  Yes, that is how we haul the Home and our camp. The chicken wire rolls up, and the two panels fit into the top of the trailer.  The little table disassembles.  I have four or five plastic bins which hold the art.  I also have a couple easels.  I am almost always in Hushville, and very easy to find.

For example, I live in the Middle East (I'm a white North American). I get cat-called, honked at, whistled at, and leered at every day, no matter where I go, no matter what I'm wearing. I get cat-called when I'm out for a run in (long) shorts and a t-shirt; when I'm walking to work in slacks and a cardigan (despite the 30C heat); in the winter when I'm wearing a motherfucking knee-length wool peacoat and a wool hat.

These men do not want to start a conversation with me and eventually get married and live happily ever after, the way your mother and father did. They don't think my socks are cute. They see me, as a woman, as existing for their sexual gratification. They consider my body in a public space theirs to objectify and make proclamations about. They consider me not a full person, and therefore not worthy of treating with the respect they would afford a man (and by ""they"" I mean specifically the cat-callers, not *all* men in the country I live in, obviously).  

It is exhausting and soul-crushing to *constantly* deal with this, and since I don't speak the language well enough, I can't even have the satisfaction of telling them off. It's not a compliment. I have great self esteem, so I don't need unsolicited validation from creepy strangers, thanks. 

Dudes doing this in North America are doing it for the exact same reasons. I'm sure nobody consciously think to themselves, ""oh a pretty girl, Imma objectify her!"" but if they're yelling shit at girls because they're daring to appear in public in a tank top, then guess what? They aren't treating her with the same respect they would a man - they're classifying women as lower on the totem pole, and deserving of harassment based on what she's wearing.",10,t3_24ianu

What *is* uncomfortable (and what I imagine the OP is alluding to) are leers, head to toe examinations, kissy noises, whistles, and those calling out opinions about your body parts and/or what they'd like to do with them.  I think the phenomenon of a less interpersonal world that you mention exists, but I don't imagine that someone just stopping for a moment to kindly say hello is what the OP is struggling with.  

She also mentions that most of the men are considerably older than she is (like her father's age)  Real talk, I personally think it is a little presumptuous for a 50 year old man to hit on a 20 year old girl.  Even if the advances weren't exactly sexually suggestive (and I am guessing from the OP's post that they were), I could see a young girl feeling uncomfortable in such a situation.  Maybe that's an elitist and snobby thing to say, but I highly doubt that if the genders were flipped that anyone would think a 50 year old women in her right mind for putting the moves on a 20 year old college boy.

Maybe I am wrong, and the OP can feel free to clear this up; perhaps giving some examples of these encounters could better paint the picture, but I think you're assuming that the interactions are neutral and non-threatening, one human being just striking up conversation with another.  However, I do not think that this is what's going on here, because I can't imagine the OP referring to people as ""perpetrators"" unless there is a certain degree of inappropriate behavior going down.  ",9,t3_24ianu
20140502153325,cheapmondaay,"This is spot on! I appreciate neutral, respectful interaction, when someone genuinely approaches me and talks to me like a normal human being. I'm a very open, social person and thus constantly have conversations with strangers approaching me at coffee shops, on transit, etc. Even though I have a boyfriend, I won't ignore or block out polite guys who just compliment me. I definitely feel flattered and thank them, and that's that. Heck, there's days where I get a nice compliment from a nice stranger and it makes my day, or even week. 



This is completely different from what I was referring to in my original post. 
Having creeps ""scan"" you from head to toe, yell at you from your car, give you creepy looks, take PHOTOS of you, and make some nasty remarks under their breath (or vocally) is NOT polite nor respectful. Eeeeeexactly what /u/SENKI and /u/boulverser both pointed out. I doubt any pervy dude yelling sexual remarks out of his car is wanting to get to know the woman, but rather finds it entertaining and EMPOWERING trying to get her attention by making lewd, unacceptable comments about her body. Any human being who expresses a sincere interest and wants to genuinely get to know another human being wouldn't treat someone like a piece of meat used for sexual gratification.

20140501195024,SometimesQueer,"It is important to consider that *when* you get scarring, never mind the risk of keloid occurrence for just a moment, it is going to be visible due to location. As with any surgical procedure, even something as commonplace as mole removal, there are risks beyond scarring, including infection, reappearance, and so on.

IANAD, this is not medical advise, and so on, but, are you prone to keloid scarring? If you've suffered keloid scarring in the past, it is generally not advisable to remove noncancerous lesions, I believe.

Your existing scars should give you some insight whether or not you are prone to this particular type of scarring.

[This seems to be a fairly sane source](http://westlakeplasticsurgery.com/articles/moles-lesions-making-a-mountain-out-of-a-molehill/) on the likelihood of complications including hypertrophic and/or keloid scarring risks, as well as some general advice such as seeking an experienced surgeon.

i support people taking healthy steps to increase their self-confidence, but if this has a chance of scarring nastily, i wonder if you'll just become self-conscious about the scarring instead. it really seems like you've built your mole up to be this big thing in your mind, whereas it's barely noticeable in real life. i highly doubt people actually refer to you as ""the girl with the mole"".

20140503082029,teslabox,"all of these ""hormonal"" products (pills, patches, rings, iuds, and injections) are actually made with hormone-analogues. This means that the chemicals are different than the hormones that the body makes for itself. I suggest looking into natural hormones, which are identical to what the body makes for itself. 

Most women's hormone problems are caused by too much estrogen and not enough Progesterone. Fake-progesterone (such as used in the pill) tricks the body into making less genuine progesterone for itself.",1,t3_24ikvr
20140501204908,Penguin_Dreams,"Moving is the worst, especially when you're all surrounded by boxes and nothing is put together, everything is all unfamiliar, and it's all kind of unsettling.  I've moved far more than I've ever wanted to and here's how I cope.

Make sure necessities are packed in small boxes and easy to access.  For me, this means the french press, coffee, and been grinder gets its own box, it's clearly labeled, and is just about the first thing to be unpacked.  Coffee is soothing and familiar.  YMMV.  Ditto for toiletries.  Nothing sucks more than being all sweaty and gross from moving and unpacking and not having things on hand to take a shower or bubble bath with.  Those should also be on top and in small dedicated boxes with very obvious labeling.

Next, you're going to want an internet connection.  See if you can set that up beforehand so you've got stuff to watch and read once you're settled in.  If that can't be arranged, find the closest place with wifi and take your laptop there.  Failing that, hopefully you've got a good cell phone.  Just know that it's temporary.

Food is pretty darn important and you're going to want some.  Sometimes scouting out the nearest places is just what you need, sometimes it's just overwhelming.  Have something non-perishable on hand that will at least allow you to not starve if finding some kind of take-out or delivery isn't possible or is just too much.

I have to admit, I don't know anything abut anxiety attacks, but I'd think that having as many familiar things around as possible is going to help.  Whatever is the most important comfort thing to you, make sure that's easily accessible and unpack it first.  There is always stress being in an unfamiliar place with it's unfamiliar sounds and the way light comes through the windows.  Just know that that's going to happen and reach for your comfort things, and know that it takes a while to get used to a new place.  Maybe walk around the neighborhood as much as possible, or drive when there's not likely to be a lot of traffic.  Take a virtual tour on Google Earth, check out any Reddit communities that cover that area and ask questions or just see what they have to say in general.  Most importantly, give it time.",3,t3_24i4yr

What kind of stone is it?  How did he make the ring?  Was it all fabricated, or was there casting involved?  What kind of tools does he have in the shed?  Does the color or the flower have special significance to your or your relationship?

I hope all my questions aren't overwhelming!  I recently made engagement/wedding rings for me and my partner, so I have a special interest in homemade rings right now.",88,t3_24j6e6

The stone I think is ~~somekind of cubic zirconia~~ Hessian garnet, and the metal is silver. He sculpted it from PMC (precious metal clay) and the stone is sculpted right into it. He chose the stone because it would withstand the temperatures it takes for the clay. The design and colour does not really have any special significance beyond that he thought I would like it. I love it!

His shed has a whole plethora of tools, not really jewelry specific but more miniature making specific. In fact, he has had very little experience with jewelrymaking so I am double triple impressed.

His face when he gave it to me was the cutest thing. We're long distance, across the atlantic long distance and I had spent 3 months over there and he gave this to me the day before I left. I miss him terribly already and it's only been 4 days :c",75,t3_24j6e6

I can relate. When my husband and I first met, we were only together (and inseparable) for three months before he went back home, across the Pacific. We spent the first year of our relationship sorting out ways to be together while we were still poor students. We managed to never be apart for more than a few months at a time.

In the grand scheme of things, you're still rather young in your family life.  My mom chose to have weird hours growing up in order to be more ""around"" as a parent when we were growing up, and it did wonders for our upbringing, but it wasn't really because she was the mom, but because she had the more flexibly scheduled career (a nurse).  My father's work became unsteady due to the economy and he got laid off quite a bit when I was a teenager, and finally when I was an older teen he got laid off for good even though he was nowhere close to retiring age.  While it was tough on him at first, my mother became the main breadwinner, and still is.  She even took a lot of her free time in her weirdly scheduled job and put some of it towards earning an additional Associate's Degree on top of her Nursing B.S. while raising us. Now that she's pushing 60, she's almost finished with her M.S. in Nursing as well, and my father's really supportive of that.

I also work in marketing, internet based, where you see wild swings in success.  What I have seen with my women colleges and a few friends who have had this arrangement is that everything remains hunky dory until the woman starts seeing real success...when her pay is 3,4,5,10 times better than her husbands. At some point it becomes pointless for the husband to hold down a 35-50k job when she is making close to 200k and the decision is made for the husband to quit and focus on the family and be a stay at home dad. Shortly after this, especially so if her success continues to climb, resentment starts to build as while she is seeing a high level of success she isn't seeing the fruits of that labor as her income is divided between two adults and a family. So the awesome vacation destinations, expensive material goods, and sophisticated/wild nights out never materialize. Around this time is usually when the man starts to be treated like one of the children or a pet. This is what really struck me as every time I would go over to a persons house or out to dinner there was this dude attached to my friend who is ""Yes Dear""ing his way through the evening. This is generally when the convention affairs start or the woman eventually realizes she could be much more successful AND finally enjoy the fruits of her labor if she were to create a power couple with someone her financial and professional equal and the marriage ends up in divorce.

During Vaisakhi, local communities, companies, and families set up booths on the street to give out free food to the passersby. Think chana masala, naan, samosas, ice cream, candies – everything! On this day, everyone puts others first before themselves. It is an extraordinary time to give back to the community with love, good thoughts, smiles, and wonderful food!  

Vaisakhi is a religious experience as well as a fun, rambunctious one! There’s live music, multiple floats, and performance artists throughout the day. It is a crazy, fun, wild, sacred event!

I worry I'm not explaining myself well enough, or that anyone else's experience with birth control isn't going to mimic my experience. But going off made such a monumental change in my daily well-being that if anybody ever asks me if they should go off the pill, I sing the praises of being on hormone-free birth control and take them by the shoulders and look them in the eye and say, ""Going off the pill is the best thing that ever happened to me"" while birds flutter around me with confetti.

I think that's very true, but I don't see how it relates to the rights of the accused. Wouldn't the solution here be investigating the gang rape, something that can be done without announcing who someone is before all the evidence is in? I don't think advocating for investigating crime requires attacking the rights of the accused.

You can (and fucking should) be for investigating the gang rape, AND for investigating the stabbing AND for not starting witch hunts. Like it or not (and I would hope not), accused rapists are vilified before they are found guilty. That can lead to innocent people come to harm. That is not okay. It isn't made okay because they're fucking up in another aspect either. It honestly worries me how many people are willing to throw away innocent until proven guilty if it's an crime that elicits an emotional response. Do people no longer believe it is better to let a guilty person go free than punish an innocent one?

I think it's a shitty sign that people are rallying around ""yea, fuck the rights of the accused."" instead of ""fuck not investigating the rape."" It's focusing on the wrong part, and really counter productive for justice.

I know some people would argue it's just a joke, and not a serious attack on the rights of the accused, but isn't that the same principle used to justify rape jokes and rape culture? There's no reason the jokes or statements need to be making jabs at the rights of the accused, when they can focus on the actual issue, which is the lack of investigation into crimes that damn well need to be investigated. The solution to injustice is not to support a different brand of injustice.",10,t3_24jjmz
20140503012546,cyranothe2nd,"> without announcing who someone is before all the evidence is in? I don't think advocating for investigating crime requires attacking the rights of the accused.

First, the school has to announce that an attack took place. They don't reveal the names of the victim or accused rapist. 

Second, in most cases of rape on campus, the accused rapist shares a dorm and/or classes with the victim. This means that the accused rapist has to be removed from those places for the safety of the victim. Which means that people notice something is up. Administrators don't *announce* who the accused is, but it's not hard to figure out, especially if people start talking. However, I can't see any way around that without hurting the victim and forcing them out of their dorm/their classes.

The problem is that it's been a year since it happened, and the school never told the student body. Now that the news is out, a lot of people are saying that they shouldn't have needed to tell us about the rape, because it might not even have occurred, which is a violation of Title IX.

And, if you need to glue pieces together use the following guideline:

* **Vinyl to vinyl** : [super glue](http://www.krazyglue.com/images/default-source/Product-Thumbnails/kg825-thumbnail.jpg?sfvrsn=0) or [PVA glue](http://static.hardwarestore.com/media/product/126951_front500.jpg) - this is the exact brand I used

>the judge asked several times about whether the girl cried. The girl testified that she did not cry during the attack but cried afterward.

How do you decide whether her behavior was acceptable like that? ""You didn't react strongly enough, you must've wanted it despite saying no"". What the fuck is wrong with her?

20140502192557,Tall_for_a_Jockey,"Please keep in mind that the defendent pled guilty. When questioned about the incident by a detective, his response was, ""That’s rape."" The argument that the sentence doesn't fit the crime has to be weighed against many factors, and I think the fact that the young man admitted the wrongness of his actions matters a great deal.  
[This article](http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2014/04/man-pleads-guilty-to-raping-fellow-booker-t-washington-high-school-student-during-school.html) says that he WILL have to register as a sex offender, and that he will be required to spend the entire day on which the incident took place in jail throughout his probation (five years). (Update: I see the original link above came after the initial ruling, but, in any case [the original judge has recused herself from the proceedings, in large part due to the strongly negative reaction](http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2014/05/dallas-judge-recuses-herself-from-case-of-admitted-rapist-sentenced-to-probation.html)--this matters because the plaintiff's attorney wants to amend the terns of probation. I'm guessing a lot of this has to do with the removal of the sex offender registry requirement.  
The original angle most people took on this case was that it was ludicrous to sentence him to community service at a rape crisis center. If possible, I would ask you to set aside how offensive this seems (one online commenter said, ""It's like asking a pedophile to serve at a kindergarten.""), and consider another viewpoint (from an anonymous commenter, as well):  
>Shame on the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center as well.  They've missed a golden opportunity to help someone who was injured.   It is obvious this boy was remorseful as well.  There's no reason he couldn't wash dishes or clean the yard.  I agree if he had been a violent offender who actually intended to assault someone it would have been a mistake, but that wasn't the case here.  Seeing other victims as they come and go would have been a fantastic way for him to really realize just how important it is to pay attention and teach his future children how to do things differently.

Whereas, their policy on nudity and pornography, other than banning child porn, states ""We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.""

20140502130526,matt618,"Despite your principal being an idiot, I'm not sure Rape Culture and High School Dress codes have much in common, and it is a real stretch to try to fight a dress code by yelling ""rape culture"".  High School Dress codes aren't in place to glamorize sexual violence or objectify a woman's body; they are in place to prevent a distracting environment. Instead of objectifying, dress codes instead aim create an environment that indeed focuses LESS on individuals' bodies and personal fashion statements, and is thus more conducive to learning.  It's the same reason sheer clothing, plunging neck lines, and obvious sexuality aren't quite acceptable at (most) workplaces, and we're still wearing ties, tights, shirts that button up tight to the neck, socks, slacks, undershirts, briefs, bras, cami's and knee length dresses.

Clothing that is distracting (in part because of totally natural sexual impulse and attraction, ESPECIALLY in adolescents), and any attempts to limit that distraction by providing a dress code which tries to limit the ability to easily plainly see, discern, or even imagine in lurid detail the features of a young adult male or female body, isn't perpetuating rape culture.  It simply acknowledges that we humans are sexual beings, and teaches children/teens/young adults that their are societal norms about when it is appropriate (or not) to express our sexuality through what we wear.  Because face it; push up bras/tanks, short/tight/low riding shorts, crop tops, etc while a perfectly reasonable personal fashion choice/statement, are also intended to showcase that which we (and others) enjoy about our bodies; which is not the point of school.

Additionally, a dress code isn't expecting or requiring female students to be ashamed of their bodies, but rather to cover them up in a manner that is reasonable for a learning (or professional) environment (especially given the ""fetishiz[ation]"" of young female bodies, as you put it).  It isn't telling them to be ashamed their bodies, it is telling students not to flaunt them.

Sure, it's hot out.  Sure, it's summer and we're all ready to do away with those tan lines.  Sure I sweat more wearing pants and a polo than I do a tank top and short swim trunks (I've got great swimmers thighs), but it would be wholly inappropriate for me to wear the latter to work.  And while I welcome (and perhaps at the same time, rue) the day when we in the US are all allowed to wear whatever (or nothing at all), and display our bodies in any fashion in any place in any context, we simply aren't there, and won't be for a significant amount of time.  ",3,t3_24jsn0

I do expect there are some select guys wearing sleeveless tanks, or showing their underwear, but I would expect any dress code worth its salt to address those issues as well).

However, I was responding to her assertion that ""...the dress code was promoting rape culture, since it cited the distracting influence of female dress on boys"".  That isn't rape culture.  That is human sexuality, writ large. That is teaching children (in SCHOOL) what is and is not appropriate for a learning environment.

She is right, however, that part of her job is ""teaching and discussing appropriate socialization"".  And that is what I wrote about; that society IS going to be distracted by revealing clothes, both on men and women (or ""boys"" and ""girls"" even), and that distraction isn't appropriate for school or most professional environments.

And, when the dress code is written to be gender neutral, I don't expect it will result in the ability to wear whatever they want.

Stop reaching for the far end of plausibility to what rape culture is, and how you can wedge school dress codes into being responsible for creating said culture.

Do you believe there is an inherent level of sexual attraction as a part of the human condition, based largely on visual stimuli?  Do believe a sexual attraction can be distracting, especially if there is a visual stimuli present?  Do you believe that finding somebody attractive automatically relegates them to object status?  Can you understand why a high school full of adolescent students would want to limit the amount of sexual attraction that builds during the school day, when and where learning occurs?  Can you accept that it actually is in the best interest of a educational environment to remove distractions when they prevent effective learning?

I know you won't, but I want you to answer those 5 questions, and only then move onto this next one.

Is endeavoring to limit the source of a distraction, caused by sexual attraction, through limiting visual stimuli, by implementation of a dress code an appropriate function of a school??

If you answered 'no' to any of those questions above, you may have to reconsider how you frame rape culture, human sexuality, sexual attraction, and the role of educational bodies.

None of that is related at all to rape.  It is a simple function of humanity's reaction to sexuality, and the responsibility of a educational body to limit distractions. ",-7,t3_24jsn0
20140502135312,Kalabaster,"I can see where you are coming from, but have you considered that most dress codes don't necessarily address tight or revealing outfits for men because men tend to not wear them? Also, that this is partially because general dress codes and society at large already expects and often makes men to wear more layers? 

This could be leading to why men are not directly addressed as having to ""cover up"" because they might distract women, or do you believe women do not and would not be distracted by attractive men in revealing or tight clothing? 

Therefore it might be dealing with human sexuality by addressing the main symptom, due to current trends, while also enforcing equal standards, as I'm sure the males would also not be allowed to wear such short, tight, or revealing clothing?

My suggestion for you, for when you do get another one, is to invest in some locks. And I mean invest! [Abus](http://www.abus.com/) is a great brand for them. Don't spend less than 80-100 on a U-Lock, which you can connect the frame to the thing you're locking your bike to.

I have a small line on my nose. It's the line where it folds, when I make a piggie nose. I don't know why, but it's always visible as a thin, slightly darker line.

My nipples are not erogenous. In fact they are pretty numb all together. Only on shark week they go completely nuts and I can't touch them without feeling pain.

Whenever I'm distracted and/or listening to someone's monologue I start pulling at strands of my hair or twisting them around my finger. During important conversations I always have to hold myself back, because I can't imagine it to appear very professional.

When I'm chilling by myself, I often start fumbling my labia. It's not arousing or connected to sex in any other way. I pinch it, flick it, scratch it or pull at it while I'm not even ncessarily aware of doing it.

My best advice is to call a doctor to ask for help. Bulimia is an illness, and a serious one at that. 

Another thing to try is to maybe cook a very light and healthy dinner and then plan something immediately afterwords, like going on a walk. He'll not only be satisfied by consuming few calories, but he'll get enjoyment out of the exercise with a loved one.

My husband has an unnamed, untreated eating disorder. He does not purge, to my knowledge, but he is extremely selective in the foods that he will eat (I can count the number of foods he will eat on two hands), and he frequently goes a day or more without eating. He has no desire to lose weight (nor does he need to), and he doesn't seem to have any issues with his body. He swears he just doesn't get hungry, but when I encourage him to eat, it becomes a battle. Trying to get him to try a new food is similar to asking someone to face their greatest phobias. He recognizes it is a problem, but cannot verbalize his thought processes or issues when it comes to food. Our daughter is at the stage where she wants to ""feed"" us the way we feed her, and he gets a look of pure terror on his face when she tries to ""feed"" him a food that isn't on his ""list"". 

We've tried to discuss this with a doctor, and they pretty much dismiss it as nothing. But it isn't nothing, it's debilitating and it interferes with his life and our family's life together. I'm frightened for him and what it could be doing to his body, and I have no idea how to help.

Then you need to speak to him about your concerns, without him being able to put you off or delay the conversation. 

Tell him how worried you are about his health, and about the dangers of purging. If he is purging multiple times a day, that can cause dangerously low levels of potassium in his blood, his teeth will be getting damaged and may eventually fall out and there is a risk of tearing his oesophagus when he is having forceful vomiting that could lead to life threatening bleeding. See if you can get him to agree to go with you to a doctor to check out those things and assess him for an eating disorder. Just because he is purging, he doesn't necessarily have bulimia, (purging can be a feature of anorexia, bulimia or something called purging disorder). 

This will be a difficult conversation. It is likely that he does not want to talk to you about this because his eating disorder knows when it is being threatened, and it does not want to lose its grip on him. You just need to be persistent and know that you are being a loving girlfriend who is looking out for him, even when he might be calling you a busybody who should mind their own business.

Like some others said, while you might want to tell him how good-looking he is or that his body is perfect, try not to. Putting an emphasis on his body looking any certain way and associating it with good or bad will continue that thought process for him. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't compliment him in other ways. Oftentimes I feel like I'm not good enough, so any time someone praises me in any small way, like ""it was really great to see you today"" or ""you did a great job on ___"", it makes me stop hating myself a little and start thinking a little bit more positively. Bulimia is rooted in much deeper emotions; when I sought out treatment, I found out that I also have anxiety and depression. His bulimia is a coping mechanism for something much deeper, and I would really recommend trying to get him treatment. One thing that pushed me to get treatment was when I came home for spring break from school and my mom saw me. She knew I had/have bulimia and she just broke down in tears because I was so skinny. She and my boyfriend constantly expressed their concern for me (and still do!) and that was the final straw. Not saying that you need to break down in front of him, but expressing your concern in a loving, rational, and not attacking/accusing way may help.

Note: I am NOT religious. The meetings and the philosophy has religious undertones, but it was still one of the most valuable experiences of my life. Hearing the stories of others overcoming the same issues I was/am dealing with was amazing. Both groups have lots of resources. My favorite is ""For Today"" which is a daily book with snipits encouraging strength against disordered eating. 

I also saw a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. That really changed my life. She gave me so many tools. She helped me find words and strength I never thought I could have. 

As far as talking to him, ask him what he thinks he needs from you. It's pretty likely that he just doesn't know. Tell him that that's okay. Tell him that when he figures out what he needs you're ready to do your best to give it to him. 

Listen when he tells you it's not something he feels like he can control. Bulimia is classified as a disorder for a reasons.

Be patient. It's not an overnight process. I would guess that some people ""quit"" cold turkey, but it's been almost 5 years since I started therapy and I still slip up. 

I still use exercise to purge (a much more socially acceptable form of purging than throwing up) and I still occasionally find myself with two fingers down my throat. 

Recovery isn't a destination. It's a road. It's a journey. 

Most of all, know that it's only a piece of who he is. He is not just a bulimic. He is not just a man with an eating disorder. He is still all the other things he has always been. He is still strong and kind. He is still capable of being a wonderful partner. He just has a demon that he needs to beat.

It sounds like he has access to your accounts - I would say he might have access to your computer too but then he would have deleted your screenshots. I would mention to law enforcement that that's the case no matter what.

What email provider are you using? Gmail? Yahoo? You should go through this kind of checklist for all your accounts (even your bank and other sensitive websites...especially if you used the same passwords in the past): https://support.google.com/mail/checklist/2986618 _especially_ #7 that talks about two factor authentication (or ""2 step verification""). It means that even if he has your password, he can't log in without stealing your phone. The system works by you downloading an app or getting text messages to a phone you always have, in order to get a second randomly generated number to enter to finish the login process. It's very effective at stopping people from using your account without having the second step (something you have/own next to you, like a phone). If you're worried he might steal your phone, you can set up remote backups and then turn on Find My iPhone (http://support.apple.com/kb/PH2696) or Android Device Manager (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3265955?hl=en) so you can lock it so he can't use it, and also be able to show law enforcement how to locate him (and he just dug himself a deeper hole).

The best thing about 2 factor authentication is that it's not just Google that offers it. Facebook does too, as well as a bunch of banks and other email providers and other accounts online in general.

Then make sure you have a backup of everything. A backup of a backup, even. Leave it with a friend, an account online using an email he doesn't know about - on a computer he doesn't know about, leave it with the police... There are backup services out there that will back up your email and keep deleted messages for you. Whatever you can use against this scumbag.

If you feel comfortable doing so, also report violations and maybe the company person researching his accounts can help law enforcement with the deleted message problem that they might still have access to: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/274459462613911 and https://support.google.com/mail/contact/abuse?hl=en

That all sounds rather unpleasant. I'm still kind of hoping I can somehow get it to go away before I see the doctor and not have to bring it up. Do GPs do the whole swabby thing? Or would that only be if I went to a gynaecologist?

This is so sad to me. I understand that you have this anxiety, but I feel like it's causing you to really downplay the importance of maintaining your health (both mental and physical), and furthermore to respond in a really defensive way when people offer you their advice. Obviously you don't have to take it, but my feeling most of the people here wouldn't suggest these things if they didn't want to help you with your issue. ",3,t3_24lchf

20140505082718,Lil_Boots1,"I never ever said that, and the only reason I brought up potential actual causes and the possibility of a cure and a sex life is that your old post seemed worried about the possibility of you finding someone you loved and then having some sort of condition that would prevent you from having sex. Granted a lot can change in 2 years and you may be perfectly fine with never having a sexual relationship now, and that's fine. You still clearly aren't in a healthy place at all as far as your relationship to your body, and you have the chance right now to discover that you're completely fine and normal, or to discover whatever treatable issue you might have. For what it's worth, when I started using tampons, it took me 45 consecutive minutes of exploration to find my vagina, and I'm perfectly anatomically normal.

I understand that you're scared and you probably feel cornered, and that's probably why your responses have been so defensive. I'm so sorry you're in this position now. The reality is that lifestyle decisions aside, you have a phobia that is now negatively affecting your health, and it's time to address it rather than just hope nothing else ever happens again. Even if you're never sexually active, there are many different things that can go wrong with your reproductive organs over the years, and I'd hate for you to end up in this same situation in another 2 years over something different. It would be better for your health and your quality of life to address this anxiety and phobia rather than just hoping you never have to deal with it.

As for the appointment on Thursday, you could take a trusted friend or your sister or someone with you. You'll have to go in and take your pants off, but then they'll give you a paper sheet to put on your lap and when they have you put your legs up in stirrups so they can get a look, you can't seen anything from up by your head, so if having someone there to hold your hand would help you feel calmer, they wouldn't really have to see you naked or anything. Do what you need to do to take care of your health as comfortably as possible. If that means having someone with you, that's ok. If that means calling today and explaining the situation and asking if there's anything they can do pharmacologically to help, that's ok. It might help you to know that they literally can't do anything without your consent. So if you get there and then you decide that you really need to talk to the doctor before they examine you to feel comfortable with it, then you can do that. If you really want only an external swab and no penetration, you can insist on that (if that's what you want, I'd forgo the external cream the day of just to make sure you don't kill any yeast that makes its way outside). If you want them to tell you if your anatomy is completely normal, they're going to be looking at it anyway and they can tell you. You're going to be completely ok. You'll only be try in an awkward exposed position for 15-30 seconds, and then you'll be allowed to cover up again. It's ok to be nervous about it, but it's not nearly as bad as it sounds and it will be over before you know it. And they'll be able to diagnose you on the spot and give you a prescription for Diflucan or an antibiotic, depending on whether it's yeast or BV. You'll be feeling better by Friday, and this will be all over for now.",1,t3_24lchf
20140504213927,Lil_Boots1,"It's not that unpleasant. It takes no more than 2 seconds, if you wash yourself it's not anywhere you haven't touched, and anyone can do it. They may even let you take the swab yourself if you explain your anxiety. Your GP is fine if you're comfortable with them. You can treat thrush with over the counter medication, but you have to put it inside your vagina so that's not an option for you. Your doctor can prescribe Diflucan, which is just a pill. It's also not recommended to treat your first yeast infection yourself because it's very easy to confuse thrush and bacterial vaginosis if you haven't had them.

Sure, you're fine if you never want to be sexually active in any way and if you're lucky enough to never have fibroids or any other common reproductive problems. Of course it's up to you because it's your health and quality of life at stake and no one else's, but if you had been more proactive about dealing with an irrational phobia, dealing with a very common issue wouldn't be so nerve wracking and you wouldn't have to delay treatment and suffer longer because of an irrational fear. I really think you should address this with a therapist, because chances are you'll have more yeast infections and maybe a case or two of BV in your life and it's not that unlikely that you'll have a fibroid or cyst that needs to be diagnosed and treated at some point, and right now your irrational fear would prevent you from seeking the treatment you need. It's important to your future health that you become comfortable enough with your own body that you can at least handle seeing a doctor about any health problems in any body part.

Edit: that exterior cream isn't going to do anything good for you if the infection is actually inside your vagina. Stop dicking around with your health and see your doctor. Call ahead and tell them how nervous you are, and they may prescribe a single dose of Xanax or something similar to be taken right before the appointment to help you remain calm.",5,t3_24lchf

I have a friend who's a nurse who said that the antibiotics I was on commonly cause thrush, and she's gotten it from them herself before (but no, I did not and will not let her look at my vagina, not that she asked). Kind of wish the GP could prescribe the tablet without having to look or touch down there, but I know that's not happening. I do have an appointment for my GP on Thursday since it's the earliest appointment I could get, but it would be very nice if there was some way of dealing with it before then.

20140502194138,dreamingofjellyfish,"Oh hey! I just had a lecture from the scientist working on the vaginal microbiome, and it's potential connections to BV!!

So, it probably means your pH is high and maybe they observed unexpected bacteria, unless they were doing some fancier testing (genetic screening for specific bacteria - don't know if this even exists on a clinical basis for BV). 

To give a bit of background, the bacterial community in the vagina is really stable for some people and not so much for others, and this appears to be related to the species of Lactobacillus present. But you won't necessarily have the same species throughout your lifetime - there can be a whole-scale community shift, for example during and after an infection.

Getting more directly to your question (and this is very much not diagnostic or medical advice). Before I mentioned that the vaginal microbiome has variable stability. So, some populations (potentially the less stable ones) can clinically look like BV (high pH, species that may be regarded as diagnostic for BV) but without any symptoms. Now if this is what's going on with you it may be that you have increased risk of BV, but you'd not necessarily have symptoms again. 

But you should talk with your doctor, because I'm an internet stranger speculating wildly based on science that is too new to actually be part of accepted diagnosis or treatment.

We text constantly. We talk almost every day and I see him every other weekend. I absolutely couldn't see him any less than that.

If you absolutely can't move with him at this point, then you have two options: do long distance or break up. That's what it comes down to in the end. I think the long distance is at least worth a shot.

How long is your degree program lasting? Is it possible you could transfer to the school nearer him at some point if long distance isn't working for you?

As far as patiently waiting, it will be hard. I had to wait six weeks between my boyfriend having a first interview for his job to finding out if he had it (two telephone interviews and one in person). He was a nervous wreck, I had to be the one who stayed calm about it. I swithered whether I wanted him to get it or not - I knew it was a great opportunity and what he wanted but I couldn't help thinking how it would affect me and us. There was no possibility of me moving with him. Mostly I tried to not think about it. Easier said than done I know. I tried to stay upbeat about it, and supportive and no be too bitter and resentful, because its not fair to him to ruin it for him. But generally I tried to not even consider it.

When he found out he got the job, we than had a week until he moved. We tried to fill the week with fun things (celebratory lunches, celebratory ice cream, trips to our favourite museums). And then I'd go home and cry.

As time goes on, it's not getting a whole lot easier. I miss him. I'm thinking its time to start looking for a job in his city so we can get on with our lives. I feel like while he's over there and I'm here in I'm some kind of limbo.

Wow this went on longer than I intended. TL;DR whatever happens its probably going to be horrible for a while, try not to think about it too much while its so far off and just keep enjoying each others company.

I think I'm mostly just going to not think about it as much as possible which will hopefully even it out to a normal amount instead of the emotional carousel that is my brain right now.

20140503123033,elmuchocapitano,"So, I have a similar dad. I moved out as soon as possible even though I couldn't really afford it, because being in debt was better than living under his roof. He's like a sociopath; charming when he wants to be and a complete fucking nutcase when he doesn't. I recently (a few months ago) made the decision to stop talking to him entirely.

He used to text and call me to scream and yell at me. By this time, I lived on the opposite side of the country from him (my dad being in Ontario and me being in British Columbia) and I, for some reason, would just put up with it, because he was my dad. Even though I was gaining exactly nothing from the few times we spoke, I still picked up the phone and answered his texts, even if I knew he was only interested in a fight. Whenever I would try to just stop talking to him altogether, my family would tell me to get over myself and talk to him because he was my father, and I couldn't cut him out of my life just because he was an asshole.

But you know what I found out? You totally can. 

My life has been so much better since I decided to stop talking to my dad, because the less I hear or see from him, the less anxiety I feel, and it has made a huge improvement to my quality of life. The pressure I get from my family to let him be a part of my life simply because we are related is nothing compared to the anxiety I feel when I know he could text/call me at any time and ruin my day. Now, I see something from him and I just delete it. 

You might have to put up with him for now if you're not willing to move out. What I did to get through this period when I knew I needed to leave but couldn't leave immediately (I was in high school still when I was living with my dad, and rather than try and go to school and live on my own, I knew it was in my best interest to stay, even if he was violent) was learn to smile and nod. This type of person has huge control issues, and when something leaves their control, like when somebody disagrees with them on something, they lose their freaking minds because they don't know how to deal with the uncomfortableness, frustration, or anger that they feel. So, don't make them feel uncomfortable, frustrated, or angry, if you at all can help it. Even if they're wrong, tell them they're right. Even if what they said was unfair, just smile and nod. And then, when you're ready to leave, you don't ever have to speak to him again. 

You should never just drop someone in your family for making a mistake. I had forgiven my dad for a million things that he had done to destroy our family before I decided that his violent temper and his terrible treatment of not just me, but his own parents, my mom, and my brother and sister, were just too much for me to handle. You also shouldn't have to let someone ruin your life just because you share some of the same DNA.

You should look into getting a place somewhere cheap, even if that means moving far away from home. I only work ~20 hours a week because the job market is terrible where I live, but I can afford my own place - it just means I don't get any extras. You can find a roommate online if you need to split something. You can get a personal line of credit that you can use just until you can find a full-time job. Maybe you can stay on a friend's couch for a couple weeks while you look for something. If it's really that bad, you'll be willing to make a lot of sacrifices to leave as soon as possible.

Basically my entire family lived on the West Coast, he cheated on my mom for a very long time with another, younger woman and when my mom found out left her for the bimbo and moved to the East to be with his shiny new family, that whole stereotypical story. I tried to be forward-thinking about it because maybe he was just really unhappy and I didn't really know anything about marriage at that age. Two years after he left, I decided to move out east to live with him so I could attend a university prep school right by his house and increase my chances of getting into a good university -- I hadn't been doing well in school but I really wanted to turn that around. 

He had always been violent when we were kids but nothing compared to how he was with this new family. He put on this charade when he was around them and then when it was just him and me, he let all of that pent-up frustration from living a lie right out onto me. He was too arrogant to deal with his guilt over what he'd done to our family and what he'd given it up for, and he took that right out on me. The second I turned eighteen I was outta there.

Since he lives so far away, and usually only visits my brother and sister once a year, I just have to make sure I'm not at my mom's place when he's in town. Since they don't really have a relationship with him, I'm not forced into having a relationship with him. It's not like I have to sit with him at Easter Dinner or anything.

20140503164826,MonkishSubset,"I almost expect to get down voted, but I want to contribute a slightly different point of view.

My father was also verbally (frequently), and physically (rarely), abusive. Things got better pretty much the second I moved out and started supporting myself. He realized that I had the option to simply walk away if he continued his behavior. And so he stopped. Gradually, over time, I was able to forgive. And now we have a relationship of mutual respect. If I had simply cut him out of my life I'd have missed out on that. 

So, my advice is to focus on becoming independent. Don't put too much emotional energy into your family--right now your focus should be on starting your own life. A little distance can bring a lot of clarity. 

Oh, and your dad knows damn well he crossed a line. The fact that he stopped before actually hitting you shows that. Keep maintaining your boundaries, focus on getting out, but don't lash back at him, tempting though it might be. That would be counterproductive at best. ",21,t3_24mo40

I think being responsible for two other lives gave him a great deal of anxiety. This realization allowed me to let go of some of my own pain. That, and plain old time.

Here's what I wish I did MUCH sooner:

* Go talk to a therapist - it will allow you to talk about how frustrated, angry, and scared you are without dumping it on your family.
* Stop trying to reason with your father.  It won't work.  
* Stop trying to talk sense into your mom, that won't work either.
* Spend as much time out of the house as you can.  The less you are around that, the better.
* Make a plan to move out on your own or with a roommate.  
* Tell your boyfriend.  If he loves you, he'll be there to support you.

I got to a point that I just stopped talking to my father.  Writing him out of my life was the best thing I ever did.  Don't put yourself in the middle of your parents, they are both adults and they can deal with things themselves.  The only time you should intervene is if injury is imminent.

20140503205605,MelodiaAlegria,"A domestic violence shelter might be able to help you when you're ready to leave, as they have experience with getting people out of dangerous situations. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not a professional. I'm taking this from what I've learned in my research about domestic violence, and my own (though not as extreme) experiences with a shitty dad. Your best course of action is probably to contact a counselor or shelter and work out a plan with them.

Until you're ready, my advice would be to *very slowly* gather the things you don't want to leave behind- important documents like your school transcripts and financial papers, and sentimental things that you won't be able to retrieve after leaving. Don't do it all at once, though (too noticeable), and only take the essentials, i.e. anything irreplaceable. If you can, rent storage space and burn the receipts; if not, leave your things with a friend or professional your family doesn't know about. Do this knowing that whatever and whoever you leave behind, you can't go back. 

Do not tell anyone your plan unless they are helping you execute it. If your dad wants to find you, he'll go to family members and close friends first to try to bully them into telling him where you are. If possible, wait until you turn 18 so that counselors/teachers/doctors/etc aren't obligated to share your information with him. (IMPORTANT: state laws and policies vary, so if you're 18 but still in high school, they may still be able to give him your info.)

Do your best not to leave any records. Call shelters or people helping you from a public phone, maybe one at school. Buy anything you need with cash. If he has access to your accounts, don't withdraw large amounts of money until right before you leave so he doesn't get suspicious. Take care of any loose ends- put your car title, financial information, etc in your name if at all possible. Get yourself as legally and financially disconnected from him as you can, or he will use it to control you. (I learned this the hard way.)

Most importantly, do whatever you need to do to survive until you can get out. Smile and nod, agree, don't ruffle feathers. Don't mention leaving or do anything to make him or anyone else in the house suspicious. That part sucks- I know how hard it is to just swallow whatever abuse he throws at you. But in the end, that will help you get away.

There's a lot of great advice in this thread, but I wanted to answer you specifically because your situation sounds especially dangerous. If you need someone to talk to, you can PM me. Professional counselors and domestic violence workers will have the best resources to help you, but even if you can't take any action right now, you can start strategizing. I know it might seen like an impossible situation, but there are people out there who can help you.

Edit: I didn't mention going to the police because that doesn't guarantee your safety. Concentrate first on getting out of harms' way, and then you can consider legal action. If he's threatening or abusing anyone else, you will be more helpful to them once you've left than you would be while still living with him.",3,t3_24mo40

Your natural instinct is that his behavior is wrong and you should understand and accept your instincts. That being said, my advice is to ignore your mom, trust your gut, protect yourself, and REFUSE to even consider forgiving your father until he makes an acceptable apology AND works to fix his behavior. In the meantime, make your exit plan to remove yourself from this ongoing situation and find your own place to live. 

You deserve better than to be treated in such a way, and should not put up with it, regardless of his threats. He's wrong, and any position to the contrary is unacceptable, IMHO.  I would not have long, angsty conversations with mother, either. State your position, say it once, and then go on about your business. If he wants to be an ass in the future until you move out, leave the room. You don't have to tolerate it or witness it. Once you're out of the house, it's up to you who you visit with, and you can decide then. 

And if touches you in anger, or makes good on his threats, go straight to the police and help him learn a lesson in consequences.

Some jerk co-worker grabbed my ass when we were alone, I told him to stop it and he just laughed and tried to do it again.  I got really serious and told him to get away from me.  Against my better judgment, I took it easy on the jerk and reported it to his supervisor (a peer) instead of mine (the vice-president).

His supervisor talked with him and the guy avoided me for awhile.  Fine by me.  Then he started getting more cocky and started making comments to my other co-workers about what a bitch I was being lately while I was standing right there, and I went to my supervisor this time.

The VP calls both myself and the jerk into his office, the jerk owns up and gets a two week suspension.  Fine, whatever.  But then the VP calls the jerk's supervisor into the room with me and the jerk's supervisor says I never told him about anything, so he had no reason to take it to the VP himself.

I was livid.  It's one of the few times I ever lost my cool at work and I stormed out to the main floor and called the jerk's supervisor (now referred to as Jerk x 2) every name in the book, most starting with ""You fucking lying _______""  I was shaking I was so pissed and left for the day.  

Jerk x 2 tried to have me suspended for being disrespectful, but I showed them the security tape (thank goodness I was in good with security) that shows the ass grabbing followed by me marching up to Jerk x 2's office and a lot of hand waving on my part.

The VP told me that is was finished, but I was called into his office along with the other female accounting staff for a talk about how we should keep our distance from the male drivers, so as not to have these sorts of problems.  I gave my notice two days later.

I dont see any sexual assault here. The top upgraders were women so he made those remarks, if they were chinese he would have made a racist slur instead. He isnt out against women (nor assaulting physically or psichologically any), he is out against anyone who is better tan him.

Their reasoning for this metric choice is thus:

>Replying (versus not replying) to an email from a student seeking research experience and considering a doctorate, the outcome variable of interest in our study, is the most visible signal that a faculty member *has not entirely dismissed or overlooked the prospective student’s interest*.

And they certainly do have a good point.

>6 **Nearly all faculty responses to students in our study conveyed a willingness to offer assistance or guidance, but due to scheduling constraints, many encouraging faculty responses did not include an immediate offer to meet with the student on the requested date.** In previously reported analyses of these data (Milkman, Akinola and Chugh, 2012), it was determined that all bias against women and minorities in this experiment occurs at the email response stage. Specifically, faculty respond to (and therefore also agree to meet with) women and minorities at a significantly lower rate than Caucasian males. However, once a faculty member responds to a student, no additional discrimination is observed on the decision of whether to respond affirmatively or negatively. In other words, all discrimination observed on the decision of whether to meet with a student results from e-mail non-responses, which is thus the outcome variable on which we focus our attention here.

Looking at the paper cited in the footnote, you find that there is no difference in response rates or acceptance rates to students asking for a meeting that day, [but suddenly a huge (and incredibly significant) disparity when the students are asking for a meeting a week in advance.](http://imgur.com/k0fw4Bd)

They looked at your question in two ways.  First, they designed their study specifically to answer the direct race and gender matching question.  So, if you're a white woman, do you reply to white women more, etc.  female profs were no more likely than male profs to reply to female students.  The main exception to this rule was that Asian profs were more likely than other groups to reply to Asian applicants.  Otherwise, the race matching wasn't significant.

The other way they looked at this was by discipline representation.  So, if you work in a field that is,  say, 40% African American, will you reply more often to AA applicants than a field that is 5% AA.  The answer is again that there was no significant direct effect of representation for any group.  

Overall, though, they did see a higher rate of white male preference in certain fields - those which pay well and are high status, like engineering, etc.  since they don't see a sig effect for same group matching or for representation, they interpret this as more bias following stereotype.  That is, the faculty implicitly believe that the white males are more qualified because white males are associated with high status/high pay careers, regardless of their actual representation.",5,t3_24nn3j

For instance, there are several studies where the exact same essay/application was given to two groups of people, the only difference being that the name of the writer was a male or female name. People rate the essay/application more positively when associated with a male name than when associated with a female one.

The best advice I can give you (and your mom, who's doing the talk) is just to NOT make anything about puberty sound mysterious or scary. Just lay it out in an open, comfortable conversation. I remember being terrified of starting my period because no one explained it well to me, and what I pictured it being like was horrifying. I didn't understand what was going on with me, and I was a nervous wreck during that time. I remember even thinking that I could get pregnant from sleeping near my friends brother at a sleepover! Just make sure that she has a good understanding of this stuff, and don't hold anything back or make it sound scary. The fact that you're her big sister and you've been through it should also help. ",9,t3_24nje2
20140503201852,CB81,"Age 9-10 is average for my family. I was the late one at 13, the result of low body fat and gymnastics. Even then, I had proper breasts at 10, pubic hair and BO at 8, and acne at 9. I think I was in bras around 9 as well. 

My sister was 5'0"" in the third grade and towered over everyone. She had busty woman sized breasts by 5th grade. She topped out at 5'4"" in 6th grade and that was that... she was as physically grown woman as she was ever going to get.

In my case, I was small for my age until 6th grade, other than being unexpectedly curvy. I had a final growth spurt at 15 (quit gymnastics and gained 30 pounds) and shot past my sister to 5'6"".

Since my sis is 5 years older and went through it early, periods were just a fact of life at home. Supplies were already around, and overhearing my sister's experiences over the course of childhood took away the mystery.",9,t3_24nje2
20140503184948,Lil_Boots1,"I wasn't an early bloomer by any means, but my parents made sure I was well-supplied with books from a fairly early age just in case. It meant that when I had a question about whether something was normal, I didn't have to ask, and I was informed about what changes were going to happen well before they actually took place. I'd recommend *The Care and Keeping of You* which covers all the stages of everything and how to care for a growing, changing body in a way that's age-appropriate for any pre-pubescent kid, even in second grade. If you aren't sure yet whether this is puberty or not, you might consider trying to find ways to talk about some of the potential changes and try to normalize them as much as possible. My mom did that when I was about her age, and really I think it's a good idea whether she's on the verge of puberty or not. 

I will say that some of this could be hormonal for reasons other than puberty or it could be social. Kids can be cruel, and if she's been bullied by kids who tell her she stinks or something like that, that could contribute to the obsession with cleanliness and the moodiness in general. Kids going through a growth spurt often eat a lot right before they grow, so it might not be a puberty thing. This should be discussed with her doctor for sure, because while precocious puberty isn't harmful in itself, and is actually very common in children of certain ethnic backgrounds, it can cause problems if it's happening before her bones and joints and things are ready for it. Her pediatrician should be able to guide you as far as whether she's going through something normal and healthy or not. They should definitely be consulted because if she's 5' tall or shorter and her father is 6'5"" and her mother is an average height, then she's currently much shorter than her expected adult height and that could be a concern if it is puberty already.",6,t3_24nje2

None of this has actually turned out to be early onset puberty...it was just a developmental stage.

Now, not to say it couldn't be, obviously. But there can be lots of reasons for the same symptoms. Correlation not equaling causation and all that.

I think the best thing you can do is be relaxed about it, whatever is going on.

20140503232454,academiamia,"I was an early bloomer, and was actually a lot like your sister.

Started getting boobs (like, needed a bra size boobies) in 4th grade. I was 8. I refused to wear a bra, BTW, since none of friends were. I felt like I was being picked on by my parents, since I only had older brothers, and they never had to start wearing special underwear. I started wearing bras when I was 10, when my friends did. 


I went through crazy growth spruts, and had stretch marks on my hips and thighs, and eventually my breasts before I got to middle school. I was my adult size by the time I hit high school at 14: 135lb, 5'6. (I mean, I'm now 145 and 5'6, so not much of a change.) When I adjusted from ""junior's"" to ""women's"", I went right to a size 6, and I was ~ 13. Again, I'm currently a size 6.


My hormones were crazy. I had a lot of trouble sleeping; usually I'd crash after dinner ~7pm, waking up around midnight and then being restless until ~5am. I remember this time really vividly; it WAS a hard time, thinking about it. I was a cheery and smart kid, but got all emo and dark for a few years as I grew up so fast. I was changing so much, so quickly, I was all over the place. My moods were crazy. I am a really mellow girl nowadays, and **was** by the time I was 15 or so. 

SO, my suggestion is to be the sister you've always been: totally support her! My main complaint at that time was that my parents didn't seem to realize how very uncomfortable I was with my body. I didn't have a sister, and didn't know what to expect. I suddenly wanted to go shopping and pick out my own clothes, I felt ugly and frumpy ALL THE TIME, and desperately wanted to pursue any interests, like dancing or photography or a foreign language/ hobbies. I wanted to feel special and interesting and... safe again, like I felt when I was kid, just a few years ago. I suddenly didn't know myself anymore, and wanted to feel more confident.

Honestly, I felt like a freak of nature a lot. But unconditional love and support, and my parents treating dramatic outbursts cooly and casually helped me understand it was a phase I had to push through. Support her, make sure she feels pretty and normal by taking her shopping, taking makeup and hair, and getting on board with any quirky styles or interests she picks up.

As scary as it may seem when our baby sisters (I'm 20 years older than my  youngest sis, so it's like she was MY baby in a lot of ways) start this process, there's no sense in panicking. It's gonna happen, and all you can do is be supportive of her self-esteem and guide her through the rocky process of becoming a grown person instead of a ""kid"" between the ages of 8-9 and 17-18. 

Remember that the ego of a pubescent girl is a wildly fluctuating monster, of almost bi-polar proportions: she's on top of the world one minute, and practically suicidal the next. Help your sis learn to take care of her body (washing face and hair, managing odors, regular exercise in some fun way.) Club sports can be a great way to combo working out with making new friends outside of school. Doing things with your sis, like getting makeovers and going hiking, lets her know that you're in the trenches with her and builds rapport.

If you really want to know if she is going through the early stages of puberty she would start to breast bud an grow wispy body hair.

Another big thing is not just preparing her for what's to happen, but to prepare her for how things change around her. I know it's not desirable but the reality is that once you start developing physically, the world treats you differently. Boys I hung out with would behave strange (hello hormones), and I honestly thought it was my fault.

The best you could do is just talk with her after your mom does. Let her come to you. Don't push it, just be there for her. Let her know she can be honest with you and you won't go running to your parents about everything.  That's what bothered me the most about my sister.

20140504040825,tracesoflace,"My period started on my 9th birthday (is that unfair or what?) but I already knew what to do - my mum had given me a little purse pack of panty liners and pads with a booklet and told me to get the school to ring her if I ever wanted to, when it happened. My auntie started at 11 as well as a cousin at 9 so my mum wanted to be prepared, as well as I had started in bras not long before. I suggest you get a mixed pack of tampons/pads/liners that comes with an information booklet so you can have it on hand for her, if needed - maybe even sitting in the bathroom (in addition to a bin!) and a few additional pamphlets and books. It's not really abnormal to have puberty starting at 8, but if you're worried about hormones or precocious puberty take her to visit her doctor and also encourage her to ask as many questions as she desires.

We didn't learn about periods in school (well, what causes them and what to do about them) until age 11-12 which was too late for a few of us. Be open to discussing anything and everything relating to the body and answer her honestly, don't shame her for wanting information and if you don't know an answer, find out for her. I was so confused and upset that my period started so early, that I couldn't go swimming, I had boobs, I was the tallest, stretch marks everywhere and was wrecking all my undies. My friends didn't understand and I didn't have a big sister. My mum had opened that avenue of discussion already.

My sister started her period at 13, 16 now and I just tell her if she needs to go to the doctor (and she should if she wants to start having sex so she can be safe), pharmacist, psychologist, needs pads, tampons, condoms or any information she can come to me or our mum and we will do everything we can.

If you want to try to have a discussion with her you could try to find TV show episodes or films that deal with these kind of things and watch them with her. With a big sister extending her arm, she will be okay.",1,t3_24nje2
20140504045855,lascalaveras,"Is she an ""early"" bloomer though?  I think plenty of girls start puberty by at least 9:

http://pediatrics.about.com/cs/conditions/a/early_puberty.htm

it's sweet you're worried for her, but blood on the pants and teasing from class mates is part of growing up.  It's not going to break her.  

I guess part of your concern is it sounds (no offense) like you were a late bloomer yourself.  Honestly, by the time I was 11 all of my friends had their periods and were wearing training bras.  

And again - no offense at all - I would mostly be concerned about her getting a ""worried"" vibe from you and start to think any of these changes are unusual.  They're not.  You're probably just used to thinking of her as a little girl.  She still is - but her body is developing as it should.  

Tell her these changes are normal and you are available to talk to her if she needs.  Get her a book on puberty so she can get answers on her own.  

also, btw - a sudden and keen interest in bathing all of a sudden?  I mean, I don't know your sister, but when I started spending a shit ton of time in the bathroom at that age - I wasn't exactly washing my hair the whole time.  ",1,t3_24nje2
20140504085041,mundabit,"I started puberty around 7 and got my first period at 9, I didn't experience any emotional/mood changes until I was about 12, for me it was all physical. I started getting breasts, then hair, then menses, then more hair, then more breasts. Then I started getting mood changes.  then when I was 18 I got some more breasts. I didn't get any taller, But my family is full of short women who bleed young and breed long into their 50's.

I feel I got all the support I needed in terms of pubety. I knew from a young age what was eventualy going to happen. My mum was never shy about telling me that things change. I remember her showing me her pads and how she bleed, and how her breasts were big and saggy and hair sometimes grew on them, and in other places too. Up untill I was about 4 I used to bathe and shower with my mum every now and then, so I knew what I was going to end up like.

My grandma gave me the official talk when I was 7 and my breasts started developing. She was a midwife and did not spare me any details. I was fully prepared for what was going to start happening. I don't think I ever had a single question of ""is this normal"". I think the only time in my life I ever asked this was when I was 21, and washing my boobs in the shower when I sprayed milk all over the wall. But even then, I knew what it was, I was just wondering why it came out of me (long story, still getting tests). I got a lot more support than average. I had many medical conditions relating to my period so I was in and out of GYN's for most of my teenage years. 

I highly recommend booking in with a good GYN or Women's health nurse after you give a young girl the talk, she might have tons of questions, some of which you might not be able to answer. No matter what you tell her the most important thing is to teach her where to go when she has questions and who to get the best information from. OP, I think that can definitely be part of your role as big-sister. It might not be for a few years, but your sister may want to talk about boys or sex or vagina-goo, and not want to ask her mum, its a lot less embarrassing to ask her sister, don't be afraid to google things together, and let her know that you can take her to the doctors if she wants to go without her mum.

I got my first breast bud at 9 and started my period at 11.  

Agree with the other posters that you should check with her pediatrician but it's not unusual. As long as she knows what is going on and everything is explained, I don't think it will be too much of a problem. 

I talk to my daughter all the time. Just make sure she knows she can talk to you or your mom any time. There is a great book called 'The Care and Keeping of You' which can help.

Being the first in the grade to start puberty was really awkward and it would have been nice to know someone was willing to actually talk about things that were happening to my body rather than guess or look up worst-case scenarios online. It doesn't make for a confident, well-adjusted adult.

That, and my family. They were so supportive. So you just have to make sure that you're there for her, and don't be too hard on her when she acts out - it'll confuse her more. Offer advice when she seems like she needs it, and try to integrate yourself in her life as the person she can come to with troubles about her body and the changes that it is subject to with age.

I developed breasts much earlier than anyone else in my class and some of the girls in the grades above me. This made them pick on me so I thought that becoming/being woman was a horrible thing. I was incredibly lucky to have an amazing older sister (there's 5 years between us) who helped me through all this womanhood stuff. She was great about it, if I had any questions I didn't feel comfortable asking mom/dad, I could go to her. I remember one day I went home from elementary school due to cramps and I found her at home for the same reason. She had bought battle supplies on her walk back from the high school and we destroyed a tub of chocolate ice cream together. 
Just be there for her. Show her the tips and tricks to surviving that lovely time of the month. Like ALWAYS keeping supplies in the house. I don't know how many times I've had to go to the store with a wad of toilet paper in my panties fearing a bloody nightmare. 

Early onset of puberty in girls has been linked to the relationship with the father. But don't quote me on this, I'm no scientist. Myself and most of my girlfriends who developed early, had shitty relationships with their fathers.

I agree with /u/OnBehalfOfTheState about going to the doctor about this. My sister and I both had a rough time with our periods/puberty due to hormonal imbalances.

I was not an early developer (I had breasts at 9, but I think that was largely due to being overweight), so I cannot say for sure, but here's the thing: I was a victim of abuse. The obsession with cleanliness, change in eating habits, and mood swings could all be signs of abuse. I'm not saying they are, I'm saying they could be. It could also be something else psychological.
You say you want to be there for your sister and that you're pretty sure she'll come to you, but the only way to really ensure this is to talk to her about it. Tell her you want to be there for her and that she can talk to you about anything and that there's nothing she can say that will make you feel badly about her. Talk to her about your own concerns (but in general terms). And most definitely have her see a doctor.

I recommend doing anything that doesn't remind you of him too much. Do things that benefit your future. You say you're going for a masters, so you have a pretty solid focus point I'd say.  I feel you though.  My recent relationship that just ended has got me extremely down in the dumps and I understand how hard it is to move on, especially when there is another person in the picture with them.  Time will heal of course.  I had to shoot a wedding today and the bride and groom damn near mirrored the way my recent ex and I acted with eachother (in a good way of course).  That shit was so taxing on my emotions all day that I slipped out of my professional attitude and became visibly depressed.  I snapped out of it and put my fake smile and energy back on though.

Sincerely I think I dodged a bullet. I learned some wonderful things from him, but I'm glad it's done.

I love captain awkward, and she wrote this in an article

>It’s okay to still be in love. Love is – as this hideous wedding-cake topper excruciatingly reminds us – patient, it is kind, it believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  So there you are, all shaggy and embarrassing bounding toward your person wagging your tail and doing that adorable thing you do where you pretend that you’re not going to hand over the ball you’re carrying in your mouth and your person doesn’t even want your stupid ball and then the leash of reality yanks you back.  That part of you is the purest and best and truest part of you, and you can’t really turn it off.  It’s just going to love for a while.

>I say this because it’s really fucking frustrating to try to talk yourself out of having a feeling or beat yourself up for having a feeling at the same time you’re having the feeling.   So  just have the feeling.  Just be the Golden Retriever of Love.  You’re not stupid for feeling it, you’re not a bad person, you didn’t do anything wrong.  You just feel what you feel, and you’ll feel until one day you stop, and you can’t decide when that is, so don’t even try.

20140503233429,instantnoodlez,"You're not alone. A lot of people have been in your shoes before, myself included- in fact, my most recent breakup was just a couple months ago.

There *is* a light at the end of the tunnel. It *will* get better. For my very first difficult breakup with the person I was in love with many many years ago, I felt like I was shredded to pieces. I couldn't sleep, eat, and I lost the will to do anything. Despite what people told me, I absolutely thought that it would never get better, that my life was ""over"".

And yet, here I am. It's been years and I don't think of him at all. After that breakup, I was wrecked every time his name was mentioned. Now, I feel nothing. If I had traveled back in time to the past and told myself back then that I would be fine in the future, past me would've *never* believed it. But it's true. I'm here, and I'm feeling absolutely fine.

...Well, maybe not *too* fine, just because I got dumped from my newest relationship just a couple months ago. And even now, I'm definitely still heartbroken from this recent one, because so much had happened between us. Yet, every time I feel heartbroken, I look back to the past and think about how wrecked I was back then too. But I remind myself that if I recovered from that first breakup, I will recover again. It's still a little hard to believe now, but it was also hard to believe then. But it will happen. And it will happen to you too. Sometimes, it's true that time is the only thing that will help, however there are many things you can do to accelerate it- delete him entirely from your life, start new activities, go to new places, hang out with family and friends, and simply replace your old memories with new memories, which, as long as you keep living, you will.

The way I got over it? Honestly? I met my husband.

So take comfort in knowing that even if it doesn't feel like it now, you WILL be great again soon and hardly even think about him. 

My first rule of going through a break-up is to allow yourself time to lay around in your pajamas, eat comfort foods, watch your favorite movies, and burst out into tears a few times a day. Then after you've gotten it out of your system a little bit you can take relaxing baths, eat some healthy foods, make yourself look nice and feel nice, and start to move forward with your life. Because really that's all you can do. There's not going to be one magical moment where you're like ""I'm over it now!"" It's just going to happen slowly.

It fucking sucked. I got hurt so often that I was getting used to the pain, but I can't tell you how many nights or mornings I would be laying in bed bawling my eyes out, feeling like my chest was going to explode or burn up or something.

Oddly enough I have almost this same problem with my mom.

Most of my close friends, male and female, have seen me naked. That being said, it was usually in MY room or dorm suite or walking around my apartment topless. I made sure it was in my personal space occuring before assuming it would be okay to be naked or change in front of someone in their room. There is nothing inherently wrong with being naked and being naked in front of other people, but not everyone is comfortable with nudity. Some of my friends can handle it, some of my male friends can't. It makes some people uncomfortable, and I personally think if me being naked/topless/shortless makes someone uncomfortable I am close to, if not actually, sexually harassing them. It is all about the audience you are with.

 Obviously, this guy wasn't leering at you as you changed, didn't try to make a move, and isn't treating you differently so he doesn't mind. The ""man friend"" minds and that is just going to need to be a discussion in your relationship. My boyfriend knows I like to be naked around other people and am naked a lot in our house so our roommates will see us; however he doesn't really feel comfortable with me being topless in the house if a new person who may not know me is there because it has made some girls uncomfortable, and some guys will give me looks or say things when I leave the room that he doesn't appreciate. He doesn't tell me I can't be topless, just that some of the immature guys (we are 21-22) can't handle it and he doesn't want me to be disrespected and out of respect for him being uncomfortable I don't do it.

As I learned more about the field, I realized not only do I have a genuine interest, but I also possess these skills that will allow me to excel as a professional in the field""  You have chosen that university for similar reasons- not because you think its a good fit and you like the culture, but because the staff is the highest ranked within your primary interest, or it has the best relationship with X____ teaching hospital, or it has this relationship with a non-profit health organization that you'd ultimately like to work in. 

As for the last question, another way to word it is ""What mark do you want to leave on the world?""

Grad school applications are exceptionally difficult. Undergrad they want to know about YOU, the student. For Grad school, they want to know what you will offer as a commodity, and as a member of whatever academic or professional community they are training you to enter. Will you remain involved and contribute to the community whether as a teacher or powerful professional? Or will you use all these precious resources and return nothing on their investment?

Keep it very tightly focused on how you will be a valuable Health Adminsitrator, and how This School will be your partner in reaching your serious goals. Anything personal, put a very technical and professional spin on it. The biggest mistake people make when applying to grad school is focusing on their own passion for the topic. Everybody loves their topic, so you have o show how you will succeed and *contribute to the field*. That is the most important part ever. **CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIELD!**",8,t3_24o05y

 I would find it incredibly difficult to maintain a full time career and spend quality time with my family. Most jobs that would interest me wouldn't have me home until about 7pm which would be bath and bed time so in effect I'd be a weekend mum which is something I'm not really prepared to accept. (I'm happy to outsource or just becoming sloppy all other house hold tasks apart from daily quality bonding time with my kids)

On the other hand I definitely miss the intellectual challenge of work. I've recently started doing tutoring and it's just made a huge difference to be using my brain and to have a purpose outside of the house. 

Ideally I'd love to find some kind of middle ground where I could have a less intensive career (working say 8am - 3/4pm) which would allow me to be home with my kids after school but in reality this doesn't seem to exist. Once as a couple you start focusing on one person's career it's hard to readdress the balance; my husband's offered to take his turn as a stay at home dad but that wouldn't make sense financially because his career's already off the ground.

Personally, I think I would hate being a stay-at-home mom, or to significantly compromise my career for my family. I'm a medical student, and I'm not putting myself through this so I can be mommy. My degree is worth every bit as much as my boyfriend's (a classmate), and I will not be treated like it's second to my function as a female. I want a family, and my boyfriend was never under any illusions that I'd ever be a housewife. He's the kind of person who will have no problem contributing to family life equally, and who will work with me to handle careers and kids instead of expecting me to just handle it myself. 

It's actually kind of funny, when I first began dating my (Canadian) boyfriend, I mentioned something about how it would be nice to live in Canada because they have Paternity leave. He said he never thought about taking Paternity leave. I asked him why not, and he said ""I don't know, I guess I just assumed my wife would take care of that stuff."" His mother was a SAHM for ten years after he and his sister were born. It's just how he was raised, and what he's used to. But right after those words left his mouth, he said ""Actually, a ton of people I know took Paternity leave when they had kids. I'd never expect you to give up your career. So I guess that means I'll have to make sacrifices too."" He had just not thought about it until then. By now, he knows clear as day that I'll never be a SAHM.

We didn't hire the nanny/housekeeper until my son was 3; yes, it was hard work. We did hire a part-time cleaner -- in the US, we had one who came twice a month; when we moved overseas, we upgraded to twice a week.

20140504220939,FaceToTheSky,"I think for a lot of couples it ends up being a sequential thing; that is, one parent stays home when the kids are young and THEN gets their career off the ground. It requires sacrifice for sure - you're not going to have it all at once. Of course a lot depends on how flexible your respective jobs are.

For me, it's worked out like this:  I had a surprise pregnancy quite young and didn't even really get my career off the ground before the boy was born, so I stayed home and did part-time stuff here and there - tutoring, worked part time at the mall, etc. After a few years of that, I got a full time job (8-4 type thing) and my husband switched his work hours to 1-9. So he got the boy off to school in the mornings, and we had him in an after school program. We didn't get much time as a couple, which sucked, but we knew it was temporary.

My earning potential has always been greater than my husband's, so as my career has advanced, he has backed down his involvement at work. We're currently at a good spot where I'm bringing in a pretty big stack of cash and he has switched to part time, which conveniently has dropped him into a lower tax bracket, so his take home pay is almost the same! But our kid is a teenager now... It's taken this long to get to a place where we all feel fulfilled. And still our house is a mess and neither of us are real involved in his schooling beyond regular old helping with homework.

The most important thing has been that my husband has always taken on an equal share of kid duties and housework. We both agree that family is more important than work, and should come first (as long as it's not going to get you fired, cause that's not helpful). My focus, careerwise, has always been to make ""enough"" money and to feel fulfilled at work  - I'm not worried about external measures of success.

I think it should be said that moving to a country, finding a partner in that country and adhering to that country's cultural norms (however much we may disagree with them) can hardly be called culturally insensitive or racist.

And what do they like about it? That these women are apparently more reserved, worship them, treat them like they are their children (feeding them, doing their chores), etc. Seriously, men who want these kinds of women just want a mother they can fuck and boss around.

As far as I can tell, there isn't anything 'wrong' with their preference for docile asian women (not saying that is a reality, but perhaps an ideal).

20140504174505,janeylicious,"To add my own story: I'm overweight and I have an unrelated problem that I'm trying to prove is not caused by the overweight-ness by losing weight. I was also getting married and as much as I didn't want to stress about losing weight, I wanted to lose weight.

I went to the doctor to deal with some loose ends (exercise induced asthma + exercise to lose weight = ugh, among other things) and then I just took it one day at a time. I didn't set any calorie/pound goals. No diet (but I don't eat many sugary things or drink soda). I only walked more if I could (like parking further away, or getting off a bus stop early) since I couldn't work out easily because I had bronchitis, and I just ate less of the food on my plate telling myself that it was okay to leave leftovers and put it in the trash. To track my walking I have a fitbit. Eating less was a problem but I got used to it slowly, and I tried my best to not buy bad snacks (oreos, ice cream) so I'd have to walk to the market and get a little exercise in if I wanted a bad snack.

My dress kept slipping down on me all day long at my wedding and so I now have a bunch of wedding pictures where you see my black corset under my dress...because in two months I lost almost 20 pounds, and my little body fat measurement device thinks most of that was straight up fat. It's a mixed blessing.

I'm back up like 5 pounds because I ate with reckless abandon on my honeymoon (strawberry pound cake any time via room service and frozen cocktails on a cruise are terrible), but now I'm trying to do it again with my husband since he also needs to lose weight. It's like a 2-3 week hump or so where you really feel the pain of not eating as much, and once you're past that it becomes easier.

You can do it. You can get help if you need, too, and it doesn't make you a terrible person. I wasn't overweight enough to qualify for the medically-supervised diet plans but you can look into those if you want something guaranteed. Otherwise it's a slow process, but don't forget to reward yourself (I had a pint of Cherry Garcia this past week since I have a cold and it was hot) and don't kick yourself if you screw up here and there. A day to day laid back approach makes it much more doable than to be like ""I want to lose 50lbs in a few months!"" and then despair every time you miss a goal.",3,t3_24p4r1
20140504150155,TrueBlonde,"I know it's not the same thing at all, but I also recently had a monstrous task ahead of me. I was studying for a professional exam, similar to the Bar or medical boards, and I knew I had to study at least 3 hours a day, every single day, from the beginning of December until April 30th. At first, I was completely overwhelmed - how can I possible study that much for so long? How can I give up my social life? When will I have time to do anything? I was seriously stressed out and doubting that I could do it because studying that much for so long seemed like such an impossible task. I was looking at the next 5 months of my life and all I saw were 400 hours that I needed to fit in for studying, on top of my fulltime job.

Then someone gave me the advice I gave you. Take it one day at a time. So every day, I pretended it was a new day and told myself, ""Hey, you're going to study for an hour then take a break. Then another hour, then a break. And then you'll study that third hour and be totally free for the rest of the day."" After a few months, I was able to do my studying in a three hour block of time. I stopped worrying about my studying the next day, and the next day, and the next day - I just focused on what I needed to do *today*.

There were days I didn't get my three hours in. There were days I was drained and didn't study at all. But instead of dwelling on the fact that I had failed, I used it as motivation to try harder tomorrow. I looked back and saw all the days that I *did* study and told myself if I could do it for all those days, then one more day wouldn't kill me.

And I *know* that you can do it too. Take each day as it comes and treat it as a new day to change your life. Don't worry about what's going to happen on the future and how far you may need to go. Just today.",13,t3_24p4r1
20140504112313,shameaboutray,"As someone in a similar predicament (PCOS, insulin resistance, desk job), the only things that have worked for me was to cut out 90% of the carbohydrates from my diet, combined with more activity. Walk everywhere you possibly can. If you can do a standing desk at work, do it. I have far more energy at the end of a work day with my standing desk. A body in motion tends to stay in motion.

I'm Italian. My family has turned food enabling into a fine art. We show our love for you by feeding you until you're sick. Once I started making visible changes, I think my family sort of backed off the whole food = love business, at least with me. Though, it took me throwing pasta on the ground to get my point across. The gasps in the room were audible. I explained to them I just can't eat it anymore. The carbs and sugars give me skin issues, terrible dandruff and keep me in a constant state of hazy lethargy. They make me spaghetti squash now so I don't feel left out of pasta dinners.

You may want to consider seeing an GYN that specializes in PCOS to get on some form of BC and maybe Metformin. 2 years ago, my GYN (who specializes in PCOS and endo) recommended I get a Mirena IUD and put me on a Metformin regimen. I did the Metformin for about a year or so, but it just wasn't for me. The side effects were not something I was willing to live with, so I decided to do my own thing (with my Dr.'s approval of course). I'm currently on a pale-esque diet (no refined sugars, breads, pastas), take a supplement called Inositol daily along with vitamin D3, and it's completely changed my life. In the last year and a half, I'm down about 50 pounds (still got another 50 to go), and I haven't felt this good since I was a little girl. I've also been using a koji soap to help speed along the fading of the dark patches.

I know things look bleak now, but rest assured, whatever damage has been done is reversible. I am one of the laziest motherfuckers on the planet, so if I can do it, you can do it. [YOU CAN DO IT](http://i.imgur.com/wC7yAnj.jpg).

Here are two links that my friends have found useful.

This is for your [BMR](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/harris-benedict-equation/) BMR is what my trainer pushes more than the BMI

BMR tells you how many calories your body needs to work.

This is for some basic [nutritional guidelines](http://www.cscc.edu/campus-life/pdf/Nutritional%20Guidelines%20for%20Female%20Athletes.pdf) that should help.

Also, consider (if you have the funds) getting a pedometer of some sort. I personally have a Fitbit flex. It buzzes when I reach 10,000 steps (which determines an ""active"" lifestyle) and has a really great interface. It also makes me more accountable to myself.

As for the office job, find out if there's a park near-by or, if you're in a business complex, some paths. Take a walk or two each day. Nothing fancy, just get out and walk. It'll reinvigorate you, help you get to 10,000 steps, and keep you going.

Your joints may hurt from all the walking (because 10,000 steps is roughly five miles EVERY DAY). Continuing to walk DOES help (most of the time) with joint pain. Losing weight is going to suck, so TRY TRY TRY to keep a positive outlook so you don't get forced into quitting by negative things.

Look at the vitamins you're getting. Also, if you have the funds and/or health insurance, think about getting tested for food allergies. Contrary to popular belief, food allergies isn't a Yes/No issue. You could be sensitive to certain foods that would cause your body to have issues breaking it down properly. (I'm going to get this done as soon as I have the cash monies.)

Talk to a dietician, if you can (see aforementioned monies and health insurance thing). DO NOT DO CRAZY STARVATION DIETS. They are so super bad for you. I will be doing the Personal trainer meals (because I was stupid and didn't read up on it) and it IS a starvation diet. I'm tweaking it but it's still going to be stupid. 

Have a support group. You can always talk to me (I am not a ""big girl"" but I have close friends who wish their bodies were a little different.) and I will help as much as I can. PS: I hear Reddit is really good about cheering up and motivating! ;)

DON'T LET THIS GET YOU DOWN. Sometimes when you realize how far away your goal is, you might want to give up. It's NOT hopeless. YOU are NOT hopeless. YOU GO GIRL!",9,t3_24p4r1

20140504130359,intirb,"Having been on weight loss programs myself, here's my advice:

Take it slow and steady. It's easy to try to starve yourself and lose as much weight as possible in a short amount of time, but that is NOT sustainable in the long run. If you set up a bunch of strict goals, you're setting yourself up for failure. In fact, you may even be purposefully sabotaging yourself because you WANT to see yourself fail.

In fact, I'd recommend not thinking about weight loss at all. Instead, think about being healthy. Constantly tell yourself that you're making a change for the better because you love yourself and you want to treat yourself right. If you start telling yourself that you hate who you are right now, stop that line of thinking right away and replace it with: the person I am right now is a STRONG person who wants to be more healthy and is making a positive change. If your parents are constantly hounding you about the weight, try to convince them that you're going to make positive changes but NOT because of your weight - rather just to be a healthier person. Encourage them to make positive changes to be healthier with you, so that you can support each other.

Finally, pick incremental goals, and don't do everything at once. A good first step might be just to track everything you eat. After two weeks or so of that, you can look at your habits and try to pick some easy goals. Maybe you notice that you drink a lot of soda, so you cut that down. Or you decide to just walk for 15 minutes a day. Easy goals that will help you build momentum and let you feel like you're achieving something.

As you start building momentum, focus on fitness and nutrition goals that will challenge you and show your progress. Like, walking a mile, or jogging for five minutes without stopping. Keep track of your personal records, and keep trying to beat yourself. I think a lot of people focus on weight because it's an easy number to track, but that fixation doesn't lead people to make healthy choices. Set a long-term goal, like finishing a 5k, and when you finally get there, it'll feel great! It doesn't matter what you weigh - if you're making a habit of jogging 5k, you're doing a lot for your own health and happiness.

Focus on making those changes lifetime habits, not quick fixes. Every time you want to make a change, ask yourself: can I live this way for my entire life? If the answer is no, then it's not a reasonable goal. If you're thinking about the goal: ""I won't eat pizza for a month"" but you can't imagine living your life without ever eating pizza again, you're setting yourself up to fail. Instead, think about minimum frequency you could eat pizza and still be happy (once a month?) and make THAT your goal.

**Tl;dr: focus on building healthy habits for life, not losing weight in the short term. And do everything out of love for yourself.**",4,t3_24p4r1

20140504184524,Lil_Boots1,"You don't think of it as 100 pounds. Did you know that 5% weight reduction is considered clinically significant? So if you're 250 pounds right now, losing 12.5 pounds will improve your health a lot. 12.5 pounds is doable, right? You can lose 12.5 pounds. And then when you've lost that and you're 237.5 pounds, you recalculate. Now you have to lose 12 pounds. You already lost 12.5 pounds, so you can lose 12 pounds. You know you can do it. 

As you lose weight, you'll notice yourself feeling better, especially if you have PCOS. Weight loss will really improve your symptoms, so that will also be motivation as you start seeing results. You might find that eating a keto or generally low glycemic index diet will help you feel better and lose weight as well because it will make your insulin resistance less relevant.

Definitely agree with everyone who says to start small. Reducing portions or cutting out snacks is an easy first step. This should see a couple pounds drop without any exercise if you have been used to a diet of large portions. And once the first pounds go, trust me, you will feel so motivated to kick it up a notch that you could even incorporate exercise and physical activity into your routine to see even more come off.

I can only run for 30 seconds at a time, but its better than the no seconds Ive been doing. 

I will tell you not to watch the scale. Losing weight is 80% diet and 20% exercise. You can lose 50lbs by diet alone. Most people add in exercise to fill in gaps in the skin where fat was. The first week at the gym I gained 4lbs. But three weeks later I was down 7. 

Download the app! Seriously! Also, stop drinking sodas and sweet tea. If you have to have soda, remember to log those empty calories. The more you drink the less food you get. Get a bottle of Deer Park with the sport cap and fill that bitch up 3 times a day to start with. Get used to peeing (perfectly normal and necessary) for a few days.

20140504191325,The_Panophobic,"Fellow desk-jobber trying to eat better and exercise, here are a few things I do that might help you. I pack my lunches the night before, and plan them to include a variety of fruits and veggies, as well as some good protein so I won't be hungry. Pack a few snacks if you think you'll want them too. I find it's easier to pick healthy choices when you aren't hungry/about to eat. An example lunch might be half a cut up apple with peanut butter, a handful of baby carrots, some broccoli, some mushrooms, some radishes, and some snap peas with a little bit of ranch for dipping, a cup of greek yogurt, and a hard boiled egg or some tuna salad with whole grain crackers. I'll switch up what fruits and veggies I put in there so I don't get bored, and I keep dried fruit and nuts at my desk as snacks.

I also put 30 minutes on my calendar every day to take a walk. Some days I end up being too busy or I just miss it, but at least every day there are 30 minutes when people aren't trying to grab meetings with me that I can take to walk around the building. Some of my coworkers also do it, and we help remind each other. Someone else recommended a pedometer like a fitbit. You might not even need something so hi-tech though--remember when those ones you clip on your belt were the hot item in athletic equipment? They're like ten bucks, and they'll do a good job of keeping you mindful of how much you're moving around during the day. It can be a good reminder to get out of your chair sometimes at work.

It is simple but not easy--you just need to burn more calories than you consume. My fitness pal is a great tool that can be used on your phone or computer to track calories. This can be a way to monitor yourself, see patterns, and identify calorie-dense foods that are holding you back. Giving up or cutting back on sodas, for example, can be a great way to cut a large amount of calories from your diet.

Food prep can be VERY helpful, I like to make lunches for the week and portion out snacks like baby carrots or pretzels so that they're easy to grab and go.

I wasn't quite as heavy as you, but after I started a plant-based diet, it was life changing! I had high cholesterol, I was nearly obese, I had PCOS and was heading to diabetes like my mom, I had cystic acne, I had IBS-D, I had borderline low thyroid... all of that is GONE. I also have fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis and while I still feel some of the effects of that, both are much much better. I literally thought my life was over in my TEENS because of all the health issues I had. 20s mostly sucked, too. I was on the couch or in bed a lot and I didn't have a lot to live for because my energy levels were so low and my pain levels were so high and it seemed like my body was working against me. Now I am biking regularly and know what it feels like to look down over mountains I've hiked. My best days are still AHEAD of me, I'm sure.  


I went vegan for the animals, but just changing my diet as a result of that was incredible. I had a lot of effects happen even before I started focusing on healthy eating and eating more whole foods. I was just trying to avoid cruelty to animals and then it was like, ""Woah, all these health issues I take for granted as unavoidable/untreatable are getting better!"" 

And when you feel better, you will want to do more. You will find active hobbies because you feel good getting out. If you can, get out on a bike and just make a habit of it -- not to burn calories or lose fat, but just to feel the wind in your hair. Do things for the enjoyment of them and get in those habits.

You owe it to yourself because there is so much to experience in this life that is awesome. You are going to look back later and be so proud of how much you've accomplished! And it's not going to be about the number on the scale or the calories you had to eat in a day, it's going to be about nourishing your body with lots of great tasty food that gives you energy and nutrients to power you through great adventures. It's not going to be about how many calories you burned or fitting into size X jeans, it's going to be about seeing what's over on the other side of that mountain or dancing to the music because you can't help but want to move to those awesome beats! And then you'll see some pics that a friend of you took while you weren't looking and you'll be smiling and think, ""Damn, I look as good as I feel!""

She's made some steps in the right direction, though. It's really been incredible for me. I just assumed that I'd end up with all these health issues like her and others in my family -- that is was ""genetics"". Now at family events the topic invariably comes up, ""What's she doing differently?"" It's still hard to get people to try it, though. They think it is going to be ascetic and difficult. The truth is, I thought it would be. Then I actually went vegan as an experiment that my husband and I were doing and it was *way* easier than we thought. We didn't start off whole foods, so it was really easy, but whole foods came rather naturally just as we learned to cook more and avoid stuff in boxes. And we've become such foodies! Definitely NOT deprived, though we do vary in how strict we are about whole foods (strictly vegan, but I do like olive oil over steamed veggies and real sugar in my coffee and the occasional cupcake or non-dairy ice cream).

Having sex is risky for your physical and mental health. Not all STDs are preventable by condoms, and it is hard not to get emotionally attached to people you sleep with. This doesn't mean there should be anything ""dirty"" or ""unpure"" about having sex, but it is risky. 

Your number is just a number, and it means nothing. Having had casual sex does not make you a bad person, and if you can do it without regret, go have fun, and enjoy yourself.

However, if you are going on a date, and before the date and the spur of the moment, ask yourself if sex will bring you fleeting vs lasting happiness. If you don't want to have sex before the date, waiting a few dates won't stop a great partner from wanting to be with you. Having sex on the first date also won't stop a great partner from wanting to be with you. 

I just think that if casual sex doesn't make you happy, that is also ok to realize. Just ask yourself why you feel bad. If it's because you think external forces want you to feel bad, than it's silly. If you decide you personally want sex to just be for love, than that is a suitable reason to not participate in casual sex.

I think those ideas come not only from religion but from things like romance novels (where the ideal woman is portrayed as inexperienced, generally) and other kinds of media. And it all fits into the patriarchal world that we inhabit.

It took introspection and a lot of time to understand that it doesn't work like that. For a start, 'virginity' is such a vague concept. So it had such little relevance. As long as I'm being safe, it  doesn't matter how many partners I've had. Why does it matter? Get over all those preconceived notions. Men suffer from it, too.

Plus, think about the princesses. What happens in their Happily Ever After? They just sit around, that's what. Belle got a bigger library, but she's not really going anywhere. Still only one forest away from her town. Tiana's happily ever after was working in a restaurant. It's cool that she got her dream, but it's a pretty mundane thing almost anyone could do. Ariel was the princess of a vibrant underwater kingdom, which I'll bet made more than one lady in here wish she could turn into a mermaid and go visit. She marries Eric, and now she just sits around in a regular old town. Snow White and Aurora ... well they already kind of sat around. Now they sit around wearing nicer dresses, I guess. Happily ever after is lame. In real life, you get to live past the wedding, and go on adventures the rest of your life. 

To say that a relationship is a ""hard journey"" is just as unrealistic, I feel, as the Happily Ever After is. When you're with someone who you have a lot of compatibility with, it's just not hard. Sure, we have little fights about one of us feeling like it's the other's turn to do the dishes. But we both want the same things out of life, so there's no big dramatic fights over moving to different countries or whether we should have one kid or fifty kids. And that's ignoring the good parts- which are about 90% of the time. I'd take real-life relationship over glossy, superficial Disney one any day.",1,t3_24pqyu

I can't say how I got to the point that I realized that life wasn't a fairy tale or a romance novel.  It just happened.  I don't know if it's because I had a couple difficult relationships that made the great one that fell into my lap.... so easy.  It's still work.  A lot of work.  There are arguments, occasional tears.  But in the end, communication, compromise, and love for each other make us work at it and appreciate what we have.  

The biggest thing for me was after a long, drawn out just ""OK"" relationship, I realized I was strong enough to be on my own.  Forever if need be!  A man would not complete me.  And then I met a man that complimented my life.  That was my life changer.",1,t3_24pqyu

Your next step should be identifying your usual narrative fantasy path, and how/when you start heading into it. The step after that is telling yourself ""No. Stop."" whenever you start.

I'm in therapy for this very thing right now. I am a writer, a Romantic, and have an overactive imagination. Narrative fantasy is like crack for me. I manipulate not only myself, but the people who enter into relationships with me into fitting this ideal storyline that not only doesn't make any sense, but isn't even something I want.

So, don't be me. 

As for becoming stronger, I started going to aerial yoga three or four days a week and actually doing the things I dreamed about doing when I was a kid. I dyed my hair pink, bought sailing lessons for my birthday this year, and have decided I'm not going to do anything I don't want to.

20140504153029,janeylicious,"I think Disney Princesses are slowly moving towards something that isn't all love-at-first-sight-princess-with-no-worries. And there have been a few examples in the past where that's not the case too.

Brave might center around girl-must-find-man-to-marry but then throws that to the wind and then some. Frozen shows sisters sticking up for each other no matter what happens and the men are a bit of an afterthought - Anna may have found a man but Elsa is also core to the story and we don't even know what Anna will do at the end with a relationship. The Princess and the Frog bothered me a little since Tiana could be more independent, but she is focused on her dream that doesn't involve getting married to The Perfect Prince. Tangled was a nice twist in that Rapunzel is not a totally helpless, vapid princess. Then there's Mulan, who is all about helping her family instead of just focusing on finding a nice boy to get married to and leaving her father to help the country.

Pixar movies in general also don't focus on girl-meets-guy and they are refreshing to watch while still managing to move me to tears. Like The Incredibles shows a family working together - a family that would probably fall apart easily if now-Mrs. Elastigirl wasn't around to hold them together ;)

If you look at other animated films in general there's some good stuff in there too - Fiona in Shrek is pretty awesome and breaks a lot of stereotypes. Anastasia is pretty self-sufficient. 

Anyway back to the main concern - there's nothing wrong with having a fairy tale dream. Even the most stereotypical story you have from a Disney movie involving ""happily ever after"" (and tell me about this, the buttons at Disney World I got while on my honeymoon say this...) is going to involve fighting and compromise and problems but there's no room to tell that story anywhere and that doesn't get audiences in to watch the movie anyway. But overall the story could still be ""happily ever after"". I'm super feminist and hate the pretty-pink-princess stuff but I still _want_ to live happily ever after because it's something everyone tends to strive towards (happiness just tends to not be based on the hot husband and little kids in a castle kind of story).

If you _want_ to change your dream, you could get started reading, maybe.

I had enough of him and I pretty much verbally lashed out. Basically, entire family got involved, my mom stood up for me, he threatened to throw me out of the house and threatened divorce with my mom because ""he wasn't appreciated enough"". I had to walk home from school for a week because he refused to pick me up, and he refused to talk to me for a few more weeks.

My mother and I were so scared from his reaction that we actually mentally prepared to leave without notice, because we didn't know what he would do (would he take a knife out and threaten to kill us if he heard we were leaving? No idea what his brain was capable of thinking). In the end, he ended up changing himself for the better. No clear reason why, don't know if my yelling had any life-changing effect on him. He's MUCH better now than the dad I remember growing up, but it's still very frustrating dealing with the crappy parts that are still left.",3,t3_24qqnu
20140505021945,MrAnonyMousetheGreat,"You stayed in town for college?  If not, maybe he got more used to chilling out?

I have an Indian father.  I'm a guy.  Similar attitude as your father.  Except he was more physical in his ""reprimands. (ie losing his temper at any challenge to his authority, and not being deliberate or controlled at all)""  I finally pushed back in one of these encounters when I was about 16.  In a series of a few months it happened a few more times.  I pretty much stopped talking to him around the first or second incident (which happened on his birthday, so that I kinda sucked.  Actually, I think he started the silent treatment then, and I continued it.).  Finally, the very last time I called the cops.  Of course, they sided with him, handcuffed me, and threatened to send me to JuV (if I remember the incident correctly, I had asked my mom if I could watch TV, she said yes.  So I was watching it.  He came in and turned it off.  I turned it back on, and the fight ensued).  However, after that, there were no physical encounters.  I think my parents realized there was something really wrong and terrible happening to our family and the way they were handling it was going to lead to things like this.

Anyways, I didn't talk to him for three years until my aunt whom I love and respect convinced me to some time in my freshman year of college or second year of college.  He was paying for my college, my private school, and everything the entire time.  And we've worked on rebuilding our relationships.  And he's generally gotten more mellow, but not completely.  Since then there have been two incidents where he's lost his temper and gotten blood-eyed, ready to wreck someone angry.  It's been either directed at me, at which point I reflexively got in his face and challenged him to go ahead and throw the first punch (which he didn't), or I stood in the way and wouldn't let him come at my family members.  You can't predict it, and it happens at the smallest triggers.  99% of the rest of the time though, he's normal, and we'll argue and and joke around with him.  And my mom is her own woman, and operates independently of him for the most part (she decided to go to enroll in a DNP program without ever telling him until she decided to go for instance).  When I was in high school, it seemed like all the ridiculous stresses of life and work (he'd work ridiculous hours, 6am to 10-1pm, 7 days a week) really just kept him on a trigger.  And life's treating him terribly right now, but somehow, he's become more resilient and is managing it better.  It seems that his main stresses are that my sister and I turn out OK.  But it may also be because he's being forced to work fewer hours by the stuff that's going on.

So, what I have to say based off of my experiences is this:

Be ready to be independent.  Be ready to take student loans, move in with your BF for the summer (make sure you have that out, first), etc.

Assert yourself, calmly, rationally, don't get angry.  And don't react to anger.  And don't inflame anger (I mean trigger his triggers on purpose cause you're getting angry).  If you see him getting angry, just take your mom and go away.  Let him know via text or something, that you'll continue the discussion later if you wish.

The point I'm trying to make is that this anger, this sound and fury, is almost all bluster, in the moment.  I suspect your father loves you, and you have to trust that emotion wins out.

P.P.S  The safer and smarter and less direct route is to keep lying about reasons to leave the house.  Go to medical school.

I'm still heavily dependent on my parents for financing my rent, food, and study. I've started taking loans out this year, but really only to cover tuition. Everything else is supported by my parents. 

The short term lease wouldn't have worked. A lot of this isn't about the money -- it's about the mental reasoning behind why I would do such a thing. Not going home during break doesn't make sense to my family, and would cause a LOT of unwanted drama. I often have to think about how my actions would influence the mood of the house. Even if I go home for one day and cause hell because I talked against my dad, it's usually my mom and my little sister (who only have one home to live in, whereas I have friends' apts, bf's apt, school apt, etc. to go to) who get the brunt of it. I don't want to cause stress where it's unneeded, and it really hurts me to see my dad yell at my mom for something I caused.

It's a sticky situation. But I'm glad you're a parent that sees the need for a child's independence.

Some thread types are also really bad at catching and holding on to odours ( unnatural ones like polyester mostly). Are you washing them often enough? If so, is it with a strong detergent or an organic one. Or maybe it's a liquid one i instead of powder ? Tried going the natural route and holy shit all of my clothes appeared clean but after a few hours they would stink like hobo sweat. After switching back to regular powder detergent it took a fee cycles of washes and now all my clothes smell fine.

How are you drying the clothes - drier? Hung on the rack? If clothes stay wet long or dry in a damp area where air isn't circulated they will develop a funk too or even mildew. A good way to get rid of it is to do a final rinse with a half cup vinegar. And to NEVER allow wet clothes to wait, not even minutes, before hanging.

And finally deodorant - same experience as with ""natural"" detergents. Some are not true deodorants (reduce sweat or bacteria) but simply smelly shit to mask sweat smell. These are absolutely awful.

Some things that I find helpful for me: shaving my underarms and trimming pubic hair.  I find that if I have longer hair in either place, it traps and holds onto the smell more.  It's also easier to get the skin clean.  Also: using a good-quality bodywash and bath ""pouf"" to get a good lather in the shower, and making sure to get between any folds of skin, where odor-causing bacteria like to hang out.  Make sure you have enough time between getting out of the shower and getting fully dressed for your skin to really dry out - I get some skin irritation (particularly bad around my belly button, it can also have a little odor to it) if I'm not careful about letting the skin fully dry before getting dressed.

As some other people mentioned, if you haven't been on top of cleaning, sheet changing, etc., that can contribute.  Even if your clothes are clean, if they have been hanging out in a room where the air is musty and other smells are lingering, they aren't going to smell super-fresh when you finally wear them.  I like to clean with diluted vinegar to help deodorize spaces.  If the weather is nice enough where you are, try opening the windows to let your place get a good airing out.  Try to wash your sheets every 2-3 weeks (more frequently if you can), and add in some white vinegar to the wash to help deodorize.

As far as the vaginal moisture goes - yes, it is normal.  I like to wear disposable pantiliners every day because it helps extend the life of my underwear and it's easy to change out a liner midday if I feel like I've been extra sweaty.  As I mentioned above, I also try to keep the hair trimmed short to minimize the accumulation of odors.

If you've tried all of these things for a few weeks and it is still and issue (maybe find a friend with a good nose and ask them to be frank with you about it?), try talking to your doctor.  Sometimes people can get skin infections that need some medical attention to resolve the odor.",2,t3_24qy0q

If it's all in jest, but it still bothers you, I would suggest telling him so--that those ""quirks"" are a part of who you are, and that you cannot/will not change.

However, if it's not all in good fun, I would also suggest talking to him about it. Nobody deserves to feel like the person they are is somehow lesser or wrong for some/all of the quirks and characteristics about themselves. BUT I would give him some sort of time limit to change his tune (whatever time you think is appropriate, but I would say a month max). If he continues to make those comments to you after your assigned time limit, I would cut the cord on your relationship, because then it just sounds like he is trying to manipulate/change you into someone that fits his mold of what a female/girlfriend/wife material/etc. is supposed to be.

As for him being jealous, I don't have any advice on that, but your situation sounds almost exactly like my husband and my before we got married. I kept the guy friends that were truly my friends, and weeded out the ones that were not (easier said than done). Eventually, my husband realized that I could be trusted to have both male and female friends (that's not to say he was sitting there saying, ""You can't have male friends. Harumph,"" but I'm sure you get the point).

If you want to make more female friends though, I would suggest maybe looking into activities that typically have a higher female demographic that you'll enjoy. I promise you'll meet people that you'll get along with!

When he doesn't like one  of my friends, we talk about why and based on whether I think his reason is legitimate or not, I either remain friends or cut ties to a ' I'll only talk to you if it's necessary while being as tactful and non-cunty as possible.'",3,t3_24q27d

Your problems with G sound very similar to what my G's problems were. There was a specific incident that made me realize that he was jealous of me having male friends. And I flat out told him, to his face, that it's not up to him who I am friends with. It was just one of those things I felt so sure about. 

That was a long time ago (6 years!). We've worked through that, and many other things. We both have close male and female friends now. If you're both open to internal reflection, and honestly communicating with each other, you can work this out. ",3,t3_24q27d

20140504214525,AlterngeusG,"UPDATE: Hi everyone, sorry I couldn't reply individually to your comments, I tried but they came in too fast and I had to plan for a serious and potentially unpleasant conversation. I started with ""is this how you saw things going when we first met?"" And then from there I brought up that we bicker about my old friends and that it's difficult to do work. I also mentioned that I hate being stressed about making nice with girls just to get along with them, and that I feel that he is being controlling, which could be the first stage of more abusive issues.

At first, he was hurt that I felt that way, that I put our drama online for all to see, and that I painted him as a jealous boyfriend. And then it sunk in that there was a reason he was being painted that way: because that's how it is. G is jealous, he likes being the sole support system, and he likes the idea of me acting in a way that I can't. He said that he wants to change.

So we talked and reached common ground. I can be with my friends one on one without criticism as long as he meets them first. I can make friends of either gender but he wants to meet them. I think that's fair, and that it will help build trust without completely unnerving him. 

Second, I made it very clear that I want him, and only him, and no one else. He said he knows and he loves me too and he just wants to protect me. We talked about how protection does not have to equal control, and that I am always going to be honest about what I'm doing and who I'm with. Tears were shed, it opened my eyes to a few more things he does that should have led me to this conclusion before: he insisted I move in after dating less than a month, he checks on my constantly when I'm at work, he makes sure the doors are locked when he leaves for work (midnight tour, he does NOT lock me in a house just because he's not there!), etc. we have a lot to talk about still tonight, obviously. However, I think we scratched the surface of the control issues, which is so important.

Finally, we are going to keep working on the positive parts of our relationship: we have great communication, we laugh often, we have intelligent debates, the sex is fantastic, we show our affection through words, gifts, and touch, we are adventurous and romantic together while a little bit cheesy. I am not leaving him if he can relax and trust me more. If he can't we will have to face the possibility of a break up, but for now that's off the table. We love each other dearly, he completes me, we hit a rough patch and hopefully we will adapt and overcome together.

Thank you again, twox! I will update again if anything happens, and I want to say thank you especially for making me feel less alone. You guys made me feel like I can keep and make friendships with either gender. More importantly, I may have let G continue to be controlling and domineering.

My boyfriend of the past several months not only accepts my friendship with my EX (We'll call him J); he understands that though J and I love each other, we both know we aren't good together as a couple. My boyfriend actually likes J and invites him over when we hang out with other friends. I keep waiting for him to be bothered by my friendship with J, but he *genuinely* has no problem. He thinks it's kind of beautiful and amazing that we've been able to remain close in spite of the relationship not working out. I spend time with J by myself when I choose, and my boyfriend is totally cool with it, encourages me to maintain this friendship because he can see it's important to me.

However, I have *always* had primarily male friends and I NEVER tolerated jealousy from anyone who wanted to date me. I do not believe in ""I trust you, just not him."" That means you either think I'm lying or that my friend is a rapist, neither of which are acceptable. I would have told this guy to kiss off a looooooong time ago. Give up my friends of 10 years for someone I barely know? That's crazy. 

Look, part of respecting YOU is also respecting your judgement. If he doesn't believe you are capable of making your own decisions, like who to be friends with, then he doesn't think of you as an adult, doesn't respect you. Why would you want to be with a man like that?

YOUR behavior is NOT the problem, understand? You haven't done anything wrong, you have nothing to be ashamed of or feel bad about. Your boyfriend's behavior has been controlling, manipulative and abusive. HE is the one who needs to change. Immediately. 

He will not dictate who your friends are.
He will not complain when you talk to other men. 
He will not bat an eye when you are doing your JOB. 
He will not call you ""naive"" and ""un-lady-like."" 

If he doesn't straighten himself out, this behavior will get worse. It will continue to escalate, until he finally hits you for the first time. He'll cry and apologize, say he didn't mean it, swears he'll never do it again.  At least, not until the next time it happens and he convinces you it was your fault. Then he'll complain that you ""shouldn't have made him so angry.""

Be careful. Put yourself first. Listen to the people in your life who really care about you. If they don't like this guy, there's a *reason.*

Places vary on how formal their dress code is, but a google image search for ""business clothes women"" or something similar will probably you some ideas.

20140505113821,ShirleyFunke482,"I've found that many petite lines at stores are actually sized differently all around. They are tailored for a higher natural waist, neckline and shoulders are shrunken and the sleeve length is shorter. Usually smaller all around.

Both stores frequently have sales too, making it more affordable. ",2,t3_24qw0i
20140505115132,Lil_Boots1,"They make those changes because people who are shorter don't just have shorter arms and legs. They have shorter torsos and smaller bone structure in general. For example, my mom is 5'1"". A misses size 4 fits her hips and often her inseam depending on length and shoes, but if it's supposed to be a mid rise pair of pants, the waist of the pants which should hit the top of her hips actually reaches her belly button, but because it's designed to reach the top of her hips, it's too wide to fit her natural waist. If she wears a dress or a v-neck top from misses, the waist is too low and the v is much deeper than it should be because it's designed for a longer torso. Some day I should make her try on things with me (5'6"") and take pictures to illustrate the reason that petite sizes are made entirely differently, because many people don't seem to know. So if you're someone who is very short, like OP or my mom, you will likely find that petite sizing fits you much better. Some things don't matter as much, like t shirts and sweatshirts and sweaters.

That said, a size 16 is more or less the same width in petites and misses, give or take a size because women's sizing is inconsistent anyway. A woman at our church is roughly my mom's height but at least 100 pounds heavier, and she also wears petites because the inseam length, the cut of the rise and the location of the waists all fit her better and are more flattering for her.

Nobody gets to force others to feel a certain way. They don't get to tell you who you can befriend or when you get to party with friends. 

Handling things ""like a guy would"" makes no sense to me. What does that even mean? Can you describe this? Sounds like you handled the situations like a reasonable adult. Is that what guys do?

Either that, or don't let your goodies touch without a condom on. 


Also, it is my completely unscientific opinion that starting an intimate relationship with a man messes with your cycle. Whenever I am with a new guy, I am a week early. Not sure if it's pheromones or the increased activity in the lady garden, but I and most of my girlfriends have experienced it. 

So, don't worry about it for now. Go do something relaxing and take a test if you are a week late.

I want inspiration on how to build a lasting relationship, rather than stories of terrible ones. 

EDIT: I made a [**thread**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24rmit/serious_whats_your_story_of_your_happy_marriage/), but no-one is answering. I guess there aren't any good stories to share :/",101,t3_24r9yk
20140505155723,Paxalon,"The thing is, even in a happy and ""good"" marriage, sometimes things do go tits up.  People are people, and married or not they make mistakes.  Just because you have a ring on your finger doesn't mean you're immune to horrible lapses in judgement, personal crisis, and unhappiness with other aspects of your life.  People get tempted by others, feel taken for granted, feel stuck in a rut.  Sometimes, that stuff goes bad.  Even in a seemingly solid relationship.  How you handle those things, what you will tolerate from your partner, and how you communicate will make the difference in whether things go on.

And people change and grow over time, always.  If you're both mature, compatible, and communicate well, then you will you change and grow together.  That's great, and beautiful. If you disagree on a lot of life things, don't talk through things, and aren't sure what you want in life, you will probably grow apart.  And while probably for the best, it sucks.

What builds a great relationship?

**Respect.**  Not taking what the other person does for you for granted, and acknowledging that, although they are half of your marriage, they are still their own person with thoughts and feelings and needs.

**Communication.**  Probably #1.  The other person cannot fix what they do not know is broken.

**Maturity.**  The ability to take responsibility for one's actions, and recognize that you are not the center of the universe.

**Compatibility.**  In values, beliefs, financial patterns, living patterns, and sex.  This is not the same as liking the same music and movies, though that doesn't hurt.

Boring things, mostly.  :P  Except for the sex.

Not necessarily so.  Alcohol affects different people in different ways, and the faculties for informed decision-making may be jettisoned earlier than the faculties for communication.

It may be different for people in a long-term relationship because, when alcohol is involved, the question becomes ""is my partner making a decision while drunk that she wouldn't make while sober?""  And people in a long-term relationship can usually judge that pretty well.

But if it's somebody you don't know well, then you can't make that judgment.  And your partner can always get past this by giving you blanket consent--*while sober*--for hanky-panky to happen when she's drunk.",4,t3_24r9yk

If they aren't concerned when something that should be normal is causing you great distress, they aren't worth your time. It sounds like it might not be the entirety of your problem, but you could have been narrating my life several years ago when you were talking about the speculum, and how scared you are.

TLDR Vaginismus is a stress response that seems to happen out of fucking nowhere. Your body anticipates penetration, and your muscles turn into steel and hell no nothin's getting in there, no matter how lubed it is or how stretched you think you are. It takes a lot of conditioning to work yourself up to being able to handle typical penetration - and even then it's not guaranteed.

When I figured out what my problem was with my current doctor (who is a magical health fairy as far as I'm concerned), it took years of frustration, persistence, and several relationships to get to the point where I could handle penetration - and even now, the only pleasure/satisfaction that I get from it is knowing that I'm not in pain.

I'm going to tell you something that is very important whether or not vaginismus is the issue, that took me a very long time to say and even longer to believe: *you are not broken*. I don't remember how long I went feeling like I was a failure of a human because I had a body part that didn't function right and *no one* knew why or how to help. Don't you ever dare compromise or put yourself into a painful situation because you feel like you have to. My condition got way worse than it should have been because myself (and my ex) decided it was something to push through - and then he started to ignore that it hurt me, and then sex became something that was just for his benefit, and then at the end, he raped me. I'm not saying this can/will happen to you, but if my shitty experience can help someone else understand just how this affects someone's life, then you bet I'm gonna scream my story from the mountaintops.

I really wish the best for you - your body shouldn't be your enemy and you don't need to be in pain. You really, truly deserve to feel healthy and pain-free - please don't give up, you might have to switch doctors a dozen times and you might hit snags in relationships, but always look out for yourself because at the end of the day, it's only you that gets to wear your body, no one else can know how you feel until you tell them.",8,t3_24r7l9

20140506013754,StringOfLights,"I was also cheated on (also through much of his PhD, though not 7 years). It really sucked. It rocks your whole world. You feel stupid, used, abused, scared, angry, and lonely in ways words can't describe. It's a completely final and abrupt slamming of a door that can never open again. It's almost like mourning a death, in a way, because someone you loved dearly is gone forever, but you're left grappling with the fact that that person never really existed. Not in the way you thought they did.

You are stronger than you know. This is a stupid test of your strength that you don't deserve, but you'll come out of this knowing that you have the ability to be thrust into a situation like this and come out the other side. It takes time, but you'll get there.

It's really nice to hear the motivational stuff about meeting the right person, but one thing I really had to come to grips with was that I shouldn't worry about finding a new relationship at all. The independence I gained when I moved on from that horrible relationship was so amazing. I didn't need to find anyone new to make myself happy; happiness is something I had to carve for myself out of this ridiculous world we live in. A person to share that with is great, but having the inner strength to know I was going to be okay without that is extremely powerful. Just being okay with myself was so freeing. 

I took the months after that relationship ended to turn my focus inward and find what I needed to tick. I'd say the immediate aftermath was probably the loneliest I've ever felt, but I hit a point where I really relished my independence. I took every opportunity to travel, and all the trips were alone. I pursued hobbies and interests. Read a lot. Got a pet. At some point I realized I was alone but not lonely, and it was really, really peaceful. I'm extremely grateful for that time.

Of course, this cliche wouldn't be complete if I didn't tell you that I ended up meeting the perfect guy. It's been three and a half years of bliss. I never would have imagined a relationship could be so good. I wouldn't have found it if I hadn't taken time to focus on myself, though.
",30,t3_24sw5k
20140506090521,ideefixe77,"This is such a great response. Thank you, thank you.  You articulating what I am feeling so well. I feel like someone died but I know he was never that person so I'm mourning someone who doesn't exist but still is capable of cutting me so extremely deeply. It is a tall order to try to work on being happy on my own. I know I owe that to myself. But at the same time part of me wants to show him I can move on as fast as he did- obviously not a healthy inclination. I'm pushing back on those urges and I am focusing on trying to heal. I'm definitely in that lonely stage. I have no idea how to do this or even cope with this. ",2,t3_24sw5k
20140506094400,StringOfLights,"You already are coping! You're working through the emotions and adjusting to all the changes you're going through. Really, it's extremely stressful just to have your day-to-day routine change. You're talking through things. You're grieving. Cut yourself some slack; it's okay to be upset and sad. Don't add guilt to that. What you're feeling is natural and normal, and it will pass with time.

 Everything you do for the interim will feel like a stop-gap coping mechanism. That's fine! Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and get more distance between yourself and this awfulness. Every day you get farther away from it.

He moved on fast because he's a cheating twat. You're not that person, and that's a good thing. What do you want to prove to him? That he's meaningless? The best way to do that isn't through revenge, it's through indifference. 

Hate him for awhile for wasting your time and your effort and betraying your trust, but when the time comes and those feelings start to fade, just nothing him.  If you do things to show him, you're empowering him. You're on the other side of that now, and that's a much better place to be. 

Everything from here on out is on your terms. Be thankful you didn't spend one more second with him. Go off and live your life. It will be far better than it would have been with him.  

Maybe karma isn't a thing and he won't get what's coming to him, but you can't control that. The only race he's running is a race to the bottom, and you have better things to do. Let him fester in the mess he digs for himself. People who do asshole-ish things tend to surround themselves with other assholes, so history tends to repeat itself eventually. 
",1,t3_24sw5k
20140506102504,ideefixe77,"That he is meaningless is definitely the goal. It is certainly how he has made me feel and it is horrible. He really has made it completely clear that I mean and meant nothing to him. And while I doubt he would care if I did the same to him that is absolutely the goal. Right now he stabbed me in the back and keeps twisting the knife. I would love to get to the point where none of these effected me- where his actions mean nothing and he can't hurt me anymore. I think that will take a long time. And maybe in the meantime I can fake it till I make it. :) I have already committed to no longer speaking with him. I said my piece yesterday. I got it out of my system and allowed myself one day of vindictiveness where what I said was aimed to hurt. Now my goal is to move on with grace. 

And as far as assholes ending up together his new girlfriend certainly seems to fit the bill. She did the same thing to her long term boyfriend but moved my ex into their house first. I hope that the fall to the bottom hurts. (With the goal of me not even caring about this of course :) )",1,t3_24sw5k

After a string of terrible relationships and being cheated on repeatedly I've taken a year to just be by myself to find happiness and strength from within. It sounds so cliche but I can't even begin to describe the ways in which I've changed, definitely for the better. I've heard it a lot lately that rather than search for someone to be with, you should develop yourself and your own character so you're someone worth being with. I agree wholeheartedly. The quality of men I now date is much, much better. I have more self respect and more belief that I'm worth a decent relationship where I'm more than just a doormat. I think part of it is also opening your eyes and trying to see the world in a realistic view. I think I used to project how much I adored my boyfriends to the point where I tricked myself into thinking they felt exactly the same even when there were clear  signs to the contrary. Self love and self worth aren't bad things, if you have them in the right proportions. Best of luck to OP. Life seems shit right now but trust me lady, you're going to look back on this as a blessing in disguise. Love yourself, care for yourself and rebuild all the energy that was wasted on that loser.

But deep down I know I'm not ready or capable of another relationship right now. I loved him so much that I can't even contemplate even seeing someone else casually. And that is part of what stings. He never loved me enough to feel that way. He was fully capable of not just sleeping with someone else but jumping into a committed relationship less than two weeks after he looked me in the face and said he knew we had something special, that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me.

20140505155202,detsher77,"Going out on a limb here but this sounds like a very common situation of different values. You valued the relationship, he valued what he got from the relationship, which means he can get that outside of your relationship.

He probably wouldn't consciously think this, but I see it happen so often. Doesn't mean he wasn't a good partner for the majority of it or that you misjudged him as a person, just that some people walk into a relationship looking for what they can get out another person because they think that's what relationships are for, without understanding how little respect that shows their partner.

I didn't realize his pattern until recently because when we got together 7 years ago it was right on the tail end of another 2 year relationship.  I doubt ours would have lasted near as long if I didn't fight so hard to maintain it. If I didn't forgive so easily and make excuses for poor behavior.

He never had actually gotten over the *first* girl. He just bounced around from girl to girl just so he was with *someone*. He didn't know how to be alone or who he was, really.

I always viewed angry as a good time to disconnect completely: get rid of anything that reminds you of him, disconnect any accounts, delete him off Facebook. By the time I'm over being angry, I'm on my own and no longer reminded of the guy. You've got this. He has no sense of who he is and a girlfriend he'll probably flake out on in two years.

Last summer he went to a friend's wedding out of state. When he came back he brougt up a specific issue in our next session that was do or die for us and we agreed on a timeline to either fix it or end it. I was pretty sure we wouldn't fix it but I was looking forward to wrapping up amicably. 

Lo and behold, he had fallen in love with his friend's sister when he was at the wedding. So 4 days later he decides fuck it, we're done. He doesn't tell me about this woman, though, and was generally a piece of shit throughout the process. 

And you know? I feel fucking amazing now. I spent a couple of weeks being ridiculously drunk with my friends and then I started reveling in everything I couldn't do when he was around. He was allergic to flowers, so I started buying them weekly. He couldn't have a pet; I'm getting a cat. Etc. 

It's been about 9 months and I'm super happy. I'm seeing a couple of different people I like, I'm having great sex, I rearranged my apartment and I fucking love it, and no one but me leaves their goddamned dirty socks on the floor.

There's a lot of value to developing a good life as your own person. I figure, even if I meet the love of my life they could be hit by a bus or something. 

I'm not sure of your age, but one issue I have had is that all of my close friends are married or partnered (I'm 30). For some people, making some new single friends would be the solution to that. I'm pretty happy with the number and quality of my friendships, so I just got really used to reaching out to existing friends on weekends, which is when I struggled with loneliness the most. 

A very good friend gave me the best advice, which was to be intentional about filling the time that had previously been filled by my relationship, so I also picked up some new hobbies and volunteer activities. ",12,t3_24sw5k

The experience is a significant part of what makes me the way I am today (better, I like to think). You, him and your relationship must have had a lot of good in them to have lasted so long but everything and everyone has their faults. You have learned, and you will continue to learn from it, as you think about what happened in the years to come.

Was your judgement off? Or did he change? People do change, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse. At best, you know what people do and say, not what they think and feel, no matter how close you are to them. To an extent, your love is of a fantasy, built around your experience of the other person but also reflecting your understanding, expectations and desires.

When you began to love him, you didn't know he was capable of this. Once established, love doesn't give up easily. Maybe you should have realized it a bit sooner. You say you had suspicions. But relationships require trust, risk and a positive, constructive approach to problems. You did well to give him the benefit of the doubt while there was doubt. Don't be too hard on yourself for not seeing it sooner.

20140505191713,counttess,"I'm going to play a little bit of a devil's advocate here, in hopes that it will help you move on and make you feel better about the situation. It's very easy to get onto the train of thought that he's such a terrible person, but in reality he may have realized that it just wasn't *right*, and it took getting to know someone else that it wasn't.

My ex is an absolutely wonderful person, I think he's fantastic and we were really best of friends. He deserves the absolute best. I felt the need to break up because it just wasn't right. He wasn't someone I wanted to make my life decisions with. His values were different enough from mine that it took a toll on our relationship. The differences would seem minor to many, but they were cause of anxiety and sadness for me at times. I didn't want to live the rest of my life with him as my *partner*. Friend? Yes.

My current boyfriend and I started dating not very long afterwards, and to many, it would seem like way too soon. I totally understand that. We've known each other longer than I had even known my ex, but it took us hanging out again to realize that there was someone out there that *did* carry my same values and would potentially be someone who I would want to make my life decisions with. That realization was the breaking point for me with my ex.

So in this scenario, I'm your ex. I didn't cheat, but I was emotionally spent by the end of our relationship. I didn't want to hurt my ex, I respected and loved our relationship, and tried my hardest to assure him that I did *not* regret or did I want to ""throw it away.""

Your ex is capable of love, and he did love you. I loved my ex very much. He probably still cares for you, but there's a huge difference between wanting to be someone's partner and being someone's friend. 

Did your ex handle it well at the end? No. It's hard to end a relationship, regardless of how long it was or what your current feelings are. He shouldn't have texted the girl in that way. 

At the same time - don't throw away those 7 years yourself by feeling the need to be vindicated. Appreciate the love and compassion you had for each other when it was good, cry over the bad, and be happy with yourself. Realize that there's someone (probably many) people out there who will make you happy and carry your same values, and someone who will be your *partner*. ",23,t3_24sw5k

In my case, she just stopped loving me. Went from being the sweetest, best girlfriend to just straight up not wanting anything to do with me. Asking her why and what happened didn't help. It made no sense to me. I panicked. I lost sleep. I didn't understand how this could possibly happen. We were engaged. We were 3 months away from being married. And within hours, all of that is gone. How? Why? I was profoundly hurt. She wanted me no more. Not for sex, love, dating, nothing. I tried desperately to win her back to no avail. Soon, my feelings of hurt and rejection turned to rage. If she's going to do this to me, then fuck her. The day after she moved out, I picked her up unannounced, drove to the bank, split our finances, and I ended it. I cut off all contact and haven't spoken to her since. I may talk to her again someday. My feelings for her are now more anger than anything. If she begged me to take her back, I wouldn't do it.

OP, I am so profoundly sorry your relationship ended like this. Truth be told, I don't know what happened with mine. I know you feel the same way about yours. How could someone do this to you? Without seemingly a care in the world? After you've known them and their personality for so long, how could they be so cold and so ruthless to you? I wish I had the answer. I can think of few types of pain worse than this. I truly hope you are able to move on from this. There *are* men who are honest and wouldn't do this to you.

We lived together and were planning a life together when I found out he had been cheating on me the whole time. To make matters worse, I found out that he was bi-sexual, cheating with both guys and girlsl (Not that there's anything wrong with bi-sexuality!). The fact that I had NO IDEA he was interested in guys as well as girls threw me for such a loop. I'm short, athletic and had a very short haircut at that time. After we broke up I was plagued by the question of whether or not he was only interested in me because I looked like a boy. I felt so horribly unattractive and ... neutered. I thought of all the times I had felt sexy in the past and felt like such a fool for believing that anyone found me desirable. I was seriously messed up.

The good part about this story is that I got over it. Seriously. It took a few years, a few good friends, a LOT of wine and finding a very patient new guy to help me get my groove back. You can get over this too. It won't be fast and it won't be easy, but you'll come out the other side.

Well one day he gets an iPhone and wants my help to set it up. I had a feeling something was going on so I read his texts and found some going back months that said he loved her and called her the same pet names he called me. Just bad shit. So we broke up and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want him back at first. You incorporate someone into your life for years and then in a very quick snap its all different.  

Stuff like that can really throw you for a loop and make you question your judgement, but you aren't wrong in what you did. You trusted your partner like every relationship should have. You should always be able to trust the person you're with. I think the best way to look at it is to see this as him doing you a favor by getting caught. You aren't wasting your time anymore.

So, since this says Republicans favor a limited central government, Republicans should be against the federal government limiting abortion rights, should be against federal laws against marijuana, and should be in favor of using our military to defend our country rather than invading other countries.

I had better not hear you ever say that the Republicans believe anything different than that.

And according to the oxford dictionary, the [mens rights movement doesn't even exist](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/spellcheck/american_english/?q=men%27s+rights+movement) so I had better not hear any complaining about that either.

>What's your position here? That in recent times the conventional meaning of ""feminism"" has changed from the conventional meaning of feminism that it has had throughout the bulk of its history? If so what meaning has ""feminism"" changed from, if not something like the one from the oxford dictionary?

Feminism used to be about ending the differences in rights (achieving equality) between the sexes. This is laudable and is a subset of egalitarianism. Feminism has become about achieving greater rights and privileges both from a legal stand point and from a cultural standpoint.

>Or in pointing to loud voices are you claiming that the loud voices represent a meaning of feminism that is different from the current contemporary conventional meaning? If so, what's the current contemporary conventional meaning that is different from that represented by the loud voices?

Loud voices carry the meaning of any movement or group unless met with denouncement. This is in the same way Rush Limbaugh and Todd Akin affect the perception of Conservatism and the Republican party (and also the reason I left the Republican party).

Here are some loud voices. As a man, how can I associate with a group who has mainstream personalities and leaders who say these things?

 that 'man-hating' is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.

20140506100944,johnbentley,"Firstly, the example of the republic definition demonstrates well that the success of a definition getting ""the essence of a political ideology"". To get to the essence of something necessarily leaves out the *detail* of the ideology which may or may not be essential to it.

Whatever you want me to say some Republicans are for abortion, most are against. There is certainly dispute among republicans about the extent to which government should be limited.

Secondly I find your complaint against the provision of a short definition odd given that's exactly what you did
> Feminism is about the advancement of women. If it were about fairness, it would be about achieving equal rights for everyone, regardless of gender.

The definition of ""feminism"" you provided was as similarly terse as that which I provided, so if there is some problem with the provision of terse definitions it applies just as much to yours. The chief difference between the two, was that mine was sourced.

> Feminism used to be about ending the differences in rights (achieving equality) between the sexes. 

Right, so you do acknowledge this understanding that was different to the one you initially provided.

> This is laudable and is a subset of egalitarianism.

Conceptually, yes, but you do also accept that feminism was the first movement to care about gender equality?

> Loud voices carry the meaning of any movement or group unless met with denouncement. 

Loud voices carry the meaning of a movement in the mind of those that wrongly generalise from those minority loud voices to the whole movement.

>  As a man, how can I associate with a group who has mainstream personalities and leaders who say these things?

Do three things:

One, don't generalise from the loud voices to the whole group.

Two, denounce views from those that identify as feminists that say sexist or male deprecating things as not being feminists.

Three, don't blindly accept what is evidently a lazy list of quotes generally taken out of context, misquoted, or entirely fabricated that do not represent the author's intent. Instead, attribute the quote to a source that we can, at least in principle, verify for ourselves.

Several of your quotes are debunked at [Unchecked feminist quotes: a list for MRAs, feminists, and anyone who likes factual accuracy](http://franklyno.tumblr.com/post/66730593551/unchecked-feminist-quotes-a-list-for-mras-feminists).

David Angier

It's not the brevity of the definition you provided that I complained about. The definition you provided was simply lacking important details, just as the definition of the republican party was lacking important details. An omission in a definition does not mean what is omitted is not true.

>Right, so you do acknowledge this understanding that was different to the one you initially provided.

It *was* different. In the past. Tense is important. 

> Feminism ***IS*** about the advancement of women.

vs

> Feminism ***USED TO BE*** about ending the differences in rights (achieving equality) between the sexes.

See the difference?

>Conceptually, yes, but you do also accept that feminism was the first movement to care about gender equality?

I do accept it, but I don't see its relevance.

Do you accept that things change? It is not uncommon for any organization of people to stray from their original intent when they become mainstream or achieve some sort of power, be it political or otherwise. That is what I am saying has happened here.

>Loud voices carry the meaning of a movement in the mind of those that wrongly generalise from those minority loud voices to the whole movement.

Are you British?

So, you think it's wrong to generalize conservatives based on what Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Todd Akin, and Sarah Palin have said?

>One, don't generalise from the loud voices to the whole group.

How can I not?

>Two, denounce views from those that identify as feminists that say sexist or male deprecating things as not being feminists.

And when I do that, I get downvoted into oblivion among feminists. Feminists, as with most groups, generally push away anything they think they might disagree with.

>Three, don't blindly accept what is evidently a lazy list of quotes generally taken out of context, misquoted, or entirely fabricated that do not represent the author's intent. Instead, attribute the quote to a source that we can, at least in principle, verify for ourselves.

The two works of fiction you mentioned are actual books with those quotes. How can feminism in one hand denounce violence against women in books, tv, and movies as perpetuating rape culture and in the other hand write things against men and say ""it's just fiction""?

Also, the clarification of the David Angier quote doesn't make it any better. If someone files a false report, that is a crime. Period. If that report removes someone else's freedom even for a short time, that is an egregious crime against that person. Using the possibility that people might not report legitimate crimes because false reports are prosecuted is offensive at the very least and is tantamount to a criminal act in and of itself.",0,t3_24rx3t

Feminism today is severely tarnished as an anti-male movement due to several loud people who hate and have been given a platform to speak from.

It is certainly possible for a movement to be a subset of a larger ideal without violating the larger ideal. The LGBT movement is a great example of this. Collectively as a movement they have made great strides to end discrimination against them. They have made laws treat them equally and they are successfully pursuing social change that will have them be more accepted, though they certainly do have a long road ahead of them. For the record, my voting record has been in support of them. Though I haven't had many opportunities, when the time came I did vote in favor or legalizing homosexual marriage. I think, though, there can be danger in identifying primarily as one of these subsets. It becomes your team, or your tribe, and begin to associate more with it than the larger goal. I believe feminism is just such a subset that has exceeded the envelope of egalitarianism. Here are just a few examples of what feminists with a large audience have to say:

Robin Morgan

> I feel that 'man-hating' is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.

 - This has ""man-hating"" in quotes because she is quoting people that call feminism ""man-hating"". She isn't saying she is a man-hater, she is highlighting the ridiculousness of calling feminism man-hating. 

Robin Morgan

> I claim that rape exists any time sexual intercourse occurs when it has not been initiated by the woman, out of her own genuine affection and desire.

 - She is saying women should enthusiastically consent to sex. This is clearer in the context of the chapter it appears in.

Valerie Solanas 

> To call a man an animal is to flatter him; he's a machine, a walking dildo.

 - The SCUM Manifesto is satire. Solanas herself called it a ""literary device"". Did Jonathan Swift really think the Irish should eat babies? No.

Jilly Cooper

> The male is a domestic animal which, if treated with firmness...can be trained to do most things.

 - I cannot fathom why this is attributed to SCUM. Jilly Cooper has nothing to do with Valerie Solanas. Cooper writes romance novels. On the SAME PAGE this quote comes from (Men and Super Men, 1972) Cooper defends men from the ""Women's Lib"" movement which she calls a *storm in a B-Cup, and the biggest bore of the century, only rivalled by the Common Market*

Andrea Dworkin 

> I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig.

 - From a work of fiction (Mercy), not a feminist academic work. 

Andrea Dworkin 

> Q: People think you are very hostile to men. A: I am.

 - From the same interview: *Q: Are there men you admire? A: Yes.* Cherry picking.

Ti-Grace Atkinson 

> The institution of sexual intercourse is anti-feminist.

 - I don't know anything about this one apart from it was written in 1974.

Catherine MacKinnon 

> All sex, even consensual sex between a married couple, is an act of violence perpetrated against a woman.

 - This comes from a Playboy magazine in 1986 and is fabricated. MacKinnon herself says she never said it. Why someone would bother I don't understand because her views aren't a million miles away from it.

Sharon Stone

> The more famous and powerful I get the more power I have to hurt men.

 - There is no source for this. And Sharon Stone has never been a feminist leader or spokesperson and has never said she was. Why would this be in a list of quotes from famous feminist leaders?

David Angier 

> If anyone is prosecuted for filing a false report, then victims of real attacks will be less likely to report them.

 - This man isn't a feminist activist, he's a Massachusetts assistant district attorney. Also, he's talking about a specific case, this is not a general statement.

Marilyn French

Elizabeth Cady Stanton

Ireen von Wachenfeldt

 - Wachenfeldt says this quote was taken entirely out of context. She says: *Time after time Rubar asked: It says in your magazine that men are animals. Is that what ROKS thinks? Time after time I replied: No, we don't think so. But if you've been the victim of repeated sexual assaults by men, I can understand why you might think that. Rubar chose not to include these answers in her programme.*

Only one of these quotes is from the past 25 years. One! And nearly all of them are twisted out of context. There is plenty to criticise about the modern feminist movement, but first you have to understand the modern feminist movement.

You mentioned a few are from fiction. Why does that matter? Isn't the feminist argument that the pervasiveness of rape in fiction (movies and tv) perpetuates 'rape culture'? Why then does its counterpart in feminist fiction not promote hatred towards men?

You say David Angier isn't a feminist activist. So? Are you saying he's not a feminist at all? Are you saying that as an ADA he has no power regarding the issue he discusses? If his feminist view in this regard guides him as a prosecutor how is that not dangerous?

Are you saying Sharon Stone is not a feminist? Because, if you don't deny she's a feminist, then her celebrity makes her words have value.  If you're saying she isn't a feminist, then why? I haven't been able to find a refutation of this quote.

Regarding Andrea Dworkin's interview, your refutation doesn't make the point you want. It is possible to be prejudice against a group based on sex, but still respect some of them.

Without feminism, women wouldn't be able to practice medicine, law, public office, or hold patents.   And because you deliberately only decided to quote the most radical feminists you could possibly find, feminism isn't good enough? 

Feminism focuses on women's rights. Just like the LGBT movement focuses on gay rights, but I don't see you complaining about them only focusing on LGBT  instead of straight people. I don't see you complaining that the NAACP doesn't focus on other minorities. Men have a pretty long history of denying women basic human rights, but we're the jerks for focusing on improving women's lives instead of men's?

The movement has discredited itself.

Feminism focuses on women's rights, yes. But it doesn't focus on equal rights for women. It focuses on increasing rights for women, often at the expense of others.

It's feminism that says women never make false rape reports, and if they do we shouldn't punish women for ruining a man's life. 

It's feminism that focuses society's efforts towards helping homeless women more than men even though women only account for 1/6 of the homeless population. 

It's feminism that mocks men who have been abused by women and speak up about it -- just look for a shelter for men who have been abused. 

It's feminism that says a woman can end her pregnancy if she didn't mean to get pregnant, but a man has no choice in paying child support.

For a much better summary of this ridiculous chain of actions taken by ""mens right's activists"" [please read this](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/01/02/mens-rights-activists-call-for-rape-accuse-a-thon-to-smear-sex-assault-victims-advocate/). In short, these actions show that MRA aren't really helping men, just attacking feminists. And going about it in a way that, well... makes it even harder for me to take them seriously.

As one writer so eloquently sums up her (and also, my own) opinion of the MRA group: [""this is not a legitimate political or social movement; it is a hate group.""](http://jezebel.com/no-i-will-not-take-the-mens-rights-movement-seriously-1532799085) 

Finally, please see [the part of this article titled ""A List of ""Men's Rights"" Issues That Feminism Is Already Working On""](http://jezebel.com/5992479/if-i-admit-that-hating-men-is-a-thing-will-you-stop-turning-it-into-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy). It's a very nice summary of how feminism does support men's rights. Because, as I said before and will say again, it's the same forces at work that hurt both. Feminists realize this (now, some will argue that women have historically had it harder, and still do, but that doesn't mean they are illegitimate claims. Sexism hurts everyone, men or women and all those ""in between."")",17,t3_24rx3t

For quick background, I've been really into 'geek' things (video games, anime and manga) since an early teen, but I took a break from video games for the past three years due to the demands of university. Since I'm close to graduating, I'm starting to pay a bit more attention to the scene again.

And when it comes to women, the contrast between when I left and getting back in is startling. Except I can't tell whether it's because I've grown up, the community has grown down, or a bit of both. I mean I held some internalised misogyny as a teen which I've since grown out of, and yeah even back then there was a guy's locker room atmosphere, but if anyone just coughs the words feminism or females or SJW in a video game forum now, good grief the things people feel compelled to write. You can just tell it's all being written by boys. Not men, boys. Under 18.  In most video game discussions you can't tell the ages of the people present, but as soon as women come up their immaturity is exposed. I start to avoid these discussions entirely now only because I like to maintain the illusion that I'm a 22 year old woman trying to have engaging discussions with other adults, not people I would be babysitting in real life.

I encourage you to be honest with the adults in your life at least about your struggles with self-esteem and depression, because I'm 10 years older than you and I still rely heavily on my grandma and, until last year, my great-grandma. You're still a kid, and honestly I'm not convinced anyone is really ""self-sufficient"" at any age. If you're going through some shit, that's ok, everyone has been there and many of us have been through therapy. That certainly doesn't mean you can't consent to sex. But I'd encourage you and anyone else, male or female, sexually active or not, to consider why they do what they do and if their motivations are actually healthy. I know you feel mature at 13; everyone does. I felt mature at 18 and 21, too. But even in the span of just 2 years, I've had enough life experiences to make me rethink my previous decisions and wonder why the fuck I ever agreed to some of them. 

I suspect that much of the disapproval you've met with is rooted in concern about your over all well being rather than in a creepy patriarchal purity culture. You're incredibly articulate and you seem pretty introspective, but like most 13-year-olds, you're missing some of the dots you should be connecting and even strangers who don't care about your ""purity"" are concerned about how safe you're being. People who have sex at a very young age often have riskier sex and have many other issues going on at the same time.

Also, if you liked The Unbearable Lightness of Being but it was a little too nebulous, try A Tree Grows in Brooklyn which is much more focused-ish but with a similar tone. I would also recommend If On a Winter's Night a Traveler by Italo Calvino. Actually I just love his books, but that one describes my reading experience so well that I absolutely fell in love with it immediately. He wrote some fantastic books with some very out-there premises, and if you like Kundera (I can't spell) you'll like Calvino.",5,t3_24s18p

It wouldn't even matter if that was part of the reasoning of your sexual assaulter, because it's still sexual assault and no matter what else is going on in your life, you never deserve it or cause it to happen to you. That's victim blaming bullshit and I would never say that.

All I'm saying is that often when anyone is having sex this young, it's partially *because* they were sexually abused in the past or because they have self-esteem issues or mental illness like depression or bipolar disorder. Those later ones are a pretty good bet since you've posted before about self-harm. Being sexually active at 13 isn't an issue alone, but it's not uncommon for it to be a symptom of actual problems. It's also associated with riskier behavior in general, promiscuity at a young age, riskier sexual behavior, self harm, problems with grades and substance abuse, and so on. 

Because we don't know you, it's an odds game and we just want to tell you to be careful and to think through your decisions. Everyone thinks they're mature and responsible and they know what they're doing when they're 13. At 13, you feel almost invincible and you feel like you know everything you need to know. At around 20, you realize that you know nothing about anything, and from what I can tell, that feeling lasts basically the rest of your life.

Of course you don't have to reconsider your sexual choices because they are your choices, but something many people realize as they get older is that what they thought was a reasonable, mature choice at the time was made for all the wrong reasons and those are usually the decisions that people regret. Your experience may be different, but always being sure you know your own motivations can be a really good way to avoid doing things you'll regret later, sexually or otherwise. 13 isn't too young to have sex, but it's young enough that people will be concerned about your still-developing critical thinking abilities and emotional intelligence and how that might affect your ability to really make the right decision for you.",3,t3_24s18p

>The implications of the research on undetected rapists – research that has  largely focused on men in college environments – point to the similarity of these offenders to incarcerated rapists. They share the same motivational matrix of hostility, anger, dominance, hyper-masculinity, impulsiveness and antisocial attitudes. They have many of the same developmental antecedents. They tend to be serial offenders, and most of them commit a variety of different interpersonal offenses. They are accurately and appropriately labeled as predators. 

>This picture conflicts sharply with the widely-held view that rapes committed on university campuses are typically the result of a basically “decent” young man who, were it not for too much alcohol and too little communication, would never do such a thing. While some campus rapes do fit this more benign view, the evidence points to a far less benign reality, in which the vast majority of rapes are committed by serial, violent predators. 

>This less benign reality has potentially significant implications for how 
universities deal with sexual violence within their community. Prevention efforts geared toward persuading men not to rape are very unlikely to be effective. Lessons can be drawn from many decades of experience in sex offender treatment, which have demonstrated that it is extremely difficult to change the behavior of a serial predator even when you incarcerate him and subject him to an intensive, multi-year program. Rather than focusing prevention efforts on the rapists, it would seem far more effective to focus those efforts on the far more numerous bystanders – men and women who are part of the social and cultural milieu in which rapes are spawned and who can be mobilized to identify perpetrators and intervene in high-risk situations.

What about psychological coercion that stops short of threats?  What about someone who's drunk, but not in a complete stupor?  What about someone who freezes up and never tries to resist?  No force or threats would be necessary in that situation, so it wouldn't be considered rape under the study.

The study seems to have shown that the most violent and clear-cut rapes were the result of deliberate and serial predators, which is hardly surprising.  The issue is that less forcible forms of rape were not accounted for at all, and we have no idea who's perpetrating those forms of rape or why.  So it's a bit premature to say ""It's all just predators.""

EDIT: To be fair to Lisak, he seems to have tailored his questions to identify rapes that would be clearly in violation of the law.  Many US States do require force or threat of force in order for sex to be considered rape.  ""Coercion"" is a good deal more slippery and generally isn't illegal unless it contains unlawful threats of some kind.

For different reasons I've had to stray away from some friends over the past few years and like you, I'm in my mid/late 20's. It gets more difficult as you get older because people become set in their social circles. My way of combating this is stepping outside of my comfort zone. I joined a community garden in my neighborhood, looked into a bicycling group, and have done some fashion shows for an acquaintance that is turning into a friend. I've met a lot of new people because of it. Basically, I threw myself into activities that **I** enjoy, and found like minded people through those activities. 

I think perhaps you may be able to salvage some of the relationships from this group. If you've got one or two people that you feel a real connection with, ask them to hang out one on one. Explain that you aren't judging them for their actions, but it's just not your scene any more and that you want to maintain a friendship with them.

That being said, I have noticed that polyamory and the genital obsession is SO POPULAR at my school. I'd say 75% of the art is focused on the idea of genitals, pornography, or polyamorous relationships. I think it's one of those counter culture things that has just gotten really really trendy and popular. I don't want to belittle that lifestyle, as it's totally valid and acceptable and I don't hold any judgement to it, but I do think that it's similar to every other trendy phase (stoner, goth, emo, punk, anime, hippie, raver, etc). Young people are going to explore and try to find out about themselves, most move on, and some find happiness within the lifestyle. Your friends are simply exploring a new culture, and they may or may not stick with it. 

I'd continue to maintain some level of friendship with them if you want, because I'm sure this is something that will go as quickly as it came. I've had acquaintances that were the same way, and they grew out of it for the most part.

20140506064053,SENKl,"Ugh.  I had some friends who went through this.  It was particularly alienating since I have a pain disorder that makes sex, well, painful.  Therefore, their exploits weren't exactly relevant to me.

Anyway, all they ever wanted to talk about were their hook-ups, and kinks, and polyamory, and how they needed to fuck and blow off steam, etc.  They also happened to be around the same age at the time (mid-twenties).  I think a lot of it has to do with forging an identity and the need to assert that identity.  It could just be me, (and nothing against the polyamorist/pansexual community), but I find that this expression of overt sexuality and need to communicate about it incessantly is more intense in these communities.  It could be that they feel ostracized for their lifestyle choices and feel a need to speak up for it, or because it's this ""new cool thing"" that makes them feel special.  I don't know what it is, but I agree that the phase you are describing is pretty obnoxious.

Luckily, my friends are still poly or in the kink community, but they have calmed down and don't discuss it anymore.  I think they've become more comfortable with who they are and don't feel a need to constantly state their sexuality and justify themselves.  I also think they've come to recognize their sexuality as just a part of themselves and their lives, and it's really just not as significant to them as it once was.  Hopefully, this will happen for your friends and they'll just let go of the constant advertising.

In the meantime, I would probably just keep a bit of distance, or just act really disinterested and bored when they bring up these topics.  You have already expressed that you don't want to just talk about sex all the time, so you could keep reiterating that as well if you really still want to hang out with them.

I just felt like I didn't know who I was anymore. I left the job, got deeply involved with some internet friends (I didn't go out and stay out until 2am, I compulsively played an MMO with a group of 'friends' until 4+am every day).  I had crazy dreams/plans to leave the country and start over.  I didn't give a flying fuck about everything I'd worked for until then.

Eventually, it got really out of hand and I was having hallucinations and full on psychosis.  I finally did seek treatment but it was only after I couldn't keep a grasp on what was real anymore.  I know now, in retrospect, that I lost a good 5 years of my life to true chaos.

Personally, I have *years* of being stable, if somewhat pessimistic, then intense depression sets in and I know that a manic episode is not far away and I'll want to change EVERYTHING about my life.   
  
But if it was me in his position, I'd probably feel very empowered and enlightened, getting the courage to change my job, follow my dreams, ""find myself"" etc. And if my S.O. told me that all these changes (that I think are positive and self-affirming) could be just a bipolar episode, I'd get pissed. I would feel like my S.O. was belittling all these great new things that I was trying to do, or maybe that my S.O. liked me more when I was unhappy (which would make me think that my S.O. might be holding me back / weighing me down).   
  
Like I said, that's how *I* would most likely react, but my mental health is a very touchy subject for me. I would try to judge how he might react and pick your strategy accordingly. Did he stop his medication because he thought he was healthy enough to handle the disorder on his own? Personally, I've stopped several different meds in a fit of rage (it's *my* brain, I should be able to control it, etc).  
  
If he just quit the meds because he thought he was ""better"" then he might be more open to talking about it. Either way, I'd be very supportive and non-confrontational.  
  
It sounds like you've played kind of a passive, supportive role while he's making all these changes, but you may need to assert yourself and tell him how important your relationship is and that, while you agree with some of what he has said (ie. both of you growing as individuals), you are committed to keeping the relationship stable and strong.   
  
If he would be open to some kind of couples counseling, I think that would help a lot, or if he's not ok with that (in my experience, the idea of counseling/therapy was horrifying and embarrassing before I started to go regularly) then maybe just have a sit down with him and just talk it out.   
  
No matter what, I think it's important to stay calm and be honest about the way this is making you feel. It's possible that he's right about some things. There's nothing wrong with getting married young, or living together right away, or having a quick engagement. But sometimes people haven't really discovered their individual preferences when they've spent the majority of their young adult years as a member of a couple. It sounds to me like he might be in that stage of ""discovering himself"" while you are are happy with remaining ""part of the whole"" - neither of these are *wrong*, they're just different, and it's important that you both understand how you see the situation and how it makes you feel.

20140505224806,KittyL0ver,"It's worth pointing out that antidepressants are used for treating conditions beyond depression.  For instance, tricyclic antidepressants are commonly prescribed for the treatment of chronic pain.  I'm sure the OkCupid question was really trying to ask if you'd date someone with depression.  Regardless of it's intention, those responses in the article were eye opening to me.

I was depressed for most of the time I was in high school and college.  I did seek help and was in a good place mentally by the time I graduated college.  Unfortunately, I developed chronic pain in my early twenties that has only worsened as time goes by.  The difference in how both family members and friends treat me is staggering.  I can remember people talking behind my back, calling me crazy when they thought I was out of earshot.  I was treated like a child.  I was full of ""drama"".  I had ""no good reason to cry"".  I needed to ""get over it"".  

There are some similarities between the two conditions, but the reactions for some people are night and day.  If I didn't want to go out when I was depressed, it was completely my fault.  Friends would get mad.  If I can't go out now because I'm in too much pain, everyone seems understanding.  No one lays a guilt trip on me now for taking medication, but when I was taking SSRIs to depression, I was constantly told that I needed to get off of them.  At one point I can remember a group discussion about suicide.  The general consensus was that anyone who took their own life was selfish.  When I pointed out that some people do so because they're in pain or have a terminal disease, everyone agreed that under those circumstances, it was okay.  I didn't want to start an argument, but for me depression was much more painful than the daily physical pain I now have.  In both cases you're fighting against your body, but in the case of physical pain, it will pass, and you can get on with life, if only for a short while.  There was no escape from depression.  It was all encompassing.  

I look back now, and I don't even know how I did it.  Depression is a place I don't want to ever revisit.  My most painful moments now can be treated with opiates if need be.  With depression there was no reprieve.  ",10,t3_24sthd

20140505162835,undercurrents,"It's more than dating someone on anti-depressants. it is accepting the person as someone who happens to deal with depression and is more than their diagnosis. And often, speaking from personal experience, that is not easy to do and the diagnosis defines me. For me, I've been medicated continuously for more than 20 years, and I am considered treatment resistant with double depression. Meaning, although meds keep me alive, I've never fully responded to them; and double depression means I go from major depressive crashes into dysthymia so I never actually come out of my depression. I did fully come out of it once, and it was at that point I realized just how much of life I have lost to depression. You'd never know it from meeting me because my actual resume seems fairly impressive- I've traveled and lived around the world, done many things on people's bucket lists, and I'm talkative and outgoing. But all during that time, even while jumping out of a plane from 14,000 ft, I've felt dead and emotionless inside. Music seems like white noise, food has no tastes, flowers have no color, and the world is like a punishment I'm forced to face every day rather than to be a part of it and really feel alive, feel human.

I'm so afraid for my future because behind closed doors, when I'm tired and don't have the energy to keep up the ""normal"" persona, I sleep a lot, am unable to work a full time job nor one for which I am technically qualified by my education (I have lots of cognitive impairments from the depression), and because my depression is endogenous and genetic the crashes often come hard and out of nowhere so they are unpredictable and devastating. I am not mean nor negative, I simply struggle to care for myself and each day is full of so much suffering and tears. I've been hospitalized several times, though I've never actually attempted to take my own life- oftentimes something I see as a fault that I am unable to hurt myself. 

I feel defective in many ways- the depression affects me socially, emotionally, cognitively, physically, and sexually. I have no idea how I would be able to care for children when I go through unanticipated long crashes where I am unable to care for myself even. I'd like to think we are judged not by the cards we've been dealt, but by how we play them- and in that case, I know I'm strong because I fight every day and am willing to do anything out there to try to help myself. Recently I switched to a brand new medication (I try every new one that comes out, and I'm on a cocktail of 3-5 at a time), and my body reacted badly so I have spent the last 5 weeks horribly nauseated and throwing up (the med has a long half life, and apparently my metabolism is nonexistent). I am waiting to start ECT in about two months, and have been on the waiting list for a DBS brain implant. And I've signed up for every trial under the sun, but I am often rejected given the length and severity of my depression. Like I said, I'm willing to do anything to help myself, but unfortunately not much has been able to help me. 

And ultimately, this leaves me pretty undesirable as a partner. OkCupid actually has this question on their site, ""Would you date someone on anti-depressants?"" and the overwhelming responses are no. And I crash as one would crash from diabetes, and I take medication as one with diabetes would require insulin, but according to most men I've encountered, that makes me ""full of drama."" Not to mention, I cannot work full time and I have a ""job,"", not a ""career,"" and am still financially dependent on my parents at 33 (I work as much as I can even though I qualify for disability), so that makes me even more undesirable. The first question every one asks on a date is ""What do you do for a living."" I am a nanny, but the full honest answer is, ""I am a nanny, and although I love my job, I am highly educated but am unable to hold down a job that meets my level of education because of the many problems caused by depression such as memory loss, fatigue, and brain fog. I also am only able to work part time because I am too sick, I don't make enough money to support myself and so I am financially dependent on my parents and if we would continue this relationship to the next level, my financial burden would be passed on to you. Plus I don't know if I can have kids because I often end up in states where I am too sick to even take care of myself. Oh, and I sleep a lot."" Sounds appealing, huh?

If anyone is interested, I made a post a while back on here about depression- [What Do You Know About Depression](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/paeil/what_do_you_know_about_depression/), and I made two more posts filled with resources on r/depression, but they were randomly removed months later so I have to remake those sometime.

20140505174815,undercurrents,"Oh, sorry, I didn't realize there was an article attached to your title.

On some level, I like having that question on there so I can prescreen for prejudice. Some who just answered, ""no,"" I found out upon questioning that they hadn't really thought about the question and when given more information, would actually change their answer. Where the hurt lies is in those who give explanations of why they wouldn't. Drama is the main one I see, but that just pisses me off because you wouldn't call a non-mental health illness ""drama."" In general, I'm level-headed and rational, don't argue, am not negative, don't complain, and don't have mood swings. I'd also never doing anything crazy- well, what I consider crazy when I see other relationships and the vindictive things they do to each other. But apparently having a mental illness that I cannot control, according to many answers, makes me ""batshit crazy."" 

The article mentions a brain tumor, and I actually have a tumor in my head. Just for kicks, I posted on facebook when I was about to go into radiation (never mentioned it before), and my timeline filled up with messages from people I haven't heard from in more than 15 years (other than the friend request). So the next day, knowing that I would now show up in the newsfeed for all those who wrote on my wall, I posted this meme http://imgur.com/47b15u2 and not a single person liked or commented. I started opening up about my depression to those who seemed really concerned about my tumor, and I tell them the depression is actually a bigger deal and has taken a bigger toll on my life, and they never hesitate to tell me I'm wrong in what I feel causes greater suffering in my life. 

But what I found even more devastating is how people I grew up with view two friends we lost. Four kids in my grade (elementary through high school) have died. One died in a motorcycle accident, one of a heart attack. I see them brought up on facebook posts all the time of how much we miss them. But the for the other two it's different. One committed suicide and somehow his entire life remembered has been replaced by those final moments. The other's death was undetermined- she was found floating in Lake Michigan. At some point the police and the media found out she was bipolar and she was suddenly labeled a possible suicide even though no signs pointed to that- she had her hair done earlier that day, she was responsive to medications and in a good place, and she had her purse with her the night she died (was stolen and found later). People don't generally bring their purses and get their hair done right before committing suicide. Yet now, whenever she is brought up, the first response is something like, ""all those years and I never knew she was bipolar."" WTF? What does that have to do with anything? She was our friend and a person, but now she has become simply diagnosis. Even though her death is still officially undetermined, the police stopped investigating and the media stopped reporting when they learned she was bipolar. 

And this is what really scares the shit out of me. I've been fighting my ass off my whole life. I am strong, I've done plenty with my life, I'm a good friend (as long as I never talk about my own problems and only listen to theirs), and generally people like me. Yet, if I one day lose my battle with depression and I die, I'm afraid all that will be lost and I will be reduced to simply my depression and suicide. As a person I won't be remembered, only my diagnosis. People can do nothing to help themselves when diagnosed with cancer- yet til the end they will be seen as grand. If they live, they are survivors, if they die, they fought bravely and stayed strong to the end. I have fought every day for my life and yet I am see as mentally ill.

There are really only three things to think about:

* Do your non-penetrative FwB activities work well for you? Is he a generous and giving lover? (And are you likewise in return?) If so, go for it, if not it might be worth looking for someone is, or making the effort to be more generous yourself, because it should be a team effort, not a service relationship.

* Do you really want to have sex with *him* or do you just want to have sex? I mean, no problem if it's just the sex, but, personally, I've always found that when it's a targeted desire, it's mindblowing, while general horniness tends to just be scratching an itch - it's still great, but it's greatness that can be achieved alone as well as with another.

* Make sure you both know where you stand in advance of taking this step. Sex has some pretty strong bonding effects, and if one of you falls in love, it could lead to some serious heartache. If you're clear from the start that it's just casual, it'll still cause heartache if one of you falls, but nobody can say they weren't warned, and nobody can (reasonably) take offence if it's unrequited.

Every single time you have sex has the potential to be amazing, intimate, and life changing. Or it can just be sex. There is NOTHING inherently special or different about your first time.

Shailene Woodley is a 22-year-old who does seem like a smart young woman.  But take into account that she has a high school education and has probably never taken any gender studies classes.

She says everyone is 50% feminine and 50% masculine.

I suspect that part of the problem (as has been pointed out before) is that the term ""feminism"" sounds like it means ""pro-female"", which one could potentially infer as therefore meaning ""anti-male"" as well.  Men and women alike who misunderstand the term can then say, ""I'm not a feminist, because both men AND women are great.  Feminists shouldn't blame men for all the problems in the world!""

20140508003552,ardenriddle,"So you're basically saying that ""feminism"" has a branding problem. I agree.  It has a similar problem to, say, Islam.  There are liberal Muslims, moderate Muslims, casual Muslims, and radical Muslims.  The moderate Muslims can say that the radical ones aren't ""true Muslims,"" but the radical ones can turn right around and say that the casual/liberal/moderate Muslims aren't true Muslims and are giving Islam a bad name. That's because things like this really are open to interpretation. Feminism can be even more confusing because there's not one central, definitive text that describes all that it means, in easily digestible bite-sized bits of 150 characters or less.

There is no such thing as a true feminist--there are a lot of different ideas that live under the umbrella of feminist thought, and there is no central governing authority that decides who is allowed to identify as a feminist. There is no excommunication procedure.

You refer to feminism as a movement. It's kind of a movement, but not really. Feminism is about promoting equality and getting people to discuss gender issues.  But if you decide to read that link I posted, you'll see how varied feminist thought really is.  Some even argue that feminism shouldn't even be thought of as a movement, because it reduces the term to describing the 20th century women's rights movements, when in fact ""feminism"" (pushes for gender equality) have existed in different forms in different places throughout human history. Feminism is more of an ongoing discussion of gender issues than it is a unified movement.

Nowadays, being feminist usually means supporting reproductive rights, engaging in discussion of rape and sexual assault (a very difficult area, often shaded with gray). For some, it means supporting the sex positivity movement. For others, it's getting men and women alike to see the double standards we as a society hold (for both men and women). A big part of feminism is acknowledging and discussing men's issues, and the problems that arise for men because they're expected to meet society's standards for masculinity, which are perpetuated by both men and women...  Again, it's more if a discussion than a movement.

The fact is, it doesn't matter whether ""tumblr feminists"" are ruining the term or not. If people are saying they aren't feminists because they misunderstand the term, or don't want to be associated with people who are misusing the term, and have no desire to educate themselves subject, and yet still openly support the idea of equality for all, then who cares?  They're supporting equality (including gender equality), at least superficially.

I personally am not going to stop identifying as a feminist just because some (or possibly most) people misunderstand what it means, just like I'm not going to stop identifying as a Redditor just because there are some crazy troll psychos on here.  I love Reddit, and I think it does a lot more more good than bad. Same with feminism. If anyone ever seems shocked or confused by my self-identification as a feminist, I'll tell them that I support equality. I'll tell them that I'm a feminist and so is my husband. We believe gender roles put people into silly boxes, demanding correct behavior.  We're both of the opinion that people should be allowed to be themselves, having both masculine and feminine characteristics.  Everyone should be allowed to feel empowered at times, vulnerable at others.

The Avengers is loosely based on the first Avengers story in which they fight Loki. Captain America 2 is based on the most celebrated Captain America storyline. This is true for a number of these movies. Particularly the most successful ones. It's pretty rare that a successful comic book movie invent a mythology for its character from whole cloth, which is what you would be doing with Wonder Woman. There are a few other characters who are far more deserving of the movie treatment. I think WW is just glommed on to because she's the most recognizable one.

Not a whole lot of folks love Wonder Woman, because she isn't a very well-developed character, doesn't have any good villains, doesn't have any good stories, has a fairly boring mythology, is also morally perfect and very powerful. I just don't see why Wonder Woman in particular deserves a film. There are a few other great female characters who are more deserving. I would make a Black Canary film WAY before a Wonder Woman film. At least she has a personality. Or a Stargirl film. Shit, I would make a Big Barda movie before I made a Wonder Woman movie.    ",3,t3_24u846
20140506160227,1282,">The amount of people who go see superhero movies because they've read the comics is negligible. 

Not my point at all. Like in the slightest bit. 

>Majority of people don't know shit about comic story arcs and established villains, they just know about iconic characters and Wonder Woman is just as iconic as Superman.

No, she isn't. People know what Wonder Woman looks like. That's it. They don't know anything else about her. They don't know who Diana Prince is, they don't know what Themyscira is, they don't know who Dr. Psycho is, etc. **Everyone** knows who Clark Kent, Lois Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are. **Everyone**, even my mother, knows where Superman was born and how he came to Earth. **Everyone** knows ""up, up and away"" and ""it's a bird, it's a plane"". **Everyone** knows who Lex Luthor is. 

However, you're right. They don't need to know anything about these storylines in order for the film to be successful. But having a developed character, that exists in a developed universe, with developed villains and time-tested stories REALLY REALLY helps. The Dark Knight was an absolute classic because it adapted 3 of the best Batman stories ever told into one movie. It used iconic characters and put a unique spin on them. Iron Man was a classic because Tony Stark is a compelling character, with an awesome, heart-tugging (literally) origin story, and cool gadgetry. Captain America 2 worked because it deftly adapted what is probably the best Cap story in the last 2 years to the screen as though it was 3 Days of the Condor. Wonder Woman just doesn't have stuff like this.  

>How much of a fucking problem is it to reboot Wonder Woman with an entertaining story and make a decent movie?

Pretty difficult. If it was easy then Fantastic Four, Jonah Hex, Elektra, Catwoman, Green Lantern, The Spirit, etc. All wouldn't have flopped. If you notice, none of those stories are based on great, enduring superhero stories. The weaker your character is, the harder it is to make a movie with that character, and Wonder Woman is a pretty weak character, with nothing going on in the way of story. 

I just don't get why you guys are so fixated on Wonder Woman of all characters. It just speaks to the fact that you have no idea what you're talking about and you seem to just want to complain about this issue without having any knowledge about how to avoid situations which make female lead superhero movies like Elektra flop HARD.

She's on underwear and pajamas. She had a goofy TV show in the 70's. She's in cartoons sometimes. But in comics Wonder Woman really isn't all that popular, and it's not entirely because she's a woman. It's because she doesn't have any classic storylines, she doesn't have any great villains, she doesn't have a very interesting mythology, and she has kind of a cardboard personality. She gets a (probably more prominent) cameo alongside Cyborg and Aquaman because she's about as popular and relevant to comics storylines as those characters. 

There are plenty of second or even third stringer *female* characters that are FAR more deserving of a film than Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman just gets shoved to the front of the line by non-comic fans because she's was on their bedsheets when they were kids. ",8,t3_24u846

20140506101901,tastemymango,"I understand. When I left my abusive partner and came home to Canada (I had been living with him for three years in Mexico) I intended to just focus on me. Focus on healing. 
I was only 20 when I returned home, I was confused and hurting. I felt like what had happened was my own fault, he always told me it was and that I pushed him. I also felt like no one would love me for me. He always put me down and I guess I had started to believe his words. I also felt like damaged goods, who was going to want to the girl who flinches and covers her face when you go to high five her?
Also, when I finally had the courage to tell my mother what I had been through, she told me it was my own damn fault for staying with him and that I should have known better.
To top it all off, I still felt like I loved him, I felt guilt for leaving him and not trying to be there for him (He was beaten as a child by his father so I felt like he was hurting and I needed to ""save"" him).
Anyways, I focused on me, got two jobs, wrote down my thoughts in a journal and just kept busy. 
At one of my jobs, I made some friends and one of them pointed out that my team leader seemed to stare at me a lot. He was in the middle.of a break up from a 5 year relationship where he had not been happy for a long time. Anyways, long story short, we started to date in October, were engaged by Christmas and married the following July. I wasn't looking for love when I met him, it just happened.
We will celebrate our 10th wedding aniversary this July and we are expecting our third baby in June.
He also have me the space I needed to recover and was patient with me when I would flinch, have nightmares.and wake up crying as well as I apparently screamed in my sleep at times.

My point is that no matter how hard things are right now, know that with time you will look back on today and think ""look how far I have come, look at me now. Whatever I have been through, has in part made me the strong woman I am today"".

Also, you never know what is around the corner. Sometimes life just happens and you find things you were not even looking for.

I have never heard that it was controversial. I know a lot of people got HCV from blood transfusions before we started testing the blood supply, but I learned in clinical microbiology that most people now are getting it from sexual contact or needle sharing. You're right on to get tested, and you might also want to get tested for Hepatitis B which is transmitted the same way and has similar symptoms. Unless you work in healthcare at your age it's unlikely you were vaccinated against it and it can be just as bad or even worse than HCV. The test you would want (your doc should know this too) is called HBsAg.

Also make sure you get really regular pap smears for a while, and you might possibly be asked to be tested for high risk strains of human papilloma virus, which causes most cases of cervical cancer.
",8,t3_24tyqt
20140506114449,leedlebug,"It's not really controversial that Hep C can be transmitted sexually.  However, it is fairly hard to transmit, and isn't included in the standard  STI screen.

My sister lived with undiagnosed Hep C through most of her life (from a tainted blood transfusion as an infant, most likely).  You wouldn't BELIEVE the fuss the clinic kicked up when I asked to be tested (we'd gotten into our share of bloody fights as kids, shared razors as teens, etc); you'd think I was asking to be tested for a third eyeball.  They kept on insisting there was no reason to get tested, as Hep C is basically impossible to pass except through shared needles or risky sexual behaviour.

There's a standard talk you get when you ask for an HIV test (regarding the Canadian HIV registry, etc), but they had 3 different doctors pull me aside and grill me about why I was requesting a HepC test, my sexual behaviour, etc.  

It worries me also because my sister, having discovered that HepC is not classified as an STI, doesn't always disclosed her HCV+ status to sexual partners. She justifies it as ""well, the transmission rate is really low, so it's no big deal"".  But then, in the unlikely case she DOES pass it, her partners won't know to get tested, and they won't find out through a regular screen.

And you got fired? And your boyfriend is blaming you for what happened? WHAT A JERK.

Remember this: You absolutely absolutely not at fault for what any of those two guys did. You told them you were taken. They acted in an intensely creepy way that completely dismissed any of your feelings on the matter. They crossed the line, not you. This is fairly common with men, no matter how uncomfortable you are or how much you assert yourself they will always cross the line because your agency as a woman is not something they respect.

He often accused me of having a ""flirty personality"" and that I sought out attention from men.  If he saw me being too friendly with another man, ANY other man, things could get really bad (yelling, slamming stuff, mean mean words). He would say that he could see what I was thinking, that when I talked to other men he could tell that I wanted them to like me. He felt that men couldn't be blamed for how they reacted to me, it was my fault, I was attracting them on purpose. (When he made me cry, he also accused me of crying on purpose, to make him feel bad).  It got so bad that one day, I was jogging at a park.  I saw a group of guys playing basketball up ahead and I idly wondered if they were cute. I stopped in my tracks, and turned around because my boyfriend had gotten so in my head that I was worried when I got back from my jog he would notice somehow, that I had purposefully run by a group of guys, playing basketball to get their attention.  I ran the other way to avoid those random, basketball playing guys. That was my life with him, avoiding eye contact with any man I came across, being careful not to smile too much or joke with men who weren't my family, worried that he would get mad at me if I smiled at a cashier or waiter.

No one wants to live in a place where you can be sexually harassed for no rhyme or reason, we're humans and we want to try and predict what will happen.

Keep going until you find a doctor that's willing to be patient and work with you to figure this out. Write down all your questions and thoughts before your appointment.

I have endo and PCOS as well. I'm now 99% sure most of my pain is from endo. My Dr told me that some endo is hard to see/remove, and if you don't remove all of it, you may not get the pain relief you expect. So he may have very well removed all he saw ... Doesn't mean that's all there was. 

My Dr offered me a mirena or visanne. IUD's scare the crap out of me so I chose visanne. It's been wonderful. I really cannot even describe the relief ... I was having pain all month. I was spotting all month. I couldn't take a crap w/o feeling like my uterus was going to fall out. Even peeing (no straining required) hurt. I can go to the bathroom now w/o pain !! 

Beware of numerous surgeries to remove endo. The more surgeries you have, the more adhesions can be created, and can cause more problems (scar tissue makes things stick together requiring MORE surgery) ... especially if you're not actively trying to curb the growth of the endo.

Which, much to my surprise, I discovered that Lady Boss had the forethought to get approved by leadership before sharing them with me. Of course everything that she covered with me was in the notes but with MUCH more context. So, for instance, while she told me I am ""overly confident"" her notes said that I am overly confident when it came to my ideas about making changes to the training program and that they would need to be thoroughly vetted by the organization first.

Essentially, IF she had shared her full feedback it would have been perfectly reasonable and professional. I made it clear to HR that she had not! The HR rep agreed that the feedback was poorly delivered and assured me that she would not only follow up with Lady Boss but also meet privately with all of the employees who received feedback during the most recent round of internal interviews to ensure that no one else had the same experience. (Which I know for a fact that several did). 

So, either she is absolutely terrible at giving feedback or she orchestrated the whole thing with a great deal of forethought. Which would make her some sort  of sociopath I guess, but I'm not really sure which is the case.

One time I peed myself when I was at an amusement park with a guy I had a crush on. It was the worst time because I couldn't hide it without tying my hoodie around my waist, so I had to tell him. I was really lucky because he was my older brother's friend and a really nice guy, so he didn't make a big deal of it or tell anyone else, but of course I still felt utterly humiliated. Another memorable time I peed myself was once right before my choir was going to go on stage for a big performance at a choral festival. Nobody noticed (or at least no one said anything), but it was really stressful.

In my case it eventually just stopped happening. I never had any specific treatment for it, but I'm pretty sure it was related to my mental health issues. I still deal with chronic depression and anxiety, but they're much less severe than they were when I was in my mid-teens, which was unquestionably the lowest point in my life. I'm in my thirties now and the incontinence hasn't recurred.

Incontinence is really not that uncommon, especially in women. I know a woman who ended up getting stress incontinence after giving birth. She had to get surgery for it. I bet a lot of people have struggled with incontinence at some point in their lives.

Her reasoning was it was summer and I was wearing boots. Well that was because it's not very attractive to wear shoes a couple weeks after your toenail falls off (especially not your big toe). 

It made me feel really bad because I was treated like I did something wrong and that I was a liar. It really hurt. 

She's a bitch and he's an asshole. He claimed I exaggerated it. He was charged with 6 felonies after the next time he broke in, stole my gun, and then shot it at me. Oh but before he did that he assaulted me again and head butted one of my male friends that was with me. Class act.

So I totally get what you are going through. This was probably 8 years ago and it really bothers me. Im seeing a therapist to get help for possible PTSD because now when someone yells at me (my husband) I have started hitting first. It's a reaction. Especially if he's yelling very close to me, it makes me lose it. I used to tolerate that kind of thing from Craig because I thought it would just keep the peace. Then it turned very physical very quickly. 

As far as all of our mutual friends go, yeah it hurt, but it hurts more now that I LET them devalue me because THEY were in denial. As someone who has been through this, let it go. Cut them out and don't give it a 2nd thought",6,t3_24uda4

That's an incredibly dangerous thing to throw out.  It's a common victim blaming statement.  Abuse doesn't just show up one day.  It starts out with a lot of charm and steadily increasing manipulation that *anyone* can fall for.  That manipulation tears down the victim's self-esteem regardless of where it was at the beginning.  ",7,t3_24uda4
20140506083718,La_Fee_Verte,"You see it as victim-blaming, I see it as empowering. 

From my own past, and the cases of women that I helped and who attended therapy with me, the red flags show pretty much straight away in abusive relationships, but the victim ignores them for many reasons.

Part of my therapy concentrated on recognising these red flags for what they are, and being aware of these behaviours in any future potential relationships. Excessive charm is one of them, coincidentally  :) 

You say that anyone can fall for manipulation - but I can't agree. A healthy person with a healthy self-esteem will not fall for an abuser and manipulator, mainly because the 'charm' will just not work, and the 'minor things' that an unhealthy person will explain as 'a bad day' or 'he didn't know any better', or 'but he apologised straight away' will be recognised for the red flags they are. 

One can be a victim and cry 'oh oh why does it always happen to me' or, one can say 'why did I choose such a person, what of my needs were fulfilled and what fears of mine evoked to make me stay for so long ', analyse this and heal what is needed to heal, to avoid making such choices for the future.

I'm not trying to be this strict teacher lady saying in stern voice ''well, if you only tried more and loved yourself enough, you wouldn't end up with such a bad mark!''

What I'm trying to say is that part of the manipulation is the promise of love, the magical unconditional love - ''if only you deserve it'' (as per the abuser's weave of manipulation and lies). 

It works very often - because love is also very often something that victims were never given enough, were not given unconditionally, were not given without strings attached. 

The abuser starts from giving massive amounts of 'love', and then starts to take it away, bit by bit, so that the victim 'has to work for it'. 

If the victim didn't have enough love in herself, this works. But still, this is not, never, the victim's fault - as we are to a really high extent products of our childhood conditioning. And conditioning for something as strong and basic as love is really powerful, and really hard to break even if it is realised that something went wrong many years ago. 

Funnily enough, a very high proportions of the victims/survivors are seen as very strong women in the life outside the relationship...

A lot of things play a part in it.  The way our culture tells women to give the benefit of the doubt.  The way that red flags are not taught until someone makes the effort to learn after they've been through it.  Life changes are another way in.

The feeling that 'things just are this way, and it could be worse'. 

It still are just different words for - putting someone above yourself, therefore assigning a higher value to the other person instead of yourself. Just other words for self-esteem or self-worth.

For example, I'd like to see a top stroking the sub's hair a little bit after teasing them mercilessly. Telling them how good they are, how lovely they look, how perfect they are, how much they're appreciated, all while they struggle for you, jerking and whimpering. Kissing their nose or their cheek or their mouth, telling them how good they're doing. That you believe in them, that you know they can do it. Checking in with them, making sure everything is still okay. If they're tied up for a while, making sure their circulation is still good. Porn is full of ""perfect scenarios"", where nobody ever checks in and there are never any problems. I don't really like that. 

And aftercare. Nothing sweeter than good aftercare. Especially if we see the top doing something special (like baking/buying the sub's favorite treat). Even in amateur porn this is almost impossible to find. Kink to me is not just about pain and punishment. It's about knowing your sub, knowing what they need, and giving it to them in a kind, responsible, empathetic way. Sure, a lot of what they need might be pain or different forms of torment. But ultimately the point is that they enjoy it. And most actual human beings aren't *only* looking to be used or degraded or tortured.

20140506200139,thepanichand,"I kind of hate this video.

I am entirely pro-choice and it dismays me how the US chips away at access to abortion in little niggly ways, making it nearly impossible to access for many, and wrapping it up in the veil of the neocon movement that the last five years or so has arisen on the back of Sarah Palin et al. I always want women to have a choice. However, I hate abortion debates on either side because they are filled with fallacies and remarks by people who have never experienced making the decision or the procedure, too often. I'm just always appalled at the lack of medical literacy around the procedure on either side. 

So, I looked forward to this video when I heard about it, but yeah, I don't like it. I don't want the procedure to be scary for women undergoing it, but I am not sure this video really helps anything, with Emily making perky faces at the camera, sighing theatrically, and giving it the overall tone of a commercial for tampons aimed at teenagers. I don't see what the point was in showing the procedure since all you saw was her lying on the stretcher and waiting patiently in greens for it to be over. I think the music is in really poor taste. Finally, I don't really feel there is anything for women to take away from the video that some reasonable medical education could take the place of. I don't like contributing to starry-eyed unrealistic ideas of what a TA is like. This video makes it like it's no big deal, and while again, I support everyone's choice, I would really hate for some woman to feel brave enough to have a TA after watching this, and then wonder three days later why she can't stop crying because the video made it happy sparkle fun time, kinda. I also think alluding to being an abortion counsellor as likewise to being a birth doula absolutely absurd. I also boggle at the fact that someone that counsels women around having TAs would need to have an abortion; I don't want to be judgmental, but in some ways it almost feels like she got pregnant to make a point about having a TA, rather than a genuine birth control failure. 

I don't think TAs should be a heavy issue, don't mistake me, but I don't think skewing it into something as simple as having a wart removed is a good idea either. Physically speaking a TA isn't much of a procedure, it's pretty routine stuff, no different than a D&C after a miscarriage. But I think this is sort of irresponsible to women who might suffer psychological effects of grief and guilt to make it seem like it's no big deal. It IS a big deal. No matter how certain you are, it is a big deal; not physically, but psychologically. You can walk away and be glad you did it and not feel guilty, but it is a huge choice with much more gravity than this stupid video makes out. 

I also feel like this is just more pro-life cannon fodder. ""Look at this cold-hearted Godless woman aborting her living breathing baby with a smile on her face! This is what happens when you take prayer out of schools!"" kind of thing. I don't really think it deflates any myths that anybody with half a brain would know to look past; it is a pretty straightforward procedure physically and I can't imagine women don't know that, particularly when they are counselled about the procedure beforehand and the potential risks and complications. I really think more health literacy around abortion would be far more effective. 

Really, I feel like this is a huge step back, if anything. ",3,t3_24w506
20140506211722,dreamingofjellyfish,">No matter how certain you are, it is a big deal; not physically, but psychologically.

Well no, not necessarily. I think that may have been part of the point of this video.

The medical knowledge is out there and women having and abortion get the opportunity to ask questions before hand. But that information is about the medical procedures and risk. It can't answer the questions that I think may be pressing for a person about to have an abortion. Things like: how will this feel physically, how will I feel about it, how will I feel (in all respects) afterward. 

Obviously this video can't answer those questions. But I think it has value is showing one of the many reactions a women can have.

I would kill for a tapered waist but my torso's too short for that to ever happen, even when I was underweight or normal weight.

I also look young for my age and I used to look like a school kid in my mid-20s. My bf used to ask me not to wear a headband in public because it made him look like he's a pedo with a kid in public. :( I found that wearing slightly more ""mature"" clothes, aka smart/casual or officey clothes help with the age thing.

Have you talked with your therapist about how you feel it isn't helping?  It is entirely OK to fire your therapist and find someone else who suits you better.  Look for cognitive behavioral therapy (focusing on addressing your thought patterns/perceptions of your situation, teaching you tools to address situations outside of therapy).  A good cognitive behavioral therapist will help you define goals for therapy and routinely take stock of those goals, and what steps you can take in and outside of therapy to achieve them.

The feelings you are describing are remarkably similar to what I have felt when dealing with clinical depression.  Depression isn't all sobbing-in-a-pillow sadness, a lot of it is characterized by an inability to feel happiness and an emotional numbness.  Medication can help but it may take several tries to find a medication that works appropriately for you.  It also may take 6 or more weeks on a medication to have a difference (and it may not even be you that notices the difference, your fiance and friends may notice before you do, as it can be gradual).

I have struggled off and on with depression and have generalized anxiety disorder (which is constant but gets better and worse throughout certain times, particularly in times of stress).  The things that have helped me a lot are: A) Remembering to be kind to myself.  Beating yourself up over not finding joy in your life does nothing to improve the situation.  B) Finding a few small things that I take pleasure in, and indulging in them as often as possible (think of this as a continuation of point A).  Cuddling with my cat on weekend mornings makes me happy?  I make time for that, without fail, at least one morning out of each weekend.  Even if it means turning down social obligations sometimes.  I also find a lot of joy in creative/crafty projects, and they alleviate my anxiety issues, so I invest a lot of time in knitting.  C) Spend some time thinking about what you really want.  If you could be doing anything in the world, what would it be?  What about that scenario do you find most compelling?  This would be a good thing to explore in therapy with a therapist, as the additional perspective might be helpful.  Maybe you have a vision of lounging on a beach in Tahiti with fruity beverages, but what is really attractive about that situation is the freedom from everyday stressors and obligations.  If that is the case, try to find ways to minimize the things causing you the greatest stress - and if that is your ""great"" job, that's okay.  Your mental health is more important than a fancy paycheck.",3,t3_24w1mu
20140506175722,unhappythrowie,"Thank you, thank you this is really choice advice and I'm really glad you took the time to type that all out. You've captured exactly what I'm going through and it sounds like you've experienced the same. I'm really glad to know I'm not alone and thank you for the kind words. I ry to remember to be kind to myself but I'm my toughest critic. 

I definitely will bring this issue up with my therapist at my next session. I say therapy hasn't been helping with this because we've spent the last few months focusing on getting me back to a point where I can function and do my regular life. I had to take a month and a half medical leave from work because of anxiety and panic attacks. So we've been really focusing on coping techniques and getting me back to a comfortable place where I can get up in the morning and go to the office without breaking down in the parking lot. We haven't had a chance to get to the deeper issue of whether my life is fulfilling or not yet. 

>If that is the case, try to find ways to minimize the things causing you the greatest stress - and if that is your ""great"" job, that's okay. Your mental health is more important than a fancy paycheck. 

This is what I needed to read right now. Deep down inside I think I know that this is the answer... but I'm terrified (and a whole host of other scary negative emotions) to admit it and do something about it. ",2,t3_24w1mu
20140506153011,acyland,"I would go about this in a methodical way and analyze each part of your life to try to suss out what it might be you fee I satisfied with.

Could it be as simple as you're feeling bored? Maybe you just need to find something you really love to do as a hobby? It will probably take time and trial and error but finding something fulfilling and that you can be passionate about doing in your spare time will probably help.",2,t3_24w1mu
20140506154037,lateralus555,"This is sort of jumbled ""advice"", but maybe it will help some?
You say that you ""have everything anyone could seemingly want"", but that doesn't mean that those are the things that you want, personally. Just because some people find these things fulfilling, it doesn't mean you will. Perhaps your expectations that these things should make you happy are exactly why they are not doing that, if they never quite seem to be everything you imagined they would be. 

If anything you listed is making you unhappy, that's one matter, and a possible solution would be to change that part of your life. However, if the things you listed just aren't as fulfilling as you expected them to be, then perhaps you're putting too much pressure on those things to fulfill you. It seems like you may need to figure out what you do want, what you enjoy doing, what things make you happy, etc. if what you have now isn't doing that for you. Of course, that's not an easy thing to determine, and will likely take a lot of time, and some trial and error. ",2,t3_24w1mu

When I start wondering why I do anything that I do, and why I feel so unfulfilled with my life as a whole, I force myself to think back to very blissful moments in my life, and think about what made them so amazing. I've come to realize that the things that give me true, in-the-moment happiness are actually more simple than I ever thought they would be... I enjoy the sun, nature, helping other people, teaching, really good food, really good coffee, really good books, one-on-one conversations with close friends, etc. So, I try to keep these things in my life, even if for just an hour everyday. I certainly don't feel ecstatic all the time, but I guess I just like having some little go-to habits that can bring me a bit of insta-happiness during my search for those larger things that supposedly bring a more long-term happiness?

You should try developing a hobby. To start from scratch on a skill, and to work very hard at developing it, is extremely satisfying. And I mean to actually work at it, set aside a couple hours each week to develop your craft. What's something you've wanted to try your hand at? Playing an instrument, watercolor painting, salsa dancing, learning a foreign language, writing short stories, rock climbing, joining an intramural softball league, what would you like to do?

20140507072957,jeweledtree,"This is something that I have struggled with as well. I got stuck on a path where I was telling myself, ""I'm not happy now, but as soon as I hit this next milestone in my life, THEN I'll be happy.""  So I would just keep persevering until I hit the next big ""moment"" hoping that then I would feel happy and fulfilled. This led me into marriage, and working towards the stereotypical perfect American dream life, with a house with a white picket fence, 2.5 kids, etc. I thought those were all the things that would make me happy because that seemed to be what everyone else wanted. 

After just one year of marriage, everything fell apart, and I had a breakdown. I realized that I had completely lost track of myself. I was just going along with what I thought I was supposed to do, and not paying attention to what I actually wanted. So I decided to reset my life. I got a divorce (there was more going on than just me randomly deciding I was unhappy), I got therapy, I moved out on my own and I changed how I was living my life. 

The biggest thing for me was changing the way I view my life. Instead of always planning for and focusing on the future, I have worked on staying present. I focus on what makes me happy right now. I took up mindfulness meditation, which is amazingly helpful for this, and I really think you should give it a try. It definitely helped me to shift my focus, and helped a lot with my depression and anxiety as well. (Anxiety seems to be a common theme in this thread.) 

The other thing I discovered when I went through this process is that I don't really have a ""Passion"" in my life. Something that I love, that takes up my free time, and gives me a sense of fulfillment. This one, I'm still working on finding, but in the process of finding it, I've taken a lot of fun art and jewelry making classes. I've also started writing, and self-publishing. So, while I may not feel yet that there is one thing I'm super passionate about, I at least feel like I'm exploring new options. I think this would be a good thing for you to try as well.

20140506183926,VividLotus,"I understand this feeling. What it comes down to is this: a lot of people don't feel fulfilled by any kind of stereotypical ""success"" because it's not what they specifically want. For example, someone who truly wants to live in NYC and be a professional ballet dancer more than anything in the world might feel very unfulfilled by being a highly-paid lawyer in Atlanta, even if that sounds like a very ""successful"" life to most people. 

The first thing to try is to see if you can make yourself happier by doing things you enjoy and find fulfillment in outside of work. Most tech company employees I know do this. Sometimes the thing is something they wish they could do as a career, but either a) it's not at all a realistic goal for them in that sense, or b) they're not willing to make the sacrifices necessary in order to do it full time. Other times that thing is just a hobby they wouldn't really want to do full time, but it's something they really love doing. I think the key here is for it to be something that gives you a sense of accomplishment, rather than just a sense of relaxation.

If you still feel unhappy and hate the idea of spending 40-100 hours a week at your job, then I think the next step is figuring out if there is some specific thing you'd rather be doing. If there is, then figure out whether you want it enough to make whatever sacrifices would be necessary for that. For example, if your main passion in life is photography and more than anything you  would love to be a full-time wedding photographer, you might have to give up on the idea of owning a house in a ""desirable area"" (especially if you work at the HQ of that particular tech company and live anywhere remotely near that). To some people, having a fancy house or a car they can brag about is worth a job that bores them. For others, it's not. But often, you can't have it both ways.",1,t3_24w1mu

As for weight loss and getting in shape, I like to do things that are scheduled with other people. It's much harder to blow it off if I feel like I'm letting my friends down. I don't know what sports you played, but if there are any community or church leagues near you, maybe you could join those to give yourself something physical to do? Find a friend who wants to get in shape, too, and become running/lifting/swimming buddies or go play tennis a few times a week. That lack of motivation is also characteristic of depression, so you might consider seeing a counselor or someone to discuss the possibility that you might still be depressed. I'm also focusing on exercise because it helps relieve depression. Diet is important, too, of course, more important than exercise when it comes to pounds lost, but you might find that starting regular exercise that you enjoy helps you feel better, and I know personally when I feel better, I eat better.

I picked up MFP, started walking and biking, and eventually moved to a c25k program (I've never run before, but I'm up to 7 miles now and things are looking good for my 10-miler in October).  Lifting is new because I've plateaued in my weight loss, and a change is frequently what's needed to jumpstart things.  

Go check out MFP.  Sign up on your computer - it's free.  You can get it on your smartphone, assuming you have one.  Scanning bar codes couldn't be easier, and you can enter homemade meals and snacks to get calorie counts.  Invest in a good food scale.  Eyeballing portions does not do you any good.  Try logging your meals for a few days and see what you're actually ingesting (calorically) in the course of a day.  Getting through the first two weeks was the hardest for me ... After that, the cravings and need for snacking went away.  I am a boredom snacker - breaking myself of that was pivotal.  

I still have trouble not seeing myself as the fat girl, regardless of what people say I look like.  But, I know I'm so much healthier now then I was a year ago.  It's important to not get caught up in fad diets .. they always lead to failure.  Make a lifestyle change.  MFP has helped me with that, because I can still eat all the same things I did before - I just have to work it into my daily calorie count.  I am jtodd78 on MFP if you'd like to add me.  And don't be afraid to step on the scale.  That's who you are today - not who you can be, if you want to be.

Ask her over for wine or coffee and a movie (or something you normally do when you hang out together). When she is relaxed and comfortable, ask ""Sarah, can we talk about Steve?"" 

Don't put down her boyfriend, don't bring up *your* past experiences, just emphasize that you're worried about her safety based on some things she's told you. The key is to ask questions and to *listen*. (ex. ""Didn't you tell me that last week, Steve called you a fat cunt?""...""If I was dating someone like Steve, what would you tell me to do?""...""Have you ever thought that Steve might be capable of physical violence?) Don't tell her to leave him, but emphasize that if she ever did, you would help her.

If she gets defensive or shuts down, just end the conversation and say, ""I'm sorry to upset you. I just want you to know that I'm there for you, and you can always come to me if you need help or want to talk.""
