20140514080321,catiebug,"This is a good point. I feel like the original message of TwoX was lost - it was a place for women... *all* women... to gather on reddit. Feminist concerns can certainly be a part of conversations between women, but damn don't downvote a woman because she took her husband's name.

Personally, I also stopped coming here regularly because I feel like every single top post is about rape, abuse, or being offended by something. I feel like I jerk for saying that I'm tired of it, but truthfully I don't have much to add to those conversations. No, I've never experience rape or abuse, nor has anyone close to me. No, I don't freak out when someone catcalls me while jogging. That's me. I understand if it upsets *you* or makes *you* uncomfortable, but when I say it doesn't bother me (so that other women on the thread who might agree with me know that they're not alone and to just to share another perspective), I get downvoted. And surely these issues aren't the only interesting things about the lives of women on reddit?

For example, I've thought about making a post celebrating the fact that I hired 15 female engineers and creative developers into my internship program this summer and encourage others to pursue their interests even if they are traditionally male-dominated professions. How cool is that? But I feel like such a post nowadays would be full of ""the reason women don't want to work in high-tech is because it's like a frat house"", and downvoting anyone who disagrees and says their workplace is actually very welcoming and comfortable. Victimized circlejerk bullshit. So I just keep it to myself. And I guess I'm not alone, which is why the front page is full of women with issues that they can't keep to themselves and really need to seek support for. But it's not really a great representation of the women of reddit.

I only seem to be drawn here on IFF, when people actually seem interested in showing off their womanhood, sharing something interesting about their lives, and making for a cool, supportive, and interesting community that celebrated all kinds of different choices and paths in life. A microcosm of what I feel like TwoX used to be.

I originally came from construction too. GC side. So my entire HR career has been spent in male-dominated industries. I'm happy to say that all of my employers (previous and current) have been extremely supportive of hiring women and accommodating the needs unique to having more women in the workforce (appropriate benefits, appropriate worksites, attention to inappropriate behavior, etc).

Unfortunately, our problem is still that the recruiting faucet from which to drink has water pressure problems. That is, there are not enough women interesting in joining these fields for us to ever hire them at the same rate as dudes. More young girls need to feel comfortable that these fields will be an option to them and do provide a comfortable environment. I fear they get discouraged by their parents and mentors who believe it to all be the wild west and frat house-ish. Those companies are out there, yes, but they are not the norm and many women find happy careers and lives in industries where they might be the only woman around (that's not in a support function).

We realized how good of a match we were well before we started wanting to go farther :) Heh, if we wanted to rush for the sake of lust, we'd have probably gotten married already.

(talking about my relationship now, and not anyone else's) To bring in my own views, I don't think ""God"" has a problem with desire, and I don't think he ""designed"" us to be in long-term relationships without sex (using that loosely, since I'm not keen on the the 7-day creation thing). I *do* think that at least for me, sex is something that is an aspect of an ultimate commitment to another person and should follow the 'filling up' of friendship and affection. When the rest has built up, as it has in our case, desire is a natural result. If I force myself not to feel it now, I'll be trying to force myself *to* feel it later. In our case, we've used this opportunity to talk about how we'll ensure sexual compatibility and to get over any sex-negative feelings we had from our social conditioning. ",6,t3_25hh6t

I was ""lucky"" and started dating a guy at 17 who has grown with me into someone I immensely respect and value. So we've been through thick and thin together for 4.5 years and will probably be getting married next summer. I think one thing that gets forgotten is that at least in my culture we value 'waiting' but we also value learning to be more mature in how you handle relationships earlier.

What is frustrating is some people in the Christian community value waiting late to get married while still holding the anti-sex viewpoint. You can do one or the other without too much difficulty, but doing both (unless you just don't date until you're older) is a bit much. ",39,t3_25hh6t

I'm personally not waiting for marriage, but I have a tremendous amount of respect for people who do. I don't believe that ""sexual compatibility"" is as cut and dried as some people make it out to be, and I believe that most couples can work at it till they are both satisfied, if there is love and commitment on both sides.

I don't mind if other Christians think the way you describe, nor do I think they're less of Christians.

There's too much of an agenda here now, I think. ",68,t3_25hh6t
20140514131947,sweetpea122,"I got down voted so hard on a post about a woman who said she went out with a reddit meet up. She was with her bf and stumbling, slurring, blacked out for a period (she doesn't remember if she was talking to anyone while an ""assault"" happened, etc. She said a guy put his hand on her butt for  blocks while her bf was 10 feet in front of her (they were all walking home). 

In essence I said, maybe you should drink less and be more assertive ""like hey don't put your hand on my ass or go find your bf. Oh god bring out the pitchforks. Now I'm a victim blamer. Would i say that to a rape victim were the questions, why does she have to *change* her behavior, etc. Then someone said it's sexual assault if someone touches you and you don't want them to.

I think that is the most broad definition of sexual assault i have ever heard. I think maybe its sexual assault if I say ""please don't touch me there"" and it continues. And also she doesn't even remember the entire time being blacked out. Maybe he was helping her walk because her bf wasn't paying attention.

To answer their questions, no I would not say that to a rape victim. Yes I think its reasonable for women (who want to try to be safer) to avoid drinking excessively, stick with a friend if you are in a group you don't know, watch your drinks (oh my god now I'm blaming date rape victims), and sorry, but also learn how to stand up for yourself. I don't think its very fair to have a hand on your butt for 3 blocks, not say anything, and then claim sexual assault. 

And yes what he did was wrong. Im not justifying pervy men's behavior. The main lesson is to avoid situations where you put yourself at risk (IMO).How is that so crazy to say? We tell women, don't go down dark alleys, if you see a van on your drivers side climb through the other side, never put your drink down, don't sit in parking lots, etc. Can we add don't drink too much especially when you're with a new crowd? Is it fair that men don't have to worry about those things? Fuck no, but we can cry about the injustice all we want. It doesn't change the fact that these things happen and men take advantage of women everyday. ",8,t3_25hh6t
20140514200128,Nora_Oie,"Yeah, my experience was similar (although actually, the ""perp"" in question did way less than the perp in your story).  I had a ""maybe"" in my response similar to yours - it did not go well.  

Neither of us was trying to defend the alleged evil-doer, but to inject some reasonable suggestions into the discussion.  

I'd need to have been there, furthermore (to see what the ""butt-touching"" really consisted of - given the explainer's admitted possible black-out/memory problems.  It was one of the things that amazed me most about drunk people, once I met some:  they remembered things so differently than I thought I'd seen.  We all can have imperfect memories, but over the years, I've grown to trust sober people's memories (and trained professionals) over drunk people.  

To me, advising women to avoid circumstances that endanger them is no different than telling people to wear good shoes with traction while climbing Half Dome.  It's supportive.  It's a good thing to do.  But it is also increasingly perceived as victim blame.  Usually, within feminist/women's communities that I've been in, both positions are tolerated.

When it comes to the smaller ""assaults"" (dissing someone's hairstyle, showing some weird bias against something that someone else likes), I think it's important to cut other people the slack we'd want for ourselves.  No one manages to avoid offending all other people.  Being able to shrug some stuff off (and set appropriate, usually polite, boundaries with others) is a good thing.  

I'm not much into faulting or blaming unless I'm on a jury or appointed to hear a grievance.  I hear complaints all day long (and it's amazing how widely different witnesses to the same event hear things).  I don't like playing judge or jury unless I have to, but I do think proactive assertiveness and judicious boundary setting are learned skills - ones we could discuss productively here.",6,t3_25hh6t

I don't drink to excess with people I don't know. I let myself get drunk around people I trust not to act that way. Additionally, I'm not just going to sit by while some guy gropes me (for, if I recall, something like 4 blocks of walking - seriously?!) This should be a learning experience for her - maybe I won't get drunk with strangers, and maybe I'll work on being more confident and assertive so I feel like I can stand up for myself when I'm uncomfortable.

We teach that to children ""hey if someone touches your privates, say no and tell an adult"". Its not that different as a woman. Obviously, there are times when you are afraid of saying no, but this was in a crowd of people with her bf, and for blocks!

To play devil's advocate, if I was a guy and thought it was okay, I would assume she would tell me if she thought it was inappropriate. Yes, I know she has a bf, but some people cheat, flirt, and do all sort of things in front of or around their partners. 

You are completely right though about learning some confidence and assertiveness. Women need to learn how to have a voice and set boundaries and enforce them.

I very much agree with this point and would even extend it.  I think this sub can easily become a damaging echo chamber of whining and external blame.  I think people mistakenly think that removing blame from a woman is effective support.  Sometimes the best support is to carefully and sensitively point out where someone participated in the negative situations.

Some suggestions for the sub were brought up back then, but it seems like we still have the same problems!",13,t3_25hh6t
20140514103941,zazzlekdazzle,"This has been an issue with this subreddit for over a year, maybe even two.  The issue started when Project Unbreakable happened and, simultaneously and perhaps because of it, a bunch of other lady subreddits were created -- e.g. /r/TrollXChromosomes, /r/MakeupAddiction, /r/FancyFollicles, etc. 

The emphasis on rape/assualt/abuse and the funneling-off of lighter content to other subs resulted in a bottleneck where the populous with a more diverse set of opinions left for the other subs or just altogether. 

Many people have made posts like this one here in the past, even me (well over a year ago, I think).  And though these posts promote a lot of good discussion and are upvoted, things don't change.  The sub has just become large and hivemind-y, which eventually happens everywhere due to the bottlenecking I mentioned above.  I think there is a vocal minority that agrees with you, with at least the notion that we should be a subreddit tolerant of a diversity of opinions.  But there is a powerful, and perhaps silent, majority who vote with their clicks rather than their words and they upvote the abuse/rape/abortion threads over others and use downvotes to punish others with opinions that step beyond the range of what they think is acceptable.   I find the chronic and intense downvoting philosophy of this sub to be pretty disconcerting, but it has taken over and I really don't think there is anything to be done about it.  

I know I will get many downvotes for saying anything about the sub that sounds critical of its focus on sexual assault/abusive relationships/rape/abortion, because that is what has happened in the past.  I do feel that those issues are VERY important, but this sub no longer reflects a diversity of topics, opinions or a tolerance of such. It is the evolution of a subreddit, and I think it is inevitable.

Your own personal space is worth sticking up for and it's okay not to be nice about it. Who cares if the guy 'realises' he's touching your ass, it's YOUR butt he's grabbing and you DO realise it, so point it out to him. You don't have to shout at him or make a scene to make sure everyone knows what he did, especially because that creates a barrier for you to say something. Tell him quietly if that helps, just make sure you protect your barriers.

Personally, I'm always scared that if you don't reprimand unwanted behaviour immediately then he'll think it's okay and that you like it. This happens when I go out with friends, if a guy decides he wants to dance with you and have his arm around you and you don't tell him to stop it, he'll think you're really into it and before you know it he's pushing your face into yours trying to steal your gum.

People have different reactions to these situations.

As you say, you were drunk, he may have been drunk, and alcohol certainly contributes to the making of mistakes. If he is a good person, then he will apologize. If he becomes defensive and denies responsibility, then it's time to alert others in your group.

Confront it, letting one slightly slimy bloke ruin your fledgling social life isn't the best idea IMHO. If you feel comfortable still going out with the new group do, just if you're going to talk to him about it pick your time & place tactfully.

OP asked how to proceed, and in my experience, it just helps to clarify all the circumstances when handling something like this. I've had my fair share of abusive situations in life and whether someone was intoxicated or sober at the time does make a difference in how you deal with the fallout of an incident. Drugs never excuse the behaviour, but they are a relevant detail. 

I'm not saying that it *wasn't* deliberate. But I wasn't there, and neither was anyone in this thread (except OP). So if I were her, I'd just want to kinda interrogate the guy with an open-ended question to see what he thinks/claims happened... you can tell a lot by how someone responds.

> and maybe it WAS a drunken mistake

And THIS is my problem. Qualifying it with drunken minimizes the sense if oersonal responsibility. There is no such thing as a drunk mistake. By getting drunk you sign your name to take responsibility of all your actions that you commit while drunk. If andrunk driver kills a person it's not drunken manslaughter it's manslaughter and if anything the drinking is an aggravating factor (you chose to reduce your self control and risked harming others).

So if it was an act done while drunk, it was an act, not a mistake. The mistake he did was to drink and to allow himself to abuse people. And since he sounds like an adult he should know better than that. The drunkedness makes it worse not better than a sober act. ",-1,t3_25icuv

It is possible that race played a role, but given a lack of evidence and the admission that the dads requested she leave because she was ""dance provocatively"" and her dress was too short, this seems to be more of a problem with women's (girls') sexuality).",3,t3_25hgav

When I joined my department, I was strongly advised to never be alone in my office with a female student and the door shut to avoid the potential for a compromising situation. In any case, every university has rules about what can result in a dismissal after getting tenure. The common ones are sexual harassment, ethics violations, and a failure to satisfy the contract.

20140513224235,cmtprof,"Find out if the student evaluations are typed before being shown to the professor. Almost all universities collect the evaluations well before finals, but they are rarely processed and given back until a few weeks have passed after the end of the term. For many public universities, doing so is illegal. At my university, I usually don't see student feedback until a month has gone by in the next term, and all of the feedback is typed to prevent retaliation.  

In any case , this is a serious case of harassment that can land this professor and his department in serious trouble. It could be that the department does not want him to stick around but has their hands tied because he is tenured. With evidence, however, they can take action, especially if there are similar complaints. 

As a professor, I'm sorry to hear that this happened to you. I would encourage you to make your department aware of this problem.

20140514153839,Kezoqu,"I can't give advice that hasn't already been given in this thread, but I went through a similar situation with a history professor. At one point during his lecture, he was talking about how religion has influenced history and out came the words ""you see, the atheist is retarded..."" He spouted off a lot of conspiracy theories, one about how people from China are coming here to steal our water. And he had an extra credit assignment where you had to put up political signs in support of a specific candidate he wasn't naming, and when asked about the name of the candidate he'd say ""why does that matter?""

I filed a complaint, naming the clearly biased assignment and the statement he'd made. Got asked to come in for a talk from the department head, thought she'd be asking me questions about the assignment which was my main complaint, instead was the subject of an hour long interview about what life is like as an atheist and a teaching of the ""duck walk"", aka letting silly little comments like that wash off my back. :\

Yes, there will be quite a few professors in your life as a college student who will say things that are pretty crappy and unprofessional.

If not, you could do it anonymously after the course is over (to each member of the department - but personally, I'd leave him out of the chain of emails).  Your university must also have a student grievance procedure (but don't use if you think there could be retaliation).  Your university should also have an Academic Senate where you could make public comment (if even one other student would go with you and make the same comment, it would be a stronger statement).  Shaming him in front of his colleagues is about the only thing left for you to do.  The department may have heard this many times before (there was an older prof in my program with similar issues; they had heard it all before; it turned out he was in the early stages of Alzheimer's and there was a plan afoot to get him to retire - which he did about a year after a couple of us complained to some other faculty members (who happened to be women).

Second, my medication is almost the same as my previous birth control, except it has a higher dose and slightly different ratio of hormones and is continuous (no sugar pills) so I never get my period anymore. While this might sound unnatural, it's the best way to minimize scarring and pain (and fertility if this is something that is important to her). It has made a world of difference. I went from almost daily pain (and a host of other unpleasant symptoms) to being functional and happy. Danazol or Lupron are alternatives, but they come with their own side effects--she should read up on them to see what she thinks. 

Third, I understand the ""turned into a bitch"" thing. I was on regular birth control, but because I was still having periods I was developing scar tissue and still having pain. Is she on continuous BC? Is the dose high enough?
If she doesn't have any treatment, she will continue to develop scar tissue and have pain (and if she's like me and those cysts were endometriomas, it is possible more of those could develop, too). If her case is severe enough, they could remove some of the tissue with surgery, but this isn't a 100% ""cure.""

Our hormones are such that we require slightly different formulations of birth control. Usually heavy progesterone ones are good to suppress endo growth and symptoms. 

There are so many different types and formulations of birth control, sometimes it takes some experimentation to find the one that's right for your chemistry. 

Try to encourage your GF not to give up and to keep trying. 

Be patient with her sex drive and craziness while she finds that right variety.

As a fellow endo sufferer who's undergone lap and had serious lesions attached to my bowels, it's a scary disease. Unfortunately, birth control is usually the best route since endo flares with each period and can grow and spread, get into the abdominal cavity and create lesions.

I would suggest that she find a doctor that specializes in just gynecology or urogynecology rather than an OB/GYN. I went through maybe... 3 or 4 doctors before I settled on one wonderful doctor. He performed the surgery and got me through what birth control works best. I don't get my period anymore, and truthfully, I prefer it that way. I understand your GF's distaste for BC. I despise it.. but I also like my quality of life now.

First of all, give your girlfriend loads of love and support from me - I've found so much strength during my own battle with endo from others who are fighting the disease and I want to spread that around as much as I can. If she's a Redditor, you might want to point her in the direction of /r/endo, which is an amazing, supportive community. You might find it helpful as well, to read about others' experiences and get some answers for your questions!

Honestly, you seem incredibly supportive and concerned, and that makes me really happy. Having a SO that always had my back was so vital while I was going through the process of finding an endo treatment that worked for me - I got frustrated and depressed and terribly upset during that period of time and his support made things so much better than they could have been. So you're already doing a great job! :)

As far as the BC problem is concerned, encourage your girlfriend to ask about other forms (besides the Pill) at her doctor's appointment. Some endo sufferers do really well with the Depo-Provera shot, which is another form of birth control, and still others do well with an IUD. There are other hormonal treatments, too, which won't function as birth control but can ease the symptoms of endo (Lupron is one of these - it's a shot that basically simulates menopause in the body). Like you said, her doctor will likely know best. Encourage her to make a list of questions and concerns to take into her appointment beforehand so she doesn't forget anything. And if she's unsatisfied with her options, a second opinion might be what she needs.

Unfortunately, there isn't a one-size-fits-all treatment for this disease, and some people have to try a lot of things before finding what works for them. I'm one of those - I tried three different combinations of treatments, and the one I'm on now isn't *perfect*, but it's the one that works best so far. Hopefully she finds something that works for her soon!",1,t3_25hodo

She needs to educate herself thoroughly about the disease and it's various treatments to be able to recognize when she has found a doc who really knows what he or she is talking about. Many docs only know the bare minimum about endo and don't have the surgical skills necessary to do endo excision or they simply don't have the knowledge about the surgery to recommend it.

She might consider looking at the implant or shot, which have no estrogen, and discussing all of her concerns with her doctor. And as for the gallbladder thing, I don't know what her problem is, but she should discuss it with her doctor. I will say that I don't have a gallbladder and I'm perfectly fine without it after going through some hell with it. The warnings on birth control is that it can cause gallbladder disease, but as far as I know, there's no reason not to use it if you already don't have a functioning gallbladder. I'm on it now.

Honestly, she needs to talk to her doctor about those fears. The first birth control I was on made me depressed, but the one I'm on now works just fine. My old roommate was an angry bitch on her first birth control, but was herself on the one she's on now. It's possible she'll have to try multiple different pills, but honestly it's either that or she risks her fertility and she endures a lot more pain that could be prevented or she forfeits her fertility totally and has an endometrial ablation and sterilization. Her doctor may not perform that last option if you're young, because she hasn't exhausted her options and she could regret it and doctors don't want to be sued.",0,t3_25hodo

1) Stay out of the red pill.  Honestly, I doubt any good would come of it.

2) A 30-year-old who feels young is more attractive than a 24-year-old who feels as old as the hills.

3) Being 6'3"" definitely changes the dynamic, but doesn't mean you can't find a guy. You might have to be more direct with guys, as they often assume a taller girl wouldn't be interested in them.

My girlfriend is a decent amount older than me, but she has vitality and a lust for life.  Before meeting my current SO, I went on a few dates with someone who was my age (roughly 30).  However, that person would NOT shut up about how old she felt.  It was a major turn-off and helped me to see her as ""old"" as well.  I'm a firm believer in the whole ""you're only as young as you feel"" thing.

I'm sorry you're having a rough time.  It's okay to feel bad sometimes.  However, as others have pointed out, you're no old hag!  30 is not old by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, most of the people I've talked to about age say their 30s were the best years of their lives.",54,t3_25hruc

I did the same thing when I hit 30, worry too much about how I wasn't wifed yet. You know what? Worrying is a waste of time. It solved nothing. My 15 year high school reunion happened (I didn't go) &amp; I ran into one of my classmates who had gone. He told me about how all these people we knew that got married right out of high school or in their early 20s were more often than not divorced. Some were on their second or even third marriage, with multiple kids with different partners. That could have been you if you had rushed into finding a mate. 

Your 20s are for figuring out who you are as an adult. You've spent your entire life as a child growing and developing, and having someone else take care of you. Growing up and becoming mature doesn't happen overnight. So you go into your 20s and you start fucking up all over the place. It's ok, you're supposed to. At least you did the smart thing and focused on school, you could have ended up in a completely different scenario. 

Your 30s is where you really start to mature and chill out. As a lady you enter your sexual prime. You have a better idea of who you are and what you might want out of life. Attitude is everything! If you dig deep into this negative talk you're going to end up how you fear you're going to end up. Why? Because nobody likes to hang out with someone who's negative. I would advise instead to see life as an adventure. Go do things, have experiences. Live!  You'll meet people along the way, some will be guys, some may become lovers, and if they're a good match then maybe you'll want to keep them. Or, you'll have too much fun being awesome to worry. 


The grass is always greener on the other side. There are lots of advantages to being single, especially if the alternative is being stuck with someone who is bad for you.

(2) Put yourself in a position to meet men. Sitting at home binging on Netflix is not going to get you a husband. Make it your fucking job to go out twice a week to social events. Go to bars, parks, auto shows, the clubs and bars around male-centered events, and the hot social places near your city. 

(3) Men want sex. If you do meet a guy, he will want to have sex with you, so the better you are in bed, the happier he will be.

20140830070126,raceAround126,"Hello. I'm from The Red Pill and, therefore, you should dismiss anything in my post as misogynistic, hate-inspired lies! Well, with that caveat out of the way, now for a response. 

TRP has taught me a lot, most of it I wish I knew when I was 20. I could sit here and spout off for hours about how when I was around 20, I did the whole be yourself and be nice thing and what it got me. It got me used. Well used. I'd even appeal to girls about what I was doing wrong and, being female, you know exactly the responses I got. Your post is the equivalent of the male 20yo virgin who no girl wants to fuck but always want to hang out with. Ironic I guess. 

Right now I'm over 30, split off from a 10 year LTR which was, well, mind crushingly abusive and also cost me every friend I ever had and communication with my Mom. It was more than worth it though. And yes when I say abusive, I mean her to me, not vice versa. I feel the need to state that explicitly as usually people see ""abusive"" and ""relationship"", it must be the guy who is the fist-swinging animal.

TRP would have you believe as you say; any single and over-30 woman is likely to have ridden the cock carousel and fucked over and used a whole bunch of beta guys. And it's not very difficult not only to see why this belief is rife within the red pill, nor is it difficult to actually experience this in real life as a man. In fact most girls over 25 I've had the pleasure of over the last year have many beta orbiters that jump through any hoops these ladies set them! And they use it well! A few times, one girl in particular had her beta drive her to my flat, he went off to hide somewhere, after we were done, she texts him for a ride home! I mean... shit... It's like looking at a mirror of myself when I was young and stupid! I feel sorry for the guy, but whaddya gonna do! 

There's various explanations for what you're saying. Guys do go for younger girls. In my case, I couldn't get any of these fine-ass girls when I was younger. There was no playing the field for me simply because I was ""such a nice guy"". This despite claims that I'd ""find someone eventually"" and that any girl would be ""so lucky to get me""... It makes me cringe even now!

The way I see it, now I'm older and a bit better built, now I see all the above was simply because I was a pussy and now that I truly don't give a shit about their feelings or happiness, these fine ass 20yo  girls are actually pretty easy for me. In many cases, they do the chasing! I don't fully understand it if I'm honest. I wouldn't say I was the best looking guy in the world, not even close. But if they're chasing, welp, I can't run that fast! Call it filling in the gap, so to speak. I missed out earlier in life, so getting my fill now! And why the fuck shouldn't I? 

You're looking for marriage and as well you might. You do have a problem in that you're over 30 so you can't compete with these 20 somethings. I hate to use the word ""alpha"" but these alphas who have gaggles of 20-something chasing them have it pretty good! 

In contradiction to TRP, I find a lot more value in girls who have gone to the bother of educating themselves than some dullard who spent her life working in a factory with kids of various paternity looking for ""Mr. Right"". My two usual plates have far more depth to them and have actual developed personalities. And neither of them know who [insert latest teen sensation] is, neither of them are aware who [insert large-butted American chart singer in here] is fucking, or that [insert rap star here] just got shot or whatever mindnumbing bollocks is shoveled out by pop culture. 

To me, a girl without an education is fuck material and that's about it. Not because I'm predisposed to this thinking, but I just naturally find that they're too easily distracted by shiny things, have no focus and are frankly boring to spend any significant time with. So, in a complete anti-TRP sentiment, don't make light of your accomplishments. A Masters Degree isn't to be sniffed at. Unless of course it's a Masters in 17th Century Tapestry or some other waste of time. 

Also, I really am not a fan of the word “alpha”. When I go to the gym and see some of these guys who are well built, good looking, but who honestly just make derp noises for the sake of doing it, that to me is what an ""alpha"" looks like. And it really makes me think, ""fuck sake, just shut up!"". I'm there, getting changed, and they're obnoxiously ""BUUP""-ing out some random notes, and seriously they're practically comparing dick sizes in some near-homoerotic game of ""Let me see ur peen""! It's like they're five years old! Maybe I have the definition wrong, but if that's alpha, I'm happy to be just riding on the outskirts of alpha-town.

So why would an alpha give up casual sex with hotties to settle down, get married and have kids? Especially given the utterly raw deal that marriage brings? I'm hanging out with my cousin tonight. He got divorced three years ago. He's back home living with Mom and Dad because his paycheck goes to paying for his kids, the mortgage on the house where they live with his ex-wife that he is not allowed anywhere near and various other things. His ex-wife even moved in some guy that she was fucking most of the way through their marriage. So given that divorce rape is so very very real, why in fucks name would any man get married? When your only social outlet is reliant on friends and family members paying for you and not mentioning it (as in tonight), all because you got hammered in divorce court and have no means of even ever considering dating anyone else again in your life... this guy doesn't get to ""start over"". He's fucked. His life is this until the last kid turns 16 wherein he'll have just pushed over 50! That is the result of marriage for many men!

Hopefully that provides some perspective on how men think. Or at least, post-beta men like myself. I know this reads like I'm some frustrated angry little shit, but I'm actually not. The worst thing in my life was my ex in my LTR. Now she's gone, I live on my own, I'm my own boss, I do my own thing, I'm enjoying a new job role and life is fucking awesome. And the people that are around me are because they want to be. Not because I bought them or was the nice guy!

**Should you give up hope?** 

Hell no. You may have to rethink what Mr. Right looks like, sure. You’re looking to be the wifey. You may come one day to look upon a beta bucks. You know a lot of the alphas are chasing the 20 somethings. The betas are unaware that they could become a little more alpha. And being as you're looking for a husband, of course stability is a big part of that from a financial and a personable perspective. I mean, I doubt very much that top of your list is a minimum-wage 40 year old loser; I bet that if a 35 year old professional driving a brand new Audi wandered into your frame, he'd most certainly grab your attention! And why not, it's what you're looking for in a future hubby. After all, you've gone to the bother of educating yourself, you're in shape... these are not unnatural thought patterns! Shit, I'd say the same thing about myself. I think I have already!

One thing TRP teaches and is so painfully true is that any woman of any age can easily find a man to commit to her, regardless of who or what she is! If you don’t believe me, go hold vigil on a bench opposite a registry office one day!

So when I say you may need to realign what hubby looks like, it's most likely going to be a beta who you can softly prod into becoming a little more alpha. Just don't go too far, otherwise he may wake up!

But to pick out snippets from your post, namely:

> I'm still attractive and in shape

> if I should have made more of a concerted effort when I was younger?

>  rejected tons of good guys

From those statements, I guarantee you that there was at least one, if not more, guys who would have donated an arm and a leg to have been with you. An attractive 20 something in college... yeah who wants those! I can guarantee you that there MUST have been at least one guy. Unless you have a face like a truck or odd growths appearing from somewhere that scientists asked if they could study, there was someone! It's not even a question. There was!

**What you should do now?**

As you're posting anonymously on some internet forum (aren't we all), it's a nice easy way to get unhindered straight-to-the point advice. As a former long-term beta turned TRP, there's a few things you can do! 

First of all, get off these terrible subs. I like reading TRP. I go to the gym a lot, I make very good money, I have my interests and TRP showed me how to take control of these things and I have to say, my life has never been fuller. It's not just about fucking girls casually, I'm enjoying what I do. I have life plans and goals, stuff I never would have had if I was still in a betafied LTR. I'm glad of that. But, I can perfectly see the difference between wood and trees. 

Reading all these girl-power fuelled subs is all well and good provided you take only a handful of what they say! I promise, no guy wants to hear you bleat on about feminism, girl-power or all the other crap that infests the Internet these days. 

Go and have a read of Red Pill Woman. You obviously want to catch a good man, so really you need to know how to be a good woman! I don't bother girls about how much I can lift, nor do I attempt to tell them all about how I just got my hot lap down by 8/10ths of a second! Accede that you have flaws and want to fix them. It’s what TRP did for me.

Second, give us guys a break! I don't mean go out and fuck anything with a dick, but realize that not every nice guy is a creep with an overly impressive porn collection.

**tl/dr**
Go read Red Pill Woman and to use the hoary words thrown at every beta ever, just be nice!

20140830070259,raceAround126,"A little back story of a potential second LTR with a near-RPW for me.

I met a girl at a gig this past May/June. Everything started well. She was pretty, confident and certainly no dumbass. Plenty character depth, we enjoyed hanging out, what have you. Between reading her and reading Red Pill Woman, I did get the impression that she certainly had the makings of RPW. She was different from the plates and she was instinctive in her approach. Go read RPW, this is what she was like. Almost.

When I say almost, she would have certain RWP traits. Some smaller examples, we were going to her company's party, she picked up three dresses. She asked me which one she wanted me to wear. I picked one, she wore it. I expected the reaction to be one which I had come across countless times in my old LTR: the one I picked would go to the back of the wardrobe never to be seen again. Gurl power.

It surprised the shit out of me when she not only wore it but looked pretty damned amazing in it. Not only that, she demanded sex in it later on. Call that a good night all round!

Another time, she knew I had a course assignment to get in (studying second degree at the moment). I told her I couldn't go out with her. She texted me about 8 to find out how I was doing, a few back and forth texts. She showed up about 9pm, dinner materials in hand and hung around patiently until I was done working. Not a peep nor a moan about me not paying her attention. 

She failed eventually, sadly. Well, she set herself up for outright failure. We went out to a party and she knew full well her ex was there and that her ex was still into her. It wasn't even a party many of her friends were going to. She tried to shit-test me with that one. She played up to her ex's flirting. On this, I instantly went and started chatting up another girl. I knew exactly what she was doing, I just felt that the response to this shit-test should be like for life.

She took me out for a smoke and had a go about me wandering off. I called her on her bullshit and said, ""I don't play games like that"" and left. I went off to play pool with a few buddies and came back to my flat about midnight. She'd left a note on my door apologizing, my neighbor downstairs said she'd hung around for about an hour before she gave up waiting.

Needless to say I didn't call her again. 

But in my mind, a Red Pill Woman does not need to shit-test like that. I call it insecurity and honestly, if an LTR with me was her goal, she had all the makings and was ticking all the boxes. But she tried to push some shit and it failed. The moral of the story, if your aim is to secure Mr. Husband, ease up on the extreme shit tests. You are a woman, you will shit test. It's just what happens. Most alphas will deflect every shit tests, an alpha in training will deflect a good half. In my old 10 year LTR, I failed every single one of them. With this other girl, I passed all of them a little too well so she set herself up with a complete lose-lose shit test from her part. If I'd reacted differently and whined about it later, sat there like a good little boy while she played with her ex, I would have devalued myself entirely. I'd have been her beta and certainly shown my own insecurities. LTR potential fucked. 

The way I reacted, I showed I was certainly far from insecure, wasn't about to take her shit, but it cost her! I chatted up the hottest girl that was near me and she was responding well! I put on a good show. There was no touching, unlike what she was doing, but I was making this girl laugh and she was giving me the shine on. I'm lucky that worked if I'm honest! If she'd had knocked me back, I'd have been hung, but luckily she didn't.

It is harder to find men who are ok with you being tall, which is stupid because it's not like you can choose to be short magically.

2. I'll come out at say it, you probably should have started hunting at 22. And I'll tell you why, TRULY GOOD PEOPLE ARE VERY HARD TO COME BY. Oh yeah, you can go out and have a bunch of encounters a la Sex and the City. You can party, you can get drunk and dance the night away. You can do anything you want, but by the time you get out here (30s) age is against you. 

I made that mistake, I had many fun years where it was just me me me. Then by the time I hit 27, I looked around and wondered ""WHERE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SERIOUS."" I kept finding more of the same, people looking for good times. All the good ones were taken because, I'll tell you this right now, a good catch will not stay on the market for long. 

For a moment there, I was seriously worried. I found my catch, but I spent many nights full of regret. If I would have known how hard it was to find a good person, I would have not spent my younger years just messing around. Your mileage my vary. But that was very stupid of me, I was expecting a good catch to fall in my lap simply because I had reached a point where I was all partied out. From 27 to 29 was filled with regret because I was serious and not a person was to be found. 

I did get my break, but it was sheer luck. Something as important as a lifetime partner should NOT be banked on luck. 

Of course, it's not over, you can catch a break. But all I'm saying is most people will kiss a million frogs before they find their prince(ss). That takes time, years even. Its a process that should be knowingly started early, because it's a lengthy one. Even though I got lucky, if I could do it all over again, I would have started seriously looking at 21. Because I have no doubt it would take me at least 5 years to find someone who was a good fit. ",3,t3_25hruc

50 yr old happily married woman weighing in.  I didn't even meet my husband until I was 40.

The only guys who believe in the red pill philosophy are red pillers - i.e. guys you don't want any part of.  YUCK

Now, I will tell you - the philosophy ""   it'll happen when it's supposed to happen...most of the happy couples that I know met naturally, not when they were trying.""  ---- DOes that work for your job?  Say, you want to be a lawyer - 'it'll happen when it's supposed to happen' - does that mean not go to law school?  Not get on the law review?  Not intern at a good law firm?  Not research which type of law you want (family/environment/IP/criminal/etc)?  NO.  You have to prepare yourself.

Now, if you are sitting at home expecting Mr Right to knock on the door and say ""Hello 30yoloser, I'm here to sweep you off your feet"" you are being extremely unrealistic.  

FIRST thing you have to do is learn about yourself.  Who are you?  What are you passionate about?  What makes you sing when you get up in the morning?  Is it advocating for the poor?  or writing that perfect piece of coding?  Or Getting that painting just perfect?  

You have the education and career - now I will say that I am a huge advocate of a relationship being a nice-to-have in life, not a must-have.  Kinda like power windows in a car.  My car runs great and gets me where I'm going without them, but they are nice to have and make life a bit more enjoyable.  

What I did - I did the online dating thing. It's a numbers game.  I would receive about 8 emails to find 1 guy who was worth emailing more (most of them were 1 word emails or someone who had never read my profile).       
It would take about 8 guys worth emailing to find 1 worth moving to a phone call (That's 64 initial emails in case you're counting).      
It would take about 8 good phone conversations to find 1 worth meeting in person (okay, 512 initial emails)      
It would take about 8 first dates to find 1 worth dating seriously who thought I was worth dating seriously (4096 initial emails)

Thats a lot of guys to wade through.  I did the online dating thing for over 10 years.  I had several guys ask me to marry them, only 3 real engagements and of course, my wonderful marriage.

My standards are very high.  According to some of my friends, excessively high.  However, I am now living the life of my dreams and they aren't, so I wouldn't say that my standards are too high.  They were just right for me. I would rather be single than be with the wrong person.

I tried to average 2-3 initial dates (coffee or lunch dates) per week.  Meet in a public place with a place to go after 1 hour and a person to check in with when that hour was up.  If the date is going great - it gives both of you something to look forward to.  If it isn't going well - it gives you an easy out.  If he stands you up, you were getting lunch/coffee anyway, so no loss no foul, and you eliminated another guy who isn't right for you.

I am a little puzzled at your general outlook on all this.  A loving relationship is ""the one thing [you] desperately wanted"", but you consciously decided to take a passive approach?  I find the term ""husband hunting"" really weird, but if you care so much about a relationship, yeah you should probably be trying harder to meet new people.  I suspect if you really analyzed the situation carefully you'd find that the couples you know didn't all just fall into each others' lap.  Maybe they met through mutual friends and didn't have to join a yoga class or something in an attempt to meet new people, but they still had to put some real effort into establishing and maintaining a connection.

That simply isn't a productive philosophy. There is no 'supposed to' in life. You have to take responsibility and face that you might just happen upon someone who you match really well with, but realistically you can improve your chances. I'm not saying you have to resort to behaviour you don't respect, but you can (and perhaps already are?) do a lot to increase your chances of meeting someone you like.

Keep active. Keep fit (or get fit, if you are not). Don't focus too much on not having someone, but make sure you are enjoying your life with or without someone. If you want to meet people, you need to make the effort to put yourself in social situations. Join a social group relevant to what you enjoy. A hiking club? A book club? Whatever you enjoy, there are surely other people out there who enjoy it too, so just make sure you push yourself to join them when possible. If you find that whatever you are doing doesn't satisfy you, then you need the courage to move on. I know that is far easier said than done, but the reality is that life isn't easy. It's hard and it doesn't always work out. You have (probably) just one shot at it though, so if you acknowledge that you have sufficient reason to go out there and do something about it.

By far, most couples I know are relatively the same age (+\- 3 years). By far, most people socialize among their age group because of logistics (if you work you work and meet people at work, if you are a student you meet people at uni) and because of interests. I remember being 23-24 and to me a 30+ man **could** in principle be attractive but he would have to add something extra to the table to make me choose him over someone my own age. By far what I valued as a young adult was being able to share new experiences together. Have my own apartment, go to a music festival, go camping etc. someone who has been there, done that can still enjoy them but cannot really match me. The older they were, the less stuff we had in common and the older they looked (i noticed that my attraction matches the age I am. So at 12 I liked 12 year olds. At 24 I liked 24 year olds. And now I think 24 year olds look like babies and I like people my own age). And I was weary of people who chose me **for** my age. I could sniff that like a bad odour and it turned me off instantly. 

Seriously, go out and just make friends and share hobbies. Meet people as much as possible. 


And for goodness sake do 't call it husband hunting *gag*. Meet people, see if you share values, see if it works out, if not break up. Then think of long term potential.

I don't even regret the best ones I rejected because seeing them with their loved ones is proof that love like that can actually exist. We wouldn't have had that together. They just fit in their lives, even though they have ups and downs. It's amazing.

Guys find tall women intimidating, you might have to be more open and approachable to make up for the social construct that says men have to be the tall one in the relationship.

Even though I'm average height, I've had guys who are ""only"" a few inches taller than me be insecure because they're ""short"" when it's just they're under 6'.

Generally it means someone ""explaining"" stuff to you that you already know, bonus points if it invalidates something you've already just said or was about to say, bonus points if you literally just said the same thing OR the exact opposite and they kept explaining it to you.

Generally used to describe men either ""explaining"", or explaining *away*, the lived experiences of women, and white people explaining away the lived experience of POC (people of colour), etc.

The experience mansplaining describes is 100% not unique to men. Try being a teacher sometime and see how many women (and men) think they know your job better than you do.

Mansplaining is a generally offensive term that somebody came up with because it's catchy and would draw attention to them and their work. It's unnecessarily polarizing, it's an explicit attempt to shut down debate on the basis of the other person's identity and, frankly, it's ugly word to look at. It's also a jump to offense when none is really necessary. People who try to explain something to you, even when they clearly have no idea what they're talking about, isn't intentional disrespect. It's just something that people do when they converse. It's the other person trying to put things in their context so they can understand it.

There something you just have to parse for yourself, but personally I don't think there's anything wrong with being a slut. Most single people go through a slut phase at some point in their lives, and what that could look like will vary. Some folks who go through everything tissue, and others might just have one crazy affair with a FWB situation. Nothing is required, you don't have to go through a sex phase or do anything you don't feel like you need to do. If you only want to be in committed relationships to have sex, then so be it. Personally though, I'm a big fan of not having any regrets. Ask yourself if you don't act on these feelings, will you regret not having the experience/s. Life is short, and we shouldn't necessarily worry about other people's judgments. people are going to make judgments about you whether you do things or not do things. But you know yourself best.

20140514003133,AppleSpicer,"Write whore and slut on toilet paper. Wipe your ass with it. Now flush it down the toilet. 

Modern shaming of women for their sexuality in part comes from the age old Puritan norms of controlling women's sexuality for the purpose of ensuring that acts of reproduction were done within marriage so children wouldn't end up being fostered by the local community. This dates back hundreds of years to when contraception wasn't as reliable. Societies used this in order to enforce accountability and family structure as well as a mechanism to use women as property. 

These words are sexist and support sexist institutions when women were treated as cattle. We are sexual human beings. At times equally as horny and sexual, at others even more so, than men. It is perfectly normal for you to love sex and want sex and you're not wrong for doing so. 

Let me tell you a story of my personal journey in all this. I *loved* masturbating as a little girl. I'd do it 3-4 times a day until I moved into a college dorm with 2 other roommates (oh how I suffered!). I started before I really knew what I was doing and gradually felt more and more guilty because of it. I had heard that it was wrong and a sin. I couldn't help it and did it anyway but felt shittier and shittier. I felt like a bad person. We women are told that we shouldn't feel this way and if you do you're weird and wrong. We're told to feel guilty and discouraged from exploring what feels good for us. Instead we're told that boys are the ones who should feel good. Boys are encouraged to explore their sexuality. This is sexism. 

It took me years to realize this and accept it, and it may take you time as well. You aren't alone. Many women say they don't experience orgasm until 20s or 30s simply because they felt too guilty to explore their sexuality. Men on the other hand are encouraged to explore themselves and statistically reach orgasm at a much younger age despite experiencing puberty at a later time than women. 

Once I moved out of my parents' house I was free of a lot of the Conservative notions I was raised with. I was more free to accept and explore myself in college and it was a wonderful experience. I don't feel regret or dirty. I'm very happy with my sexuality and don't feel obligated to follow some age old sexist custom. You need to decide for yourself what you want and try to separate your bedroom activities from all the many voices who are going to tell you what's right and wrong. 

You're never going to be good enough for those voices. ""Too slutty, too girly, too weak, not pretty enough, too prude, too simple, too crazy, too fat, too skinny....."" We're bombarded with this shit and it's important to build a wall between the way you see yourself and the way others would like you to see yourself. 

Judge yourself by your own standards, not by someone else's. If you love sex and exploring your sexuality then hold that dear to your heart and don't let the shit get through your impenetrable force field. ",2,t3_25iahf

20140513232119,gingerchew,"Where do you think your guilt comes from? (e.g., Are you currently or were you ever part of a religion that preached sex as a sin? How did your parents talk with you about sex?) I think knowing that might be helpful for processing and dealing with your guilt. 

As far as ""having fun"" goes: never have sex because you feel like you should; have sex because you want to.

You sound like you probably shouldn't be ""sleeping around"" in the way that you're imagining it, at least until you come to some peace with your guilt. 

Sex itself is not a moral act. It's how you treat others and how they treat you before, during, and afterward that makes it either moral or immoral. Try to figure out what moral sex means for you (and not your parents, etc.), and then do that. 

Personally, I've slept around quite a bit, and done some pretty kinky stuff, mostly with friends who I still talk to. The only negative sexual experiences I've had have been with people I didn't know well, so after learning the hard way a couple times, I don't do that anymore.

Also, if you're in college, your school probably has a counseling center or something that can help you figure some of this out. If you're still having serious guilt issues related to sex after reading my awesome advice, you should probably go talk to them. ",1,t3_25iahf
20140513233724,bluephilosophy,"No, my background is sound. I was raised a christian but never had religion enforced. I stopped going to church around middle school because I didn't think it was for me. Sex isn't talked about in my family, but we're a pretty quiet family to begin with. I think the guilt of feeling emotionally connected to other people sprung from my past relationships... Both boyfriends were extremely possessive and neither liked to hear when I hang out with anyone besides themselves. They were both controlling and jealous. I knew they were bad for me, which is why I left both of them. Now I don't plan on having another SO until I know them intimately on a platonic level (not sure if that juxtaposition made sense...).

I agree with you that I'm not spiritually well. I have confidence and trust issues. I don't like making ""best friends"" because of the pressure I feel in emotional responsibilities. I want to love people equally, and to make promises to treat this person more special (platonic or not) is just too much work. I don't like being asked to ignore one set of friends for another. I haven't taken the time to think about why I'm always upset in a relationship until recently so I'm only just starting to make sense of a lifelong dilemma.

I just want to have a great time at a party or having sex. I don't want someone to feel jealous because they thought they had a special thing with me but now I'm having that special thing with someone else.

As for long term effects, there is a risk of blood clots, but it's very very small. However, if you're a smoker or you're over 35 or obese or have high blood pressure or a combination of those, your doctor may not be willing to prescribe birth control because while the risk is still low, it's significantly elevated. There's also a very very small risk of gallbladder disease and an increased risk of breast cancer with combination pills. At the same time, there's a decreased risk of ovarian cancer, which is more deadly for most women, so it's a bit of a pick your poison kind of thing.

First of all don't be afraid to tell the doctor that you are nervous about being uncomfortable during you're Pap smear. That should ensure they take their time and slowly explain the procedure and personally, I think knowing everything that's going on will put you at ease from the beginning. 

That should help with your nerves right out the gate.

The speculum is really made out to be a scary metal torture device. It's not THAT big. It's helping your doctor get a clear view of all your lady parts. Sure they are chilly and are not made of a tempur pedic mattress foam but if you flinch or clench that's more apt to cause you discomfort then the device itself. 

Also, they aren't scraping plaque off your teeth during a Pap smear. It's more like swabbing the inside of your cheek with a cotton swab. But instead of a cotton swab they use something better shaped for the inside of your vagina. It's quick and as long as you relax and remember it's once a year and for your health and well- being I'm sure you won't ever hate it as much as the dentist. Also you seem like you might prefer a women doctor. 

But regardless of preference always be open about your concerns and a good doctor will not only address them they will do everything they can to put you at ease.

Maybe consider getting a OBGYN recommendation directly from a friend. Ask what they like about their doctor, are they friendly? Easy to talk to? And super gentle with your friend's lady business?

(In the UK, so different school system) when I was 10 I moved to a completely different town over 150 miles away from where I lived previously. A lot of the people at the new place were hostile precisely because I wasn't ""one of them"" but I made one of my best friends on the first or second day at the new school. During (our version of) high school I was getting completely sick of the group she was hanging out with. They were never as nasty to me as these people are to you, but they really weren't very nice/friendly people at all, especially since I was one of the kids the school dickheads didn't like. I eventually drifted off and started hanging out with other people or just in the library on my own in lunch breaks, but met up with my best friend after school/at weekends. She's still one of my best friends today.

What I'm basically trying to say is it's not worth hanging out with a bunch of people you don't like and damaging your self-esteem in the process, for the sake of seeing one or two people who - being friends - shouldn't mind making time to see you if you're happier and healthier being away from the other people.",1,t3_25if8w

Any ""menstrual period"" that occur  while on hormonal birth control is not real in a sense that is not occur by normal endocrinological function. If you have problem with your ""periods"" while you having a hormonal implant, your implant is the problem. Since you have it for a whole without problem, my guess is the implant  is wearing out and doesn't release enough hormones anymore.

> Come on Clare, really? There were hundreds of girls at prom. Do you really think that all the chaperone dads were just staring at you?  

gives me a really uncomfortable vibe. Is she saying the girl shouldn't feel uncomfortable, because the dads were probably staring at all the girls? It's pretty unfair to expect a seventeen-year-old *not* to feel uncomfortable when adult men stare at her. They've been taught their whole lives, up to that point, that if a strange man is staring at you, you tell a trusted adult because of stranger danger, etc. They're just not used to adult men looking at them in ""that"" way yet, so they get scared.

I saw a picture of this girl and thought, ""She's a stunner.""  But would I think that its her fault I'm thinking that?  No. Anybody who wants to blame a 17 year old for wanting to be as beautiful as possible for her prom while following the dress code is a moron.  Actually, that isn't fair to morons.

It was without a doubt one of the most eclectic groups I'd ever been around when it comes to cultural/moral/ethical lines.

20140514110800,wizardbrigade,"I am one of those people that confuses you. I agree that women in the Middle East are oppressed *by Western standards*, but it is ethnocentric to view Middle Eastern culture by the standards of your own culture. The biggest issue is that women who were born and raised in the Middle East are indoctrinated into those beliefs and that the rest of the world needs to be understanding of that to some degree. I always think of it like this: if I traveled abroad to another country with a completely different culture surrounding gender norms and was told that all women were required to go around topless, I would feel incredibly uncomfortable exposing my boobs the whole time I was on vacation. That's, of course, because I've been conditioned by the society I was raised in to believe that that is inappropriate and that some things just aren't for everyone to see. Really, really think about it: like how would you feel if you were with a bunch of male friends that you had platonic relationships with and you had to go around the whole time with your boobs out. Or if photos somehow ended up on Facebook or something, everyone would see them and know what your private parts look like and you would feel humiliated.  
  
I'm not saying that anyone should be slut-shamed into covering themselves up, I am just saying that what we consider to be areas that are okay for everyone to see is entirely based on the cultural norms that we were raised to accept. For women who have been taught their entire lives that their faces are private parts of their bodies, it's pretty scary to be told that you have to expose your private parts to total strangers. This subject is such a double-edged sword, but for the dignity and the psychological sake of women who have basically been brainwashed into believing that their faces are akin to other sensitive areas of their body in terms of what is appropriate to have out in public, the Western world really needs to try to view the subject with a little bit of cultural relativism.

I think it is important to keep in mind that these opposing cultural standards are always evolving and battling each other. In Iran particularly, western ideas and the people who embraced them were quite literally expelled from the country. 

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Cultural_Revolution) happened about a generation ago(30+ years), yet in general in America we are clueless. You can imagine how many young people there are who may have found western culture appealing if they were allowed to experience it. Relativism is important, but contextualizing culture through the lens of history is even more so. When a group of likeminded people make strict rules and impose them on an entire population, there are almost always negative repercussions for those who disagree. This concept is evident anywhere you look. In America, the war on drugs, the occupy movement, the NSA's recently publicized activity, net neutrality, and the costs of t.v./internet are the quickest things to come to mind that are the result of those in power exercising that power in their own interest. This is what happened at this young girl's prom. This is nothing new, it is as it has been since people first started forming collective groups. 

I would be interested to hear how other groups or cultures feel oppressed by ""the man"".

This is about equality.  women are forced to cover parts of their bodies which men do not have to cover.  Women cant do things not because they are wrong, but because men have said that they cannot.  Case in point, most things women are forbidden to do, are the ones men can do easily.  If it was about not showing your private parts, the conversation would be about covering up all these topless sluts and douchebag guys walking the street swinging their dicks in everyones faces.

We should focus on the true problems these women face: violence, lack of access to birth control and education, the subjugation they face. We should be helping them, not looking down upon them and focusing on something that is relatively minor (clothing) when there's a bigger picture.

And I think we should be critical of that approach.

Think about the Western world. Slut shaming is still a big part of our culture due to Judeo-Christian theology that women have to be virgins when they get married. It's extremely engrained in our society. When I first saw a feminist slut pride march on the news, I was appalled. Being a slut was just *wrong*. There didn't have to be  reason. But as the years went on I realized how problematic that way of thinking was. To say that a woman has to not have sex so she's ready for her man is beyond sexist. 

I don't really blame any woman who thinks she has to be a virgin until marriage since it's so engrained. But it's still something that's very clearly wrong. And it's something many of us have fought against. Just because it is  part of our culture doesn't mean it should be part of our culture.

Back to the Middle East, I understand women there are raised that way and I don't think any less of any woman because she wears a burqa. But forcing a woman to cover herself is based on the flawed and sexist logic that women have to cover themselves so they don't ""compromise"" men. It's based on the idea that men should control what we do with our bodies. 

So again, just because it's engrained doesn't mean we shouldn't criticize it.

>Anderson says that for serial abandoners, “Creating devastation is their way of demonstrating power.”

This is such a twisted way to look at things, it made my stomach turn. Cutting off contact isn't about 'creating devastation', or 'demonstrating power'. It isn't about the other person, it's about doing what is best for yourself.

After I broke up with my ex, I wanted to remain friends but I thought it would be healthy to break contact for a while first. When we discussed things like when to pick up each other's things, I was emotionally distant, and this made him very angry. He said it was ""barbaric"", that I was being ""hateful"", and that he wasn't sure he'd want to be friends at all if I didn't start talking to him again. Of course, that just proved that he needed some more time apart from me, and eventually he realised he'd been acting like an asshole and apologised.

I'm only partly joking when I say that television shows like *Friends* and later notions like ""friendzoning"" had a lot to do with constructing a reality in which both men and women can insist that it is healthier to remain in contact, even if one person has very good reasons for not wanting to remain in contact.  

It is of course great if people *can* remain friends, but it certainly is up to each individual to decide.  Friendships can't be unilateral.

20140514183859,LePew_was_a_creep,">I’m not talking about distancing ourselves from those we casually date or asking for space after a breakup or simply choosing not to be friends with our exes. ***I’m talking about breaking off all contact with the most intimate person in our lives*** without civility — refusing to answer the phone, reply to emails, or acknowledge any aspect of their communication or needs — often without explanation.

[bolded for emphasis]

>Our relationship lasted four months.

Ok bro. 

> Following our breakup, she continued to say she wanted to be friends. At the last minute, she canceled our first night out as friends and tearfully said she needed a week of space. I left the ball in her court and didn’t hear back from her. She completely withdrew. It was a very painful time for me, and she later acknowledged that it was for her as well.

>After nearly a year of silence, I reached out to her and we began a series of conversations toward repairing our friendship. She said she had recently begun dating someone new and I think it was difficult for her to talk to me about our relationship. Her response was to withdraw again. There were misunderstandings and miscommunication.

There was no miscommunication. She didn't want to stay friends with an ex while dating somebody new. That's totally normal and OK. Lots of people do that. Frankly she doesn't need a reason beyond ""I don't want to"" but seriously? How socially dense are you? If there were misunderstandings it's because the author has the social capacity of a slug.

>She stopped responding to my email and when I called to inquire she blocked my number and emailed me to stop contacting her. Over a space of nine months, I wrote her two kind emails in the spirit of healing. Finally, she replied, “I do not want to see or hear from you ever again” and threatened to file an anti-harassment order against me. The open, thoughtful, communicative Emma I knew had vanished.

Spirit of healing for who? Him or her? She clearly moved on. The Emma he knew had vanished because she never existed in the first place. This dude spent two years pining after an ex. That's so much longer than the time they spend dating. He built an idea up of her in his head, creating a fantasy and couldn't deal with the fact that the real women he was putting that on didn't want to deal with him anymore. 

>In fact, to this day, I have only guesses to make sense of her hostility to me.

HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU DID NOT LEAVE HER ALONE WHEN SHE CLEARLY DID NOT WANT TO TALK TO YOU?

>I was raised by an abusive, likely bipolar mother. She physically abused me from age seven to fourteen. After she’d hit me, I would often sit alone in my room in complete disbelief that this was continuing to happen to me while adults who knew, such as my father and uncle, chose not to intervene.

>My mom regularly oscillated between loving and abusive behavior toward me but it took me nearly a year to realize exactly how Emma’s reversal had brought up my feelings of past trauma. After all she’d said about remaining friends, Emma’s withdrawal so shocked me that it reactivated my earlier experience of disbelief and suffering in isolation, essentially triggering episodes of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).


How unbelievable unfair that statement is, not wanting to stay friends after a breakup and directly comparing it to your emotionally and physically abusive mother. Clearly that gave him attachment issues he needs to work out in therapy, not by demanding his ex pay attention to him. 

>Emma’s last note included the phrase, “Apparently, what I want seems irrelevant to you.” She didn’t realize the irony that what I wanted had long been irrelevant to her. 

Seriously? Seriously? You can't always get what you want in life. The person with more restrictive boundaries sets the rules because not wanting contact and being forced into or having your boundaries broken down is more upsetting then having someone refuse to expand their boundaries to fit where you want them to be. He's just so self obsessed. No wonder she went NC.

>I believe that most domestic violence is the result of men with trauma histories reacting to powerlessness in response to experiences with their ex, friends, or family. Certainly men are responsible for finding nonviolent ways to respond to feeling powerless, but culturally we need to understand the dynamics driving these kinds of situations if we’re to reduce them.

So he's saying it takes two to start a fight. Seriously? That's really telling about him as a person. That's so fucked up. 

[People should have a view more like Patrick Stewart. He witnessed DV firsthand as a kid and you can tell watching him it's still distressing people told his mom it takes two to start a fight when she did nothing to provoke his father.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqFaiVNuy1k)

>Trauma specialist Hala Khouri says, “If it’s hysterical, it’s often historical.” I view Emma’s threat of a court order in response to my letter in this light. Those with trauma in their background often can’t discern between the person triggering them and the original source of trauma. When difficult emotions arise, they may feel real feelings of threat and anxiety. Their brain may shift toward fight-or-flight mode. Cutoff can be a flight response that helps keep difficult emotions at bay.

So he admits to having trauma as a child, and Emma cutting off triggering that trauma, then goes on to imply she's the hysterical one because of past abuse. He's so dense. I can't even.

>Women want us to be passionate, masculine lovers, yet we’re expected to turn off our emotions and let go the moment we’re dumped. 

Uh, you are in regards of how you are emoting towards her in her presence. You can emote all you want with your friends but she's broken up with you. She no longer owes you anything emotionally. She can go NC if it helps her because she's no longer caring for you as part of the relationship unit. There's a reason men have funny crazy ex stories and women don't tend to. Because women's crazy exes tend to be violent enough to land them in jail after stalking, harming or killing them. Sure some women get violent when broken up with, but it's not on the same scale as with men.

>Some time after her final email, a date took me to a restaurant in which Emma happened to be waitressing.

>She grimaced when she saw me. Her expression seemed mixed with frustration and anger. She walked by our table about two dozen times without ever making eye contact. For nearly a year, I’d had only a couple of short email sentences saying she wanted no further contact with me. It was quite powerful to see emotion in her. Until that night, I didn’t realize how angry she is at me—but in person, it was obvious.

Going by someone's work place when they've asked you not to talk to them makes them angry. Your failure to grasp basic social realities is not a sign of her poor character but it says a lot about yours.

>When we don’t tell people why we’re angry at them, we’re also robbing them of a chance to apologize and make amends. I would like nothing better than to understand how I’ve hurt or upset Emma and to apologize and make repairs.

She's angry at you because you won't leave her alone.

Although it's understandable why a guy would depend solely on his girlfriend for emotional support, it's obviously problematic. That should never fall just on one person.

20140514184802,LePew_was_a_creep,"I think you have to accept after a certain point for many relationships and many kinds of grief there is no such thing as closure. 

People who break up with others were at some point attached, that decreases their likihood of telling you something that is going to be hurtful - the reason they broke up with you. If the ex continues to force contact, that for many (especially women) is as threatening, and someone who's scared isn't going to say something that might make the other party angry. Chasing after closure makes you less likely to get it and risks making the other person afraid for their safety.

Some relationships have no closure. Sometimes people fall out of love, lose their attraction, realize they're no longer a good fit. There's no specific reason they can give you, something you can fix, a penultimate moment or reason that explains the breakdown of the relationship. When the other party has to closure to give you, it's unfair to expect them to invest in you emotionally when they're in the process of detaching. They don't owe you closure, and if they don't give you something you can use as closure you are the one who has to find it for yourself. 

That's where you need to be more open with your friends emotionally and talk to them and see if you can piece together closure for yourself. Or, you can learn to move on and accept that you don't need 'closure' to get over a relationship.

Harassing someone to be your friend when they don't want to be in contact with you in unfair. It's scary or anxiety provoking when you want someone to leave you alone and they keep contacting you insisting you owe them emotional support and you're a nasty person for wanting to live your life free of them. One party is sad and/or angry without contact. The other feels safe and happy and stress free with no contact and becomes unsafe and/or unhappy and/or anxious or depressed with contact. In that case it's easier for the person to learn to stop being sad with no contact than to expect someone forced into contact they don't want to learn to feel safe and stress free with it.

Well, the not wanting to invest emotionally part when they are detaching makes some sense, but I am not so sure about the conclusion they don't owe you closure. 

Push the principle to the extreme. A couple is together and is happy. Then, one of the partners just leaves one day, at least as far as the other partner is concerned. Is that decision necessarily valid? Is closure really not required? 

Does you answer change whether it is the woman or the man who left? Does it change is they are married? Does it change if they have kids? 

I can't see that you are going to argue that it is valid under such circumstances, or there are a lot of dead beat parents who get off the hook because they decided that it was the right thing to do and that would all that would matter. 

And if it is not valid under those circumstances, then ....

20140514234420,LePew_was_a_creep,"If they have kids they have to be civil to one another for their child's sake. But if they are being perfectly civil and they don't have anything to say to you that would give you closure, they don't have to spend hours and hours hashing out why the relationship fell apart until the other party feels they have closure.

They owe basic human decency. Closure isn't part of that. Closure is largely something people find on their own. Maybe knowing the reason can help, but sometimes people get told the reason and it's not enough, they think there must be something more to it. 

>A couple is together and is happy. Then, one of the partners just leaves one day, at least as far as the other partner is concerned.

Obviously one party wasn't happy, which is the biggest problem with this example. One party thought they were and the other wasn't. When both people are happy they don't just split. You can be unhappy because you feel unappreciate, you lost your attraction to that person, you fell out of love, you stopped feeling like you both had the same goals, whatever. But unless one party is moving to for a job or something, parties where both couples are happy don't just break up. And when you're moving for your job and breaking up both parties know why and going NC makes the most sense because both parties are hurt by the split and going NC is ripping the bandaid off instead of slowly peeling it off.

In the ""the couple is happy situation"" without a move? One person thinks it's a happy relationship and the other isn't happy and they've already come to terms with the relationship ending by the time they break it off. They've been unhappy with the relationship for a while, and the other person not seeing it just affirms their choice. People have reasons why they leave a relationship. If that person is unhappy and the other person can't see it, the party who leaves it going to have a hell of a time explaining it sufficiently to give the first closure if the first party thought everything was hunky dorey while the other became unhappy enough to leave. It could be really hard for the unhappy person to try and talk to the previously happy person who still believes the relationship was perfect and *why did you leave*. That they couldn't see the flaws was hurtful, that they insist they weren't there at all even moreso. I could easily understand why the unhappy party would avoid contact to avoid being reminded of how little their partner actually understood them.

It doesn't matter what gender you are. You gain closure on your own. The other person can't give it to you and as long as they weren't a total asshole as they left there's nothing wrong with them going NC as a way of self care for them exiting unless you have a kid together, in which case you need to maintain a civil relationship for your kid's sake. But even then, that doesn't obligate them to go beyond civil for extensive conversations about *why* they left.

And by being a total asshole I mean saying unnecessarily cruel things, spreading lies to all your friends, stealing your stuff, cheating, that sort of thing. NC doesn't fall under that category.

Often conversations about closing are just fronts for trying to get back together, if the other party can find out *why* they can fix it because they still think getting back together is an option. Wanting to avoid that situation is perfectly valid. If you're a guy or a woman if you don't want to hash it out with your ex because you think they're trying to find something to ""fix"" to get back together with you, that's perfectly legit. 

I agree with this piece on closure and staying friends [this piece about why nobody has to stay friends with an ex](http://captainawkward.com/2011/04/18/blanket-statement-monday-you-dont-have-to-be-friends-with-your-ex/)",2,t3_25ivrd

I don't ever second guess that I made the best decision for myself - yet that doesn't take away the 'could have been' or regret that I was in that position in the first place. Something few people seem to get. My experience was pretty traumatic due to outside circumstances - and yet I loved that person that could have been my baby - even though I couldn't keep him/her.
 
Over 5 years later, I have come to realize that the experience has, for better or worse, given me tools in which I now can relate directly to people who are caught in place like I was. I can understand other women better and maybe even offer something to them if needed - be it the choice to keep it or not. It has made me a better listener, a better person in understanding the complexity of life - its now something I chose to draw upon when there is need so that maybe others don't feel as alone as I did. At least that is how I look at it. Doesn't take away the pain, but makes seem less pointless at times.

For practical advice i'd say, if you're meeting someone, meet them an hour early for a drink, if you're not comfortable sitting down with someone casually do not expect to be comfortable sleeping with them, talk, great way to weed out assholes.
During the talk bring up ""sexually liberated"", if he smiles and nods, walk away, if he agrees wholeheartedly, walk away, if he reticules the notion, walk away, if he asks what you meant by that, fuck him.

As a side note, if you need catchphrases like the above to justify your choices you might still have some growing to do before miring into the emotionally swamp that is casual dating.

There are guys out there with all the commitment properties of a towel on a tiled wall but who will still treat you right and respect you in the morning, they are just a tad harder to find than using a ""nearest horny set of balls plz"" app, in life you receive in measures of the effort you put in.     

8 years of age difference is only a problem if he's younger than 26.

Your statement about not wanting a committed relationship and your doubt about him valuing you as anything but a hook up contradict each other, get in touch with him and find out or get over him and move on, any other path leads to sad-panda land.

Don't be too hard on yourself, life is confusing, approach it with an open mind, if only because narrow minds see fewer paths and often miss the one that leads to happiness ,don't be to hard on other people, life is confusing for them too.  ",2,t3_25iu5z

My feelings about the age difference have not changed, in the sense that there is only one way to find out, i can not look into either of your minds to see what's at play here tho ;)
Do realise that like your worldview shifted from when you were 11, so is his different from yours.
Personally i would not know what to do with a 19yo girlfriend, not in the sense that i could not feel affection for the right person at a certain age,
Just that the process of growth and discovery you're going through right now, while wonderfull in it's own right, can also weigh on a relationship should either partner not be up to bridging that gap.
Alot in relationships is seeing it from eachothers perspective in order to avoid or understand conflicts, not every 27yo will still know and be understanding of how a 19yo mind works, not every 19yo will have understanding or patience with how a 27yo mind resolved to look at things.

But like i said, case by case basis, just don't take it personally or to hard should it turn out different.

The longing you describe is just a part of human nature, i'm a fairly solitude person but even i would go insane if i could not share what's on my mind with friends/family/loved ones.

20140514034008,Shinji-Nokoroto,"I personally think that the ""void"" you're talking about is quite obviously the older man you met before and ""hooked up"" with. I assume hooking up with means you had sex, and those were most likely the best memories you've had with a man. Try to create memories that are unrelated to sex, go out, even with friends that are male. Open yourself up to opportunities that don't mean you have to sexually please someone or yourself to feel wanted.

That aside, you wanting to feel some love in the form of sex is not unusual and does not make you a slut. You are expressing your loneliness and need for interaction. Just try to take it slower with male friends, or new boyfriends. That way the void will be less of a gap between this older guy and sex - and more about nostalgia of moments past.

These apps like tinder are there mostly for doing what you have done (not in all cases). Take the time to go out with these college friends to places you enjoy. Hopefully through this you can pick up the confidence to find new guys to spend time with and hopefully this leads to fulfilling that feeling. It's hard, but if you can't enjoy being with yourself first, then how can you expect others to. You have more to offer than your sex skills. Save them for someone who cares.",1,t3_25iu5z

It was a late night rant, and I was left with a subjective opinion of him being an asshole, and definitely not the type of guy I'd go for in almost any other situation. If you want other information, I guess I should've listened to my intuition when he texted me (as we were planning to hang out): ""This better be worth it"". I replied, ""And what if it's not?"" and he said, ""Then I'd waste a ton of gas"". I was like, ""well if you think you'd waste a ton of gas/want more than to hook up and smoke weed then maybe you should play it safe and not come"". He ended up coming, obviously but when we were fooling around, he asked for head which I did, because I do like it/the response it gets but he started pushing my head faster even though I was gagging and it was clearly uncomfortable for me. He came after like 45 seconds and went to put another condom on because I guess he was embarrassed for finishing early but then he said, ""I can't get hard with a condom on"" and implied sex without condoms. At that point I was like noooooooo way. But I don't know, those things to me make me think someone is kind of an ass but if you don't think so, that's okay too. I just didn't particularly enjoy it

I say he's sleazy, because even in conversation and etc I realized afterwards he, and his personality, was just like the type of guy that I would avoid in general--sleazy and looking for cheap fucks. I'm not saying I'm above that, clearly I was just looking to hook up too, but I guess I expected better behavior/more intelligence from guys in general. Which is my fault too. 

But you're right, I think because of my previous mostly positive experiences with hook ups (all of them were with older guys who were more my type) I expected this to be a positive experience and the lousy sex was definitely something I didn't think would happen. At the same time, I don't think lousy sex is the end of the world. I realized something bigger was happening here, the fact that I did this signaled to me that I was at a pretty low point in how I was feeling, so no I'm not whining about some lousy sex.

Editing to add in the quote (wikibot has abandoned me </3)

>In ""A Defense of Abortion"", Thomson grants for the sake of argument that the fetus has a right to life, but defends the permissibility of abortion by appeal to a thought experiment:

>>You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. [If he is unplugged from you now, he will die; but] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.

>Thomson takes it that you may now permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will cause his death: the right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so by unplugging the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something—the use of your body—to which he has no right.

2. Civility is good.

3. Abortion is such a weighted issue. Generally when we think of women going for abortions we imagine accidents (through missed or inactive pills, faulty birth control) or recklessness, but it's a much wider issue. 

As many have already pointed out, not every pregnancy is a result of a woman choosing to have sex - rape is a good instance. 

Second, abortion and the right to an abortion doesn't just cover feasible feotuses - removing the right to abortion also affects women who require a non-feasible feotus to be removed, such as in the cases of incredible disformity which mean it would not survive outside of the uterus, or even dead feotuses. Take [this case](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741) as an example, which ultimately lead to the mother's death. The right to abort a child legally saves lives. 

Third, abortions will happen [anyway](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/magnitude/en/) regardless of the legality of the practice. Isn't it better to safeguard women who for whatever reason do not want a child, and protect their lives?

But personally I agree with many of the sentiments offered already, that if I take reasonable precautions I have already chosen to not have a child as a result of sex, so your argument is moot. However, that does not mean that if I became pregnant I would choose an abortion - I would weigh up that decision if it arose, and I don't believe in forcing my opinion on others and wouldn't judge others (regardless of my personal beliefs) if they chose an abortion or to give the child up for adoption or raise it themselves.

When the driver of a car hits another person and causes them significant injury, that person is often in need of a blood transfusion. However, we do not legally mandate that people responsible for these injuries by donating blood. This would be a far safer, far less intrusive consequence to reckless behavior, and might significantly improve the safety of our roads. Drivers would need to take responsibility for the possible outcome of getting behind a wheel.

We could also mandate that people register and be prepared to donate bone marrow. This could save a whole lot of lives. This could restore the potential of a whole lot of people who would die otherwise.

It's far worse to subject a kid to parents that don't want it and never did than it is to prevent it ever entering that environment. Sure, adoption's an option, but adoptive parents (as a general rule) want healthy white babies, and what if you're a minority? Your baby will go into the foster care system, which is awful and overcrowded, and they will again likely grow up in a bad home situation.

By saying you're pro life, you're essentially saying the only options are raise a kid you didn't want, or put it up for adoption, and there's no guarantee the kid will get adopted, especially if it's neither healthy nor white. You're saying you want every woman who gets pregnant should carry it to term, even if it might kill her, or if the baby will die within days of birth. Even if the child will outlive their parents, but remain needy and dependent until it dies.

20140514163630,box-of-stars,"Think of it this way. You leave a window unlocked in your house while you are out running errands. You come home and an animal has used the unlocked window to break in, and has taken up residence inside your home. The government tells you that you must take care of this animal for 9 months, and you cannot free it into the wild because it would surely die. At the end of 9 months, you then have the choice to take it to an overcrowded shelter, or keep it for the rest of its life. You don't have savings tucked away to care for this animal - a very expensive animal to take care of - and you've heard the government has ways to help you out, but you are largely on your own to take care of the animal.

Now you may argue that the rules should be different because a fetus is a human being. But many, many people do everything they can to prevent this fetus from coming about, yet accidents still happen. And because an accident happens, should this person be forced into the above situation? Don't you think that's taking away some rights of the person who tried the hardest they can, given our current contraceptive technology, to prevent the accident? Unless you subscribe to the idea of abstinence, but why should everyone subscribe to the same sexual philosophy?

We describe this country as the ""land of the free,"" but there are many people trying to tell us how to behave in the bedroom and then punish people when they don't act accordingly and an accident happens as a result. These are responsible people trying their hardest to be safe in the bedroom and live as they'd like to live. I don't think an accident should take away a person's rights, at least until the fetus could survive outside the womb. At that point the parent has had many weeks to mull it over and decide they do in fact want the child. If you're that person staring anxiously at the pregnancy test in the bathroom, do you want a choice if a + result appears?",23,t3_25jybv

I personally think removing the ability to have a choice takes away important rights of the parent. Surely one day we will have a 100% foolproof way to prevent pregnancy, but until that time are we to force people to take care of a child they didn't want to have, and a lot of the times are unable to adequately provide for?

As a pro-choicer I do not justify murder on all accounts, for example I am strongly against capital punishment. I think a person who can survive on their own, meaning not in the womb, should have the right to stay alive no matter what they are accused of. But if a person is physically dependent on another person to survive, and is physically inside of someone, that parent should have de facto ""power of attorney"" to decide the fetus's fate.

It's also a convenient time to think the decision over. When we place arbitrary early deadlines on abortion we force women to decide quickly to just terminate the pregnancy instead of being stuck with it.

Do you really think pregnancy is just an inconvenience? Have you ever met a woman with a difficult pregnancy? Pregnancy can and often does do permanent damage to your body. It can induce diabetes, tear your abdominal muscles, and even kill you if you have an existing health conditions. 

Even if it's healthy, it often leaves you nauseous, causes your limbs to swell, requires you to take off work; plus, at the end, you can look forward to probably several hours of agony while your vagina is literally ripped open or you abdomen is sliced open, your organs removed (temporarily put on the table beside you, that is), and a baby cut out of your uterus.

It's much more than inconvenient.

And some women ignore other women, too (there are some egregious examples where I work).  A younger woman can say something and two minutes later, several people will ask a question that shows they didn't listen.  If an older woman or any man repeats it, they suddenly hear it.

Oh, and in years of observing television-watching behavior at work, among students, in bars, in homes, I've noticed that men will frequently turn the channel when the dialogue is between two women.  They'll watch if it's man-to-man or woman-to-man (man-to-man is what men prefer, though - and I actually got to do some rather extensive research on that at one point; no way to randomly choose homes for observation, but I did get inside a wide variety of households for observation).

Apparently two males can easily break through this barrier.

Certain aggressive people try to dominate any group they're in, especially if there is no one to challenge them.

Passive people often defer to these so called 'leaders' instinctively without realizing it as well, because they seem, and act in charge.

Although it sounds like there could be more going on than what you describe, of people listening and deferring to this person, if you're talking about sexual harassment charges.

Nope. Hormones effects fat distribution (what you are thinking of) and muscle growth and retention. Muscles need testosterone to maintain and grow. Mtf transitions typically include taking an anti androgyn that blocks the production of testosterone thereby decreasing muscle gains and making it harder than to grow and gain than a cis woman.

The first time it happened, it was while moving a washing machine.  I used to be able to, if it was on a hand truck, get it up a flight of stairs by pulling it up one step at a time.  It was gruelingly hard, but doable.  I went to do that same thing about 9 months into transition, and I could *not* get it up even one step.  I nearly pulled something trying, but it just wasn't happening.

The second time was very recent.  The place I am staying has its own well for water, but currently it's not working due to a whole bunch of stupid reasons I won't get into.  Well, needless to say, not having running water freaking sucks.  I was trying to fix it while my boyfriend was at work, but when it came time to unscrew the big plug on top so that I could fill the pump with water and prime it, I could *not* get the thing to turn.  Not one turn.  I was putting every ounce of weight and ""ooomf"" into it that I could muster, but I might as well have been pushing against a brick wall.

I am really sorry I did that, because I'm in constant pain now.  

But, when I was young, I tackled everything - for me, it's getting older that's hard to accept.  My strength is definitely way less than it was (obviously, now with the spine injury - which I made worse by refusing to stop lifting/doing certain things), and men my age have no such problems.

what i **have** come to realize, though, is that cis-males are a lot stronger than i previously thought. i was once play-fighting with my ex, and at one point he had me pinned down and no matter how hard i tried, *i just couldn't get him off me*, or move, for that matter.

This actually scares me.  I really feel vulnerable now, like if some guy wants to mess with me it feels like my ability to stop him is minimal, at best.

This is a reason why some women literally get larger, as well.  Sexual abuse victims often bulk up, weight-wise, often without any conscious desire to do so, because it is indeed harder to tackle/carry off a bigger woman.

Big dogs, medium-sized protective dogs, pepper spray, martial arts...all things that women use to keep the creeps away.  And once you've been assaulted, it's hard not to want to think of a way to prevent it or to, even unconsciously, do something to prevent it.

20140515145330,27thproblem,"As a chick working in a male dominated industry-- that whole men ignoring you or just humoring you when you're talking-- *that*.

I find that once I get to know the guy in question, that dies away. But when you're working with a guy you just met? SO frustrating sometimes.

My all-time most ridiculous example:

As a telecom technician I spent like five hours one day helping some HVAC contractors hook up the HVAC control system in a new building. At that time, I was the go-to person in my office for dealing with HVAC controllers-- I had memorized the three controller models that most of our buildings had and I had gone to the trouble of downloading and *actually reading* the manuals for each of these controllers. I knew those fuckers back to front and I'd helped contractors from the same company install them in half a dozen other buildings.

But on this one fucking day it so happened that the owner of the contracting company was at the site, personally overseeing the installation of the new HVAC stuff.

Somewhere along the way, we hit a snag. Its been too long now, I can't remember exactly what the issue was, but I know I spent about two hours trying to explain to the contractor-owner-guy over, and over, and over, and over again that I could see perfectly clearly where the snag was, but I couldn't fix it because it was an issue with the controller software and that's not my job (as a technician of any kind, you're taking a big risk by attempting to fix something that its not your job to fix-- even if you *know* exactly what is wrong and could/would have easily fixed it if it were only within your purview).

I tried to walk his technicians through it but they *really* didn't understand the software (in their defense, software written for things like utility controllers is generally difficult and obnoxious) (*not* in their defense-- it seemed like every time I worked with this company, they had a new tech and none of their techs *ever* had a clue how these controllers were supposed to work even though supposedly installing and fixing these things is basically what they do all day)... And, to be honest, I think having the owner-guy on the site was making his techs extra nervous-- I actually felt bad for them.

*Anyway*... Eventually the whole thing boiled down to me using my cell phone, my fluke and my laptop in an attempt to demonstrate to owner-guy what the fuck was wrong. (I mean... it was seriously ridiculous... I was using my phone as a remote terminal to demonstrate why connections outside the local network weren't getting through-- and this was at a time when I was still the only person I knew who actually used the terminal on their cell phone-- I guess I kinda feel like, on the basis of that alone, owner-guy should have just been like, 'oh, okay, i see that you know way more than i do about this stuff. i will just calmly accept this and take your advice now'.)

Finally it was getting dangerously close to quitting time for me and I didn't get overtime and I had no desire to just chill with this asshole out of the goodness of my heart-- so I called up one of the other techs in the office (they were all guys at the time) and had this conversation (out of owner-guy's hearing range):

me: hey, i've been stuck in this building working on this stupid issue for five hours but this guy won't listen to me or let me leave until its fixed-- and i can't fix it because xyz. BUT i have a hunch that maybe if you just come over here and repeat to him everything i've been saying for the last two hours, he'll like it better since you're a dude.

other_tech: sure. just tell me exactly what you want me to say.

me: just explain to him that xyzishblahblah is the problem.

other_tech: cool. be there in 10.

And, as you've surely guessed by now, the other tech came over, spent fifteen minutes saying exactly what I'd told him to say, and what do you know? Owner-guy makes no more arguments, just accepts it, thanks us, and we go back to our office.

Le sigh.

> *he could be back in his home country* 

If you *do* get a permanent restraining order, you may wish to contact Department of Homeland Security to try to get him added to the list of people barred from the US. Including copies of arrest reports and court cases (the other women's as well as yours) will greatly increase the chance that he can never come back to the US to harass you or any other woman.

Sounds like New York state to me.

If the goal is to change toys so girls can tell a different story, to encourage them to change the way they think about themselves, value doing things instead of looking pretty, then changing the themeing of 'dress-up' toys from Barbie to superheros isn't going to change anything.

20140514135526,teslabox,"The scariest birth control myth I read regularly is the persistent idea that birth control is made with Progesterone. Your Huffington Post piece correctly uses the term 'progestin' for the not-exactly-progesterone that is used in 'hormonal' preparations, but I think a lot of doctors confuse their patients by calling the chemicals in the various formulas 'Progesterone'. 

This myth causes much confusion about the difference between natural hormones and hormonal drugs (manmade chemicals that influence the hormone system). [Real Progesterone USP protects against traumatic brain injury](http://protectiii.com/), while [fake-progesterone/Provera/medroxyprogesterone-acetate causes strokes](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/257k1d/birth_control_and_you_what_you_need_to_know_but/cheng50) (this 2xc poster's mini-stroke was within a week of her depot-provera injection).

Another myth that I constantly run across is that birth control ""regulates"" the menstrual cycle. It is more proper to say that combined pills work by suppressing the glands in the brain that drive the cycle. But ""regulate"" sounds nice and sells well, so that's the term that gets used. 

This myth about 'regulation' is particularly tragic, because most young women's menstrual difficulties would respond nicely to an intervention based on physiology (progesterone USP supplementation to treat anovulatory cycles/'luteal phase defect'), rather than pharmacology (birth control until menopause). I am specifically thinking of a woman I met whose doctor started her on birth control when she was 12 years old. Now, at 24, she is on a ""4 'periods' a year"" product, which is better than regular birth control because she's only disabled for a week-every-three-months instead of a week-a-month. I asked ""what was going on in your life when you were 12?"" - her big drama then was an emotionally-abusive step father. Stress is a potent hormone disruptor that cannot be addressed with a pill.

You asked, hope this helps.

Other women don't like the idea of anything 'manmade', and that's okay too.

I also completely agree with you - it's important to address a woman's entire situation, not just one body part.  

It's hard to draw conclusions from just one study, so here's a meta-analysis of 8 studies look at the risk of the thromboembolic risk in women using progestin-only contraception, if you're interested!

Get into a good college, preferably a state university with in-state tuition.  

I had a wonderful grandmother I could move in with.  Most people don't have that.  I lived with her a few years before I was able to move away to college.  

Make female friends.  The one thing I wish I had been able to do is join a sorority.  I didn't have any good girlfriends.  My mother really soured me on women in general.  I really should have joined a sorority just to have that family of women who welcomed me and helped me with the things I didn't know.  The friends I did have --- were more interested in going out drinking and clubbing and having sex with male strippers and getting fake ids and had no interest in the future.   Some sorority girls can be that way, but most aren't. 

I love using tampons!  My mother always told me that only sluts use tampons.  No, women who don't want to ruin their clothing wear tampons.  Change them every single time you go pee.  Every. Single. Time.

COunseling.  Counseling really helps.  In college, you get something like 10 free sessions each term.  Use them.  IF you aren't in school, check out your local college with a psychology dept.  The students do counseling on a sliding scale starting at around 5/hr.  

It helps.  I ended up with wrecked self-esteem, which meant I fell in love with a man who treated me very slightly better than my parents in the beginning and worse in the end.   counseling would have helped me avoid that mistake.  

I did lots of counseling after I got divorced.  And I am now married to the most amazingly incredible man in the whole wide world!!   Or should I say, the most amazingly incredible man for me.  He wouldn't be right for most people, but he's perfect for me.

(((hugs)))

And there's the standard drill ----

Hit the gym - get those endorphins flowing!!  

LEarn something new - take up guitar, learn to kayak, travel to a foreign country!

volunteer - make the world a better place!

These are ways to keep growing and learning and making a difference in the world around you.  It never stops!  I'm 50 and I'm still doing all of these daily!

20140514101026,TicklesMcgillicudy,"Let me start things off: 

Im BRAND NEW to reddit. I am interested in it as a platform for feminism. Lately there's been a lot of talk of (enter normal-ass teen girl activity/adjective here)-""shaming"". In particular, ""slut-shaming"" and ""fat-shaming"" have been hot topics of late. But what about all the other various and sundry shaming we've been subjected to as young women? If I think about it seriously, I realize that the feeling of shame pervaded a great deal of my daily life growing up, and most of it was about stuff my body was just DOING AS A NATURAL MATTER OF COURSE. Why the fuck was I feeling shame about taking a shit? Or having hair on my legs? Or masturbating??

So let me stop rambling and get to my fucking shame story. Somewhere around the age of 12, I realized that if i touched myself a certain way, an AMAZING thing would happen. My mom had this little vibrating accupressure tool (and yes, I really think she used it for this because she is a serious, old school, east asian immigrant) and I would...well you get the picture. It was FUCKING AWESOME. It felt great and it was also incredibly relaxing and for a high-strung kid like me, it was a total godsend. Then my little sister found out what I was doing and told my mom...which is when I learned what the word ""masturbation"" meant, well, sort of. I was told that what I was doing was disgusting and wrong, and that girls should never, ever masturbate. Being the defiant little shit I was, I basically said fuck the man and kept on doing it. I got ratted out a couple more times but eventually I got too old for my mom to keep having that talk with me. 


Im so glad I didn't let the temporary shame surrounding my first adventures in masturbation to turn me off to it permanently. It was one of the most important things I ever learned to do because I learned to explore my sexuality on my own terms and internalize the fact that I didn't need a man, or any other person for that matter, to experience pleasure. All I needed was something that buzzed a little, and a nice, soft surface upon which to lay (not a fan of the showerhead technique, just doesn't work for me).  I think all young women should be given a vibrator and a basic anatomical diagram from a woman in their life that they trust. 

TL;DR: I was ashamed (for like..a month) about masturbating, but then I got over it and realized how important it was in the development of my sexuality. ",8,t3_25jhs8

Body hair. Like, on my lower back I have super light, very thin, practically invisible little hairs that I was soooo ashamed of for some reason. Same thing on my arms.  I thought I looked like a monkey because women aren't supposed to have any other hair than on their head, right? So as a teen I shaved not only my armpits, vagina and legs but also my back and my arms. 

Also, anything that had to do with periods. I felt embarrased even asking my mom for pads. I panicked at the thought of someone somehow noticing it was the time of the month. I was so anxious about it it was ridiculous. Because my vagina should always be fuckable, right? That is its primary function, is it not? 

Also, of course, poop. Guys can say ""I'm gonna take a shit"" or joke about shit taking, but girls don't poop.

It's really and sad how much of my teen years were spent obsessively  shaving and feeling gross about how my body worked. And silly, and unnessesary, and stupid.

Instead of eating three big meals a day, graze on much smaller meals throughout the day, so that you are not eating a lot at once but also are not letting your stomach get empty. 

Avoid eating fatty foods, spicy foods, and aromatic foods. 

I also found that getting fresh air/avoiding stuffy rooms was helpful.

Drink as much water as you can each day.

Most likely you can't.  Being ""nice"" will only give him the wrong signals.  That doesn't mean you have to be mean either, just be direct.  Tell him you're too busy right now for a new friendship and that you don't think of him in a romantic way, and that you need some space and you think it is better for the two of you to stop talking.  If he asks you to hangout after that, just remind him of what you said before and tell him directly that you don't think it is a good idea.  Be assertive, and don't fool yourself that this can be done without hurting him.  If he has developed feelings for you, it will hurt, there is no way around it.  But it is better to hurt him all at once by telling him the truth, than being too nice and have him interpret as you being a little interested, which will only make him pursue you further, which as a result will make you retract further, and hurt him (and you) more for a longer period of time.",9,t3_25k6sw

First, good for you being responsible and getting tested, its always good to see somebody be safe with their body. However i am sorry that you had such a judgmental nurse. It is not their business to tell you who to have sex with or how many partners you choose to have. Next time i suggest you find a different clinic.

On your relationship

Men can be jealous sometimes, so can women, especially when discussing passed sexual activity with partners. I for example have only been with one women and im marrying her. She however has had more experience with partners. I try not to be jealous but hey, nobody is perfect. She assures me its i. The past and all that and i know she is mine. 
So please if the conversation comes up, and he is jealous dont be upset. It is in our nature to be jealous and depending on the man, possessive on varying levels. We are much more emotional creatures than we like to let on. 
But as i see it the possessive feelings should go both for both parties in the relationship. He will be yours if you will be his

OP, is really not like that.  For someone who has lost almost everything, like it does seem to be the case from your post, it is clear that she is living for them and taking comfort from them.  As an animal lover myself, I can tell you that some people see the separation from pets as losing family members.  Not only that, but they also see themselves as a failure for no longer being able to provide shelter for them.  My advice is that you and your dad (if you are all still on speaking terms), and maybe your siblings too, try figure a way to help her keep the cats.  Involve the family, and ask for help.  Some very decent, not at all that expensive apartments are pet friendly, at least in my area.  Look into it.  I can see how devastating that would be, if I had to give up on my pets in the middle of a divorce! Her whole world just flipped 360 degrees and she feels helpless and hopeless.  Maybe take her for a coffee and go with her trying to find a place for her to live that's affordable and pet friendly?

They get so focused on never leaving the side of the person they're caring for, they stop taking care of themselves and that can be really detrimental to their own health.  

My mom was my dad's caregiver for most of their marriage, as he was very sick.  She was with him until the end, when he passed away from cancer.  We occasionally had to drag her out of the house for some time away, and it made a world of difference for her.  It's not always easy for the caregiver to admit they need a break, but it's HEALTHY for them to get a break.    

Talk to him.  You understand.  You have your own obligations in your kids, and he has his obligations to his mom (which is fantastic - that's *very* hard and what a good guy to do this!!!), but you guys are both people, too.  You exist outside of these obligations.

Figure out a time when you two, and ONLY you two, can get alone time.  Date nights that are more than 2-3 hours.  A long weekend alone.  Whatever works.  Fit it into the schedule and take that time for yourselves.  He needs a break, and you need to have a little more one-on-one time with him.

20140515061548,Guinness2702,"No, not at all.  I'm not just talking about direct encounters, I'm talking about things I've seen written and said in the media, on the 'net, etc.  Indeed, for one of my years at uni, I shared a house with a few lesbian feminists.  Some people would automatically claim that lesbians are amongst the ""worst"" feminists.  Actually I liked them and considered them friends, and am disappointed that we never kept in touch.  We never had any disagreements about feminism.

I don't have a problem with the concept that women have (or should have) exactly the same rights as men, which is what I call feminism.  The issue I have is with people who claim that women have *different* rights, under the banner of feminism.  Whichever gender it favours, and however you justify it, that is discrimination and inequality.  That is just an alien concept to me.  Human rights are universal, and cannot be sub-divided into subsets, whether it's male/female, black/white, or blonde/brunette/ginger/marge simpson.  True feminism is not about *different* rights, it is an acknowledgement that there are times and places where women are denied *equal* rights, and *are* discriminated against, and an expression that this must be redressed.

To talk about ""women's"" rights (or for that matter, ""black"" rights, or ""blonde"" rights, or <category X> rights) is divisive.  People should only ever speak of human rights.  Anybody who makes that distinction clearly has an agenda, otherwise that distinction is redundant.

When I *am* involved in the conversation, or observing someone else's conversation, I find that some people continue to try and make that distinction.  When someone says that gender should not be a factor in making a decision, they start to become very defensive, as if one *should* be discriminating between men and women.  The irony is that whilst I personally do not even take gender (or race, or hair colour) into consideration when considering my position on human rights, there are some people who claim to be feminists, who *insist* on making that distinction, and often they become very defensive when someone refuses to accept that women have *different* rights.  In doing so, they reveal themselves to be prejudiced, and in possession of an agenda .... and those are the people I dislike.

Someone who truly believes that all people are equal should not even be able to comprehend an attempt to make a distinction, on any criteria, as that criteria is entirely redundant and does not affect the decision.

Edit: slight rephrase",2,t3_25jq71
20140515065524,DevilinaBlackDress,"Also, people have a right to get angry and be defensive. Granted it doesn't help men who want to understand more about where women are coming from. Anger about something is what translates into movements and social change. Being polite doesn't get you anywhere. And using a trenchant argument isn't really aggression, it is a political necessity.
",1,t3_25jq71
20140515064448,DevilinaBlackDress,"So ... define then what you mean by ""different"" rights. Do you mean ""different"" as in ""feminists"" argue that women should be afforded special treatment. Or do you mean ""different"" as in, women are different beings and different creatures than therefore must (by definition).  

The thing, you are not taking into account, is people didn't necessarily make these distinctions, history did. The advent of feminism was a historical contingency. Women wanted to participate in the student and civil rights movements of the 1960s and were being marginalised from this movement. I believe that one of the activists at the forefront of the student movement said something like, the only position for women in this movement is ""prone"". Women became upset about this and started to organise their own collectives. Ideologies do not simply spring from people's heads, they arise from social movements. Women (the varied group that we are) did not agree on how to approach the question of gender, and so it gave rise to many different collectives. It used to be the case that women were arguing for ""equality"" with men, but since none of the feminist intellectuals can agree on what ""equality"" means (since we all want different things, as people), the theoretical position has moved on from here, to a more modern sophisticated one, wherein we argue for different but equal. 

It would be nice, in an ideal world, to say that the question of ""rights"" is a simple matter. Btw I used to be a university tutor, and was doing a PhD on gender studies until I quit. And that equality means the same thing for everyone, but it doesn't. Look at the the case of Aboriginal Australia, people say ""Oh, but they have opportunities to be equal now, well why don't they. Why aren't they getting an education and not drinking and taking the opportunities here now to ""become equal"". Well, some Aboriginal people don't want to. They want to keep their traditional practices and fish out in Arnhem land. Becoming ""equal"" according to our Western definition, is to go get a mortgage, a Western education, university and earn a higher income. In what position does this place an Aboriginal person if they don't want to do these things, does that they deserve to live in poverty. 

The same can be said for women. A critical issue is child raising. Women have ""different"" bodies to men. It is a fact of nature. You cannot argue that women are ""different"" to men in this way. In a society structured in a way where certain white men are more privileged, women have to become more like men to ""become equal"". Women have to make a decision, career, child, career, child. I'll just post this now, it's getting too long. But you see my point. Is it really fair that women should have to choose one or the other. Choose child rearing, you inevitably earn less and have less in superannuation. The fact is women ARE different to men (and thats what the feminists are talking about) and questions of equality need to take this into consideration. ",1,t3_25jq71
20140515080733,Guinness2702,"The *principle* of the universality of human rights *is* simple.  The implementation is complex, and fraught with prejudice and imbalance.

Women do not have to make a career/child decision!  *Families* have to make that decision.  Yes, there are imbalances which mean that the only option for many families is for the woman to raise the kids and the man to work.  You would say that those imbalances often denies women the right to choose a career, and you would be correct.  However, I expect that there are many men who would prefer to stay at home and raise the kids.  Those men are affected by the imbalance too.  Those same imbalances also deny men the right to choose raising the kids.  However, I do not protest that this is mistreatment of men, or complain about a lack of ""men's rights,"" although society often does deny men this right, and there is real inequality therein.  I advocate absolute and unequivocal equality of rights.  ~~Women have the right to a career.  Men have a right to a career.  Women have the right to raise their children.  Men have the right to raise their children.~~  A human has the right to a career.  A human has the right to raise their children.  A family has the right to choose which parent will raise the children, and which parent will go out and work.

Let's try and explain it using a parallel issue with varying grounds.  The denial of the right of women to vote was once considered a women's issue.  It is not.

And, more broadly, I disagree with your assessment of the concept of feminism, or the idea that, because equality is a good thing, we do not need feminism, feminism is just about female superiority, etc etc. I think that feminism deals with the question of how our conceptions of women and femaleness influence our beliefs about everyone, in ways that we might not notice. And this can have very subtle effects, for instance in your statement regarding how feminism ""actually comes across."" It would, of course, be more accurate to say that your description is how you *actually perceive* feminism, to put an emphasis on the fact that this is your own, subjective experience in response to it, and maybe it is wrong or stems from particular habits you have in thinking.

Beyond that, however, I think feminism deals with the fact that there are those things between men and women that, sometimes, can never really be equal. For instance, pregnancy is never an equal experience between men and women. Nobody cares if individuals born without a uterus have access to abortion or not. There are issues about gender where the concept of ""equality"" becomes far more difficult, where we must consider the impact of these things on men and women differently, and so on and so forth.",11,t3_25jq71

I absolutely agree with you that the concept of feminism, when defined as equality for women is simply the right way to do things. Personally, I find it absurd, that we should even have to explain that concept to people, when it should just be the natural disposition.  However, that is not the way the world is, and IME, some people who claim to be feminists exhibit bias towards women..  Like it or not, that is how I perceive feminism in *practice* not *concept*  I am not saying it is a good thing or the right thing, or that I agree that that is what feminism *really* is.

Nonetheless, discussing rights in terms of equality is not open to abuse by OP's ""all sex is rape"" crowd.  Feminism is about ""women's"" rights, not about ""people's"" rights.  I do not make any such distinction.  I think all *people* have equal rights.  I do not see women as some inferior subset of humanity who need special protection.  All humans are equal, and have the same rights in my eyes.  The issue of gender in relation to such things as pregnancy and abortion is not part of the equation.

If you're claiming that feminism is *not needed* or *not a relevant part* of the conversation around equality, then I think that you are wrong.

It is common for people who oppose dialogue surrounding gender, race, class, etc to claim that they just don't see any difference between people, that all people are just the same to them. If we want to discuss equality in a thorough way, we cannot reduce all humans to a set of identical particles, we cannot ignore or reject the way that diversity in human identity creates a a richer and more complex narrative.

I don't agree with the idea that feminism is about giving women special protection; I think of it as a line of inquiry, not a conclusion. For instance, whether you accept gender as relevant to issues like pregnancy or abortion or not, the truth of the matter is that the way we handle these issues intrinsically has a different effect on men and women. If you refuse to acknowledge gender when considering pregnancy, if you refuse to acknowledge an inherent inequality in what pregnancy means for men and women, simply because pregnancy is not something that a person without a uterus can experience. A person born male will never have their life threatened by the fetal development. A person born male will never be told that they need to carry a fetus within their body when it has already died. A person born male will never undergo involuntary hormonal changes relating to another person growing inside of them. And so on and so forth.

I bring these things up not to draw any further conclusion from them, but to emphasize that there are intrinsic inequalities, which means that when we make choices, laws, etc around these issues, these choices, laws, etc have unequal effects. We cannot simply get rid of that by pretending it isn't there, or applying the laws ""equally"" to all humans. Nature, the status quo, and many other things will come into play and shape something universally applied into something unequal. And this isn't something within your control, not something you can make go away by just trying as hard as you can to see everyone equally.

I apologise for that.  Feminism is not about highlighting the differences between men and women, it is about ensuring that women have equal rights and treatment.  Too many people behave as if it is the former, and then attempt to exploit those differences (the ""man haters""), and your comments felt like they were at least heading that way.

> We cannot come to a conversation on equality in a diverse environment if we are not willing to acknowledge that certain issues affect others more than ourselves.

  Can we not agree that diversity is not simply about male/female.  That everybody whilst having some things in common with others, is unique .... and that what rights we may have are common, regardless of *any* differences.

  My ~~probllem~~ disagreement with feminism, or at least some manifestations thereof, is that it focuses on women's rights to the unspoken exclusion of men's rights.  Whilst I've no doubt that there are many many more cases of women being treated in various detrimental ways, historically and presently, I am not trying to dismiss that .... I am saying let's not take sides.  Talking about ""women's"" rights is taking sides.  Let's talk about ""human"" rights.  That way, nobody is going to misunderstand your observations of the distinctions between any two or more distinctive ""traits"", and nobody is going to deliberately make those distinctions, and in doing so poison the cause.

> do you want society to treat you, as a man

My favorite feminist authors are those who deal with the issue of intersections between race and gender, often dealing with racial inequalities within the feminist movement as well as inequalities they experience as women within their own racial group. And there are other interesting dynamics to consider as well, including those of non-heterosexual people, those of trans* people, those of people in poverty, and so on and so forth.

What I notice in your response, no matter how you justify it, is that you have this gut response to hearing something expressed as ""This is an experience that I have as a female-born person,"" and you respond by attaching a lot of meaning to it. Feminists do not make you do that. You do that. And you do not do it because you have no choice. You had the option of asking for clarification, or even just checking to see whether what you thought you heard was correct. But you did not do that. You instead responded as if what you assumed was undoubtedly true.

You say that it's important to talk about human rights, but how can we possibly know whether something is truly equal between men and women if we cannot talk about women? You say that we mustn't highlight differences between men and women, yet you felt perfectly comfortable making a claim about how men and women are treated differently. And there's a sort of inherent resistance towards equality there that can only be resolved by acknowledging differences.

You see the term ""woman's rights"" as taking sides because you do not acknowledge the fact that there are those regimes where the law can impact women with a very different effect on men. A law relating to abortion **does not** change whether a male-born individual needs to tolerate another organism growing inside of them. I am absolutely astounded that you are taking issue with something as basic and simple as the idea that men and women may be affected differently by changes in policy, or that this could be something worth discussing. I do not even know how to cut through all of the assumptions and ideological overlays you are attaching to a simple statement, to just establish something as basic and simple as, ""We know there are ways where men and women are different."" And if I cannot even do that, then I don't know how I can possibly persuade you to believe that it could be worthwhile to think and debate about the questions, ""How are men and women different? How are men and women the same? How are men and women treated differently in spite of their being the same? Is there a such thing as men and women being treated the same in spite of being different?"" And so on and so forth.

  No! No! No!  There are no subsets to human rights!  That is my *entire* point.  To create subsets, by definition, creates discrimination and inequality.  To enumerate some right that applies to a subset, by implication at least, excludes those who are not members of that subset.  This is entirely unacceptable and abhorrent to me.

> A law relating to abortion does not change whether a male-born individual needs to tolerate another organism growing inside of them.

  A law relating to abortion does not say that ""only men are permitted to have an abortion""  Again, this is an assumption but, it would appear that you would interpret a prohibition on abortion as an assault exclusively on ""womens' rights,"" by virtue of the fact that only women bear children.  This, if so, is a fallacy.  Those who support prohibition of abortion do so because they believe that the unborn child has a right to live.  They do not advocate such laws as an attempt to 'keep women down' or to harm women.  Their position would not change if men bore children.  That this only affects women's bodies is entirely incidental, and not part of their reasoning.

  So, you think that it's exclusively a woman's right to have an abortion?  Consider the hypothetical that we had the surgical capability to transplant a growing foetus into a man's body, and that 50% of pregnancies were carried this way.  Still think it's a women only issue now?  The fact that in the present day, in present society, with present technology, only women bear children, does not change the underlying principle that it is the right (or not, depending on one's views) of all *humans* to have an abortion.

  For you to prove to me that there is inequality, you would have to prove to me that I am wrong .... that anti-abortionists take such a position with the specific intent of being harmful to women or that they would, in the hypothetical above, allow only men and not women to have abortions.

the gender gap. it is true that if measured as a whole men are paid more than women. but if you break groups down into smaller demographics you quickly find that this is an artifact of past problems and is expressed only in the older generations, and the gap is so large that it disproportionate. if you are a female born after 1979 and you have no children, you actually get paid 8% more than a male born after 1979 with no children. when men born after 1979 get paid more than women born after 1979 it is because they work more hours or in a different job altogether. 

the rape double standard. if two people are intoxicated and agree to have sex with each other, either both of them raped each other, or neither has raped the other. trying to hold men more accountable is not equality. a male can get erect while being raped in the exact same way a woman's vagina can get wet while being raped. 

the patriarchy. this should be called they kyriarchy. it has everything to do with those in power, and is more correlated with wealth than it is with a penis. the vast majority of men are powerless and are just as oppressed as women, just in a different way. 

female objectification. males are equally objectified. they are not as often sexually objectified (although they are sexually objectified), but instead are often objectified by what they can do, and what they can provide. 

privilege. everyone has privileges. what is privileged in one setting is not in another. a disabled and oppressed person has the loudest voice in the media, so even oppression itself causes a person to gain privilege in some situations. its a good idea to attempt to recognize your privileges, but to tell someone else to recognize theirs is actually you attempting to abuse yours, it assumes you have the right to tell other people what to do and is a demonstration of superior position.

victim blaming. when a crime occurs there are tons of different factors at play. the elimination of factors involved in a crime can eliminate the crime from occurring. trying to reduce the factors that are at play in a crime is not victim blaming. would you teach your children to not take candy from strangers? would you consider it victim blaming to teach that to your children? if you would teach your children not to take candy from strangers, than why wouldn't you teach women not to get drunk around strangers? not all men are rapists, but some are, some women are rapists as well. some men and women are kidnappers too. it is always a good idea to practice safe actions that reduce your likelihood of becoming a victim to every crime. this doesn't just apply to women, it also applies to men and children. 

censorship. this one is my personal red button. push this and you will incite violence in me. any ideology that cannot stand on its own merit is a bad ideology. if people are not allowed to speak up against something, than this is a dead give away that that something is a form of tyranny. it doesn't matter what it is, dissenters should always be allowed to speak their mind. this is the one and only path to progression. i combat this by not going on posts that censor comments. if my voice cannot be heard, than i see no reason to allow theirs to either. that is equality. to censor the censurers.

economic factors boil down to supply and demand, and who controls the supply and who controls the demand. are you saying that women aren't strong enough or somehow lack agency in this setting? it seems to me that you are implying that women are weak and stupid, and that they aren't able to perform as well as men. i don't believe this. i am an egalitarian, i believe that women are independent autonomous human beings that are capable of making their own decisions.

i keep trying to repeat that it is the choice of words used in feminist arguments that make it problematic. it is the fact that they choose only to focus on the problem of women, to the exclusion of the problems of men that makes it divisive.

for instance that there are companies that would benefit from having a female view of group cohesion in the work place. most feminists would agree with this. but they wouldn't say it like that. they would say ""companies are holding women back and not allowing them to get into the upper levels of management, so and so study shows that more men get hired into these positions than women.""

one of those statements is constructive and inclusive. one of those statements is divisive. both of those statements say the same thing. until feminism ditches the ""fem"" and starts considering everyone then they won't be able to get everyone on board. feminism's very name is divisive and implies that we should be focusing on women TO THE EXCLUSION OF MEN. exclude men and you will have a hard time getting more people on board.

who do you think funded the feminism campaigns? who paid for it to be publicized? how did it get on public air without the approval of the people in power? was there money to be made off of these feminist movements? who made that money? i'm not talking a couple million dollars. who made hundreds of millions of dollars, who made billions of dollars?

what is the difference of patriarchy and kyriarchy? why would you use language that is exclusive that gets people to oppose you, instead of inclusive language that gets people to join you?

all i am really saying is that feminism is divisive because of the LANGUAGE it uses, and the fact that it chooses to focus on one group of people to the exclusion of other groups of people. this isn't equality. it is a dividing force, it creates imbalances, it perpetuates the problems it claims to fight against.

i want equal rights for men and women. but i realize that feminism will never lead to this. feminism can't lead to this, because it uses language that causes men and women to fight against each other. two warring factions cannot be equal. it is the same for the men's rights activists. they cannot achieve equality for men and women, even though they propose to be trying to do so. their language is one sided for men, their arguments are only for men, to the exclusion of women.

men's rights activists and feminists would readily accept each other's arguments if they were simply stated using different words. but they both use exclusive language. and neither can really reach equality (however, it may be possible that in the future they somehow meet in the middle while taking separate paths). why would any woman join the men's rights movement (yes some do)? why would any man join the feminist movement (yes some do)?

i am an egalitarian. i see people as having problems. i have the freedom of choosing the rational arguments i come across regardless of political ideology. i have the freedom of accepting and rejecting claims i come across. i am not bound by any rule set. my stance is a stance that says that all people should have equal opportunity, and what they choose to do with it should reflect on them as an individual.

exploitation is a simple fact of life. you need to get food to survive. you will have to do things you don't want to do in order to get food to survive. you will be exploited to survive. what i am opposed to is other people taking from your labor and your work so as to cut a profit while at the same time making it harder for you to survive. i am opposed to people conditioning your mind against your own free will to force you to desire things that you don't need. i am against con artists convincing you that you want something that is detrimental to your own welfare. this isn't a female issue, it is a human issue.

but there is one last and major problem i have with feminism. the radicals at the top. those who scream with the loudest voices and hide under the guise of feminism while lobbying for laws that will be detrimental to both men and women.

when rape laws are expanded so far as to say that all sex with a woman who has consumed alcohol is rape, than it hurts men and women. it throws innocent men in jail, and it makes them afraid to have relationships with women. the women lose out on the ability to choose to consume alcohol and have sex. they have lost choices, they have lost agency because of feminist laws. the men are victimized when in good faith they were not trying to rape someone, and are still labeled and prosecuted as rapists.

when you carry the banner of feminist you empower these radicals to harm both men and women. because men and women are dependent on each other so much that if you hurt one, you are hurting the other. black people depend on white people who depend on mexicans and asians and every other arbitrary ""racial"" group. the fact is there is only one race of people, humans. we do ourselves a disservice by trying to force each other into bottles based on skin color, eye color, and nation of birth. all humans lose out if we don't allow the next Einstein to succeed just because she wasn't the right race and gender.

a young attractive woman can make a lot of money in the pornography industry. you can call that exploitation. but i will just say that you are failing to recognize her privilege. not everyone can do that. she has an option that most people do not have. you call it exploitation if it is a woman's privilege. and you try to prevent her from using that privilege to get ahead under the guise that you are somehow helping her. it does not help her when you take her options away, that can never empower her. but you don't even see it, which is very sad in my eyes. its almost as if you don't believe in human rights for women.

The whole 'i'm a woman so hold the door open, buy me food, a new purse, and if you don't your a jerk' is really pathetic.

From what I've read online, it seem as though there are a lot of things that can affect your period. If even one of those things is a little off, you may not get a period.

Making it a double hoop to jump through where you have to prove you're a woman too just sounds exhausting.

Would a subreddit where people talk about the law profession and female issues be pretty cool? Probably. But I'd think a safe space for paralegals, law students, etc. would be kind of nice. /r/lawschool's a pretty great community but if I have a problem like getting hit on at networking events and how to handle it, they'd probably go ""wish I was a girl."" And if I posted here about awkward sexism in the legal industry I'd probably get more of a ""you can do whatever you want, don't put up with that stuff, go talk to HR!"" and I'd have to say ""uhh there is no HR, and I'm kind of desperate for any job I could get."" Just as a student I've thought it would be cool to have some sort of hang out spot online for such a thing, but maybe shit gets worse when you become an actual attorney?

 Or planning out if/when you'd ever have kids (if someone took off time to work between law school like everyone suggests, spent three years in law school, and spent 10 years paying off loans, you'd be in your mid-late thirties before you're settled enough to have kids).

20140514135831,iamequipoised,"I see that you are still a law student, but for what it's worth I am more than happy to work around verification that preserves your anonymity. For example, one of our members provided me with a blurred bar card that showed active licensure but censored the name, coupled with a postit showing her username and the date/time so I could verify she had possession of the censored card. I also joined /r/lawyers with a censored business card/bar card combo. So you don't necessarily have to show your bar number and name to become a member.

The truth is there are no guarantees of anonymity on the internet, not matter what precautions you take, and there are no guarantees that /r/LadyLawyers will never ever make a mistake and let the wrong person in. We can only do the best we can do. 

ETA: I've considered whether law students/paralegals might be a good addition too. I think that is something I will put to the community once we get going a little more. The restriction to practicing attorneys is to help avoid people searching for free legal advice and/or job begging, in my mind, but that might be able to be avoided even w/ addition of law students/paralegals.

Trolls are super confusing to me and I don't understand how their brains work.  If having a women-specific area would draw that kind of trolling, and if outing someone as a woman elsewhere on Reddit could be seriously problematic, then we should definitely take affirmative steps to prevent it.

Step-through frames are not girl bikes, as they've said. They're unisex. Step-throughs are easier to dismount/mount in casual to formal clothing, without risking damaging it. I live in Toronto, right? All the businessmen who ride bikes ride step-throughs around the down town core.

When I worked sales as well at a small shop, I really tried to intervene in people suggesting ""get a girl bike, your a girl"". No, just no. I'd stop that shit and go ""What're you gunna be doing with your bike, and what in the past have you found comfortable?"" and then I'd send them on a nice long test ride. 

In terms of bikes being designed to fit proportions: If you're riding at a level at which that becomes a factor, gender is the be all end all. ""Bike fittings"" are when they measure your arms/legs/various reaches and find a frame for your exact proportions. Gender isn't a factor because whats relevant is your arm/leg lengths in relation to your body and so on.

LOL. I've always thought the same thing about boys riding ""boy's"" bikes.

Anyway, the top tube, as it's called, adds structural integrity to the bicycle. But that's really only a concern if you're riding a lightweight road racing bike or a cyclocross or trail bike where there is extreme stress put on the frame.

As people say here, there are pros to the step-through frame. But I think what OP is most upset about is feeling that her father could only fathom that she would want a bike based on his understanding of what bikes are and how people use them, rather than what his daughter wanted and how she would use it, and when confronted with a cognitive dissonance (i.e., ""Girl bikes are for girls; my daughter is a girl, but she wants a 'boy' bike""), he chose to cling to his sexist misconception about bikes rather than support his daughter and realize that there are no ""girl"" bikes or ""boy"" bikes.",14,t3_25lcu0

I miss my ""girl"" bike because I use a bike as my main mode of transportation in my city and I now ride a men's mountain bike. When going to certain grad school events while wearing a pencil skirt, getting on and off the men's bike is much harder and less graceful and I'm certain one of these days I'm going to just fall over bike and all while trying to dismount. And it's heavier and I have to carry it up to my second story apartment unless I want to lose my seat for the fourth time in the last year. That said, it's a personal preference thing.

He explained that the point of the lower bar was to be able to ride in skirts, and now that I have men's bike to ride to everywhere I go in town, I can confirm that while it's easy to ride a bike in a knee length skirt that isn't too voluminous, it's harder to get on and off a men's bike. It's better to make your own decisions based on the fact and not let his biases away you either way. 

The ""boy bike"" may actually be the better choice for you, only you can know.

20140515101427,progressionbikes,"I own a bike shop in Scotland (more hills and mountains than beach front boulevards). Whether its for hire or sale, the bikes I steer them towards are ones that fit them, their needs and their riding environment.

My customers are of different heights, arm length/reach, leg length and fortunately different frame sizes, geometries, styles and components mean this is easily customised for the individual. It may be because of injury or physical issues (old age, joints, etc) that also affect what bike they go for, or what I suggest for them, whether a step through bike or a 'mountain bike'.

Generally speaking mountain bikes have higher horizontal top tubes, with 'kinks' or 'bends' on ladies specific frames. Ironically it is the 'testicle to top tube' gap that men want to check. This comes from one way to measure the size of a bike and bike frame by ensuring there is adequate clearance for one's twig and berries when standing over the bike, with feet on the floor. I haven't had a fellow come in asking for a step through because his junk is down by his ankles. However ladies also value this clearance.

Why do ladies bikes still have this bend? Mostly due to the fashion cross over from your Victorian step throughs for long dresses to modern frame designs and the need to distinguish between 'mens' and 'womens' bikes, for those that feel the need to. However in certain disciplines, the only difference is frame SIZE not frame DESIGN. 

When it comes to hiring bikes out, I stock a range of frame sizes, but to be honest most of my bikes are unisex bikes. This is incase a group of 'laddish' lads come in to hire bikes only to find out that as it is a busy day the only ones left are 'girly' pink ones. Now whilst pink is not seen as a girly colour in many modern cycling circles, and the modern person will just get on and ride it whatever colour it is, it is often just easier to stick with more neutral colours. 

When it comes to off road, the extra power and stresses on the bike through the key welds and stress areas mean that bikes need to be as strong as possible to avoid 'folding', or snapping. It was believed that men put more power through the arms so HAVE to have the horizontal top tube, but the discipline and terrain is just as an important factor. So off road bikes are geared for more abuse, shakes, rattles and rolls and therefore need to be designed appropriately, and the step throughs have been design out.

Step throughs are fantastic for those that need them, and for those that don't need the strengths and designs of a mountain bike. I've had plenty of happy customers leave on step throughs, and electric step throughs, although it is more due to age or injury than gender.

Interesting to find out if there were ladies step throughs AND ladies non step through bikes available for you? Then there could be little argument from your dad, as clearly there are different options available. 

As a small piece of advice for someone buying a bike for the first time, unless you have a budget of over about £650 / $1000 try to avoid full suspension bikes as they are heavy, the suspension often doesn't work very well, and they can hinder your development and skill progression, if you are looking to go down that route. Anything under £150 / $200 and it will fall apart faster than a wet cake. You may not even have been considering it, but its a consideration to mention none the less.

[EDIT] There are exceptions to this rule of course, but this is an OK rule to go by.

So to sum up, its different bikes for different people, whether that is as a result of their needs, their riding style or the environment or terrain they ride on. Just please don't go and show you dad he is wrong by riding down an official downhill track on a step through. You may not be conscious enough to say 'see I told you so'!",5,t3_25lcu0

  I think for a LDR to work out it had to stop eventually being long distance, its only really supposed to be a temporary thing. I think most people will admit it is harder and not as fun. To me it feels like less of a relationship. Mostly an ongoing promise they'll hold out until their together again. 

Anyone who's made it work is probably a lot more determined than I am. I think I could maybe do it for a while with an established relationship. but with newer ones I'd be scared there is so much uncertainty. That I could be holding out for a person its not going to work out with. ",1,t3_25lgsi

    To be in a long term relationship there is a lot of patience and trust in the perceived final outcome. Especially if you are used to a short hairstyle per say, you have the crutch of knowing it will be safer and less of a risk. However, imagine growing luscious flow, like a lions mane majestically flowing in the wind as it surveys the serenghetti. You always had a buzzcut, lower maintenance, comfortable and safe. But one day after much deliberation, you decide. 
    You are incredibly excited and optimistic at first, the flow is exciting, it's something new, something fresh even though it's different. As you progress through the process, you go through the ""dark ages"" where you aren't sure if this is what you want. You get scared of what could be and question the effort it takes to maintain something you aren't sure is worth maintaining in the first place. 
    There are heaps of hairstyles to choose from...Why is this one perfect for me when it takes so much?

Congrats on growing your luscious flow, it is finally paying off, the dark ages are over and I must say it looks rather good on you.

20140514220214,_Ab_Aeterno,"I love this idea! I think a few things could make this work well:

* You may not have had this in mind, but a new subreddit may need to be in order. This subreddit was big enough before, but especially now with default status, it's going to be difficult for people who want to participate see ""book club posts"" since the front page (and second page) change SO frequently. If you log in to 2X every few days, you will miss all relevant posts. 

* Multiple books, multiple genres. Not everyone will want to read the same kind of books. If we do say, one book a month, then if you don't like the genre for 2 months in a row, you may not check back in the sub. I think Something like- 1st Monday: Classics. 2nd Monday: Scifi. 3rd Monday: Non-fiction. 4th Monday: Wild Card. Of course, a lot of this will depend on how much interest there is and can fluctuate on feedback. 

* Organization. All requests per genre must be within a thread designated for such requests. All discussion must occur within official discussion threads. I think it'd be fun to have ""casual"" threads as well, such as ""I read *Children of Men* a while back and want to know what you gals think about [observation here]""

* I think it would be cool to have at least once a month be a book discussion on a female author, genres varying. 

I'm in love with this idea, let me know if you need any help or just to bounce ideas. 

**EDIT:** We also need to decide what makes this a ""2X book club"" versus a ""regular book club."" Maybe that means ONLY female authors. Maybe that means at least once a month, a female author. Maybe that means a gender-centic critique vs. socio, psycho, or anthropological critiques. Maybe it means for ""people who identify as as a female."" Maybe it means none of these things.

I definitely want to read a lot of those, but I also think that it could be worthwhile to read the occasional male-centric book by a male author, and critique the ways in which they handle gender in a problematic way, or ways in which we appreciate parts of their presentation of female characters.

Mostly, I think I want it to be a book club that is a safe place for women to talk about their perspectives on books, where we can introduce both men and women to female characters they can really identify with and find a new favorite book, or rant about books we take issue with (in a respectful way).

20140515114820,unchow,"My two cents regarding book choice: I think it would be a bad idea to put hard limits on what kinds of books are eligible, be it based on author or genre or content. I think what would make this a 2x book club, first and foremost, is that it is filled with people of similar mindsets. If those people agree on a book to read, simply because they are interested in it, then that should be enough. The nature of it being a 2x group of people means that the book will most likely and typically be read from a feminist stance, which is a valid and interesting reading of any book, no matter the content.

Personally, I think feminist or gendered readings of ""non-feminist"" media is often more interesting than that of ""femisist"" media. One of my favorite scholarly articles that I read in college was a feminist reading of the Aliens movies. Nurturing mother vs devouring mother and all that. I'm reading Gulliver's Travels now, and in the most recent chapter the author started dropping bombs about how this other society is ""different but totally not better because I'm totally not judging totally guys"" than his European upbringing because the chamber maids and nannies in this culture are forbidden from gossip and whatnot, under penalty of death if I remember correctly, and this makes the women of their culture as cautious of what they say as the men are. These things pop up in the strangest of places, and if you put an artificial limit on what books are allowed then you can miss out on some noteworthy things. 

I think having a certain percentage of women authors might be appropriate, but having a hard and fast rule across the board will probably be more stifling than anything. Everyone will want or not want to read a book for their own reasons, and will voice their opinions accordingly.",2,t3_25kvfy

But let me make one important distinction:

* People of all races and genders should be paid equally for the same work, no matter what, if they have the same qualifications and experience. I am 100% in favor of that.
* Comparing societal averages of female wages against male wages for the entire population will forever ""demonstrate"" a wage gap - and this will exist for the rest of time until men and women start collectively dropping out of the work force in precisely equal numbers in order to attend to families - i.e., hell will freeze over first. 

That's basically all I have to say on that matter. On, and one final parting note: comparing individual workers pay to their successors or predecessors is highly likely to yield anecdotal data. Show me a trend within a company and I will listen. Show me pay disparity between two workers who have the same title, but are contemporaneous, functioning under different market conditions and business conditions, well, it's like comparing car A outside in a storm with car B in factory settings - without knowing anything more about either car. There are too many variables to be able to isolate meaningful data. ",5,t3_25lcfx
20140515155251,lawstudent2,"~~Fair enough. That seems completely reasonable. ~~

> Because equal pay laws harm women.

~~Good point, well made, I find it persuasive. It creates a perverse incentive - say no more.~~

Wait wait. I just re-read your point, and it is some weapons-grade libertarian bullshit.

<The free market automatically imposes a financial penalty on the employer for being sexist.
By implementing equal pay laws, you are reducing that penalty to $0, taking away the woman's freedom to choose, and putting her out of a job because the sexist employer has no incentive to hire her over the man. The free market discourages discrimination in the private sector much more effectively than any law ever could.

Something I simply do not get about libertarians is their total inability to look at reality *the way it is* rather than in their John Gault fantasy. Right now there *already is* huge disparity in what women earn *for the same jobs* as men - and this is in a system that *is already* free market. So, no, in fact, the free market does *not* offer this incentive. The free market maximizes one thing, and one thing only: profit for those who have money. In fact, it is precisely *because* of this that women are taken advantage of by employers, who look to hire cheaper, similarly qualified employees as men. This is the same reason that jobs get outsourced. 

Second:

> If you have an equally qualified man and woman applying for the same job for a sexist employer, then equal pay laws take away the woman's freedom to choose to offer to work for a lower wage than the man. If she were allowed to do that, the employer would have to pay more to hire the man. The free market automatically imposes a financial penalty on the employer for being sexist.

That is some real mental gymnastics there. Because employers are sexist, we should take away women's choice to be exploited...? I am really not following. This part in particular: ""If she were allowed to do that, the employer would have to pay more to hire the man."" simply doesn't apply. You are treating something as zero sum which simply isn't. It's bad math, plain and simple.


Back to the original post:
I don't see where that leaves us, however. Were you trying to trap me into saying something dumb? I'm in favor of the proposition that the pay for a position should be related to market demand, qualifications and experience, without reliance on gender, race, sexuality, or religion. That shouldn't be controversial. What I merely point out is that a lot of bullshit metrics are bandied about that really obfuscate this issue: clearly, there is a problem in this country, and globally, that women get paid less for the same jobs. However, comparing average pays across industries for men and women is not a meaningful metric, because women disproportionately remove themselves from the workforce over men.

I first donated to locks of love, as that is the famous organization. When I went to do it the second time I did some research and realize...they kind of suck. The wigs they give out aren't always free or even heavily discounted, they throw out tons of hair, they also sell a lot of hair to other wig suppliers.

20140514193544,brookecapulet,"Hi there! Californian here, so I cannot tell you what it'll cost. However, I have cervical cancer, so I get a colposcopy twice per year. 

I've heard mixed things for colposcopies. Some find them to be rather painless, while I find them to be painful. However, this could be due to damaged cells. Who knows. 

For the colp, they will have you undress from the waist down and hop into the stirrups. Do not be alarmed by the bizarre things they have in the office. It's most likely just the colposcope, which is kind of like a magnifying glass with a light attached and a camera to take pictures of your cervix. 

They will most likely put vinegar or iodine on your vagina/cervix. This allows them to see things more clearly. It will also sting, but not for more than 30 seconds. 

If this is all you are having done (plus the ultrasound), then you do not have to worry about pain. 

However, if they find something abnormal, or are being ultra cautious, they might also perform a cervical punch biopsy or ""punch"". This is what I find to be painful. 

The beginning of the punch is exactly like the colposcopy: the doc inserts a speculum and swabs the vaginal walls/cervix with a solution that removes excess mucus and helps highlight any abnormal areas (if they haven't done so during your colposcopy. This is the vinegar). It may cause a burning feeling. Again, it's not horrible. 

The colposcope is passed through the speculum and focused on the cervix. Your doc will note abnormal areas and photograph or sketch any abnormalities.

For the punch, a special scissors-like instrument (biopsy forceps) is inserted through the speculum or colposcope and used to snip tiny specimens approximately the size of half a grain of rice, from selected sites on the cervix. I find these to be quite painful. However, I've asked my doc to let me know ""when to cough"" as it greatly reduces the amount of discomfort.

Following a biopsy, your doctor may apply pressure or use special solutions or a cautery device to control any bleeding. You will leave wearing a GIANT pad and will discharge a yellowy brown mess for a couple days. It's normal.

20140514193049,Lil_Boots1,"A colposcopy is pretty simple and will be done in a doctor's office. It's similar to a Pap smear but where they take the sample from is determined by looking at your cervix with a light and using a dilute acetic acid solution to make any potential lesions show up. If anything looks out of the ordinary, they take a small biopsy which I've heard feels like a bit of a pinch. It will probably take longer than a Pap smear because there may be more samples to get, but it's nothing to stress about. You might be a bit sore after, but it shouldn't be anything too crazy.

In case you haven't had a Pap smear before, it's also very simple and I believe in Australia it's typically done in your GP's office. They use a speculum to open your vagina so they can actually see your cervix, and then they just take a little swab to check for abnormal cells. Neither of these procedures is terribly invasive or painful, though of course you might feel awkward or have some discomfort.

Many different guys have told me that guys are not capable of having a woman friend without the thought cross their minds ... Likely there are exceptions but enough unrelated guys have trusted me with this wisdom that I generally believe it to be true if nothing else as a defense mechanism. 

Unfortunately (or perhaps for the better) I adjusted my approach to be up front that we can be friends and only friends right up front. I learned it was easier to set expectations early on and even be cold because then guys accept me for ""that's just the way she is"" which is easier than having to break it to them later.

Yeah, it's messed up that I went from a person who is super bubbly and friendly to everyone, to a guarded bitch because I got tired of letting guys down gently which is never easy, but it seems to be easier on everyone this way.

20140514203051,lozzern,"I'm actually kind of similar to your friend in a sense so I'll explain things from my point of view. I usually don't initiate contact with my friends unless I specifically have something to say, just because otherwise it doesn't cross my mind. I'm kind of just content in my own little world. I don't really initiate talk for the sake of talking, and I don't like small talk, but if someone were to start a random conversation with me, that's fine. It's just not something I do, unless I have something to say. 

It's pretty hard to describe to be honest.. it's just the way my mind works. Most of the time I'm content being by myself and not talking with anyone, because I'm an introvert. Same with making plans, I'm just not necessarily bothered whether something happens or not, so I don't make them unless I really want to do something. I feel like you might be an extrovert and enjoy talking in general more than her, maybe.

BUT I have been on the other side. A few years ago I had a friend who would NEVER talk to me, and I was literally the only one making an effort for an entire year. It was definitely a change from how she used to be. I even brought it up with her - like she was making zero effort. She disagreed, but I eventually just had enough and stopped talking to her, figuring if she wanted to be my friend then she'd make contact. We aren't friends anymore. I've had other friends like that, that would just never talk to me, and it resulted in not being friends any more. Or maybe both of us were just non-initiators and we weren't close enough to keep the friendship going.

So it could be kind of confusing as to which of these situations it is, but I think it is the first. Like does she ask you for advice? Tell you stuff? Laugh with you? Or is she disinterested? If she seems like she definitely does like being around you, she just isn't an initiator, I think you just have to accept that that's what she's like.

The present thing however is a bit weird, maybe the next time that happens you could ask her what her reasoning behind that is. Maybe she feels bad about the presents and is worried that you won't like them.",1,t3_25l65q
20140514204052,runningwiththegnomes,"See,  it's hard for me to say exactly which situation it is, but I guess it's the first because she doesn't ask me for advice/tell me stuff unless I've already started the conversation with her. Only small exception is when there's something she's really worried about affecting her, I guess.

I asked her about the gift thing yesterday and she claims it's because she always likes the gifts I give her and feels self-conscious that I won't like them. Which is really weird to me because I always tell her I like them. She's actually decent at gift giving, but I get really frustrated that I have to wait until she ""feels like"" giving them to me. The gift she gave me for my last birthday is actually one of my favorite presents I've received as an adult and I've told her so.

The thing that I really have trouble with in terms of just accepting her as not an initiator is that I don't really have a lot of friends and I've had trouble with friends leaving me in the past (usually because I picked wrong having them as friends in the first place or something). So when she never seems to consider me when I'm not around (or at least doesn't let me know), it makes me feel like she doesn't care. It's kind of an insecurity, I'll admit. 

Like, I pointed out to her that my birthday is coming up and while I don't want or expect any presents (because I don't really care either way), I kind of wished she would have mentioned it at some point. Maybe asked me what I might want to do. I'm not asking her to plan it or anything (though I already have hers planned a couple months later). I'm just saying that since she knows I care about doing something on my birthday, it might have occurred to her to wonder. Of course, after I brought it up, she asked me what I wanted to do, but I kind of felt like it didn't count if I had to prompt her and I said so.",0,t3_25l65q

I know it's hard to understand, but for people with low self-esteem and things like that, you can be told something a million times, but if you don't actually believe it, those doubts will stay there. It just sucks really. Maybe it's more that she is waiting until she is ready? I don't know. Maybe a little bit of patience is needed with her. 

Yeah, that's hard. I mean the most you can do is just really clearly explain your feelings, and to have her explain hers back, and both of you to just try to understand. Like, because of how different you both are, one of you is going to have to compromise. Either you will have to accept what she's like and not expect her to initiate things like that, or she will have to except that that's what you want from her, and for her to do that every time. I agree that it would be better if she did it, because it clearly affects you quite a lot more.

>Data from women who enrolled between 1935 and 1939 in a long-term prospective study of menstrual and reproductive health, in which menstrual cycles and other events were recorded as they occurred, were analyzed to examine factors associated with age at natural menopause. Analysis was restricted to 561 women who enrolled before age 25 years and recorded data through at least age 44 years. **Women with a median cycle length that was less than 26 days at ages 20-35 years reached menopause 1.4 years earlier than those with cycles between 26 and 32 days.** The difference in mean menopausal age between women with short cycle length (less than 26 days) and women with long cycle length (33 days or longer) was 2.2 years. Women who had ever been pregnant reached menopause slightly, but statistically significantly, later than women who had never been pregnant. Similarly, women who had ever had a live birth had a slightly later age at menopause compared with nulliparous women. A trend of later age at menopause with increasing parity was also observed. There was no association with age at menarche. Certain of these observations are consistent with proposed mechanisms of cessation of menstrual function. [Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2316494)

So maybe, but not by all that much. Interestingly, age of first period did not have an effect while pregnancy did postpone menopause.

Your best bet for accurate information fast is a pharmacist. Call or go tomorrow and explain what happened. If you need Plan B, you can buy it there I'm sure. Plan B can be taken for up to 72 hours after sex, so early tomorrow morning is the best time to have this conversation. They'll also be able to tell you when to start taking the next pack since this one is off. As far as no period yet, don't worry. Different types of birth control tend to cause periods on different days of the placebo week, and it's even possible to have none at all. Plan B shouldn't affect a pregnancy test because it has progestin in it and the pregnancy test looks for human chorionic gonadotropin, typically only released by a fertilized egg/embryo/fetus, so don't be afraid to take it. 

I don't know enough about this pill to tell you anything about the risks from recent sex, but you should still have been protected in your last placebo week from your old birth control because of the old hormones. That said, in the future, it's generally best to use a secondary form of birth control in at least the first week of a new pill if not the first whole pack, just in case. Chances are you'll be ok, though, because your chances of conceiving from one or two instances of sex are low.",3,t3_25lh1b

The Bell Jar helped me so much though. I was so scared while I was reading it because I could identify with it so well. But then I finished it and thought about it for a while.

You should definitely talk to someone about it. A therapist maybe; I've had not the best experiences with therapists, it's hard to find a good one fast.

Maybe talk to someone you're close to. I realise someone that close may not exist though.

I used to not want to say any of the stuff going on with me aloud, so I would write it down. That helped me straighten a lot of it out.

I know not everyone has someone to talk to, or resources to find a therapist, but everyone can write this stuff down. You can type it out and then delete it even, or write it down and shred the pages. It still helps.

Was Mrs. Abramson really discriminated against? Was education and experience a factor in the Times' decision on the salaries of Bill Keller and Jill Abramson? I saw this story and decided to investigate myself.

**Education:** 

Bill Keller: graduated from Pomono College in 1970. No special graduate degree or anything, just your typical 4 year college. 

Jill Abramson: Received a BA in History and Literature from Harvard University/ Radcliffe College in 1976. Same thing here, no special graduate degrees or masters programs, just a four-year undergraduate degree.

Education Edge: We'll give the slight edge to Abramson, because Harvard.

**Experience:** 

Bill Keller started working after graduation at the *Oregonian* in 1970 and worked as a reporter until 1979. I'm unsure what he did from 1979-1984, but it is probable that he worked as a reporter at another paper, because in 1984, he became a reporter at the *Times*. He had a long career at the *Times*, becoming bureau chief in '88, and executive editor in 2003 until 2011 (with Abramson filling this position in 2011).

Jill Abramson worked at her university paper, and also at the *Times* while in college from '73-'76. This was probably on a part-time, internship basis, but I'll still include it in her 'experience'. Afterwards, she spend a decade as a senior staff reporter for *The American Lawyer*. From 1988-1997, she was a senior reporter for *The Wall Street Journal*. She joined the *Times* in 1997, becoming the Washington Bureau chief in 2000, and finally replaced Bill Keller as executive editor in 2011.

**Recap:**

**Education Recap:** *Equal* (slight edge to Jill Abramson because she went to Harvard)

**Experience Recap:** 

Years experience in career-field: Bill Keller: 41 years ('70-'11) ; Jill Abramson: 40 years ('73-'13). ***Slight edge***, Bill Keller by a few years. Even including Jill's 3 year, part time, college internship at the Times, Bill still has the slight edge.

Years experience at the New York Times: Bill Keller: 27 years ('84-'11). Jill Abramson: 19 years. ('73-76 & '97-'13). ***8 year edge goes to Bill Keller, even including Jill's college experience with the Times.***

Years experience in *NYT* executive editor position: Bill Keller: 8 years (2003-2011); Jill Abramson: <2 years (June 2011 to May 2013). ***Profound edge to Mr. Keller.***

My findings show that their backgrounds were *not* the same, and that the *Times* had every right to have paid Mr. Keller a higher wage than Mrs. Abramson, based on his longer experience in journalism, at the Times, and in his former position. If Mrs. Abramson wanted to legitimize her ""unequal pay"" argument, (if this is indeed what she did), she would need more years experience, or something to make her stand out, like say, the Pulitzer Prize that Bill Keller won in 1988. I guess my economics teacher was right. Unequal pay based on gender is a myth.

CEO's get benefits packages that compile over time that are written into a contract and deeply negotiated. They are generally pretty fair. If you look at total number of women in those positions versus men in those positions, that is where it starts to look pretty bad, but the ones that are in those positions are paid pretty fairly compared to their predecessors. (For example, it's unfair to compare the female CEO of GM to the male CEO of Target and exclaim it's unfair she is paid less. Two totally separate companies.)

With beyond a reasonable doubt, if there is even a slight chance that the accused is innocent, you are supposed to set them free. Here the idea is it's better for ten guilty people to go free than one innocent person punished. This heavy standard is imposed because the penalties are so harsh, such as imprisonment, loss of the vote, felony records, or even death penalty for murderers.

Preponderance of evidence is applied to lesser things. For example in civil cases, both sides simply argue, present evidence, and the side that has the greater amount of evidence wins. This is why, say in the OJ Simpson case, he got off of the murder charge, but was found at fault in the wrongful death suit. The juries found a preponderance of evidence, but not beyond a reasonable doubt.

A college court is more like a civil case. The worst thing that happens is that you're thrown out of school. They don't have the ability to imprison people.

I breastfed both mine for 18 months, but I could sleep through it. For some women, it's stressful and painful, and having babies is enough of that. 

I think we should stop pressuring mothers either way. My mother-in-law is a breastfeeding advocate, and she put so much pressure on me to breastfeed - even though I had already decided to give it a go - that it almost put me off. She even wanted me to force my kids to keep feeding after they'd weaned themselves because ""You really should breastfeed until they're two!""

There's no reason to push stressed out mothers over the edge by dictating something like this. It doesn't make you a better mother, and I read a really interesting article about [fat-loving toxins in breastmilk](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/16/breasts-breastfeeding-milk-florence-williams) - there's a downside to both choices.

However, there are people who can't breastfeed. They are often shamed because they physically can't do it, and it's horribly wrong and rude to do that to someone. Not breastfeeding because of this is okay.

There are also women who choose not to, for various reasons such as involving the father in the feeding process, taking medications that they fear could harm the baby, and because maybe they want to be able to eat or drink what they want and don't want a mini human latching at their body every two hours or more. And that's okay, too.

When they succeed, they make us feel way better, for a lot longer, than simply being boisterous and fun. At least, this is always how I feel, I would not know about my roommate, for sure, but he always seems happier afterwards.

The point is, I think you should find his closest friend. Someone who's closer to your boyfriend than any of his others (you'll know), and tell him what's going on. Damn, you might even get a response of ""ah, shit... He's going through that again?"" and he'd ask how you wanted him to help.(you would in my friend group, at least) ",0,t3_25mop2

I know this type it used to be me, the best action you can encourage is to live life in the now, there is no point regretting the past, he just has to accept it and go forward. The best thing to do is to demonstrate it yourself, get away for a while and find some place where you both can just totally relax and embrace life.

Drinking way too much, drug use, letting people down and my job actually led me to feel guilty about the way had to treat people every day.  The job was debt related, so I saw some people in really shitty situations and sometimes they would see no other way out and kill themselves.  I would always view this as my fault as, in my eyes, I didn't do enough to help them (even in situations where there was no way I could help at all).  That guilt would make me want to get wasted to forget and then I would let down people who were close to me, feel guilty about that and want to get wasted all over again to forget.

My life's totally back on track now and I've been seeing a new girl for a few months.  Sometimes things from years ago just pop into my head without warning and make me feel shitty and guilty.  She notices every damn time as I go quiet and try to push whatever it is out of my thoughts.  Then when she sees something's bothering me she asks me about it and I blurt out everything then suddenly I feel okay again, particularly if she assures me it wasn't my fault.

The thing is I would normally never share any of this stuff and only share it with her because I know she's awesome and won't judge me.  I'm what most people would describe as a big, strong guy and sometimes that makes you afraid to show people that you have weaknesses too.  If I were OP I'd take it as a compliment that her boyfriend talks to her about his past.  He probably really doesn't enjoy talking about the things that bother him but he feels close enough to her that he has to tell her.  I know I've carried some things around for years and not told a soul.  It actually amazes me that I finally trust somebody enough to even start to talk about it all.

And once I get it out, I'm usually okay. Sometimes I'll have to process it a bit more, but it eventually dies down.

I also think that he just has really high expectations of himself and can't stand it when he steps out of line from his ideal self. A lot of people are saying depression and I don't think it is. Could be OCD maybe? His inability to let mistakes go because he feels that they shouldn't have happened to begin with. He's just incredibly hard on himself. But really, as cringeworthy as some of his mistakes probably were in the past he needs to understand that you learn the most from your mistakes. And if you can't accept your mistakes you're bound to repeat them again. He has to accept that all those things has made him who he is, a great person. And you wouldn't be with him if you didn't see that. Explain this to him. Also as far as body and height issues go he's going to have to make due. It sounds like he's doing all the right things exercise wise. Maybe a change in diet? Other than that he'll need to treat his height the same way he needs to treat the past, accept it and move on. Easier said than done but if he can do this he'll be much happier. And there is no ""this is the day that I accept my past and who I am."" It's a constant battle for us all, it may happen more for some than others but it never truly goes away for good. Im not a doctor and I have no experience with major depression so I don't want to rule anything out because I'm in no position to say so.

20140515144750,zazzlekdazzle,"In my experience, this sort of issue, which often comes from having unrealistically high expectations for oneself, is very deeply rooted into the fiber who a person is.  This is not to say that he can't change, but that there is likely little you can do to change it.  I think the best thing you can do is just learn to live with it, the same way clean people learn to live with messy people, and punctual people learn to live with people who just can't be on time.  Don't see his lack of self-acceptance as a reflection on you, how good of a girlfriend you are, or how well you are communicating your love for and approval of him.  It is just a part of who he is and until he wants to change it from the roots, it is likely how he will remain.  This is probably a lot of what drives him to achieve (whether socially, at work, or at the gym) so it is useful for him in a lot of ways.  

I have lived with this before in men, and I did let it finally get to me.  First I tried to fill the void with love, demonstrations of my appreciation of him and who he is, and lots of patience.  But over time, i let it get to me. I was working and working to show how great he was and how I wasn't judging him for the things he thought were bad about him and he just wasn't getting it.  Soon, I became resentful of all the work I was putting in and felt under-appreciated because no change was happening.  Then, eventually, I started to let his issues with self-image affect my self image: shouldn't he feel great that he has such an awesome, patient, loving girlfriend? Maybe I am not a good girlfriend, or as attractive or desirable as I thought?

With those guys, their unhealthy narcissism would have killed the relationship anyway because they weren't happy with themselves,thus they could never really be happy with me.  Once the honeymoon was over, it was *over* and reality really set in.

My SO is very well liked, insanely successful, handsome, and smart. However, nothing is ever enough. Ever. He was raised in a strict Asian household. I know his parents are proud of him, but they do their best not to show it when he was younger. They held him to impossible expectations, and he kept meeting them. He's at the point now where he's doing so so well but he can't be happy or satisfied as it's not ""enough"". He always points out the ways he could've done better. (Ex. He had to take a test at work and got the highest score anyone had ever received. Ever. In a global organization. What does he fixate on? The two questions he got wrong. ""I should've studied more. There was no reason to get that wrong"") 

Like you said, I spend a lot of time trying to build him up. I even give him build up through my mother as I know it means a lot to hear a parent say their proud. However, now it's definitely taken a toll on our relationship. Since nothing he does is good enough...and he does so so so much more than me, it makes me feel awful. Awful that I can't reach his standards. Awful that I can't make him happy, because he'll never be happy.  Awful I can't give him the things he wants. He says he doesn't judge me that way, but I know he does.  

It's hard, because I do love him, and I think in some ways he'd make a great husband and father. But he is all for raising his children the way he was raised, because he can't see how much they messed him up.

If he's beating himself up it's because he's proud - knows he's capable of better and holds himself to that standard (even if that standard is ridiculous.)

He's angry at himself for his mistakes and that's why he keeps bringing them up.

That is not depression. This can happen with depressed people, but jumping to a mental disorder isn't smart. Telling someone as proud as jake that they have a disorder isn't smart. 

I'm in a similar boat. 

I pay my way, write the news for a top ten market tv station, work another job and will graduate with a degree in tv reporting next week. But what's gotten me to this point is jake's level of self judgement.

A misspelled word or messed up video that airs will seriously ruin my night. It will remind me of every mistake I've made and every newscast I think I've ruined. That happens because I know I'm better than my mistakes and just blowing them off won't fix them.

Another thing-----

Jake thinks he should be able to solve everyone's problems and juggle the world without help. He thinks that's being successful. You need to let him fail, then talk him back up. He will learn he can't do it all eventually.

Some people, I think, need to be shown they can't carry the world. Telling them they can't will only make them want to prove you wrong.

 As a guy, I need my gf to believe in me, not diagnose me.

(just riding on this comment here)

I can relate to most things the OP's said about here outside of the things he's done/doing and his past history.

He's not necessarily depressed. When I confess certain things to my SO, it's partly to let her know everything that I've done so she can see whether or not it'd be best to leave me before we get into anything serious.  I don't want to hurt her.

You're going to have to reassure him, saying things to him like you've said here should help. It's just that the past can get so overwhelming and lock one up into self-loathing behaviour. 

Being diagnosed would only make the person feel distant, despite good intentions. I am usually asked if I am safe at times, it's understandable given my gf's context, but I am not depressed. Like /u/4u5t3n said, it would make the person feel inferior. Sit down and talk things out, if possible. Get a digital channel in which you two can communicate but add positive vibes as well (or just text, I guess). 

I do think that perhaps comparing his story to people who've gone through the same things and reflecting on how he's doing and how it's important that he focus on that in order to maintain (this is tricky/fine line) what he has.

There is some huge stigma about seeing a therapist, it seems, and it is such a shame.  Even people who say they're cool with other people seeking therapy sometimes avoid seeking therapy themselves.  One negative experience seeing a psychiatrist or a behavioral therapist can prejudice a person against the entire field, and it shouldn't.

Finding the right therapist can take some trial and error.  If you don't like a therapist up front, you can stop and try another.  And keep trying until you find someone you feel comfortable opening up to.

Alas, you can't make someone seek help if they don't want to.  But perhaps you can decriminalize the field for him.  Couples therapy could be good.  I know that ""couples therapy"" might have a worse stigma than individual therapy, but I think that's because most couples see it as a last resort.  It shouldn't be.  Your boyfriend obviously takes care of his physical health at the gym, he should want to maintain his mental health as well.  Seeing a therapist is like going to the gym: it's not just for emergency cases.  It's about maintaining health.

20140515115554,kadathsc,"I would recommend you continue hearing him out. You might even try some probing questions as to why he says or believes the demeaning things he says about himself. 

What I would try to change is decrease your efforts to try and convince him otherwise. I believe that's part of what's causing you this much stress. You're trying to change his mental process and you're not well equipped to do so, and also from his point of view someone asking him to stop thinking or acting a certain way isn't very helpful and can actually be frustrating.

If anything, try to point him gently into acknowledging if he's happy with his mental processes. You can still point out why you think he's not right in his assessments, but ask him what made him come to a different conclusion. A different perspective is very helpful for those who can sometimes be very negative on themselves, it reminds them the world is not all black & white.

I would then gently suggest treatment options, if he expresses a desire to change or address his negative thinking. There are many books that focus on changing your thoughts from negative to positive, basically with changing your mindset. One I've read that I found useful was this one: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SEHQ96/ 

It might not be his cup of tea, you know him best, but give it a look and see if it might be something that he might read. Or read it with him.

It's hard for men to seek out help, and they sometimes need a helping hand in this regard. I think it's also key that you mention a therapist/counselor relationship is very similar to a personal relationship. You have to find one that's good for you. The training or certification these individuals receive will not guarantee success, there has to be a fit. 

If you do encourage him to seek treatment (which I agree is a good course of action) make sure he goes to several therapists first. So he can choose one that has a style and approach that fits his goals and needs.

EDIT: Just another thing that occurred to me, when you do suggest he seek professional help, be clear that you'll still listen to him.

Bringing it up is tough, I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/webcomics/comments/1e7siu/) was a fairly good explanation of how people see it vs how the sufferer sees it. I think it is important to talk about it though. If you need to approach it softly then do so but I would expect him to appreciate telling someone about it. 

Therapy is an interesting one, I have been to counselling and a pdoc. Some of them I clicked with and some of them I didn't. I eventually found that having a proper support network is incredibly important though. 

""it's private, it's his problem"" - couldn't be further from the truth. Part of mental health issues is you put all of the stresses on yourself and don't want to bother people with your ""petty"" problems. This affects you massively, you are a large part of his life and his actions and feelings will have an effect on you. I have hurt people more seriously than I have hurt myself - I was able to be corrected once diagnosed (6-7 years) and some people still can't bear to look me in the eye or have any contact with me (4+ years). 

You should consider going to get some councilling yourself. A professional will be able to give you better advice on how to deal with living with something like this. I wish there was more emphasis on the support of people who support us head cases.. I feel bad for what my family went through every day. 

The most important thing I think you can do when approaching this situation is never forget that it is not his fault. If you ever start to think it then it is already too late. I was constantly looking for signs that people felt like this and could tell in an instant (sometimes making it up entirely) when someone thought that way.. this makes you shut down further. 

As the comic says, I think the best way to support him is patience and reassurance. I think letting him know that you are thinking about counselling is good or bad depending on the delivery, if he realizes that it is not a big deal to have a professional to talk to work shit out in your head it will likely make him more open to the idea. NEVER EVER TRY TO MAKE HIM DO IT THOUGH.

Since I believe this is a self esteem issue I don't think a health professional is needed by any means. You and the people closest to him will be of the most help and your words and actions will be your best tools. 

Here are some things you can do to build self estate. 

-compliment him no matter how small it may seem.  Tell him he's funny, smart, helpful, strong, ect. But don't overdue it. 

-be understating with him. Don't get mad over little things and don't get frustrated easily. Things take time and only time will help him get better and back to the person he is. 

-Be aware of him. I don't necessarily mean know when he is around, but rather try to realize when he is angry or sad. This will help you to control your emotions and know how to act in response. 

-include them in (almost) everything. Since I don't know the exact source of the problem it is a little hard to narrow this one down. Just make sure to have him with you when you try new things or meet new people.  

These last three may be the most important.  

-realize they may not be ""themselves""
They might be a little moody, but that's because they are struggling with this and they don't really know what's going on and WHY they are feeling the way they are.  

-find out what is causing it. The more you know about the problem the better you can respond to his needs. 

-lastly, DO NOT baby him. If this is low self esteem that is the last things he wants is to be babied. Be straight forward with him.  He wants to be independent and wants to be able to handle things on his own.  This is no different.

20140515140219,throowwFUU,"My boyfriend and I have our own issues like this, going through the monotony of life, dealing with different conflicting life choices/emotions. It isn't unnatural for anyone to get depressed and in my opinion its also just as natural to get out of it without the help of medication. Psychiatrists have convinced the public into thinking that emotional pain is a disease and can be cured. Providing a ""cure"" has caused more ""sufferers"" to endorse the addictive medication and its a costly way of living an extremely sad life. Your boyfriend feels whatever it is he needs to feel, you don't need to slap a label on him and say ""he has this"" (I just thought that was really intrusive) I also think-because we aren't receiving an unbiased perspective-that some of the things you are ""worried about"" or ""asking advice for"" should be none of your business in reference to his decisions, feelings, choices to pursue ""help"" (seening a psych or GP W/E). Do you think he'd be ok if he knew you were asking for reddit's opinion? Honestly, if my girlfriend had gone online to talk about my problems to other people without even knowing the complete extent of my anxieties, I'd feel like my privacy was compromised. 

STOP diagnosing him. STOP thinking he has applicable lables. We are all human with deep rooted fears and innate animal instincts that cause us to fear, have anxiety, depression, motivation, happiness, pride. Every spectrum of the feeling sensory is thanks to our existence and evolution through time. You cant stop him from feeling certain things, blaming his past, wasting your time and his on things that don't matter. Why is it so funny to me that counterparts of relationships feel entitled to protect something that isn't theirs (like a body part)? BE THERE FOR HIM that's all you can do. Allowing him to diagnose himself (and your obvious neglect to remove your biased opinion of these stupid ""diagnosis"" probably makes him feel worse.)

If this is an occasional thing and isn't a relationship deal breaker for you, then I suggest you accept it as part of who he is, listen to him and do your best to be encouraging and supportive.

Gently trying to provide him with a little perspective on the issue may be of some help, as he sounds like someone who is aware of his behavior and tries to do better, but don't expect results to be fast.  Repetition, patience, and a gentle touch will be key here.  It may take months or years to see a significant impact, and he may never completely change.  You need to be OK with that.

If it's a really serious problem, then you could suggest, or even push for, therapy.  But you can't make him go.

Perhaps most importantly, avoid viewing this as your problem to fix.  That will only lead to frustration, and if you get frustrated you'll make it worse (trust me on this, I've done it with my wife, who has had medium-serious self esteem issues for as long as we've been together).  Instead, try to see this as a small flaw in an otherwise excellent partner.  Be as supportive and helpful as you can, but do not take ownership of the issue.

20140515160753,DudeFu,"What this guy is experiencing, I think happened with me. I lost a wonderful relationship because of it. In fact, at the time I didn't really understand it myself. It wasn't about insecurity though. For me, things went well, I had great friends, and a good relationship. I felt lucky. Then it seemed to just change. I didn't understand it. I mean I was a great guy, why am I not doing better in life? I want to do great things, I want to provide, I want to lead a great life. But the reality was that after all my time being social and having fun, I was left with barely enough to pay my bills in the real world. And I truly felt the consequences of not having ""better"". In my case it was about money to do things. I had a great job in all things but pay. It seemed everyone around me did well. They were all happy. Then I noticed they didn't share it in like I did with them. It affected me, and not in a good way. 

For me, I had plans, I had traveled. I had seen the life I wanted to live, and experience the wonders of this world. I wanted to LIVE!, but I felt shackled by the reality of life. And it started to get to me. I didn't even realize how negative I was. People tried to tell me but I couldn't truly relate. I mean it was happening to me, not you. Things were just supposed to work out for me. So I will try a little harder, not go out as much. It spiraled, and I lost everything. People didn't even recognize me. It was like it was a competition and I lost. I knew I was a good guy but I felt like a loser for not being able to live up to my expectations. 

Looking back it was anxiety but it was also a reality check. It was a bit of a ""comeuppance"". And I realized that I was so used to things going well that I had lost most of my coping skills and just spiralled. I'm not sure of any advice to give. For me, I realized that I had all the pieces but the self-discipline to really achieve the things that I wanted. I got lazy with things always working out for me. I do know this. If I could go back, I believe I could fix it. Maybe it was meant to be this way. I mean I am so much stronger now, so developed. That girl I was involved with, I could have married her. She was special, and gave it her best to stay with me. It has been a long while now (15  years), but we talked about it a few years ago. She even apologized, I was floored. I explained it all, and I think it was a relief for her to hear what I had to say. She was amazing, but until I turned myself around, there was nothing she could have done for me. I pushed her away though and I got lost in myself. Your bf doesn't seem to be doing that. 

If I knew more, I might offer advice. He will have to come to terms with his current status. He will have to learn to cope and let go. He is going to have to grow up. Life is hard and it isn't fair. For me, volunteering helped. I wish I had done that more back then. It puts things into perspective.

One thing about your story stuck out for me : the psychiatrist.   You said that that he said this was the ""cause"" of problems for him.   Chances are is that it's more like this:  his sessions with the psychologist brought up very uncomfortable feelings and now he's blaming the psychiatrist for ""making him feel bad."" I'm not saying that psychotherapy is for everyone,  but he might be throwing the baby out with the bath water on this one.   Maybe he ought to try again... Or perhaps more like,  blaming the messenger.   The key might simply be having someone who isn't in his life,  whom he can talk to.

Do you feel that his failures or his feelings about them are pervasive as well as permanent? That is to say, do you think a failure in one area of his life effects his outlook on other areas? I wonder if he is dealing with a negative explanatory style, and pessimism in general. 

I am a pessimist with a girlfriend and a lot of what you said sounds familiar. I used to think about past failures, challenges and indiscretions and let them effect what I thought about current situations and relationships, even when they were completely unrelated. I also dealt with some addiction, and coping with life as an addict is a great way to unlearn how to healthfully recognize when things are wrong or how to help yourself, both physically and emotionally. 

I'm not big on self-help, but you both could consider looking into the work of Martin Seligman. Specifically his volume ""Learned Optimism"". If you (or your boyfriend) need to validate who Seligman is or why he's worth listening to, any online search about his work should corroborate the experiments and advances he's been involved with, and why he's not full of shit.

I'm depressed, but I deal with it. People tell me that I am smart, capable, cute, a ""catch"" etc. but I never believe it myself. Your boyfriend even sounds better than me.

Things that I do to make it better: **self help books, get enough sleep, diet, & exercise**. The best things that got me feeling OK with myself were the following books: [Dale Carnegie](http://www.amazon.com/How-Stop-Worrying-Start-Living/dp/0671733354/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400178620&sr=8-1&keywords=stop+worrying), [Feeling Good](http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-The-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400178662&sr=8-1&keywords=feeling+good), [Power of Now](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Now-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400178677&sr=8-1&keywords=power+of+now)

Living in the past and/or worrying about the future is rough. Constantly thinking or experiencing racing thoughts is rough (The books help a ton).

The only salvation for me is **helping other people, trying to be the best person I can, and hope that people accept me for what I am**. You shouldn't feel that need to fix him. Being there for him is all that he needs from you. Honestly talking to him on what you're worried about / what he's worried about seems to be the way to go. If talking is making it worse, then you need to talk about why it is making it worse.

It does indeed change quite a number of small things - your vaginal ph changes, the stress of ""yes? no? maybe? maybe now?"", and I honestly hope pregnancy is kind on you as it can be absolute hell for some (migraines, dizziness, mental health goes a bit sideways). Knowing that your brain literally shrinks and then grows in a slightly different pattern after birth... 

My friend had reasonable sex ed but didn't realize that after birth it's not just ""placenta gone, all done"" ... it's ""you know all those periods you skipped, have them ALL now"".

On the practical side - you can get the test strips inside of pregnancy tests in bulk online on sites like Amazon, same with the ovulation ones. 

I'd start looking at the sites that challenge the ""you have to have""s - you don't need to have a swinging crib, you don't need to have a thousand cute outfits (they rarely stay clean for more than a couple hours anyway), you don't have to have arch-supported shoes for a baby that won't be walking for a long time, etc.",3,t3_25n1jc

My sex drive has always been shitty -- like, once every two months if I wait until I get horny -- but I couldn't get enough the first time we started trying. My husband enjoyed making me wait for every other day. I admit I enjoyed being horny all the time too. That's a nice problem to have.

But yeah, the whole thing is weird. We now have a 3.5-year-old girl and a 5-month-old boy and so much of it is weird. When we found out our second was a boy I was a bit unnerved at first by the fact there was a penis in me, a little one and not my husband's, and that it could get boners (even fetal boys can get boners, which is also weird). My husband said, ""It's okay, I put it there."" WEIRD

Our daughter recently started using the word ""actually"". Oh my gods. It's the cutest thing ever.

Can't tell if it tickles or if it's like that scene in James Bond where the guy is whacking him in the balls with a heavy metal object and he's laughing about how the guy's going to die fondling his balls.

I've heard parents of older boys laugh about how their son was freaking out because his little boner wouldn't go down.

All of that with other people's kids is magnified 1000x with your own. I don't particularly like kids, never wanted to hold a baby, and when I pictured my own they were able to have real conversations -- I considered the stages from baby to preschooler the price I'd pay to have older kids -- but halfway through my first pregnancy I suddenly got baby rabies real bad. Still can't say I'm much of a fan of the toddler stage, but now that my daughter is approaching 4 years old and we're starting school (we're homeschooling, and she's showing interest), I'm so happy teaching her even the very basic stuff like how to write letters/numbers and what the organs are called and what they do...though she clearly has no idea what I'm talking about -- when she tells me about the organs she gets all the systems mixed up. Stomach has to do with the heart and the lungs with the bladder...

It's so amazing to watch them grow day-to-day. Way different from seeing a baby once a week as we did with our friends' kid who's about 9 months older than ours. Currently my daughter is sitting on the couch with two paper tubes and a headless plastic snake. She just stuffed the snake into the white tube, held it upright on the couch, tapped it with the tube she put stickers on at the YMCA, said ""abwa ca dabwa!"" and lifted the white tube to dump the snake out. This whole magic show is a totally new thing. When you're looking at them weekly or every couple of days, you tend to feel like each new thing is something they learned while you weren't there. When you see them every day, it's like, ""where did that come from?""

Oh and this: ""Oh! Dere you are snake! You Are Freeeeeee!"" ""Uh oh. De booteful tail...Dere we go, all right."" I am D E D ded of the cute.

Since when is ""loving your body"" equivalent to not changing a thing? I love my body, that's why I live a healthy life. I love my mind, that's why I continue to learn new things and exercise my brain by thinking. Of course I'll try to improve the things I love (or motivate them to improve themselves as I haven't quite mastered the art of remotely exercising other people via telekinesis). 

Loving something means caring for it and making sure it's in good condition. If someone loves their car, they won't accept a dent or a scratch, they'll fix that. There is not a *single thing* that we can love that we won't try to improve or where we wouldn't accept an improvement. Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream can always have just a *little* more chocolate chips.

But this idea that we should let our bodies go because that's what you do when you ""love"" it is ridiculous. This sounds more like ""giving up"" than ""loving"" to me.

Neither will any common sense that I present her with. She's addicted to the drama of the toxic relationship. She will not let it go until she is ready. Unfortunately this has driven us apart. She became so selfish that she started ruining dates that I had with my bf because she needed to talk. She interrupted precious time with my family. She is totally wrapped up in herself.

I've been in her exact position though so I get it. In high school I had a very toxic relationship. It was very dramatic and we'd be constantly breaking up and getting back together and fighting and making up. No matter how much I knew that he was bad for me I couldn't help myself. I was a pain because I couldn't stop talking about him to my friends either. I could feel my friends getting annoyed with me. 

I had pretty dramatic relationships in college too, but luckily I grew out of it. I honestly think it comes down to maturity.

20140515145506,deeelightful,"I know exactly how this feels. Last summer/spring a really close friend of mine had to deal with her long time SO beginning to show symptoms of  schizophrenia, and not only that but beginning to be very emotionally abusive towards her. I love her so much and I told her many times after incidents happened with him that she needed to begin thinking about herself and her own mental and physical well being instead of his. He tired to convince her that it was just the sickness talking when he said/did hurtful things, and he succeeded for a long time, but I just kept reiterating to her that she needed to focus on herself and not let him manipulate her into staying. We seriously talked about her problems over and over again, for months, without much resolution. At one point he broke up with her and I heaved a sigh of relief, but it still wasn't over. At one point, he spent a month in the psychiatric ward at the hospital, and I thought now it must be over but it still wasn't. Eventually, once he was out of the hospital, heavily medicated, and still being an emotionally abusive asshole, she came around and realized that maybe it wasn't the illness and maybe it was finally time to say goodbye to him.  

Unfortunately there's not much you can do in this situation. You can help by talking to her but really she has to be the one to make the final decision. I don't know how much an intervention, or something like it would help. Like I said, people with severe mental illnesses like this can be SCARY manipulative and even if you did intervene she might go back to him in the end. However, if you are afraid that he might actually physically hurt her then that is the time when you should consider an intervention type scenario. Otherwise, be supportive and blunt (like super blunt, sometimes it just needs to be said) and continue telling her how you feel about her situation. 

When it comes to your wedding though. I would tell her you don't feel comfortable having him there. You shouldn't have to deal with that sort of extra stress on your big day. It's your wedding, and you should be having a good time. If she gets mad, and doesn't understand why, then I guess so be it.   ",2,t3_25n16i

I asked she stop talking to me about her relationship problems, but that I loved her to death, I just didn't love being involved anymore. She told me he was her entire world and if she couldn't talk to me about him then she couldn't talk to me. A month later after complete silence she texted me asking if he was at my house. I reminded her of our conversation and it ended with us not being friends. We haven't spoken in over two years, but her ex and I are great friends still. These situations are so hard to be in OP and I hope you can navigate it better than I did.",2,t3_25n16i
20140515131950,foxes722,"This sounds horribly frustrating. A couple thoughts - it is normal to be protective of our friends especially when we hear about things/people they are struggling with. But we can never be inside of someone else's relationship so sometimes it is important to realize we may only ever hear the complaints but those negative things may be actually only a fraction of what is going on in the relationship. (I had to ask a friend of mine to tell me some good stuff about her bf once, who I was seriously disliking... but I realized there was a lot she & I didn't talk about, so I was probably missing some of the good stuff.)
Secondly - nothing you said here seems to indicate this guy is dangerous. Anxiety/depression do not predispose people to violence - more likely holing up in the house and isolating. Which brings up the point - this guy is ill. There is a lot of stigma about mental illness but it can be treated and while it can be amazingly frustrating to cope with for not only the person with the illness but the relationships around them - it does not make us (yes, me too) bad people. There's a lot of hate in this for someone who is struggling with his health - and while you might also be frustrated for a friend who was overwhelmed dealing with a partner with a physically disability, it might be easier to have some compassion for both people and what they are dealing with if you could SEE it.
Your friend can't make her bf seek treatment - although that would probably be awesome, but she can learn more about how to support someone who struggles with mental health issues, and what it means in relationship to her. It would totally be beneficial for her to talk to a counselor. We can only lean on our friends/partners so much - sometimes we gotta talk to someone whose job it is to give us some advice, and who isn't emotionally invested. 
People might have talked any number of my bf's out of staying with me based on the fact that I have struggled with anxiety in the long term and this can be hard. Luckily for me - there has been a lot of compassion mixed in with the frustration, and I have been supported in becoming healthier and happy. That's certainly not all there is to me... and I'm guessing, this guy.

20140515142125,snippylippy,"I agree with your message of compassion towards people with mental illness, and the stigma against them and receiving help, and the difficulties they face in getting to that help. I'm about to get into grad school for clinical psychology so I am completely with you there. I deal with anxiety myself which I am trying to find a manageable level of before I go onto helping others. So I am completely, totally with you.

However, depression and anxiety are no excuses for his treatment of her. He does terrible things when he's angry just to ""show her right"", then refuses to even acknowledge he might be wrong or consider getting help. You are absolutely right, he does need help-- he ran blindly out of the car onto the highway at night just because he was upset she complained about work. He could have been struck by a car and killed. That *is* dangerous. I cannot trust someone who would do that and refuse to accept that is harmful behavior, dismiss his fiancee's utter terror, and refuse to go to therapy to help himself. And I am definitely concerned about what goes on inside the relationship that I don't hear-- I have watched him talk to her like she's a stupid child for years, what does he say to her when they're *not* in public and he's more comfortable? It doesn't matter how high the highs are in their relationship if the lows are this low. 

He still refuses therapy, even after this. He doesn't want to get ""better."" She can't save him. The only person she can save is herself. I don't want to feel hate and part of writing this post was me trying to release it. But he's destroying the life of someone I really care about, so it's hard.

I've been in your shoes before.  My best friend in college was constantly getting into these relationships with guys that would treat her like shit, and I'd tell her, and she'd agree, but she'd keep calling me every day to cry and to complain.  It was stressing me out and making it difficult for me to do with my own shit.  Finally I just had to tell her, Amanda, I can't do this anymore.  Once you dump this dude, call me.

Unfortunately, she never did.  She accused me of being a bad friend and we haven't spoken since.  She ended up marrying one of those shitty dudes and later divorcing him.

This isn't to say that his actions have anything to do with her but, based on what you wrote ""He pulls horrible shit that's just gotten worse over the years."" its pretty obvious who he is.

What it all boils down to is this: People's insults only really bother us because they strike the chord of our own insecurities. Think about it. What if you were 6'0"" tall, and someone drove by in a car and yelled, ""God, you're really short""? Wouldn't most of us be like, ""Um, pppfffft. Ha. Okay, Wingnut"" and not think twice about it? Okay, well, the act of getting yelled out is startling, so I guess that part might remain. But would you obsess all day over your height? No, because by all objective and contextual measures, you're tall (especially for a woman). You'd just chalk it up to that person having an major attack of Random Oddness.

But when we secretly fear our cleavage is too ample, or our skirts or shorts are too revealing, or that we're a little plumper than society shows us is ""ideal,"" or if we're having a rough day or are questioning are own worth (maybe something shitty happened at work), then when some complete stranger who is likely a very unkind, unpleasant person--someone we should realize we are lucky to not be or be involved with in any way--says something that touches one of our insecurities, then it hurts, or stings, or sucks. But the good news is, it can be up to us to let it bother us. I can prove it.

Who among us here has been having the most amazing day ever? Maybe you got a cancer-free diagnosis, a big promotion, got engaged, saved a life, whatever it is that would have you on Cloud 9. And then some sourpuss comes along and tries to whip out his mini-dick and piss all over our day. Maybe someone was grumbly on the bus, or some jerkwad yakking on his mobile cuts you off and then honks at you and flips you off because of it. On those wonderful days, when you feel amazing about yourself and your life--how much does that crap bother us? For me, it's never. And that's how I know I can always choose to not let what a complete and total stranger/douchenozzle's opinion of me is. (Often, since I'm a lesbian, I comfort myself with the thought of, ""Heh.

I usually respond. People always tell me to ignore it, but I'm like you, where I would feel like I was excusing their behaviour if I didn't respond.

I respond **totally normally**. That's the key. Acting totally unaffected, calm, normal.

Sleazy guy: ""Hey baby""
Me: ""Oh hello"" and then continue walking. That's it, it'll be over. If it's not and he follows you, just keep chatting. Don't clam up, don't get flustered, don't act angry or disgusted. Pretend this is one of your old friends you've run into. Sometimes acting like someone is your friend just sort of...makes them friendly? I can't explain it well. If they follow me, I usually politely lecture them about what they did and why it was wrong.

Sleazy guy: ""Nice legs, what time do they open?""
Me: ""They're out of business, didn't you see the sign?"" It helps to have a sense of humour.

Sleazy guy: ""How you doin!""
Me: ""I'm doing very well, thank you for asking, how are you?""

I have never had anyone respond badly. Just laugh and say they're good too. One time a guy laughed and said ""You know, you're the first one not to run away from me today."" We chatted for a bit as we were walking in the same direction and I explained frankly, without offense, why I didn't like what he had done though and why he shouldn't do it. He apologised and we went our separate ways.

This was a scary looking guy and it was quite late in a major city, for context. I have tons of these stories, if you wanna hear more. Or if you wanna give me more phrases for which I can formulate responses. I've heard it all.

Respond. It breaks their weird persona. They become human all of the sudden and you become human too.

It's important to remember you're just people. Be people. Make yourself a person to them and them a person to you.

I found myself often not seeing these catcallers as people, just inconveniences. Kind of like how some people will treat waiters or service staff as not really people ( I don't do that, just an example). They were like honking cars to me. And then I sat down and thought about it one day. They are someone's children, there are people in world who love them and people they love, they might have pets, they all had childhoods or one sort or another. I'm not trying to excuse them by any means. In my head, I just humanized them more.

Yeah, they're doing something sleazy, but I've found having empathy in all situations helps the situation. Not sympathy necessarily, just empathy.

I know that's not the answer you're looking for, and it's more philosophical than you might have wanted, but that's my strategy.

I basically just pretend I have known them all my life and act like it. Since it usually opens up a dialogue with them, I get the chance to explain my side and they usually do apologise which makes me feel better as well. Sometimes I'll see them again in the street and we do a little nod to each other. My life is weird.

20140515134342,whatsupwhatsurname,"Something similar happened to me yesterday. I was walking home from my last class, which didn't get out until 8PM, so it was sort of dark. I didn't have my headphones like I usually do so I didn't really have the option of ignoring people. I was at a crosswalk waiting for the walk signal to flash on, and to my left were 2 cars who were having some trouble pulled over, one of which was trying to jump-start the other's battery. To my right, on the other side of the street behind the red light, there was a car full of people one of whom yelled out 'HEY GIRL, YOU NEED A RIDE?""

The two guys on my left who were having car trouble were either mistaken about who he was referring to or just trying to diffuse and responded 'No, we're fine!' as if he were asking them. 

Seeing the need to clarify, the man in the car yelled again 'I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU, I WAS TALKING TO HER.'

All I did was shake my head, give a sort-of laugh and say 'No thanks', and they drove off. Not that they had an option, the light had turned green. 

I don't think ignoring is a good idea either. I think people who do and say stuff like this usually are TRYING to elicit some kind of reaction, and I've found the best way to respond for me (not including instances where violence may be a factor) is just to respond as normally as possible. It's kind of funny, it weirds them out SO MUCH.

The strategies that I use are simply for my own benefit, so I don't feel like I am just accepting their shit comments. It probably won't do anything to make the comments stop, but they are fun. Also, if you are getting cat called, I would advise getting some pepper spray to put on your keychain in case some guy gets too close to you.

The frats at my school have a thing where they make the pledges cat call out of cars when driving around campus. So twice a year for about a month at the beginning of the semester I can't walk around campus without getting cat called at least once. Because of this, I have established a repertoire of responses.

A pretty common cat call is something along the lines of ""hey babe, suck my dick!"" I usually yell back ""Okay, why don't you pull over right now?!"" I like this because it calls them out, usually gets some laughs and high fives from people around me, and (surprise) they never pull over.

Another common one is the ""nice tits/ass!"" I usually flip them the bird with both hands in front of my boobs.

There are a bunch of other cat calls that these idiots make. Usually if it is them asking me to do something inappropriate I will say ""no"" or ""fuck off"" in a really bright and excited voice as if I was really saying yes in an excited way. But I love sarcasm.

There wasn't a single week that there wasn't an entire apartment's worth of furniture/clothing/junk on the curb from someone getting kicked out and there was always at least one guy just sitting on the front steps. It was right in the heart of downtown and just a couple blocks from campus.

I consider myself to be somewhat attractive (very attractive according to my husband but I've got ugly duckling syndrome and I still see the awkward ugly little girl in the mirror but I digress...) I had to walk past ""The Village"" (on the other side of the street) almost daily to get to the parking lot where my car was and rather often the guys who were outside would holler at me and say things like, ""Hey girl"" Hey shorty"" etc. Never anything derogatory just hollering like people tend to do and I think I freaked them out because I never reacted negatively. I would just smile and wave and tell them to have a nice day. The first time I did it the one guy's mouth literally fell open.

A catcall is more like entertainment for the catcaller. It's like trolling irl. I hope that makes sense to you. They want a funny rise out of an innocent person. That's been my experience anyway. I've talked to several of my catcallers and that's the answer I get usually, or they were just raised that way and don't see it as an unusual thing, but no one has ever said it was a genuine compliment.

Now with that being said, from the receiver's perspective, it's definitely not flattering. It's more like, you're hearing someone vocalize their intent to hurt you. I know that may not make sense to you right now, but think on it.

If you were vulnerable and were afraid of being hurt physically, and people kept indicating that they might want to hurt you, you would mind. Especially if these people were bigger than you, you didn't do anything, it's the first time it's happened, you didn't expect it, you're just on your way to work or you're just trying to get groceries, etc. I know you don't see a catcall as an indication that someone wants to hurt someone, you see it as a compliment, but you're looking at it from a different perspective.

If a stranger walked up to me and told me politely ""You're gorgeous"", I would take that as a compliment.

If a stranger, from the other side of the train yelled ""You're gorgeous"", i would take that not as a compliment, but rather as something somewhat threatening, embarrassing, and possibly alarming.

You're right, it's not the end of the world, but it's also not okay. Because you never know which instance might escalate to the end of your happiness and possibly the end of your life. It's not the end of the world, it's more like a possible bad omen.

If we don't point it out, get angry about it and explain it to other people there's very little that can be done about it.

It becomes socially acceptable and others follow in their footsteps.  

Now, there are two schools of thought on what contributes most in a persons development; nature and nurture.  The child of alcoholic, presumably ""bad"", parents most likely have both covered.

20140515120112,Hundee,"There have been scientific studies about how what women percieve as attractive can change when they use the pill, here is a reference to one of them.

""""It’s all about scent. Hidden in a man’s smell are clues about his major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, which play an important role in immune system surveillance. Studies suggest that females prefer the scent of males whose MHC genes differ from their own, a preference that has probably evolved because it helps offspring survive: couples with different MHC genes are less likely to be related to each other than couples with similar genes are, and their children are born with more varied MHC profiles and thus more robust immune systems.

A study published in August in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, however, suggests that women on the pill undergo a shift in preference toward men who share similar MHC genes. The female subjects were more likely to rate these genetically similar men’s scents (via a T-shirt the men had worn for two nights) as pleasant and desirable after they went on the pill as compared with before. Although no one knows why the pill affects attraction, some scientists believe that pregnancy—or in this case, the hormonal changes that mimic pregnancy—draws women toward nurturing relatives.     

Women who start or stop taking the pill, then, may be in for some relationship problems. A study published last year in Psychological Science found that women paired with MHC-similar men are less sexually satisfied and more likely to cheat on their partners than women paired with MHC-dissimilar men. So a woman on the pill, for example, might be more likely to start dating a MHC-similar man, but he could ultimately leave her less sexually satisfied. Then if she goes off the pill during the relationship, the accompanying hormonal changes will draw her even more strongly toward more MHC-dissimilar men. These immune genes may have a “powerful effect in terms of how well relationships are cemented,” says University of Liverpool psychologist Craig Roberts, co-author of the August paper.""

I'd really like to hunt down a full-text copy of those research studies. I'm willing to bet that the effect of the pill on MHC preference/attraction is real in the sense that it's statistically significant when you look at a very large group of women, but it's probably such a small effect that it makes no difference on an *individual* basis.

Additionally, if you are in a supportive and communicative relationship, you should be able to discuss these things with your boyfriend so he will be open to helping you adapt to any changes you may experience. You may have to try multiple pills before you find the hormone level/combo that works for you. 

Finally, I have never ever heard of bc making women's breasts smaller or saggy, that's kind of ridiculous to be honest. Please do some research into reputable sources and talk to your doctor.

I had some issues with my sex drive and they seem to be leveling out some what (I only got an IUD a few weeks ago so my hormones are still sorting themselves out). It wasn't terrible, but I am noticing a real difference in that area of my life.

I didn't experience any loss of libido taking birth control.

If anything, my boobs filled out a little more once I was on BC, and even after having two children, and breastfeeding them both, I don't have stretch marks on them.  (Although, since I'm in my 40s, I think I can be forgiven for a little sagginess, but I certainly never had that from BC!)

One thing I have noticed is that taking BC has made me more confident, and able to freely be in a loving relationship, without worrying about pregnancy, and with much lighter (well, for me, now that I have a hormone-enhanced IUD, pretty much non-existent) periods.  No pain, no mess, no fuss.  And believe me, I really suffered with heavy periods and pain and irritability before.

However, I will say it made me extremely emotional, because of the dose of estrogen in the pills. I take one that is a low amount of estrogen but it still takes time to get used to, similar to any other medication. I would recommend trying it and giving it two or three months.

In the past I was on two different types of combined contraceptive pill which both gave me horrendous side effects including mood swings, permanent nausea and massively decreased sex drive (which probably led to an additional messed up natural lubrication). This put me off hormonal birth control for a few years, but, like yourself, my heavy and painful periods led me to seek out alternatives. I tried a progesterone only tablet for a while which worked well asides from leading to a permanent, albeit light, period. I'm now on a different kind of combined contraceptive pill and have been for 5 months, with very few side effects (possibly some mood swings but nowhere near as severe). 

In addition, it's worth noting that some women find non-hormonal methods can aid problematic periods (for example the IUD). Try Aleese for a couple of months and see how it works for you. In all honesty considering that heavy flow you have it sounds like the best option. Best of luck.",1,t3_25myg9

No two birth control methods are exactly alike, and chances are, you will not have the exact same experiences with birth control as your friend. I recommend talking with your gyno about your concerns, and decide together what may be a good option for your lifestyle. Unless side effects are horrible (i.e. scary depression, etc.) try and stick with it for a couple months and see how your body adjusts (disclaimer: I'm NOT a doctor, so if your gyno suggests differently, listen to them). Listen to what your body is telling you - not rare horror stories that most likely have nothing to do with your body.
Personally, I had to try a lot of different methods before I found what worked for me. But, being patient and having open communication with your gyno makes the whole process pretty doable, and very much so worth it.

As far as I know it didn't make me any more or less attracted to my boyfriend of the time.

I'll try give you some information on the options available so that you know what to read up on and what questions to ask:

* The pills you have use different progesterone analogs. Both the pills you tried contain Ethinyl Estradiol (estrogen analog), although Minastrin already has fairly low levels of this compound.... you could try a pill with mestranol in it, although this compound is metabolized to ethinyl estradiol anyways.

* If it is an estrogen sensitivity, you could try a progestin-only pill. Note that these require more strict adherence to taking them at the same time.

* Another option could be to go with a more localized dose, such as Nuva Ring. 

* The hormonal IUD (Mirena in the US) is an option. It doesn't have estrogen analogs, but on the other hand, it cannot be removed without medical supervision, so if you do have adverse affects, it isn't as easy as stopping the pill. It's probably an alternative that you consider only after successful use of progestin-only pills.

* The best non-hormonal reversible method of birth control is the copper IUD. I use this method of birth control. If you want to avoid hormones all together, this is probably your best bet. I'm happy to answer questions you may have about it.",2,t3_25nlnm
20140515154338,nerdscallmegeek,"There are a number of other options besides pills available to you. The patch, nuva ring, depo shot (which I dont recommend) arm implant, two types of hormonal IUD and the non hormonal copper IUD. 

Starting on hormones will probably mess with your system for a few months while your body gets used to it regardless of what type you get on. If you keep stopping using them after two days, your body will never get past that initial phase.

Women are so brow-beaten and discouraged from pressing charges that most rapists are never brought in for questioning, let alone charged with anything or brought to trial.  
In my case, when I was raped in college, the school put such enormous pressure on me to not even go to the police, saying they were corrupt, that because the college was in a bad neighborhood that this wouldn't even be a priority, that townies were prejudiced against the college students. So I instead went through the ""college judicial system,"" where I was told they wouldn't suspend him or expel him because it would ""ruin his life"". Even though the standard they're supposed to make decisions off of is ""preponderance of evidence"" (meaning more likely than not) and he had ADMITTED to doing it in front of the head of residential life (he was an RA - thus, employed by the college), nothing happened. He even continued to be an RA in the dorm for the rest of the year, and I had to sit there, terrified in my room, as he did rounds every day.

During my time, I had 3 girls report a rape to me and a 4th who didn't want to press charges. On top of that, I stopped a girl from drinking a drugged drink at a frat party my junior year. Anyone who believes in the false accusation bullshit has never actually dealt with a girl who went from the happiest person in the world to insanely depressed in a spam of hours. This shit happens almost regularly and its disgusting. The issue is societal. Many men have been taught that their masculinity is based on their sexuality and this has given many a sense of entitlement that they don't deserve. This is extra prevalent in frat communities where groupthink keeps the guys from calling each other on their predatory behavior and in the military (of which I'm a part). To get at the rape issue, you first have to address the societal issue that allows many perpetrators to not even think of it as rape. 

As an aside, I knew a couple of the rapists I had to deal with as an RA. Many of them ARE charismatic and that is the other issue. People find it hard to believe that Joe,  the nice guy down the hall, could do something so evil but what's the first thing the neighbors always say about serial killers?

I think this is a huge part of the problem. We societally still portray rapists as inherently evil.

It's a decision, it's a terrible decision with grievous consequences, it's a terrible decision that should have serious legal repercussions.

Op said he ""asked why she didn't scream or push him off of her.""

Obviously this is to see if there exist any holes in her story. Once again, they don't want to arrest someone as soon as someone claims they were raped. If you weren't aware, arrest records **never** go away.

This is the only thing he probably did wrong. I agree, telling her she should have gone earlier doesn't help much.

Op said he ""asked how she knows she hadn't consented if she had been drunk."" Obviously a rape accusation isn't as reliable if the alleged victim is so drunk they can't remember what happened.

It has nothing to do with him not believing her, and everything to do with asking a question objectively so as not to lead her to say anything, etc. If he had asked, ""were you drunk enough so i could make sure this becomes aggravated rape?""

The officer had to use the term ""alleged"" because that's what's appropriate before it's been officially judged. It wasn't disrespectful nor was he discrediting her awful experience. He was adhering to the law. He also must have asked her her sobriety so their can be a clear statement. Knowing her sexual activity was, again, standard and important. 

I'm sorry that things didn't go as we all feel they should have for OPs friend, I truly am, but in this day and age because there are people who DO cry rape, it's that officer's job to ask the tough questions so that he and the people working the case can make the best decision regarding the handling of the crime. We all (you, me, OP, that cop) want rapists off the street. That being said: the friend should go to someone else at the station and try again. The fact remains that he couldn't find anything tangible, but someone else may be able to look at her case in a different light. 

Remember: cops want to catch bad guys. It's what they sign up for. Hell, as I type this, my boyfriend is studying for a law exam he will be taking at the Police Academy next Monday. He sleeps about 4.5 hours a night, gets his ass kicked at the academy all day, then studies all night when he gets home. His whole life is consumed by learning how to protect, and then training in order to do it effectively. Cops know the laws. They know what charges they can make stick, and what can't. Although some of them can be a bit gallows-ish in humor and outlook, every single one of them strap into a vest every work day, get spit on, get shot at, and risk their lives on a daily basis to protect and serve people. Just this morning my local police station buried a 25 year old officer. These people are willing to, and do, die while trying to help. They're not going to brush off a rape victim, it's not in their nature. 

What is happening here is that OPs emotional feelings are geared towards a matter which had very black and white legal rules. The case her friend has doesn't meet the criteria of the rules the cop must follow in order to pursue a case. There is only so much a cop can do when the evidence is gone, it's been a week, sobriety is in question, etc. It sucks a LOT, but they have to adhere to the rules. ",7,t3_25nvmy
20140516024619,FlewPlaysGames,"Yes he's required to ask questions, but he's supposed to take allegations seriously, and from OP's story, it seems that the officer already new she was making it up before he even listened. Innocent until proven guilty applies both ways - you can't assume someone is just wasting police time until you have evidence of that. There's no proof she's lying, so she should be taken seriously and her complaint investigated. 

There's a world of difference between a police officer saying, ""I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do"" and ""drunken idiots deserve to be raped"". Questions such as;
> how she knows she hadn't consented if she had been drunk

and 

>why she didn't scream or push him off of her

Offense intended and offense taken are entirely different things. You can choose to take offense at things, or you can choose not to. It seems that OP is choosing to take offense to questions that are not only standard. But are valid and *required* by the officer in order to do their job correctly. 

Edit- I absolutely think sensitivity training is important. But I don't think those questions are inherently insensitive. They're valid questions that need a valid answer. Her sobriety affects the charge of the crime. Her awareness does as well. If she fought or screamed, that's another way they can validate an aggravated rape vs rape charge. 

People are getting really upset over questions cop use to make charges stuck longer to the pieces of filth who rape. I think it's important to learn about WHY the cops are asking what they're asking when they ask. *Every single question* cops ask are asked to form a greater picture and understanding of the crime. 

There were photographs of my rape, and a video. The cops had the video, saw me fighting back, and STILL had to ask those questions. It's all a matter of protocol and gaining information. I didn't report my rape initially. Someone else reported theirs which led to the discovery of video tapes, mine being one of them.

Additionally, rough sex, or sex without proper lubrication, or sex with a girth-y person, can sometimes leave tears in the vaginal cavity.

>>Shouldn't a police officer understand that dealing with trauma victims is part of their job? Shouldn't that knowledge alone make you at least slightly understanding of the fact that some things take time? That you should be a little bit more gentle with victims and not treat them as suspects? Am I just crazy?

I can't speak to his tone and demeanor.  I wasn't there, I don't know how he phrased the questions but none of his questions were inappropriate on their face.  The one exception I see is 'Why didn't you scream or push him off you'.  That's something we need to know but shouldn't be phrased so adversarially.  As for saying she should have reported it sooner, that's certainly inappropriate if phrased that way.  If he just asked why that's not inappropriate.  

As for dealing with trauma victims: you have to understand where we are coming from.  I hate to feed the MR trolls, but the vast majority of crime 'reports' are bullshit.  This includes rape.  We take a lot of reports for rape that aren't rapes like we do every crime.  This means we need to ask hard questions and push even our victims and witnesses.  How much or how little is hard to say.  I'm sorry the process isn't easier but to a certain extent it has to be that way.

I've handcuffed grieving family members, interrogated victims of any number of crimes and had to yell at gunshot victims.  It's not easy to do what we need to do and be able to spare everyone's feelings at the same time.

>>And, if possible, I want to know if there is any legal action that we can take in order to file a new police report, although I'm sure that's not actually possible once the original is filed, or maybe take action against that officer?

Filing a new report is referred to as cop shopping and it's generally frowned upon.  About 98% of the time I get these I send them back to the original officer.  With something as serious as a rape, I'd recommend going down to the station and ask to speak with their Sex Crimes Unit directly if at all possible.  You may have some luck there, but I imagine unless they know the original cop and consider him an idiot you won't have much luck.  

As for filing a complaint, like others here have said, every police department has a complaint system.  Call the main desk and advise them that you'd like to make a complaint about an officer.  Then you have to keep hounding them to get the results.  Here I'm getting into fuzzier territory, but for us you'll either get a notification that it's been handled internally or a notice that it was referred to Internal Affairs.  If it's handled internally and you call again to say you aren't satisfied that will almost always get it pushed to IA.

When you do go in to file a complaint my biggest piece of advice:  Keep your cool.  You're not going to like the process and it's frustrating and even when they are doing something it will feel like they aren't. But if you go in there yelling and screaming it undermines your case and lets them paint you as the unreasonable one.  Be as poised as you can and you'll get a lot more traction.",17,t3_25nvmy

20140516100459,Curiosities,">  I hate to feed the MR trolls, but the vast majority of crime 'reports' are bullshit. This includes rape. We take a lot of reports for rape that aren't rapes like we do every crime. 

How do you know for a fact? Statistically, only about 3% of reported rapes are deemed to be false. And most rapes (no matter the gender or sex of the victim) aren't even reported. So do you just privately judge these people who have had the courage to report it? And then put these reports in the file, never to be seen again? No wonder cops in many places have a stockpile of untested rape kits 

How does this work? Isn't it your job to take the reports and take action?

Then again, I've been threatened with a disorderly conduct arrest *for crying* at a police station while trying to seek help directly with someone else after an officer left my house after saying he'd be right back to take a report ( for a trespassing incident) and then left and went back to the station. I can't exactly say I'd be surprised.",6,t3_25nvmy
20140516110215,copaway,">>Statistically, only about 3%

There is no statistic for false reports about rape.  Anyone who has quoted them to you, including the researchers, are idiots.  There is absolutely no way to measure the number of reports that are false because there is no way to verify what actually happened.

The 3% number is from a British Home Office study where the police classified 8% as false reports.  Basically they said, the police said 8% and we said 3% - because we think the police over report false claims.  

And those are cases where you can even go far enough to designate something as false.  A victim comes in with a shaky story that doesn't make a lot of sense.  The accused claims its a lie.  But his story isn't 100% either.  (Everyone had been drinking, he claims it was consensual, she says she said no, it's 2 weeks on so there's no usable forensics and both sets of friends back thier friends story) 

No charges ever go forward because the case isn't winnable, but you're not going to file it as false reports either.

Is that a false report or an unwinnable case?  Who knows?  

Which takes you to how I ""know"".  I've been on the job for a while, I've dealt with many sexual assaults and spent time talking with our sex crimes guys who see the actual cases not the official reports and numbers.  

I've taken many reports that don't hold water and the victim then refuses to take any calls or speak with sex crimes detectives.  I'm sure some of those are just cold feet, but I'm also sure that many of them are people who wanted the report but not the charge, or who got nervous when their story didn't hold.

>>Isn't it your job to take the reports and take action?

We don't take action just because someone reported a crime.  We take action when it's warranted and we believe the case can be proven in a court of law.  That's the decision of the officers and DAs handling the case.",3,t3_25nvmy

Look up the laws in your state. Back in Jersey and also now in the military, it's part of the definition of consent that one must be sober to give it so what the cop said makes no sense based on what I know as the legal definition.

There is in fact a scale, you do not need to be sober to consent.  However you can not consent if you are falling down drunk.   A jury would probably make the determination.

20140516145800,STONER_E,"First off, what happened to your friend was inexcusable. The victim is not just her but you as well. If you are the one she is relying on then you are just as much in the thick of it as she is. 

It's important to remind her that just because one person said it was not rape does not make it true. She will have good days and she will have bad days. If you're willing you should be there for her through it all. 

I feel for her with the nightmares, if she lives alone or is ""single"" as in sleeping alone, that is going to be the most difficult time. Being alone is when the mind starts to think without bouncing ideas off another person. If this happened recently I assume she is probably a mess even if she seems ""normal"" during the day. You should offer to stay over with her if you are able especially when you know everything that happened. Maybe when she does wake up you can be that person who help talk her through the issues. Sometimes just a hug/hand holding/lap to cry in can mean the world. Be respectful of her when having males around or making jokes as that might get upsetting. Help her avoid situations that remind her of what happened. She may seem like everything is ""fine"" but it's probably not. 

There are so many phases of grief and everyone deals with it differently. I think therapy is extremely important but do not push her until she is ready. Rape hotlines are helpful but it can get tiring to not be consistently speaking to the same person, and when it comes to rape the less strangers she deals with the better. 

I have been in your position before, when you both get through this your friendship will be that much stronger and you'll come out an even better person. Good luck to you both. ",2,t3_25nvmy

The exceptions to this were the weekend that I was out of state for a family event and two days when I was bedridden with the flu. She has an autoimmune disease, so could not risk being near me. 

As for physical presence, she lives with a grandparent, who she does not want to share this with, and does not feel comfortable straying too far from her normal routine for fear of prodding questions. Text messages are the best I can do. She is warming up to the idea of me staying over one night to see if that provides any help. I have also reiterated my nightly invitation to her to come to my place (it is closer to where she works, so ""why?"" is an easily answered question), and told her that I would sleep on the couch with her if/when she takes me up on it instead of sleeping in my boyfriend's and my room and leaving her alone.

I'm a little bit confused. Should I take a step back, or try to spend more time with her? I'm doing what I can given her desires and my own life.

20140519171339,STONER_E,"I need to clarify. My intention was not to say you are being a bad friend or not being there for her. I was just saying that most of us hide behind our phones.

I have been in your exact situation before. We didn't tell anyone, it was her choice and I always supported it 110%, I never even brought up the topic because at the end of the day telling all these people made no difference. I was there for the breakdowns both public and behind closed doors. I answered every angry/crazed phone call/face time/text never with any resentment or annoyance. She told me every detail and as hard and as upsetting as it was I was always there. At first it upset me to what I thought was as much as her, I thought I might need to go to therapy too but then one day I realized why I was so upset. I knew it was because I cared deeply for this amazing person who was being torn apart by this tragedy. I realized just like her that I didn't want to face the truth of what happened, that I couldn't be there to protect her. And that weighed on me. Because the monster took something from me as well, and it was my beautiful/amazing/hilarious friend and I wanted her back. But then I realized that I can't be upset anymore, because I need to be there for her and continuously remind her of the person she was before everything happened. I realized that being upset by it was counterproductive. How could I expect her to be better if I am not? And it didn't even happen to me.

One day we got to that point. We didn't need to talk about it. She laughed again, smiled again, even did things that would otherwise remind her of it and was completely normal. It didn't take as long as you would think. I had a job that allowed me to be flexible, I was patient with her. I told her some tough stuff, sometimes she got upset with me but I never wavered. I told her what she needed to hear when appropriate. Sometimes on those really really bad days I just held her because that's all you can do and honestly that's all that needed to be done. I never ever made her feel like it was bothering me, or that I was too busy, or that I had other priorities. And if you can't do that then you should back off, because it just gives her one more thing to be upset about. Because the weeks/months that this is consuming all of your time, you help change her life forever. To me nothing else mattered, she wasn't even my best friend at the time, it just happened to be me at the right place and right time. But I knew nothing in my life was as important as helping someone get through the worst part in theirs. 

Since I'm now spewing my life experience to you:

What I found that worked the best when she was having a massive breakdown was asking questions. If she told you what happened already, the details, then ask again. If she's talking about what happened, inquire about it. Don't just let her spew words out in a crazy rage as it's not productive. If something's bothering her make her say it, she will feel better. She knows you know, say more constructive things. If she's vaguely talking about THE MOMENT, make her say the details because she needs to get it out and accept it. It's going to be the more cringe worthy thing you will ever hear but it needs to happen. 

And if you are truly that close of friends you shouldn't be afraid to ask the hard questions or to upset her more. Because she will forgive you or won't even get mad. 

She will push you away, it will happen. You can't let it happen. You push back and tell her to knock it off ;) 

Going back to your original posting. The police thing is going to be an issue long term. Probably questioning why it happened that way? Why isn't anything being done? Tell her to focus on herself first. Don't let this evil monster take anymore from her. 

Most importantly. Talk to her about how YOU are feeling about this whole thing. She will probably feel better knowing about where you stand. It makes for good equal conversation and helps make her not feel like its ""Me Me Me"" the whole time.

20140515225121,elgarbear,"First off, any complaints made about the Officers conduct will have to come from your friend. You can provide moral support to your friend, but remember that unless you were present during the questioning or are some way involved (Witness to the crime) you have no standing legal to file a complaint. Since I wasn't there I cant speak to the Officers conduct, but perhaps I can shed some light on the reasoning behind some of the questions. 

Asking if she is sexually active is a valid question, especially if the victim had sex prior to or after the alleged rape. Bodily fluids can mix or in the absence of the rapists fluid the victims boyfriend or partner could be implicated in the crime. Saying ""Yes, I did have sex with my boyfriend earlier in the day"" will help the police definitively rule him out if his fluids are found. Intoxication is unfortunately a factor and for many reasons the officer has a duty to inquire whether or not your friend was intoxicated at the time of the rape, because believe me if charges are filed the defense is going to not only make an issue of it, they will make an issue as to why the officer didn't ask. It is also a very important question whether or not a victim tried to stop the rape and if so what they did. Just because your friend didn't say anything (Perhaps she was too scared at the time) doesn't mean she wasn't raped, but once again the officer needs to find this information out in order to build a strong case as rape is one of the most difficult charges to prosecute and win. The officer is on the side of the victim and while nothing excuses insensitivity, it's very frustrating to police when victims don't go immediately to the police so that evidence can be preserved and the rapist locked away where he belongs. Please also remember that until someone is convicted the police need to show impartiality by referring to the crime as alleged. Calling someone a murderer or rapist before conviction is just something else the defense can use to show bias against the accused by the policeand possibly win an acquittal. 

If a finding was made that there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute then that decision was most likely made by the prosecuting attorney and not the officer directly, but since I dont know where you live I cant say for sure this is the case. If your friend cannot find justice through the legal system she can always file a civil suit. Civil suits dont have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt like criminal trials so your friend may find some satisfaction in possibly bankrupting this creep. In any case your friend needs to find a good therapist and keep going no matter what. Rape is violation that lingers emotionally and mentally long after the physical heals and woman who have been raped have a higher incidence of thing like drug/alcohol abuse, depression and even suicide.

Reporting a rape isn't easy.  If the police can gather enough evidence to arrest the perp and put him on trial, you can be guaranteed that his defense attorney is going to ask all those same questions and more.  The police need to ask those questions to get the answers to them so that the prosecutor can be prepared for what will happen in court.  They need to know the answers to those questions ahead of time in court so that they aren't surprised and so that the defense attorney has less of a chance of some surprise introducing reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds.

20140516071310,HabitualRabbit,"I want to play some devil's advocate and point out why the things the police officer asked were neither insensitive, nor unnecessary, nor insinuating any slut-like attributes to your friend.

First off, your friend was traumatized. She's going to react differently to questions. Just because she felt uncomfortable by the questions doesn't mean they were intended as such.

> He asked if she was sexually active otherwise[...]

This is an extremely important question. Why? Because sometimes sex, especially rough sex, can look like rape. Likewise, sometimes rape can leave very little bruising. Knowing when she last had sex and how often she does helps in interpreting the rape kit. Why this was asked by a cop and not by the medical attendant is beyond me, however.

> asked how she knows she hadn't consented if she had been drunk,

Again, a legitimate question. The cop needs to establish that her statement is believable. Had she been too drunk, then no prosecutor in the world could use her statement as evidence. It needs to be established that she was still sober enough to correctly remember what happened. Trauma + Alcohol can lead to memories changing or completely disappearing. Had she been too dunk, in conjunction with a rape kit which may not present sufficient evidence, then the prosecution's modus operandi would have to be fundamentally different than if her statement is believable.

> asked why she didn't scream or push him off of her (she did try to push him off, but she dreams every night about it and wakes up crying at the point where she doesn't scream). 

Again, legitimately used to determine the nature of the claim. This is the type of question a defendant in court will ask as well and it is important to establish facts like these *before* a trial can even begin.

> The officer also criticized her for waiting so long to file the report...etc.

And this is surprising, why? If I wait a month to report a kidnapping then I'll be criticized for it as well. Hell, I'll probably be sent to jail for being complicit. How large do you think your time frame for a rape kit is? Or for collecting and verifying any other evidence? Rape is traumatic, yes, but waiting too long and then expecting the police to perform miracles is just stupid.

The police's job is not to coddle you or hold your hand. Yes, trauma victims are a necessary consequence of the job, but a police officer's *first* duty after a crime is to collect evidence so that a court may determine whether a crime happened. Given the sheer number of false rape accusations, I would rather a police officer ask some uncomfortable questions to a rape victim than potentially waste their time with a false claim, distracting them from pursuing actual crimes.

Please don't take our your frustration on the police. Believe me, that officer probably despises rapists as much as you do. He also sees all sorts of false claims, however. Not just false rape accusations, but bullshit theft claims, or assault charges which were fake. He's not going to be emotionally attached to everyone he meets on the job, that would devastate him.

Your friend needs help, and dwelling on a bad experience with a police officer instead of seeking *actual* help from a professional who was trained to help trauma victims won't help anybody.",-3,t3_25nvmy

I do still disagree with how the officer went about the questioning and the tone he seemed to have used as well as the final decision that no foul play was involved. The rape kit was done days before the police report was filed. My friend made a point to get one the same day that the PP counselor told her that the evidence would only be viable for another 24 hours. Just because she didn't have the emotional capacity to report the crime to the police sooner doesn't mean that she didn't do her best to help with the evidence collection process. Unfortunately, the officer's attitude is what completely unraveled everything for her. She's moving beyond what happened to her, she is seeking professional counseling, and I'm here to help her with anything I can beyond that. She is barely dwelling on the experience with the police officer because she just doesn't have the capacity for it right now. That's why I posted this, because I know she will wish it was done eventually, but she is just as at a loss as I was. Fortunately, many comments here have helped me, though. And the advice I've gotten is how I plan to help her. I realize that none of this will happen without persistence or her willingness, so I'm lending her some persistence here.

You don't do that shit. One it's not relevant, two it's attacking their personal life, three it has no bearing on whether she was raped for not, four when you ask questions like that it's to have a superiority complex over someone, five it's discouraging a person from reporting a crime to a person who is meant to take those reports and do something about them, six there are traumatic things you need to ask, but none of those included any of the above. 

Now that we got what isn't helpful out of the way... The questions that are relevant are going to be painful no matter how you ask them. It's a matter of making it less painful and asking them without attacking the victim or without completely negating the fact that it was a crime. ""I'm sorry this happened to you and you didn't deserve it. I'm going to have to ask questions that will be painful to answer, but we need to get through them"" is the way to go about it.

However every person I talked to, including the vice president of my company (35+ y/o males) assured me I was in no way in the wrong, I would not be working on this project anymore, and that there would be plenty of work for me to do at home.

So while I have experienced sexism in other places, and was worried about even reporting this, you are a person. If you are a working professional, you are entitled to be treated as such. Go out there with confidence and as long as you are doing the best that you can, people will respect you. Those that don't won't matter, and the people that do matter will take care of the people that are not respecting you.",13,t3_25ntvu

Its one thing to be informed and another to surround yourself with so many examples of sexism that it seems like the only thing men do are grope and create glass ceilings. In reality, you could easily be working for a woman or work in a place where sex isn't an issue. If you don't work in a place like that, maybe its best to switch to a company that cares about women in the workplace. Remember, stay informed, but don't surround yourself with ""the sky is falling"" type articles.",4,t3_25ntvu
20140516054037,ninja_jay,"Yeah I have to agree with this, the problem with gender activism I have noticed from both feminists and MRA's is the tenancy to surround themselves with reasons why their movement is necessary. This includes ""Sky is falling"" articles like you mention, one of the reasons I like TwoX is the general response to those kind of articles is ""This is click-bait, and a exaggeration of the real problem and not worth our time"" (At least it was before the sub became a default).

Don't get me wrong, societal problems exist for both men and women, but the internet exposes you to the *worst* of it, when in reality most of the people out there are good people, or at least try to be. 

The problem is; activism needs to a ""Call to arms"" so it will inflate its statistics, bias it's reports and fill your mind with anxiety and fear because it wants to force you into action. And of course, if you kick a dog enough times and eventually it will give up and accept the beating, same goes for activism. Value the world for it's good, there is plenty of it out there, and if you don't feel there is enough? then make some! The best way to change the world is to set an example, not police the behavior of others.

20140516024746,whyamistillhere22,"I have this right now.  I'm a female physics major at a prestigious undergraduate school.  There are currently NO female professors in the physics department.  They just hired a new professor from a shortlist of three female candidates and one male candidate.  I thought for sure they'd get a woman, I had faith in them that they'd made this issue a priority.  Guess who was hired?

Until earlier this year, there was a men's bathroom in the physics lab with no corresponding women's bathroom.  After enough fuss was made, they finally put a unisex sign on it.  But, they failed to install trashcans for sanitary napkins and tampons, so it's still not sufficient to our needs.  I am not going to carry my used tampon dispenser out of the stall to put in the main trashcan, it is not a single-person bathroom and someone could very well see me.  NO.

This issue has really been getting me down lately.  I don't want to continue in physics, I want to go to engineering grad school, but I haven't thrived in this environment so I know it'll be a struggle for me to get into a decent institution.

I'm the only programmer who also happens to be a woman at the game studio I work in.  Most days are just normal days.  Some days the microagressions get to me.  Then there are the handful of days that are really bad.  

During interviews you can get a feel of how a company is.  How your team is.  What HR is like.  You are interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you.  Ask questions.  Find a place that is a good fit.  

You do also have to understand that you aren't going to change minds overnight.  Sexism is so ingrained in our culture that it's just going to take time.  So you need to navigate it in a way that works best for you.  Will you speak up?  How will you speak up?  How would you deal with it?  These are things best to know *before* something happens.

My dad was in and out of the picture. She told me that she didn't ask him for child support because she knew he would never pay it, but wanted me to at least know him. She also told me if she knew then what she knew now, she'd never tell him about me and just leave him.

 We lived there for 2 years before my mom and her dad bought (and had built) a house together. My grandparents, my mom, myself, my mom's aunt, my mom's brother (drug/money problems), and occasionally my dad all lived in this house. It was a nice house with plenty of room for all of us.

If you are truly meant to be together, then spending a little more time with each other as boyfriend/girlfriend shouldn't be a deal breaker. 

No sex before marriage, no living together before marriage, sounds like you both come from fairly conservative upbringings. If you want to do those things with your boyfriend, but feel marriage is the only way to accomplish that, perhaps that is why you both feel so eager to jump into things. 

These are just the opinions of a random 30-something lady on the internet who knows absolutely nothing about your or your boyfriend's life, experiences, ambitions, or temperament.

And what is marriage going to do other than legitimize in your minds the ability to have sex and live together? I get that you're opposed to living together before marriage, but what would be different about living near each other in the same town, or even the same apartment complex, while building your relationship up over more time? It's not like there's a deadline that you two have to get married by or they'll take you away from each other here. You can still build a life together without marriage for a while, and know that if it doesn't work then you're not stuck in a bad spot.

Promising your life to someone, your ENTIRE future, is such a huge step. You're tying your self to someone and jumping into the ocean, hoping to god you can swim together. 

You're so young now, you're not even 21 yet and a lot of stuff changes at 21. Yes, the big 21 lets you drink legally. You might find that once you can go out with your friends, you dont want to be tied down like that. And you can say that your feelings wont change, but really you DONT know.

Its about knowing that you would want him to be the father of your children (if you two decide to have them, and if you do decide to have children do your ideas on how to raise them match up?) and reflecting the same qualities as him, being on the same page when it comes to finances. What are his spending habits? Does he want nice things with less extra cash for emergencies/spending money? Or can he settle for less expensive things with extra cash for emergencies and being able to go out to the movies once in awhile? Will you two share bank accounts or separate? Does he have set goals for the future, do you? Do your goals match or would they conflict? Hows your communication? 

There are just sososo many things to talk about and learn about each other and still so much to learn about yourself as a person. Personally, I would give it another year and then have the marriage discussion again. And no hun, you're so not crazy, its a natural thing to want to be married. But i think a lot of times people jump into a marriage not realizing what being married ACTUALLY means. Its forgiving the other person, even when you dont want to. Its learning to choose your battles wisely, and being selfless. Its giving all to the other person and trusting they'll do the same back for you.

However, there is one key difference between all those people and you two: My mom was 31 when my parents got married (my dad was 27). My cousin is 25 and her husband is 29. I used to ask my mom how she could have gotten married so quickly. And her response was that when I got to her age, I would know myself really well and know what I was looking for. She had a good point. She had experienced a ton at that point. 


Let me say this: You are 20. You are still very young (and this is coming from a 22 year old). Chances are, you're still going to change. You might discover new things about yourself. And there is absolutely no reason for you to rush into this marriage. It's not like your eggs are dying or anything.

The other thing is, I've known several people who dated someone for several years, *with* the intention of marriage, and then broken up after several years, even after discussing engagement. Things happen. Circumstances change. 

As someone who was hesitant to sleep with anyone before marriage, I can understand the temptation to rush towards sex. I also understand the difficulty of living together before marriage (my parents would be very disappointed if I ever did that), and honestly, rates of divorce are higher among people who do live together before marriage. So I don't fault you with not doing that. I don't believe it's necessary. I've seen plenty of people who are happily married who never lived together first. But I would encourage you to continue dating.

 I mean, again: what's the rush? Give yourselves time to experience some stuff. Live through some hard times together. Figure out each other's life philosophies, opinions of child rearing etc. If you're so sure, it shouldn't matter to wait a little bit longer.

I chose not to do it and have been dating my SO for over 4 years because even though we both know that marriage is what we want eventually, we aren't certain about how well we can make our careers work together and we're both way too early in them to be ready to put an obstacle in the way. But that's us, and we're obviously completely different.

I also had a roommate in college who started dating her now husband before I started dating my boyfriend. When they started dating they knew they wanted to get married, and they did. But they waited until they'd graduated from college because they wanted to make sure that they'd each had time living on their own, being responsible for their own money, food, etc. They never had sex or got close to having sex and they never lived together before marrying. They haven't been married for quite a year now, but their marriage is much stronger than the marriage of some mutual friends who also didn't want to have sex or live together before marriage and who got married within a year of starting dating at 21. They have now been married two and a half years, and from what's posted on Facebook, things look pretty rocky for them. They didn't give themselves enough time to actually get to know each other and to get established as independent adults first.

I think the most important thing to take away from that is that even without sex and even without living together, there's no rush to get married. In the best marriages, two *independent adults* create a family unit in a way that suits them both and makes them both feel happy and satisfied.

I think every girl and woman has the right to feel beautiful and have self confidence. But if women think that the only way to feel beautiful is to know that strangers want to ogle them on a magazine cover - I don't think that's how we should be judging beauty. This movie isn't necessarily a bad thing in a vacuum, but in a wider cultural sense, I feel like way too much media attention is given to this issue at the expense of issues that matter a lot more than this. Now, I am not the arbiter of social issues, so maybe it is actually that important and I just don't see it. But on the other hand, I don't think you'd *ever* see this much attention being given to a campaign to make all men feel beautiful.

But I agree with mudclub that your boyfriend has never dealt with something like this and so he can't help you to the degree you may need support and help in starting to get over this issue. You've viewed yourself in a negative light for years and it's going to take a lot of work to feel differently. I think when your boyfriend said ""not to eat too much"" it's because he had made you promise not to throw up and so he didn't want to to overeat and be triggered and compelled to throw up. He's with you and attracted to you and does not see you as unattractive or big or any of the things you are seeing. I'm sure a lot of his actions are very unintentional and because you feel insecure you're seeing his actions as unintentional and dissaproving. 

I've suffered from body issues for a long time and I can get triggered very easily by other's actions. It took me a long time to realize that a lot of the time I was putting the negative connotations on things people were saying. The only thing I can say is no matter how hard it is it really is worth seeking help professionally, as bulimia is very psychological and hard to work through without proper support. Also from my own experience, trying to put that energy into more positive forms of activities like working out and preparing healthier meals can be really beneficial.

One of the big things that I did to help her was to make sure we were active and eating healthy food because the way food and exercise affect your body and brain chemistry plays a big part in how you feel.

So, I am a trans woman.  Overall in the genetic hair dept,  I didn't end up too badly.  My face and neck were cleared with 6 or so sessions of laser hair removal, which isn't bad at all.  Like a rubber band snap.  My arms and legs reverted to a very standard female level of hair with hormones.  So what was bad?

Before Gender Realignment Surgery, I needed some hair cleared on my parts, as some of the skin would be reused for my new vagina.  For permanent hair removal, there's really no substitute for electrolysis.  That is, sticking a tiny needle into each hair follicle and frying it with heat and electricity.   Each one.  On my bits.  That, pre-surgery, gave me a ton of anxiety to acknowledge.

The box said to try baby oil if there were issues removing it, but naturally we didn't have any baby oil, so I had to throw pajama pants on over my glob-encrusted legs and waddle back out to walgreens to buy some.  

I also had to be at my after school job at the music store in an hour. So I poured baby oil on top of the wax mess, then attacked my legs with paper towels, which of course just added papery fibers to the sticky, oily mess.  

In a panic because I had to be at work, I just took a blow dryer to my legs and hardened the goop enough that I could get pants on over it. It was the most miserable 4 hour shift of my life.

One very good takedown move--say a strong kick to the side of the knee--and then running like hell while screaming ""Fire"" or ""Mad Dog"" was what was recommended for me. (These will bring attention, whereas a call of ""Rape"" or ""Murder"" might be ignored as a prank or joke, sadly.) It is a misconception that a strike or kick to the genitals will disable a male attacker--an assailant on meth or adrenaline can and has been known to chase another male attacker for blocks for revenge.

And yes, for what it's worth, I am one of the ""one out of four"".  Unfortunately for me, I was four years old at the time, and there was a gang of six attackers, so I was gang raped. 

Another thing to consider is the life-altering decision of whether or not one is willing to kill to save one's own life.  Without going into a long story, I was enrolled by a police detective in a gun course: ""Close Range Defensive Shotgunning"" while living next door to a known meth cooker, dealer, and arsonist. The course, and the detective, made the situation very clear to me: killing this man was a strong possibility, and one recommended by the police should he come after me or the property with a gas can in hand. 

Watching fake violence on the screen, and being willing and able to use deadly force in person are two very different things.

Every time, they picked the same ones - who turned out to have been assaulted in some form before. All the 'victims' carried themselves in a way that sent a signal that they were afraid, or unconfident, or basically, wouldn't be too much of a hassle.

I do not believe that simply knowing ""X behavior is bad"" is enough to go on in life.  You need input on what to do instead.  Example: I know it's bad to yell at kids and call them stupid, because my dad did that and it really messed me up.  But that knowledge doesn't magically implant in me the words you say instead when your kids are working your last nerve.  

What I did about it: You can look into self-help books about relationships, certainly.  John Gottman has written a lot about the qualities shared by successful relationships.  If you want to cut to the chase and can afford it, I can't speak highly enough about the benefits of a good therapist -- they're like a personal trainer for your brain, who can point out the less effective ways you are doing things and help you exercise new muscles.  You could definitely get a crash course in effective communication from a great shrink.  Or seek out premarital courses and couples workshops in your area -- it'll get you the basics.   

Also, I would tell your boyfriend the patterns you notice in your parents and ask him to tell you if he notices them appearing in your relationship.  He will most likely reassure you that you are nothing like your parents, but I would still want this information out on the table in a serious relationship.  ",1,t3_25oi5e
20140516115628,-blasian-,"Thank you for your insight! 

And thank you for the book recommendations. I was at the bookstore and thought about getting one from the self-help section, but there were so many choices, it was overwhelming. I'll look into Gottman books then! 

I saw a counselor while I was in college since it was free, but now that I've graduated, I don't have a counselor anymore. I'm going to graduate school, so hopefully they'll offer something similar because having a counselor really did help me work through the muck of my emotions and experiences! 

I'm going to talk to the boyfriend about it, although I'm sort of embarrassed about it... I feel like his family doesn't have these kinds of issues and opening up about it feels like I'm admitting my family can be a real mess, although I love them deeply. Anyways, thank you!",1,t3_25oi5e
20140516105830,eratoast,"I spent 3 years in an abusive relationship, as did my husband. When we started dating, we had a LONG way to go in terms of communication, because all we had were examples of what not to do. First and foremost, get comfortable with talking about your feelings. It sucks at first, it really does, but the more you do it, the easier it gets. Try to keep your cool, too. Take a deep breath and focus your thoughts and say what you need to say. Don't blame, don't yell, and try to remember that you are a team. My husband and I had a fight about his communication, and I'm so embarrassed to look back on it. All I needed to say was, ""When you don't talk to me and tell me what's going on, it makes me feel like you don't want to talk to me. If we're going to be successful, we need to talk and we need to know what's going on with one another."" It's really, really helped. And this is really cheesy, but look up the Five Love Languages test and both of you take it and read the results. That'll tell you how the other person needs to feel loved, and it really helped us focus on what mattered. ",1,t3_25oi5e
20140516115954,-blasian-,"I'm glad you and your husband are getting to be better communicators with each other! That gives me hope for me and my boyfriend. I think we definitely have to be committed to communicating, and you're right, it really does suck at first. It's so hard! I'm used to everyone in my family bottling things up until it explodes at some inopportune time. I'll have to remember the keeping my cool thing, too. That can be hard too, but I'll try. 

We actually did the Five Love Languages test a while back! But I think we both forgot what our love languages are. I don't even remember mine. Did you guys take it together? I feel like my boyfriend might find it cheesy if we did it again, I had to convince him to do it the first time, haha. Anyways, thank you for the input!",1,t3_25oi5e
20140516123906,eratoast,"Yes! Both of our exes would just go off, and that's not a healthy, normal way to communicate at all. If you're getting upset, just stop for a minute and focus on your breathing until you feel like you can speak rationally. If you get to a point where either of you can't, stop and say, ""We are not going to discuss this like this. Let's go calm down and try again later."" Go take a walk or go sit in another room and figure out your thoughts. Eventually, it'll become second nature, but it takes time.

Yes, my counselor said that it's good that I'm aware of these things, but I still feel like I need tools to do the opposite of all the things I've learned. Still sort of lost as to what the opposite really looks like. 

I'm going to talk about it to my SO tomorrow, hopefully! It's hard to bring up serious things like this with him sometimes, or anyone really, for me. I just get so embarrassed about it, but I need to get over that. Thank you!",1,t3_25oi5e

20140515213821,Pacman78787,"I believe that every negative experience can be learned from. For example, a member of my immediate family was nearly killed by alcohol. He and I carry the same genetics, we're similar in more ways than we'd care to admit.  Like you, I was genuinely worried by the possibility of following a similar path. Similarly to your situation, I never had the ""good model"" 
to follow. What I DID have was a ""bad model"" to AVOID. 

You've observed the consequences of bad communication and hostility first hand, you won't make the same mistakes your parents made because you are choosing to be aware of their possibility. Your parents may not have had that ""bad model"" to steer clear of. Their hostilities may be rooted in their own conflicting models and ideals they received from their respective parents. 

You have a better perspective than they did, you're already better off. You will always carry the traits of your parents. You can improve on those traits.

Good luck with your plans of marriage, I hope you find what you're looking for. ",1,t3_25oi5e

I mean, going into her bedroom, sure I can see that as a violation.  But again, in my time of doing these things, my bedroom was not off limits for others to enter, and often neither were my friends'.

I have nothing against discussing rape, but TwoX seems at times obsessed with the topic.  This is a wildly unpopular opinion and I expect downvotes.  I don't care about downvotes though, so its fine.

I don't know why, but if you go into a subreddit that has been around for a while, there already exists an ideology that is accepted and anything else outside that framework is downvoted to oblivion.  Some examples (whether I agree with these or not doesn't matter, just tossing out examples):

* TwoX - abortion at any phase pregnancy is 100% okay and any opinion outside that is deeply unwelcome. On TwoX, an unwanted pregnancy is a lump of whatever.  A wanted pregnancy lost to miscarriage is met with great amounts of kindness and sympathy.  (I offer no personal opinion here, but its what I've seen.  I'm pro-choice.)

* Loseit - just eat at a calorie deficit, no other restrictions on your diet should exist ever.

* Tea - Do not buy tea from Teavana ever.  Adagio Teas or bust.  

* Television - You have to love the following shows: Breaking Bad, Sopranos, The Wire, and GoT.  If you don't believe these shows aren't the greatest things to have ever been on television, you should keep that to yourself.

* Skincare Addiction - Never, ever, ever leave your house without layers of SPF 100 slathered on your skin. Any bit of UV hitting your skin is about the worst thing that can happen.

* Personal Finance - Whatever you do, don't buy a house unless you have at least 20% down payment, 6 months of savings on top of that and never, ever buy a new car.  

* General Reddit - Typically any conversation around God or religion is soundly discounted, atheism is huge around here.  Pro-legalization of marijuana, pro-gay marriage, must hate ISP's and especially Comcast for hte Americans, should be pro-science at all costs and never question the research (even though there are so many examples of science finding out what htey previously learned was wrong).  Pay your bills.  Fuck student loans. 

These are just a tiny sampling of accepted beliefs.  If you go against these ideas by saying, ""Hey, I lost 40 lbs by restricting carbs and working out"" on /r/Loseit, you will be congratulated but then told that it was the caloric deficit only and anything else is insane.  But venture over to r/paleo and they'll tell you the opposite.  Everyone is losing weight, everyone is happy, but there is little crossover happening.

It was pretty obvious that by ""pro-science,"" they meant unquestioning and uncritical of any scientific claims (pop-science and sensationalist claims are HUGE problems on reddit and the Internet community in general. People are becoming obsessed with the ideology of scientism and discovering new, ground-breaking things rather than supporting the scientific method itself, regardless of how boring or disappointing the results turn out). Maybe pro-science may have not been the best term, and you could have called them out on this, but if you read the context, it was pretty clear what they meant.

 >  Maybe you should be spending your time at conservareddit.com. I'm SURE your opinions would be very popular there. 

You're attacking a strawman here. It's fine if you want to question the notion of ""all opinions are equal,"" but the OP never stated that they agreed with these opinions, nor that they are a conservative.

 > No one ANYWHERE that I've ever read here thinks that abortion in any phase is 100% acceptable. Stupid claim on the face of it.

I do agree with you on this, but there really is no need to be hostile.


And maybe you're right that they are unpopular opinions that shouldn't necessary receive praise, but the point of downvoting is to separate spam, trolls, and rude posts from genuine posts, not to downvote those that contribute to respectful discussion, regardless of whether you may agree with them or not (which is why I downvoted you - you are not contributing to respectful discussion by being rude)",5,t3_25p7aa

Yes, I do believe that my opinion is more valid than yours in this case. Sure, rude can be subjective to an extent, but some definitions are much more valid than others. I NEVER said that I think that all opinions are equal, or that I even agreed with the OP. I simply called out what was wrong with your post.

No, I honestly don't care what you think. I only said that as an example of when to use a downvote correctly.


The point of this thread was why dissenting opinion is downvoted. The OP of the post you replied to was complaining about opinions being downvoted. There is an explicit purpose for downvotes. I don't agree that all opinions are equal or that all minority opinions are necessarily valid, but I definitely think that downvotes are misused. Maybe it's an unfixable problem and the purpose of downvotes should be modified to include disagreement, but that's out of the scope of this argument.

It's like playing Russian roulette with you health. Sure a poster may have a question about an irregular period and users will calm her with anecdotes of their irregular periods. But she could potentially have something very serious going on that requires immediate medical attention.

No more posts relating to medical questions. As someone who's worked in healthcare, 98% of the advice given here is woefully inaccurate and can put someone at risk. Anecdotal advice about your best friends mom's period isn't helping anyone.

Get rid of IFF, or Look At Me Fridays.  It's nothing but asinine posts that serve no purpose other than to say ""look at me/my mom/some female doing x""  One such post today was of someone holding a turtle. What's the point exactly? Go post it in r/pics. 

Instead of Fifty million posts about rape, make one mega post about it.  I'm a part of other subs and if a similar post is made repeatedly, a mega post is created for the subject while the others are deleted so you don't have 200 of the same thing floating around. This could work with IFF as well. 

After that, I'd like to see things like, woman of the month. Where every month a woman from science, history, technology, entertainment, ect. is featured. You could feature Laverne Cox, Marie Curie, Betty Holberton, Kathleen Hanna. Instead of lamenting and whining about how women are so invisible, show how wrong that statement is.  Show people all these amazing women who are inspirational and bad ass. 

Quit with the us vs. them tone. It's childish and annoying to read how this is supposed to be such a great and wonderful place and then you see anyone that has an opinion that differs from that of the majority, is inherently wrong, an enemy of the subreddit and dismissed. 

Aside from that, I'd just like to see better content that relates to women instead of Jezebel, XoJane and similar websites plastered everywhere.

Now that it is a default and afraid of an influx of 'default internet male dominated opinion' there seems to have been a massive circling of the wagons.  We have threads that tell men to 'just listen' and then back-pedaling.

1) TwoX sees itself as a ""supportive"" community, where members gather for emotional support rather than ""rational"" argument.

If you buck the trend and try to give more objective advice you are downvoted for not being ""supportive."" 

2) People here are generally extremely left-wing and unfortunately, very intolerant of opposing opinions.  Anything that even smells vaguely Republican, conservative, traditional, religious, etc... is attacked and downvoted with a mighty fury.  A lot of people on this sub came from those type of right-wing backgrounds and have a lot of resentment for those kinds of ideas and people and will viciously lash out. 

2) TwoX sees itself as a ""safe space"" in a reddit that it otherwise sees as misogynistic, hateful, ""pro-rape,"" etc...  For that reason, people here see themselves at war with the rest of reddit, as in certain ideas and people.  When those people or ideas come here, they are downvoted as a matter of course, even if they are being respectful or making rational arguments. 

4) People on TwoX are very emotional.  Sorry if that sounds misogynistic, but its true.  A lot of people have suffered a lot of trauma and are quick to lash out.

I love my wavy mermaid hair. I can put it in a ponytail or a messy bun, I can braid it, I can put flowers and bows and sparkly barrettes in it and I feel fabulous. 

I love my body. It took a long time for me to arrive at this point, but I do. I take care of it and it takes care of me. I love my long legs, the line of my muscles. I love my butt and my boobs, soft and perky. I love my shoulders, my collarbones, my throat. I love my tan lines and my scars and my stretch marks and my toned bits and my maybe-not-so-toned bits. 

I love what makeup does for me- it helps me create the best possible version of my face by hiding the bits I don't like and emphasizing the bits I do like. Eyeshadows especially are so much fun to blend, and fun lip colors give me life. 

I love ballet and I love to draw and write and I love theatre. I love the way ballet makes me feel, like I'm floating across the stage; I love the power drawing and writing give me of world-building; I love the way theatre takes me away, whether I'm on stage or in the audience.

I love clothes. I love skirts, maxi and mini alike. I love crop tops and tank tops and three-quarter-sleeve tops, I love short shorts and frayed shorts and high-waisted shorts, I love dresses in their many incarnations, but especially the ones that spin a little when you twirl (: I love patterns- gentle, delicate tendrils of leaves or little dots of daisies or polka dots or hearts, or bold ikat or chevron or tribal print- and I love colors, from muted neutrals to brights. And I love jeans, and I love shoes, and I love handbags, and I love jewellery, though I don't wear it too frequently these days. And lingerie. God bless whoever thought of that. 

I love the fact that it's socially acceptable for me to show my unabashed enthusiasm for things. It's totally cool for me to be smiley and bubbly, or shy and coy, or even a little sassy and full of myself, depending on the context. Whatever I'm feeling, I can express it, and whatever shape that expression happens to take- from dance to binging on Netflix and ice cream- is, for the most part, socially acceptable.

 I so love to flirt- men are darling when they're all horny and vulnerable. I love the get-to-know-you dance, I love the not-stealthy-in-the-slightest looks cast across a crowded party, I love the way my heart pounds-pounds-pounds when he finally makes his way across the room. And I love to kiss and touch and explore. 

I love other girls. I love the way their face lights up when I comment on that fierce brow game or that bold lip color or that darling halter top. I love the camaraderie that emerges from a drunken field trip to the ladies' room. I love 3 AM philosophy with my best friends, I love the distinct lack of personal space, I love the laughter that keeps us up with the moon all night long.

20140516005129,Hippotamato,"Personally, I think it's easy to look at the world and hate it. Hate the expectations. Hate how cruel and ignorant society can be.. But is's also easy to forget that sexism happens to guys too. It's easy to forget that the world kind of sucks equally, if in different ways for most everybody. I know that's not comforting, but life sucks.

At the same time, though, I think because life sucks for everybody in some way shape or form, we have to look for the best. Life is just as wonderful as it is terrible. It's not that hard to find joy, though, once you learn to love yourself and who you are. 

At first, it's like forcing yourself to smile. It feels weird and you have to focus, but then you find yourself doing it more often and more naturally. Once you start looking, it's easy to see the positive. To dwell in the good that you see and let that light your life. When you dwell in the negative, it's easy to forget about the person who treated you kindly or the random act of love you saw between two people earlier in the day... Especially when you hear the stories on the news.  but if you remind your eyes and soul to taste the sweetness in life, it gets easier. Basically, you have to make a conscious decision to change how you feel about life. Once you do and once you practice, it'll come.

As much as life can make you feel like the world is against you or your gender, you just kind of have to stay soft. Don't let the world harden you. If you spend time reveling in the good, the laughs, time spent with friends,  the good reads, etc., it's easy to love. You are in charge of your happiness. Go get it :)",4,t3_25ouo7

Honestly, your body is just doing what is natural. It's not working against you. Your body is not malicious. *you* might not want children, but don't hate your body over something so trivial as slightly different plans. I don't want kids either (not in a 'not now' sort of thing... In a 'never ever will I want to bear children' way), but hey, I'm just careful. I got a paragard iud and one day I'm going to get my tubes tied. Why hate my body or gender over something so natural? Not genders have to worry about fertility and how it ties into their plans for the future.

I hope I don't sound rude, but I feel as if your comment can be be construed as bitterly sexist. Not all men are patriarchal. Not all women aren't sexist. And womanly things doesn't have to be skirts and bodies (even though that's what's being commented).

He knew another girl there from college meets; he says his 10k time is wayyy faster than hers.  Well, in this race she DEMOLISHED him.  Beat him by a minute per mile.  Our society values strength in a way that makes men indisputably stronger.  But who decided that upper body was like the holy grail?  There are a lot of things that women are really good at, and our world records for things like swimming and running keep getting closer and closer to those of the men.  Women also tend to be more flexible, which can be useful in a variety of athletic activities.  That may not sound like much, but I think female gymnasts are probably pretty thankful for that.

Basically what I'm saying is that a lot of the things we see as disadvantages are actually only disadvantages because society has decided they are.  The issue of strength is just one example of this.  Sometimes I get frustrated, I wish I had the testosterone of a guy, but it helps if I try to remember the things I'm good at.

They preform this lovely procedure called a vulvar skin punch biopsy. 

They take a skin sample in one of the itchy areas and look at the cell dispersion under a microscope. If there's uneven overgrowth and white blood cells, you are diagnosed. They will also test for cancer, because there's a pretty high association between them. ",1,t3_25owc3
20140516092332,SENKl,"Sorry to hear what you're going through.  You need to be sure that you're using the Clobetasol on a consistent basis to quell inflammation.  They usually suggest a pea sized amount twice a day for about 3 months until all symptoms have subsided, then tapering down to 1-3 times a week for maintenance.  Make sure you're not just using the steroid when you're not feeling great.  Also, I'd apply a little after sex, since friction can lead to flare ups.  It's possible your doctor told you all of this, but you never know-- I've heard some horror stories.  Try to abstain from intercourse until all the symptoms and patches have cleared.  I know, that's shitty, but you can always do other fun stuff in the meantime :-)

This isn't as uncommon as you think-- it just so happens that a lot of unfortunate women go undiagnosed for years and years until they look like the photos you mentioned in your post.  I am glad they got it early for you, as this means you can treat it effectively!

I've heard people suggest coconut oil for sex.  If you're not using birth control, maybe encourage your boyfriend to pull out if semen irritates you more.

I do think that this condition can take a toll on your sex drive.  If you've been having sex that's even slightly irritating, it can really change your attitude toward intimacy.  If you have been fantasizing a ton about other men and just aren't interested in your man, that could be another issue altogether, but having any form of sexual dysfunction is bound to change one's relationship to sex.  Maybe you guys need to play around and find sensations that *only* bring pleasure for you.  I know the feeling of wanting to please your partner and just personal desire to engage in intercourse can make it hard to abstain, but it will likely be better for your mental health and attitude towards sex in the end.  You might want to look into dilators as well once the symptoms are more under control.

Before I'm done, I want to suggest this group if you haven't seen it already: https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LichenSclerosis/info
There are many women there with the same condition, and a TON of information about symptom treatment as well as answers about how to make sex more comfortable.  There is also information about treating the damaged skin with topical estrogen cream, and that might be something to look into.

Good luck with everything!

I also dropped out- decided getting married and being a mom was a better choice, after 2 years of college and having no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up.  Fast forward a few years, and the inevitable divorce, & I found myself hating that I hadn't ever finished.  I wanted more job options and to be a better role model for my two daughters. I went back, taking 1-2 classes at a time. I graduated finally, a few weeks before my 40th birthday. And then started in on my masters degree.  I'll graduate from Johns Hopkins next Friday, with my MA- just a few hours after my younger daughter graduates from high school.

I went to a Midwestern public school for video production, and everyone I know from that program that's moved to NYC or LA has been successful, easily making enough to pay off school loans.

Everyone that stayed back in our home state? Can't say the same. Some of them have done well... most of them have irrelevant office jobs.

It's not even a privledge thing. I came out to LA with no job, no car, no apartment, and only about $4,000. The network my school has is strong and helped me on my way.

Technically speaking, as the current laws are written, even drawing fanart for fun is in violation of copyright. Will anyone ever prosecute for it though? Absolutely not. Those making a substantial amount of money off of others' licenses will likely get Cease & Desist orders, but the majority of them are filling a demand that the license holders aren't paying attention to. (Ever see Nintendo make and distribute a flexible onix toy?) I live in an inexpensive city in a house that the landlord hasn't raised the rent on in 8 years, so there's that caveat as well.

These laws will likely get revamped in the next 20 years, but as it stands right now it's laws that no one generally enforces, kinda like those laws in the South that state women can't drive a car unless a someone walks with a lantern in front of it.

For reference--I use a 50/50 mix (eyeballed, not measured) of avocado oil and jojoba oil, and I'll add a few drops of some essential oil just for scent, usually different with each batch.

The stand in the photo is there because we weren't sure what exactly it would do when we pulled the trigger because it looked like it was in good shape... but you know, you can never be sure with a new old gun, so our first few shots were from about 15 feet away when we pulled a string lol.

I just looked at the marksmanship principles. Lots to remember, but thanks for bringing them up. Makes a lot more sense than someone going ""hold it farther back... butt out a little more, don't hold your arms down as much.""

20140517152711,awwwwyehmutherfurk,"Awesome, all awesome! The best advice I can give is crawl before you walk. By that, I mean learn to shoot prone. The marksmanship principles are easiest learned while prone, and more obviously displayed there aswell. It's because you fatigue a lot less when lying down simply because you don't have to burden the entire weight of the rifle. I looked up the weight of the Mauser too, it's lighter then the rifle I had to use in the army (which is made from plastics instead of wood, and is bullpup so it's shorter) so I'm even more jealous of that gorgeous rifle. 


Scratch that, that was the second best advice I can give you at the moment, the BEST advice I can give you is follow the marksmanship principles. They're two hundred years old and still used in the army today - because they're perfect. Because they work. Do not deviate from the 4 principles. Don't worry if it seems like a lot to remember, once you figure them out they make absolutely perfect sense and seem mostly obvious (the last one is the only one that seems mystical) and you'll find yourself doing them.

It will not influence your [fertility](http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/5/1398.short).

This means that the increase risk to cervical cancer may actually be due to the changes in your sexual activities that birth control allows you to explore, It may not be a direct response to the birth control.

It's a very controversial theory. I'm one of the lucky ones who has suffered from the hormone imbalance! I started the pill when I was about 14 because I suffered from heavy irregular periods but was taken off of it after about 8 months because they thought it was causing my migranes. A few years later I just got sick of all of the period dramas so I was referred to a gyno who trialed and errored a number of different pills and the depo which ultimately made soooo much worse, with me getting very heavy and painful periods every 2 weeks. After getting a few tests done It became apaprent that i was lacking progesterone so I was put on the Mirena. Fast forward to now after regular doctors visits and all my symptoms returning after being on the mirena for 3 years  I went and saw a hollistic doctor who was the first doctor who actually listened and it became apparant that my body was severly lacking in hormones, despite getting the progestin from the Mirena. So after all the drama that I went through after being on the pill/depo I agree with the hollistic doctors and their scepticism for synthetic hormones.

At OP:  Just own it.  You didn't do it with the intent to bother them.  You realized it has been bothering them, you apologized sincerely and you're committed to be more considerate of their needs of quiet enjoyment from here on. Basically, you have done everything that you *can* do.    

Don't beat yourself over this, it was an just a mistake, and an honest one.  Embarrassing situations happen every now and then, we can't avoid them.  Give it some time, and I am sure the anxiety will subside, and you will learn how to better navigate this feeling of embarrassment.    Be good to yourself til then, don't be locked up at home! Go out and breathe and give yourself a ~~threat~~ treat!  Girl, you made an honest mistake, you didn't commit a crime.

I believe La Leche League also has some sort of donor system, though I could be wrong. That might even be how my cousin's wife found the family she's donating to. 

I think this is an excellent alternative that should be available to any mothers who can't breast feed or who choose not to for whatever reasons. It's healthier than formula, and it might help reduce the guilt that many women feel when they're unable to breast feed. It could also be a big help to poor women who can't breast feed, because while WIC covers formula, donated milk could allow them to use that money to keep them and any older children healthier.

I don't see any health problems with donating surplus breast milk. I guess you might eat more (which costs money), plus it will take you some time to express the breast milk. So I guess it costs a bit of money (for food) and time (for doing it and for sending the milk in or having somebody pick it up etc).

As for receiving it: breast milk can contain medications and it can contain infections like bacteria or viruses. Of course with these organisations that collect breast milk, they try to reduce this risk by selecting healthy women, running tests, and limiting the kind of medications that they can take, etc, but the risk is never zero.

I am most definitely not downgrading your ""approach to purity, saving yourself for marriage etc etc"" But... it isn't realistic to think that saving your ahem.. ""purity"" for someone or until marriage is going to give you much benefit in the future. Honestly, because I enjoy sex and it's something to be explored, I like my 'developed tastes.' Yes, you have trauma from your childhood, but until when does that become a valid explanation for your lack of self-awareness? Is it worth starting off every story as a victim and ending it without any resolution for your own health and happiness? You were violated, forced to have sex with roomates and abused as a kid.. Maybe it's time to become strong, fill yourself with worth and validation. Putting your ""loss of innocence/purity"" on a pedestal may also keep you from forgiving the ones who did you wrong.

20140516130409,KaySeas,"In a few weeks, I will finally be graduating with my bachelor's degree in Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences. Since I had a lot of trouble finding a job that started mid-June, I decided that I would rather do something adventurous that was also beneficial to a wildlife species.

So this summer I will be walking 382 miles (the entire Oregon coast) in order to raise awareness and funding for Animals Asia's newest project: Peace by Piece. Just recently, a bear bile farm operator decided that it was time to end a tradition and called to Animals Asia for help. Now, 130 moon bears will finally get to live a life outside of their cages. So I will be raising funds to help them create a sanctuary that is suitable for so many moon bears! 

I was pretty excited when Animals Asia e-mailed me to thank me for supporting their organization, which I'm assuming that they found out through my JustGiving account. A few days later, my partner and I received some shirts from them.

And, the 10% women...are they also making $20,000 less, just like her, or are they making $20,000 more than her, and it is just her making $20,000 less?

The details matter.

She should approach this, not from a gender standpoint, but from a work standpoint.  If others in her same position at the same company are making more, and she is doing the identical work, then she should request a raise or an explanation of why she is being paid less.",16,t3_25pqr9
20140516102857,furlined,"Does it have to be assumed that she automatically risks her job by asking?  Generally when a man or woman prepares themselves to ask for a raise, they bring up all of the things they have contributed and ways they have gone above and beyond in their position that warrants a raise.  In this instance, she can merely ask for a meeting with her boss and bring up those points and simply ask that she be paid the ""industry standard"" for her position, education and experience, and then she needs to be prepared to back up that industry standard amount with some facts (not just ""John in accounting says that Simon makes more than me, "" but some actual statistics which it sounds like she might have already).

Also, if she feels that she knows for certain that she is being underpaid for her work, and she speaks to management and finds out why (Do they give her a reason? Is it a legit reason?) then I would encourage her to look for a new job and if she leaves, she may explain politely in her resignation letter than her conditions were leaving were driven in part by being denied the industry standard. (edited to add: this may not be particularly wise, now that I consider it, but I suppose it would be up to her if the reason for her leaving is important enough to warrant that).

The reason I think looking for other opportunities is more prudent than taking legal action is because legal action is money and time consuming, and may not present the result she wants.  Many factors go into pay.  My husband is arguably better at his job then one of his coworkers, but she has been at the company a few years longer, and is twice his age.  His company's pay depends more on seniority than actual results.  Some companies are the opposite.  Some companies do a mix of both.

In short, I don't think she is risking her job if she simply asks for a raise in the appropriate way.  Also, speaking to a lawyer is confidential, so if she were to go that route and simply ask the advice of an employment lawyer, her company would not find out unless she told them - so its not risk to her job to merely ask.  They would only find out if suit were filed and that would likely mean the attorney thought it was a suit-worthy cause.",2,t3_25pqr9

Most of the others have been evaluated and reevaluated, but not hers, and she's been in that position for over 20 years. Part of it is that she's not been aggressive about it previously, but there's people causing her problems, and making her want to be more assertive. IF it is worth it.

If the attorney does think it is actionable, then her company would find out and her job would be in a more precarious position.  That choice is hers obviously, but she needs to weigh those risks herself.

20140516162734,Stella4453,"I feel like a big problem with the issue of women's pay comes from the structures that determine pay in most companies. 

This is going to be a big sweeping generalization, but if a company is making job offers to a position, then they are going to be willing to offer X amount. Realistically though, there is range they are willing to spend on this employee, and they are going to offer the lowest price initially and then negotiate. This is sort of the same as an existing position, wherein the company is willing to make the same raises presented annually (or whatever they do) but will likely have a range that can be negotiated to keep that employee. 

The problem is, women don't negotiate like men do. I can't explain it, but as someone who's done hiring for a company, I've seen it in action. When I hired entry level jobs, applications from women would ask for  minimum wage or leave the rate space empty. Men would ask for even just fifty cents to a dollar over minimum wage and they would get it. Simply because they asked. At the same job I was told that I was the highest paid woman there (and therefore to not share that information) because no one else asked for more money. I had the least experience and I was being paid the most because the other women in my tier refused to request a raise. 

I can't speak for other people's jobs or what a company's policy is. Certainly there are more factors to be considered than just job title and their paycheck. Is it worth negotiating salary? Every time the answer is yes. I will say that it's probably not a great idea to say ""he gets paid this much, so I want to as well."" That's not just unprofessional, that's accusatory. But it's always worth speaking up and being assertive about insisting you get paid what you're worth. Even if that means leveraging another job offer to do it. ",1,t3_25pqr9
20140516140758,Elmer-Gantry,"Unless your friend is confident in being able to resolve this issue internally by talking to superiors and people in charge of pay and compensation, there is going to be no easy way to resolve this issue which would not result in a massive upset in your friend's work life. Employment discrimination and equal pay violations, though they are covered by separate statutes (Title VII and the Equal Pay Act) are both administered by the EEOC. Dealing with the EEOC is very difficult because of timelines by which you must submit or file certain documents with the Commission and with relevant courts, as well as the EEOC's own constrained budget (which limits how much they can investigate matters which aren't really egregious). Talk to an attorney who specializes in labor, civil rights, and wage and hour law. They will be your best bet to guide you through such a process. They will also be much more familiar with what counts as good evidence of pay discrimination and will be able to point you in the right direction. The best part is that all of that can be secret from your employer. 

Fortunately, there's a good reason to start looking back over a twenty year career. The Supreme Court had ruled in 2007 that the statute of limitations on equal pay violations started with the first unequal paycheck and then expired; in many cases, pay would equalize, but any adverse affect of that first unequal treatment then did not count as a new equal pay violation.

I've been here for a few years but have been participating less as the function of the sub has gradually shifted towards being a place to foster perpetual outrage. The fact that the mods shadowbanned my submissions (other than comments) doesn't help my opinion of this place much, either.

My view on defaulting is that it's caused far too much polarization.

There has been an obvious influx of troublemakers who are either posting for the lulz and/or have psychological problems up to and including rectocranial inversion. These people are mostly dealt with by the moderators. People like this are the background radiation of the Internet and dealing with them is just a part of being online.

The other side of the coin has been the reaction of the college feminist contingent to outside troublemakers.  Their reaction has been to use the influx of troublemakers as a pretext to step up gender-based hate speech and silencing tactics (mass downvotes, abusive PMs, etc) against posters who do not accept their viewpoints. These people have largely been ignored by the moderators and have made the community toxic.

There's no longer a welcoming community here. It's been replaced by a war between the kind of easily trolled young women who see rape, misogyny, rape, street harassment, and rape, everywhere and the kind of (mostly) young men who wind people up on the Internet for the fun of it.",13,t3_25q3hn
20140516140432,allialla,"I think the mods should never have agreed to let us be defaulted. They basically threw all of us long term users to the wolves for the sake of getting new users and theoretically, maybe someday, helping reddit be less skewed toward the masculine perspective.

I don't think that's going to happen. The young, angry, white men outnumber other sorts of users so drastically that the result is my favorite sub turning into a cesspool of trolls, mainsplaining, and downvotes for perfectly acceptable posts.

I'll probably be unsubscribing soon. ",5,t3_25q3hn
20140516143906,eff_horses,"New male subscriber, found out this sub exists from the default announcement. This is the only newly defaulted sub I've consistently visited because I think the level of discussion here is far above what goes on on most of Reddit, and it's definitely exposed me to new ideas and perspectives. Hopefully things stay that way as the community deals with the inevitable growth of being default, but so far I find the discussions here enlightening and the community supportive and welcoming.

I also think the users/mods have done a good job downvoting, reporting and removing bad material; I usually arrive late to discussions and haven't encountered many trolls or misogynists because their comments are either gone or downvoted into oblivion. It still sucks that such comments are more numerous than before and that they need to be removed/downvoted at all.

Overall, I'm happy to have found this sub and probably wouldn't have if it hadn't gone default, but I can totally see where those adamantly against being default are coming from, especially those getting unwanted PMs. I obviously can't comment on whether it's good or bad on the whole that this place is now default since I don't have to deal with many of the consequences.",4,t3_25q3hn
20140516125416,XantiheroX,"I am a gender non-cognitivist and a male. Some people would probably describe me as privileged because I am heterosexual and relatively affluent and educated, but I am also a racial minority so I do have an idea of what institutionalized discrimination and prejudice looks and feels like. I do no not identify with any social movements and am generally averse to activists, though I agree with some of the broader points of feminism/men's rights/radicalfeminism as ideologies. If I had to label myself it would be egalitarian. The main reason I refuse to identify as part of any movement or as an ally to any movement is because of the people who occupy those movements and their inability to entertain that they might be wrong about some things. I tend to be very critical of anyone who externalizes blame for their problems before internalizing some of that blame themselves; people who will, for example, cry patriarchy or racism before acknowledging that maybe they could have worked harder, EVEN IF they are at an unfair disadvantage or perceive that they are, or people who look to validate ones feelings before looking at facts analytically.

All this to say that I view and try to treat people as individuals, not as ""men"" or ""women"" or ""black"" or ""white"". It is something that I pride myself on as I have experienced discrimination and prejudice for things that were out of my control first hand. I try to look at each situation as unique, even if it falls into some larger cultural pattern.

I have visited this sub a few times before it became defaulted, mostly just to get some perspective about the things people of the opposite sex have to put up with in their daily lives and how some people, at least the people who occupy this subreddit, tend to view those occurrences. I have recently subscribed now that it has become a default. It is interesting for me to read some topics that I think might be controversial or which I find that I disagree with the majority opinion here, or things I just don't know the answers to. Some of the more intimate topics with regards to bodily fluids I like to keep a rational amount of ignorance about, so I just avoid those, but other than that I think a fair amount of interesting topics are addressed here and I have learned a lot about how my actions as a male may be interpreted by some females and how what I do might affect them that I wasn't previously aware of.

I rarely comment out of respect for the sub. I have no female perspective to offer, though I don't think many of the issues that people post about here require a ""female perspective only"" and I think my perspective would be valuable, if not always welcomed. If I see something I find egregious or something I think is stupid I may make some offhand comment to try to get someone to reflect on themselves, but I try not to argue. If someone is making an incorrect factual statement or asking for a factual answer I can give I will try to answer it clearly. 

Largely, I see women who have opinions which aren't far left dismissed. This place seems like little more than a political echo chamber for radically liberal women; not a sub for all women's perspectives. I'm not sure if that's what this place is intended to be. I don't think so, but that's what it feels like to me. This is hardly surprising as much of reddit is political. I am against ""safe spaces"" for thought, while I am in favor of treating people with respect and being polite. Some people would say this is ""tone-policing"", but I just think it's not being an asshole. If you can't disagree without hurling insults or raising your voice I don't think you are going to win many converts to your cause, and I certainly won't take your argument seriously, which is why I think ""safe spaces"" are self defeating for the causes they are championing, however much they enable the people who are in them to pat themselves on the back.

I don't really care if 2X reverts or not as I am not very invested in this community; but, I think that the move to default, if the mods take their jobs seriously, is a good one. A more diverse population of contributors with more nuanced and disparate views, while there will certainly be and influx of trolls and people just looking to stir up drama, will provide for better discussion of issues and maybe people will be able to critically examine their own beliefs, both the members here and people who might disagree with the general ethos of this sub.

20140516141749,bananapajama,"I'm commenting as a female long-time community member.

I have not received unwanted PMs, and actually I've received an increase in number of friendly, supportive PMs from women who wanted to talk in more detail/privately about their personal concerns or their birth control choices. I've seen an increase in questions about birth control and fairly straightforward relationship questions, which makes me think that women who might not previously have realized that TwoX existed are finding this to be a welcome place to go for this kind of question. I'm therefore happy that TwoX is currently a default because we're able to reach more women.

For threads that are obviously going to attract controversy, I've found that the mods are actually pretty fast at removing at least top-level posts that violate the rules and/or say things like ""as a man"" or imply that false rape accusations outnumber actual rape. For the PSA Rape thread, even sorting my controversial doesn't yield you that many mansplaining/false rape statistics hits.

I've definitely got more downvotes for completely benign statements. I've noticed this is starting to go away. The gross-out posts have decreased in frequency, the rants about being a default have decreased in frequency. Comments on people's IFF submissions are pretty normal...

It depends on the profession.  If you're going to be a doctor, precision and perfection are key.  If you're applying to a startup or entrepeneurship, then obviously you'd better be bold and take risks.

I like Carol Pearson's work on the victim stance.  She points out that it is part of every culture's folklore (there's some version of Jack and the Beanstalk or Woman who married a Bear in every culture).  It is part of growing up.  In many cultures, enforced victimhood is part of rites of passage (it's also true that more cultures have male rites of passage than female ones, but I digress...I can give a source if requested).

So I try to remember that people who emphasize their wounded feelings, who feel victimized by bumps or slights that I now consider daily and routine, that they are going through a necessary process.

Pearson points out that in order to feel victimized, we must also have once been innocent (perceived ourselves as non-victimized, but also as non-victimizers; we lived in Eden where nothing ever went wrong - which is a wonderful state of mind and I've seen many adult women move into that space).  Victims naturally seek out two kinds of aid:

Fighters who will protect them and teach them how to get out of victim role by kicking butt

and

Nurturers who will hold them and soothe them until the pain goes away.  

All of this forms a kind of family grouping, but it is also wonderful to move past all of those roles as our primarily, daily reality.  Love is not merely nurturing, in fact, it's one of the most complex feelings/behaviors of which humans are capable.  Love can include many feelings that some may regard as unlikely (anger, a desire to reform as well as protect, etc) but surely we are allowed to find love and to love in our own ways.

It would be so nice if people at least tried upvoting others who make them think, even if the thoughts are not all pleasant or positive.

Here in the real world, we have plenty of evidence of discrimination against black people, against women, against fat people, against people who appear to be Mexican, against the poor, etc.

Pretending that it doesn't exist, by claiming that pointing out its existence is ""victimhood"" which is counterproductive, is bullshit.

It's an attempt not to look at the real world, by pretending that making statements about it is a weakness.

It's also another attempt to suppress the rights of those who are being victimized, by arguing that by bringing it up they are ""playing the victim card"" or ""being weak.""

Going default definitely has its drawbacks. What no one's mentioned is how many *women* have now noticed this sub. Men are becoming more prevalent. And like any good sub, we have trolls. We don't need the guys to fend off these trolls; we just need to downvote and ignore. Don't feed them, don't engage, just report to the mods.

* You want to gauge the atmosphere about the recent changes, but you want to create a new post to do it, when there is already tons of discussion going on about it.  I think this strikes people the wrong way because 1) There are a lot of people upset about the changes, and the way you've worded your post rubs salt in the wound, so to speak. 2) It seems that you're uninterested in reading the other discussions and finding out what's going on for yourself.
* You want to put the spotlight on men.  This is not bad just in itself, but because there have been so many recent similar discussions and problems related to that in a subreddit supposedly dedicated to women's issues, it's probably not coming across the way you intended it to.
* You say you want to start a serious discussion, but you phrase things in a non-serious way.  I'm not sure how old you are or who you are or anything, but your whole writing style seems insincere and white knight-ish.  You come across as viewing men as needing to save women from trolls or some non-sense.  It comes across as insulting.
* When you say that you want to discuss things calmly and rationally, you imply that the opposite is normal and that comes off as insulting.
* My overall take away is that you are contributing to the problem, while trying to figure it out, and you will probably leave here thinking that this is subreddit of hysterical crazed women who can't even have a rational discussion without flipping out like a bunch of bitches.  It's my impression that you've walked by a an angry hornet's nest and stuck your stick in to have a poke rather than observing from a distance.",3,t3_25qicu

I'm confused as to why you think a graduation ceremony is political. It's just something to honor the time and work that the students put towards their degrees. It's to say ""Hey, you worked your ass off. You earned this. Congratulations."" It's for the students and their families. It doesn't matter in the slightest if those students and families are Republican, or Democrat, or left-wing gun-loving alpaca farmers who believe that aliens are secretly controlling the government.

I'm not sure why you think that would be my call. Such functions are private affairs.

2) Go through an abortion... Despite the mental anguish you might feel. :(

It depends on where you live, but I know for a fact that if you're in the US or Canada you can't consent to sex when you're drunk, so legally you could sue him for sexual assault. On top of that, you could also use the argument that you would not have consented to sex if he didn't use a condom. A [similar case happened in Nova Scotia](http://cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/condom-piercer-loses-supreme-court-appeal-1.2563227) where a man was found guilty of sexual assault because the woman was under the impression that he was using a reliable condom.

You mentioned that your ex is manipulative and wants a baby, and was mad at an ex for getting an abortion. This sort of makes me think that maybe he purposely didn't use a condom, and didn't tell you about it within the time frame for being able to use Plan B, because he actually wanted you to get pregnant. If he's been actively trying to get back together with you, it could be that he thought getting you pregnant would be a surefire way to trap you into a relationship. ",5,t3_25qtev

Every state will have a slightly different definition of rape/sexual assault, but in no state that I'm aware of is being slightly drunk alone by default sexual assault.  Usually the victim needs to be so intoxicated that they were either unconscious or unable to physically express nonconsent.

This document explains the drunk sex versus rape distinction: http://www.ndaa.org/pdf/pub_prosecuting_alcohol_facilitated_sexual_assault.pdf",7,t3_25qtev
20140516224622,alittleredpanda,"You're right - I should have specified intoxication is what I meant by drunk. If a person is just buzzed they are able to consent, but if a person is intoxicated they are deemed as not having the capacity to consent, because their state of mind is altered.

20140517013410,Floonet,"I've lived in SF, Oakland, and London. I've traveled alone to many foreign counties, in areas that were less than savory. I've had close calls and avoided bad situations by doing the following: 

First off, never divide your attention. Don't text, listen to music, talk on phone etc. 

Walk confidently and with purpose. Predators prey on the unsuspecting and the vulnerable. Vulnerability isn't just about being alone. Looking lost, unsure, and scared are also things predators look for. 

A lot of women say walk with your keys in your knuckles. That can actually break your hand. I used to do this until I was told by a self defense teacher not to. It's good to have your keys ready to get in your house/car but getting one of [these](http://imgur.com/Y03Uu1Q) instead is better. Also pepper spray. 

Walk wide around corners, and areas that are obstructed. Large hedges and big vehicles can also make easy hiding spots for your attacker and giving those things a wide berth is good. 

Go with your gut. If you are getting a weird ""vibe"" from someone it's always better to be safe than sorry. You can always turn around and go back the way you came. 

ACT FUCKING CRAZY IF YOU HAVE TO. I have been approached by some seriously nutty people. I just out crazied them. Get loud, flap your arms around, drool, shit yourself if you have to. Seriously. I know this is extreme but it works. One example, I found myself walking home from the subway one night. I had waited for the bus for nearly an hour and it never showed so I walked home. I found myself walking towards a group of young men, they turned their attention towards me and started walking towards me (and across the street towards me). It was as if they were flanking and herding me and they could easily outrun me, beat me to a pulp. These guys were 15-18 tall, young men.  There was no where to go. So my option was to act fucking nuts. I just started singing at the top of my lungs, it made them hesitate, then I started skipping, walking weirdly, saying words that made no sense. I heard one say ""hold off on this one"" and that was it, they hung back as I kept being my crazy self. They didn't mess with me. Sadly I read there were a few muggings in the area that night. I'm guessing it was those guys. 

Go for the eyes if it comes to that, and definitely try a self defense class. It will give you some knowledge and confidence in yourself.

20140517054720,Whatsername_,"It could be a personal alarm. You pull at it and this loud siren sounds, which draws attention.

20140517092914,realberbersilver,"People have covered a lot of the basics, but my advice is that, if you're going to rely on physically defending yourself (carrying a weapon, learning self-defense), you need to commit to it. You cannot take a week-long self defense course and expect to be safer. If you don't practice a movement regularly, you will never be able to do it in a crisis situation. So if you want to learn to fight back, start taking a martial art regularly.

And if you're going to carry any weapon (gun, knife, baton, pepper spray), know how to use it. For pepper spray, that means practicing spraying it. For a gun, that means learning proper gun safety and basic marksmanship.

Can you really use your voice if you need to? Go somewhere where no one can hear you or will be alarmed, and see just how loud you can yell. If you are not used to it, it takes more practice than you might think! You really have to draw a deep breath and want to project sound.

20140517111107,arvidito,"If you get the jet-typ of pepper spray it doesn't create a cloud, so you don't risk blinding yourself. It's also the self defense weapon that requires least training. The first time I used it was in a crisis situation and the guy was shocked (so he backed off) and was temporarily blinded.

The important thing when using pepper spray is that you HAVE to follow up with something - run away while the aggressor is still blinded/shocked, or attack him and make sure he doesn't pose a threat anymore. If it's more than one person, spray them and run.

A knife requires SERIOUS training to be more protection than danger, especially considering it's illegal to carry (at least where I live), you can stab someone without having immediate effect (if you don't cut the stomach open or something like that, it usually takes a while for a stab to cause serious trouble for the stabbed). Many times people who bring a knife to a fight end up stabbed themselves.

I recomend:

* Pepper spray, jet type (easy to use, immediate effect, probably won't cause you harm.)

* Self defense/martial arts, like the mentioned philipino styles, krav maga (self defense), muay thai (my favorite martial art) or regular boxing. If you practice boxing/muay thai two times a week you will soon be able to take out most people if you get the first hit. It can be just as effective, if not more, than advanced self defense technique.

Martial arts is also a great way to improve confidence and make your life more fun!

* Expendable baton, requires less training than a knife (allthough some), gives more pain than your average stab: more immediate reaction. Keep your distance, it's useless in close up combat.

* Brass knuckles, requires no special training like a baton or a knife, but you should only use it if you feel like you could, and would, throw a punch. If you don't want to practice martial arts on a regular basis, take boxing lessons for a month and get a brass knuckle. You will be able to take out anyone.

* And, if you really get serious about learning how to use it, a knife. But I don't recomend it if you want a simple and convenient way to be safer.

I think you should interpret it exactly the way you have interpreted it. We're in the realm of feelings here, there's no right or wrong about how what he says makes you feel. It makes you feel angry and ragey. That's valid.

One of the things that you mentioned that I thought was important is that you're not getting any positive feedback on your current style/manner of dress. That must suck because you seem to be quite happy with your style. That's important too. You want to feel authentic in what you wear.

In the absence of any positive feedback about how you currently dress, how his comments make you feel is understandable. Since he never compliments you on what you wear, his ""suggestions"" feel like critiques. How you feel makes sense to me.

On the other hand if you already had lots of affirmation from him about your current dress/look, the suggestions wouldn't feel nearly as critical since your secure in the knowledge that he already likes you as you currently are.

I don't know if you wanted any feedback on why he might be saying these things, but I think there's some good ideas already posted here:



I think there's a variety of things that could be going on here that the other posters have touched on.

1. He could be expressing a kink or desire.

2. This could be symptom of a controlling boyfriend.

3. It could be a (poorly executed) attempt at trying to bolster your body image.

(Incidentally, I'm curious how much the phrasing matters when doing this. For instance, if someone says ""You would look so hot in that dress."" It seems derogatory since it implies that the dress is the active agent and that it is changing you. On the other hand, if someone were to say ""You would make that dress look so hot."" Is that better? In that case you're the active agent making the dress hot, instead of the other way around. Thoughts anyone?)

And I'll toss out another possibility:

4. You've been together long enough that you're starting to get used to each other.

That's not necessarily bad. It's just what happens. But when it does, we start to desire a change and this might be why these statements are coming up now. That's not to say this is an indication that he wants to cheat or anything like that. This is just a challenge in long-term relationships in general. At the beginning you were each other's intoxicating drug, but now that drug isn't providing the same high that it used to. So sometimes trying something new can be useful and fun. But it should be a two-way street. Everyone needs to put in the effort.

Whatever the case actually is, it doesn't invalidate how what he's saying makes you feel. This is probably something you guys should talk about. How that talk should happen depends on your personalities. 

In the end, thanks for sharing your experience. I have to say, reading what you wrote made me wince because I used to say similar things to my wife and I still catch myself doing it (or thinking it) from time-to-time. What you wrote here was a much needed reminder that, regardless of the intention behind saying this sort of thing, this sort of statement really hurts.

The reason for this being that feminism is an established philosophy that has existed for more than a hundered years, and has a rich academic history. MRAs are a pretty new group that exsists almost exclusively on the Internet, and spend most of their time and energy hating feminism and claiming that it is the worst thing ever.

However I don't like the MRA reddit group or believe it's compatible with supporting men or women's rights for a few reasons. 

First and foremost is that one of their leading activists, Warren Farrell who is linked in the side bar and frequently referenced believes most women who are raped are at fault for the rape.

But by far the biggest reason Warren Farrell is not a friend to women, men, or gender equality is this: 

>**""We have forgotten that before we began calling this date rape and date fraud, we called it exciting.""**

[Here is another article that discusses this quote in context. It doesn't get prettier.](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2013/05/03/putting-warren-farrells-notorious-comments-on-exciting-date-rape-in-context/)

Below that is an MRA who can't find anything wrong with the sub.  

Such a group is no friend to gender equality. ",10,t3_25rftj
20140516234947,I_am_the_Walrus,"Technically, feminism and men's rights shouldn't be mutually exclusive. However, the people I've come across who are a part of the men's rights movement don't seem overly concerned with liberating themselves from stereotypes, they seem pre-occupied with how feminists are devil spawn and trying to take everything away from them. There seems to be this centrally misguided idea that women have tons of privilege, and what's more that we've had it for quite some time, and that what we're due is to be put in our place. So, basically just full circle back to patriarchal misogyny and furthering the stereotypes of what a man should be.

The cognitive dissonance is so strong with many of these people that they've actually rewritten history in their heads to place men and women on equal footing all the way up to the modern era, at which point we now have more rights than they do. It's a verifiably incorrect position, but they won't pick up a history book because anything proving them wrong has to be written by a feminist sympathizer.

Personally, I am all for helping men break free of their stereotypes, but this particular group strikes me as misguided and dangerous, not only because of the revisionist tripe, but because men's rights are *in no way*in any danger. Yes, there are things that it'd be nice for them to be granted, like paid paternity leave, but I think securing paid maternity leave is infinitely more important because the woman is the one who just had the baby. She needs time to physically recover, and most companies don't yet offer that (at least in America). There's a clear difference of need, and I think it's selfish and infantile for men to bitch about not getting more benefits than they already do, when women don't even get the time to heal from pushing seven pounds of flesh out of a two inch hole.

So to answer your question succinctly: yes, I think pushing for men's rights removes the focus from women's goals and rights. I *do not* think that we should ignore men, I simply think they are not in a position of need like women are. If, in the course of pursuing feminism, I can help a man step beyond patriarchal constraints, great. But no, I will not be out there lobbying for men's benefits when they have been given everything and decided everything throughout history, while women still have to fight to remain legally autonomous beings in 2014.

And it's not due to some philosophical lynchpin or ideological keystone, but rather due to small, unfortunate micro-reasons. 

Like how it can be really hard to see something from the perspective of someone else.

Or how even if you try to see something from the perspective of someone else, it usually doesn't do much good if you can only do it to some extent. Like, if you want to sympathise with Koreans, but actually have little knowledge of what life is like for Koreans, then the extent of the productiveness of the conversation between you and Koreans might just be that you make some halfway-ok-and-halfway-not statements and then the rest of the time is spent with Koreans trying to tell you how things are but failing.

Or how generalisations and group-encompassing characteristics is something really easy to make use of and it takes an active, conscious effort to avoid them. The ""NOT ALL MEN"" meme the last few days a case in point. I mean, I could have made a ""NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS"" meme a decade ago in order to spite and ridicule those making that inane and annoying and derailing excuse.

Or how people fall into ""group vs group"" power balance traps, and then wanting to apply the results as a real-life rule. For example, they may find that the Male Group has 47 Power Points and the Female Group has only 31 Power Points, so all members of the Male Group must be reduced and all members of Female Group must be uplifted - completely ignoring that this would at best be an average across everyone and your plan could well involve giving one particular female with 90 Power Points advantages which you deny to a male with 20 Power Points and then arguing that this is great and well because you are doing this on a group basis. Cue how the wealthy son of a black Harvard-educated couple could benefit from particular programs and benefits which would be denied to the destitute daughter of a white couple living in a trailer. NOT thinking in terms of groups and group benefits and group power and wanting to apply that across the groups is HARD, and requires a lot of deep thinking.

Not to mention that it's really hard to even come up with a fair ""tally"" of Power Points of this kind. People will tend to minimise their own benefits and advantages and maximise those of the other. 

I'm going to comment on the posts here as a case in point.

Firstly, you have specifically asked about the compatibility between feminism and men's rights, pointing out as an example the expectation of men to be strong and predative in all aspects, and speaking of the gendered stereotypes men are subject to.

The response here is overwhelmingly a description of how the participants view the individuals involved in the ""Men's Rights Movement"" (MRAs), their impression being overall very negative. 

For example: ""MRAs are a pretty new group that exsists almost exclusively on the Internet, and spend most of their time and energy hating feminism and claiming that it is the worst thing ever. I've never seen a men's rights advocate actually advocating anything anywhere but on the Internet, and even then, they are usually just advocating that feminism is the worst thing in the world.""

""However, the people I've come across who are a part of the men's rights movement don't seem overly concerned with liberating themselves from stereotypes, they seem pre-occupied with how feminists are devil spawn and trying to take everything away from them. ... I am all for helping men break free of their stereotypes, but this particular group strikes me as misguided and dangerous,""

""I think that the men's rights movement would do well to spend a little more time actually working on making the world a better place""

But you haven't asked about what people here think of the current members of the ""Internet-MRA"". You have asked about gender roles in general, and their impact of all men completely separate from self-styled MRAs. It's even said above that someone has never seen an MRA outside the internet. 

So why the significant focus on something pretty irrelevant? Why can't people answer your question as it was asked but must reflexively reach for their negative thoughts about the miniscule Reddit-only MRA group?Because thinking is hard.

Like the assertion that: ""The cognitive dissonance is so strong with many of these people that they've actually rewritten history in their heads to place men and women on equal footing all the way up to the modern era, at which point we now have more rights than they do. It's a verifiably incorrect position""

is completely wrong. Sure, when a situation involves two groups with unequal positions, then it's really viable to discuss which group has it better or worse. Main problem is that better or worse relies on assigning _value_ to each of these differences (like the 'points' above) -- ""women are expected to cook, okay, so that's 4 points for women. Men are expected to work and provide for the woman, so that's ... how many points for men?"" Hence you can never create a universal tally of this since the perceived value of each is extremely subjective, and subject to the grass-is-greener-effect.

The particular problematic term in the above is ""verified"". It is a claim to an unarguable truth, proof, scientific verification. But such a verification could never happen. Yet here is the assertion that it has. Any male person who feels that men have had it worse because historically men could at any point have been sent off to die in the army is told ""No, men didn't have it worse, and that is VERIFIED"". How can such a man ever sit down with and have any kind of positive conversation or share a cause with someone making that assertion? 

Conclusion: I think ""Feminism"" in theory could be supportive of both sexes. I think ""Feminism"" in practice and ""Feminists"" are not, and probably can never be, because people.",-2,t3_25rftj

Does the drinking of people around him make him uncomfortable (if so, why)? I can totally understand his desire to have a non-drinker around if that's the case. Is this the only sort of instance, or is it that he wants her around for everything?

I believe a relationship is a daily choice that both parties make according to their own verbalized and acknowledged boundaries and requirements. We all get different things from different friendships. You don't get to dictate who he enjoys spending time with if you both continue forward within the bounds of your agreed upon terms. 

Your insecurity may be a sign of weak communication between the two of you. Talk to him more. Make a point to spend more time together alone. Make sure you're getting all of your requirements met and he's getting his. Don't lash out or accuse.

Even if he has a bit of a crush, that's no reflection on you AT ALL. As long as he's respectful to you and honors his commitment, crushes come and go; it's who we choose to be with every day, that we want to go through the best and worst of life with, that really matters.",-1,t3_25razh

For some love is a choice and they make conscious decisions to avoid temptation and to progress the relationship. For others there is no outside temptation. It simply does not exist. Everyone else in the world becomes androgynous to them.

The situations that arise that produce certain emotions (those of intimacy and a feeling of connectedness) are also often choices, as well. The commitments we make are a choice, as is the act of straying beyond that commitment. Relationships are a choice. Our emotions are more transient, which is why we make choices to protect them and encourage them in our relationships and withhold parts of ourselves from others.",-2,t3_25razh

It stems from Attachment Theory, which is the way we attach to people, which was influenced by our primary caregivers in infancy. People who attach anxiously tend to attach very hard (perhaps too hard) in their romantic relationships, and these are the ones who simply do not see other people in a sexual or romantic light while they have feelings for another. Avoidant people attach very little to their partners, and have a tendency to cheat, also about 20-25% of the population. And the rest attach securely. Of course there are spectrums within each group.

I have noticed at more than one workplace that black women are maybe the most blatantly discriminated against group when it comes to hiring. Which fucking sucks for black women. And even if I'm the most millenial, non-racist recruiter in the world, there's not always a TON I can do about it - if my hiring manager is subconsciously (or consciously) racist, they may not like a black woman candidate as much -- and black women get the worst references! What if their past employer was a tad racist? 

At my last job, 3 of the recruiters on my team were black women for the record, and I use to have these long talks with one of them about race. She nearly got fired there because she DIDN'T temper herself, and she ended up going to a Fortune 500 company, where this kind of petty shit seems less common.

But, in reality, my advice for you is to PLAY THE GAME. All of us have to do it to succeed in mainstream work culture - male, female, black, white. I certainly have to do it.  Your workplace persona is NOT being yourself - it is a STRATEGY.  Maybe your actual personality is not to bake cupcakes for the office, but if it's a good career strategy, just fuckin' do it, you know?  Working in this culture CAN be degrading for anyone, if it really bothers you to feel fake. But if you don't want to do it, you're just not going to rise in the ranks. As a recruiter, I would never hire someone who doesn't seem aware of this -who can't suck it up and get along with anyone, who can't use the standard resume protocols even if everything on the resume content wise sounds good. An outlier personality may be a bomb ass person but they don't make a company run smoothly.  After all we are all kinda of there as drones ;)

> I felt like I was slowly dying a long and painful death where I sat idly watching the rest of the world life the life I wanted to live.


When I was about 15/16 I got into a 4-wheeler accident that mostly tore the ACL in my left knee. My doctor at the time refused to do surgery or anything like that and just insisted that if I didn't use it for six months I'd be fine. Couldn't have been further from the truth. I don't remember what it feels like to be truly physically active anymore. I can't run, can't jog, can't dance. Can't do most sports. Heck, I spent most of my prom in a wheelchair because it'd been 8 months since I'd had any flare ups with my leg and I was so sure it'd be safe to dance. Just two days ago I was sitting on the edge my bed and leaned back to get something on the other side, the act of straightening back up somehow ""popped"" whatever's going on my my bad leg and that simple action has left me on crutches again. I was barely 26 when a fall left me with a blood clot in my lungs that almost killed me AND on top if it I'd managed to hurt my leg badly enough that from February through October I couldn't walk at all because my leg just couldn't handle any weight. It also gave me the gift of back issues so now I have periods where I can't walk and I also have to be careful because sitting or standing for too long gives me extreme back pain.

I am so, so tired of feeling like I can only really live and experience life through a screen. I'll always be a geek, always love computers, tech, and all sorts of things like that, but damn. I'm not even 30 and yet it feels like my life is already mostly over just because I can't do things.

I just... really don't want to feel like that anymore. I want to live my life to the fullest. I want... hell, I want to be able to live without fear that if I do some fall or some incident will end up offing me just because I had the audacity to not live with someone else.

And I... just dumped a load of text on you. I'm so, so sorry but apparently I really needed to get that off my chest.",9,t3_25se05
20140517115410,dvinmadness,"i'm glad you did. i didn't have the physical ailments that you do but my mind was in the same place.  i'm so sorry that you're going through all of that.  what are some of the things you want to do that you're unable to do right now?",3,t3_25se05
20140517124608,Chieri,"Honestly? Right now it's leave the house. :P I live on the third floor and crutches + stairs = doom. At least it does for me. Though even on a good day the stairs are a formidable foe. Even my ""good"" leg has this terrible grinding noise every time I go up or down a step since years of relying more on one leg over the other has worn it down a great deal.

Truthfully I don't go out a lot. My folks love doing things like going out to karaoke and stuff like that, but I pretty much never go anymore. I haven't told my mother this, but a large part of it is that I know I wouldn't be able to handle the back strain for the usual amount of time they go out for that sort of thing and the idea of making them leave early just because my body can't handle it.... I just couldn't. 

But on a more normal note, I loved to dance when I was younger. I was a ""tomboy"" type. All the tree climbing, karate classes, and stuff like that. Even a few years ago I still managed to do some tai chi and the more low impact stuff, but right now even that's kind of out of my reach.

So a good part of it is that the stuff I want to do is tied to my own physical disabilities admittedly. Which are, predictably, made worse by my weight. And, of course, the sort of thing that could help with my knee issues and stuff like that are pretty much off limits because with the weight I'm at I'm not really a candidate for that sort of thing.",6,t3_25se05

Don't worry, I'm with you on fighting patriarchy. 
But I've been trying to combat it for 10 years now, by redirecting my attention, watching a lot more women in non image obsessed roles (documentaries, talk shows basically) and it hasn't helped much. For example, when a woman appeared on the daily show to talk about Ukraine.

She's not wearing a bra that lifts her tits to the high heavens, because that shit is uncomfortable (source: personal experience with G cup breasts), and that's where half the criticism is coming from. The rest of the criticism is just more picky sneaky ways of judging her for being fat, and generally just trying to pick out every detail they can to judge her for. Because when you sound like you know a thing or two about fashion, nobody can call you out for a thinly veiled insult on her being fat. Right?

Like the fucking shoes. Nobody gives a shit about the shoes. They're black, black goes with everything. If they were sexy black pumps and that dress was on a skinny woman, literally nobody would have a peep to say on black shoes. It is only because she's fat.

The counter-argument is that garb is basically a uniform that you're expected to wear on the field, and if you only care about the fighting and not the surrounding culture, you're not really playing the same game as everyone else.

There's a lack of investment in knowing and understanding trans people, and without that, our roles generally are not done justice. 

I would love to watch a film where trans actors(plural) play cis people, just to see the kind of social firestorm that happens afterward. But ultimately, that's not as fruitful of a wish as wanting trans people to play trans roles, because it's too rare(Laverne Cox, Candis Cayne...can't think of many others without diving into tiny bit-roles). And trans people playing cis roles just...well, it doesn't really happen. It's hard enough getting trans people to represent themselves in media, so that's a much better goal right now than pushing for trans people playing cis roles. They're just as capable of it, just like cis people can play trans roles, but letting cis people monopolize trans roles sends a bad message.

I'm sure there are enough out there who could have pulled off this music video with flying colours, so why did they feel the need to select a straight cis dude?

And while the violence shown is a legitimate plot device for the music video, due to how much violence the trans population experiences, they could have taken a teensy bit more positive route too, at least one that's not 100% operating in a fantasy (unless they're positioning the Coachella part as realistic, which I don't feel is the case). Giving the character some sort of happy ending that's more rooted in reality would have been nice. It would have said ""Yeah, you can kick me around you motherfuckers, but I exist and you're not gonna get me down because I'm still having a good time, and society is changing"" as opposed to ""You motherfuckers can kick me around as much as you like, but I can still lay here beaten on the floor and fantasize about a life where I'm fiercely accepted and you dance along with me"".

I mean, whatever. The music video's not horrible, it's alright. Just flawed. Videos from [Avicii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VJBBUqr1wM) and [Matt Nathanson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VJBBUqr1wM) have handled the transgender angle better in their videos, but at least I can take solace that there's a little more media support out there.",12,t3_25ryi8
20140517123536,AnimalHeroFirstClass,"Look, as a trans woman who feels the same way about ""getting roles"" in films, I would agree. However, it's VERY difficult to find the niche that we are looking for in this video. 

The casting call would be as follows: 

PROTAGONIST, 25-M, - A pretransition transgender woman. Must be pre-hormones, must be willing to out oneself in order to gain exposure. 

But then you have the ""star status"" aspect of it, too. Who do we really know who is out as trans who has not begun their medical transition yet?  And who in the community has the star status of Andrew Garfield? 

I feel like this parallels between this representation and the Avicii music video are very close. The lead actor in the Avicii music video is a cis man named Oscar Lindblad. Both were representations of ""before"" statuses and it was clear that the gender binary was supposed to be there as a symbol. It's hard to find a pretransition trans actress, especially a skilled one. It's a niche that only lands you drag queen or prostitute roles. ",15,t3_25ryi8
20140517125242,lockedge,"I think the star status is a double edged blade here...on one hand, you get more exposure. On the other hand, in this type of trans character role, it breaks any illusion that the character on screen is trans, at least is does for me. I see a cis guy in drag (not necessarily a bad thing) no matter what the director was trying to convey. I just can't take it seriously.

The avicii video has someone who yeah, was cis and looked pre-transition, but I could look at it and accept that the character is trans, I could take the message at face value. 

And I get that it's hard to do casting calls for trans roles. Trying to cast a trans person mid-transition would be really difficult. And casting pre-transition or late/post transition allows a broader scope of actors through cis folk. It's an issue of logistics and the fact that it's still career suicide for most people to come out as LGBT in hollywood unless they're already famous.

I just remember growing up not having any representation at all, and how depressing that was. How every trans woman character was a man in a dress, just pushing the idea that I could never be a legitimate woman, that any goals I'd have for transition would be fruitless, and it honestly on numerous occasions had me on the verge of suicide. I had no one to look up to. No one, and the only stuff I saw about trans people in the media were how sick, gross and what immoral freaks we were.

Things are a little bit better these days, but there's still a dearth of trans people in the media. There's a lack of role models that I feel are vitally necessary to helping the next generations of trans youth from feeling hopeless enough to attempt suicide 41+% of the time. There's still a hell of a lot of ridiculously poor representations of trans people in media. And maybe if those representations were better and more diverse, it wouldn't matter as much that there weren't as many trans actors playing roles (it'd still be an issue, just less of one). Instead, trans men are invisible in the media, and nearly every trans woman role fits into two or three specific subtypes, none of which are ever really positive or flattering.

So yeah...Andrew Garfield playing this role isn't the worst thing to ever happen ever. But I seriously goddamn hope that if he's interviewed about it, that he's at least spent a few hours getting familiar with terminology and the trans community so that it doesn't turn into yet another indifferent cis actor playing the part for brownie points, attention and money.",8,t3_25ryi8

20140517152131,janeylicious,"I still don't get that chart..not that I like faces either.

In my head, my migraines do not even compare to the ""lesser"" up-and-down pain from some nerve damage I have. I could judge the former to be like a 6-8 according to that chart for maybe up to an hour until drugs and sleep kick in, but I know it will end so if I had to come up with a number I'd be like, it's a 4 because I feel like it's just a stronger version of stubbing my toe - I notice it enough that I want to throw up and cry but it will go away fast so it's okay. The latter is just a constant 1-6 and while I have no problems with my job or relationships and only made minor lifestyle changes, it drives me up a wall since the severity and timing is hard to predict (I just know that standing makes it worse) and drugs don't reliably do anything about it. So I want to come up with a number that represents my frustration and pull like a 7 out of my ass. The ""demand painkillers no matter what"" from 9 is also pretty applicable. But this is a lot easier for doctors to deal with because it's just upping the dosage of Neurontin-that's-not-common-to-abuse or getting steroid injections, not opioids.

I know I'm overthinking it - it's probably why I just talk about what the pain feels like and how annoying it is with my doctor/neurologist instead of figuring out a number. Not even when I went to the ER with crazy arm pain from falling on it (during martial arts training -_-) where I could barely talk did they ask for a number..

That being said, I got a hydrocodone cough syrup for a lingering bronchitis cough the other day and the pharmacist was enthusiastically telling me to make sure I noted the expiration date (way late 2015) so I keep the bottle around to use later on because ""it's the same thing as Vicodin! You know what Vicodin is, right!!!!!"" because he thought my grimacing from just standing around at the pharmacy was for pain? I don't quite know. It was very strange.

It took about nine months to be diagnosed because doctors don't really know a whole lot about it. Physical therapy is basically the only ""cure"", and even then, it probably won't help a bunch. Some medications can help, like Neurontin. I saw an orthopedist who happened to have heard of the disease and he referred me to a rheumatologist. You should consider seeing one.

Partner had to articulate circumstances.  They sent me home with tylenol/codeine (which I'd already been taking, I never use a full prescription).  I knew I needed a different kind of drug, but I was at the point of kicking walls and talking through gritted teeth (incoherently, had already taken too much codeine).  

So, I ended up taking all of the pills in about 4 hours and called the ER to tell them that.  They said I could come in the next day for more!  I pointed out that I was just notifying them that they were aiding in my suicide due to PAIN.  Shocked silence, told to see a private doctor.

Fortunately, I was able to get into a private doctor's office early the next morning and he knew right away to give me a different sort of medicine.  Nerve pain doesn't respond to codeine.

They should have known that in the ER.  The other medicine alleviates the pain in tiny increments (which is all a person wants in that situation) and is very hard to OD on.  But no.  They gave an opiate instead.

I guess they liked me, because many people who actually want/need codeine can't pry it out of their hands.  The fact that I was banging my head and feet against the wall, blood pressure was sky high, pulse was up - all convinced them to ""reward me"" with an opiate.

20140517092617,pizzaandburritos,"I'm not in your position but I can relate on one note. I lost a fair bit of weight when I went to college. In high school I wasn't slim, but I wasn't fat. I just didn't have the kind of figure where people would comment on how fit I was. When I went to college, my lifestyle improved and I lost about 20-25 pounds unintentionally. I suddenly started to feel like I was a girl with a 'hot body'. I got a lot of attention and compliments. It boosted my self esteem quite a bit. 

I was unprepared for how much I started to identify by my looks on a subconscious level. I never felt I was fat in high school, but I when I look back to it I now see my old self as fat. I became happier with my body on some level but also not. Now I nitpick about my body in a way that I never did before. I pinch the flabby parts, I look in the mirror all the time and I can spot when I'm down a few pounds or up a few pounds because of water weight/bloating/what I've eaten recently. A tiny difference affects my self esteem in a way that never used to happen before I lost the weight. I discovered that I could reach an ideal state, and when I'm not in that ideal state I'm now really dissatisfied with myself. 

The thing is now I think of my body as a manifestation of my identity. When I lost weight initially it was sort of an accident. Then I started to identify as a fit person. I worked out a lot, I ate pretty healthily. So my body came to symbolize my success. The real success was the fact that I was a more disciplined, motivated person - that's why I took care of myself. But I came to measure that success in terms of muscle and  flabbiness. 

Fast forward to now and for about a year, my exercise routine has been inconsistent. I'm not nearly as toned as I used to be. Most people don't notice it, but I do. The thing I'm really down on myself for is that I'm not motivated or disciplined anymore. I know I could have my old body if I tried harder. I shit on my self esteem because I'm disappointed with how lazy I am. But I also shit on my body and it has becomes tied up with my self esteem. 

I know I'm not fat, but I constantly compare myself to when I was at my fittest. (I don't care that much about weight per se, because I'm about the same weight now as I was when I was at my lowest, but the difference is I used to be really toned and now I have a higher body fat percentage. I feel flabby because I haven't been working out like I used to.)  

Another thing that disgusts me is that I now look at other people and compare my body to theirs far more frequently than I used to. I scrutinize the facebook photos of people I barely know looking at their arm flab or whatever and I mentally pat myself on the back if I'm fitter than them, or I do the opposite if I'm not. On a rational level I don't judge people who are overweight. In fact, I sympathize with them quite a bit because my mom is overweight and I've seen how she has struggled with it. But I still can't help but noticing it and getting kind of a superiority boost when I see that I'm fitter than random strangers I compare myself to. 

I spend way more time thinking about it, judging other people and judging myself than I ever did before.  There's something about losing weight that just set off this borderline obsession with me. Then again I feel like it's not really at the level of an eating disorder, it's more like I went from being pretty indifferent/confident to being insecure, which I guess most women are about their bodies. Anyway, it just really fucked with my way of valuing myself and other people. 

Then add to that that I've been depressed. In the first place that's why I haven't exercised as much. And then of course lack of exercise worsens depression. The depression has tipped the balance regarding my relationship to food. A lot of days I eat almost nothing because I'm too lazy. I don't do it to diet, but I get some sense of satisfaction at the end of the day that I survived without eating. Then I look in the mirror and get even more satisfied looking at how skinny I look after barely eating for a few days. Ignoring hunger is something of an easier way to instill ""discipline"" than exercising for some reason. It's actually really not, but it feels that way because it's easier to do passive things when you're depressed than active things. But in my head, it gives me some sense that I'm controlling my life, in the form of being disciplined about things. That's what eating disorders often come down to. And my depression has a lot to do with feeling down on myself for how my lack of discipline has caused problems in my life.

When I do try to exercise I have no energy because I don't eat enough. Then I get really hungry sometimes and gorge on junk food. Other times I snap out of it and go for a few days eating healthy meals of good portions, but I have to force feed myself because I don't have an appetite. So I feel myself teetering on the edge of developing an eating disorder. It's a lot of up and down and I'm sure it has made my mental state worse than it needs to be.

I don't know what to advise for you because I haven't fixed the problem in myself. I just wanted to share my experience in case you can see yourself in it. If you're still off your meds, your depression is probably fucking with your body image a lot more than just the obvious ways.  For me it's been the depression that has made me starve myself ""not on purpose"" but just because it's ""easy"". Maybe it would have helped if I lived in a dorm or at home where food was readily available. If you see yourself conveniently being too lazy to eat I think you need to set up a system where you make sure you have food handy so you don't ""accidentally discover how easy it is"" to not eat, like me. 

I've found that exercise helps with the depression. You could see what works for you. Try to measure your success with exercise through things other than your weight and looking in the mirror --- the distance/speed you run, how much you lift, how many yoga classes you go to a week, etc. If I were to give myself advice it would be to find a training program to get to my goal 5k speed and focus on that as a fitness goal instead of standing in front of the mirror every day poking at my thighs.

After finally finding a good specialist after a year, she explained that some women develop this condition during/after taking birth control, and she was able to reverse many cases by prescribing some estrogen cream in the initial stages. There is sometimes a lack of estrogen while on BC which thins the delicate vestibular tissue, and the cream corrects that. You may need to apply this cream anywhere from 1-6 months, during which you cannot have any sex to ensure healing is complete. You should also definitely be tested for BV or yeast and take the appropriate meds for that, but stay away from over the counter yeast creams. Also, steroid creams thin skin even more, and made my situation worse (these are useful for skin disorders of the vulva, which I suspect is not the case for you). Try to find a sexual pain specialist right away. Good luck!

Even going to a doctor and having a sympathetic ear can help a LOT. There's a free counseling service through my doctor which I am taking advantage of... you can complain, whinge, bitch and moan about whatever you like, and they will just *listen* and won't even offer advice if you don't want it!

A lot of people feel like seeing a counselor is admitting that they're somehow broken... which isn't true!

We struggled with this issue a lot until we finally decided to explore an open relationship.  We were both needing variety.  I am not a fan of monogamy.  I think that if the lines of communication are open, and you discuss *literally everything* (boundaries, specific persons, situations, etc) it works out well.  Or, at least it has for us.  We both know that we are not going to be a life partner with anyone else, ever, and we reserve all of our deepest emotional sentiments for each other, our hopes and fears, etc..but, we can't help that we just want to fuck lots of people.  That's just a thing we do.  As long as our partners know that we're committed to each other and not looking for anything substantial, it works for us.  Maybe give it a shot?

When I asked my supervisor why he chose me and not the guy with previous experience, he said ""because you were the least dumb of the hot girls who wanted the job"". Yup. The 5 other male booth employees literally sat down and discussed hotness to dumbness ratio after deciding they needed to ""break up the sausage fest"". 

My job required a lot of bending and lifting and crawling under machines. My supervisor would follow me around the booth in a rolling chair staring at my ass from every angle and grinning. He asked me out daily fully knowing I wasn't single and I was going to say no. He became obsessed to the point of begging and began to schedule every single shift so that I would have to work with him. If I asked for a weekend off, he'd try to find out through my friends at work if I was going to see my boyfriend and then not give me the days off. 

But I needed the job desperately so I told myself they're just words and they can't hurt me. Eventually I had to take a week off to go on a trip and my supervisor just could not handle the fact that he wouldn't see me for a week. He cornered me against a wall (in a locked booth in which we were the only two in the building that night with the code to get in) and tried to make out with me. When I told him to stop, he forcefully grabbed my face to try and turn it back towards his mouth and starting touching me all over. I had to scream for him to stop. My trip was ruined. 

The next day he admitted in a text message to me that he had heard me say no over 5 times and refused to stop anyway. Then he told all my coworkers that we had this hot passionate kiss and the rumors that I was a cheating slut spread all over my workplace. So I finally went over his head to his boss and reported the incident and everything prior. I had all the disgusting sexual texts as well as the one where he admits to assault. That supervisor did nothing except try to ask me out himself! He acted like he was on my side and felt for me and I reported it to him because I felt safe with him. He manipulated the situation to try and get a date. 

Shortly after, I just quit. I was told I would no longer have to work with the guy who was harassing me but he showed up any time I was there anyway. All my coworkers thought I was just being a drama queen. My female manager tried to guilt me into not reporting anything to corporate. My hours got cut. Eventually, I just walked out.

There are a few downsides to being a woman here, the main one is that we're required to wear high heels throughout our shift, which can be up to 10 hours without sitting down. Also the main part of our job is to walk up and down a flight of stairs (to seat guests), which I have fallen on twice (could have happened anyway but the heels dont help). When I asked what we would have to wear if we were guys, he said ""nice dress shoes,"" and when I asked why we can't just wear nice dress shoes he didn't really have a response.

The other annoying thing is that we are required to dress like we're ""on a date,"" a short black cocktail dress or blue jeans and a top. I understand that we should look well groomed but I feel like on a date you are trying to attract someone physically which shouldn't be part of my job. 
Also drunk guys often entrap me at the hostess stand and stare at my chest and I can't really tell them to fuck off because its my job to be super polite. I can't help but think my appearance (shoes/hair/clothing color) wouldn't be so highly emphasised/exploited if I were male.",71,t3_25slf0

20140517145406,thisismyname8,"I worked at a library for 4 years while in college. due to the fact that it was the main library and in somewhat of a sketchy area, we often got some rather interesting characters that would come in. homeless people, people from the nearby mental institution (for whatever reason these people loved to tell everyone that's where they lived), as well as a variety of young people, old people, students, etc.

one day while working I happened to notice that a rather creepy looking guy seemed to be following me. I shelved books all over the library but it seemed like he kept following me from section to section. I wasn't sure if I was being paranoid but I decided to tell my supervisor (couldn't find our security guard at the time) because it was making me really uneasy.

I go back to working and eventually creepy dude approaches me. right off the bat he starts telling me how sexy I am, asking me when I got off work, telling me all of the really explicit things he wanted to do to me. I was shocked. I told him he needed to get away from me and leave. he didn't of course. I decided to go to a different floor of the library and of course he followed. ""I just wanted to tell you how sexy you are. when do you get off work?"" etc. he then goes and sits down at a table near where I was working, and anytime I'd look in his direction he would wink. 

at this point I go back to my supervisor again. I knew he was busy so I hoped to deal with it myself but it obviously wasn't working. I tell him exactly what this guy said to me and that he was following me around and my supervisor laughs and says ""it must be that skirt you're wearing today!"" umm, what? my skirt goes down to my knees, it's the middle of summer, and it's always HOT in here because the a/c works less than half of the time..and you're going to tell me that someone is harassing me because of how I'm dressed?

at this point I noticed our security guard walk back in. I go to tell him because 1.) this sort of thing is why he's here and 2.) I could tell my supervisor wasn't going to do much. so I tell him exactly what happened, including the graphic things this creep said to me...anddddddd....he laughs too. a laugh followed by ""you must be enticing these young men with that skirt!""

at this point I was just baffled. the security guard did kick the guy out but not before suggesting that it was something I did. like I said...it was hot outside and the library rarely cooled down to a comfortable temperature. it was the first time I ever wore a skirt to work (it was allowed - I just prefer pants) and I only did so because I had been suffering all summer from the heat. this skirt that went down to my knees is the reason it's funny that I'm harassed.

They had found out that apparently the person who was responsible for making the part was a woman, so as the guy was describing it, he looked me right in the eye and said, this part is ""woman wound."" Meaning that literally the part was made by a woman. It took *so much* effort to keep my expression neutral; it sort of felt like he was intentionally being inflammatory to get a rise out of me by wording it that way and not *quite* saying she messed it up because she's a woman. 

Luckily the most senior engineer (and I mean *the* senior engineer) jumped in and did his best to re-word the statement after seeing my face. All of the other engineers were silent.

The worst was when I **started my own business**. I had a male business partner, who actually approached *me* about joining me in the project I'd started. It was my idea, my baby, but we decided to do it as equals. Anyway, we had a number of local business owners that we went to as advisers (100% male) and potential investors that we spoke to about our plan (also 100% male). They virtually always, without fail, referred to him in conversation. They often made eye contact with him rather than me in conversation (like OP), even when I was the one speaking. They often implied that I should be the one taking notes during the convo. It was a rage-inducing experience. 

I worked at a **truck stop** for a few months. The customers were often sexist and obvious in ogling the female cashiers. A group of guys came in once while I was cleaning a window pane: they made a lewd comment about me being a ""dirty girl"" and made a swipe at my ass. Luckily my manager was great and immediately kicked them out. 

In high school I applied for a job doing **loading and unloading in the back of a grocery store**, since it had an opening and paid a bit more than the front register. They hired me for the register anyway since they said they mostly wanted ""strong guys"" in the back. Some of those guys were flimsy as shit. And what do you know, despite the tremendous diversity of people working there, only the young women were up front as cashiers. 

At numerous office jobs, **female supervisors have made rude comments about my outfits**. In one position my supervisor walked over to me, pulled the top of my shirt up and tugged on my bra and said ""I can see your cleavage. Don't be so inappropriate."" First of all, I was 18 and it was my first office job, so you'd think she could have made her point without being such an ass. Second, my tits were basically an A cup at the time. I did not have cleavage. At my next office job at age 19, which entailed basically making photocopies for a nonprofit, my supervisor threatened to fire me on the first warning for ""dressing like I was on my way to the beach."" I wore tanktops and capris, just like my male co-worker, who wore tshirts and jeans. He got no flack for his choice in outfits. ",24,t3_25slf0

I'd always look confused and say, ""There isn't a man working right now, but if you wait two hours one might come in... Do you want the dirt or not?"" I remember once someone told me to get help... so I called in the only other worker: another woman. That was awesome.

I said something about being catcalled while working and the first thing out of my boss's mouth was 'what were you wearing.' I tore him a new one for that. There are times when my coworkers ignore my idea and then 'magically' come up with it later. I, however, keep detailed notes and will stop the meeting to ask how this is different than my idea and why the points that were problems before no longer are. After about a year of this and calling them out on it they will listen to me now, but damn that's been hard. ",113,t3_25slf0

20140517232843,mindphvnk,"The problem is, now we have people derailing conversations, downvoting, harassing/threatening users, and making this subreddit unfriendly and unrepresentative of actual women.

How this has turned out is indicative of two things: (1) how many Reddit users are male -- Reddit/the mods thought making 2xc a default would attract more women, and instead it's attracted a bunch of assholes and trolls, and (2) Reddit is simply too misogynistic of a site to handle attention put on women.

Reddit as a site needs to **step up** and do something about this that doesn't involve throwing the largest women's subreddit to the wolves. This will continue indefinitely, as far as I'm concerned and have witnessed.",13,t3_25si6v
20140517111531,Ratling,"I think that part of this issue is that, a lot of the time, when a ""not all men"" comment arises, it's not relevant to what was being said, but more so it's an attempt to derail the conversation or it's an attempt for the person commenting to absolve themselves for responsibility/to distinguish themselves from those men who do X. 

The ""not all men"" argument is commonly used as a rebuttal for commentary of societal norms or issues.  For example, someone could post an article saying that men take on less responsibility for caring for the elderly.  Now, this is a true, scientifically studied, fact of life.  There are societal reasons and consequences for this.  When a man responds with ""not all men"" and goes on to describe his care for his elderly parents and that his sister has taken no responsibility, that isn't helpful to the conversation.  It's an interruption that derails the conversation.  It would be the same as if in a social science based subreddit someone posted an article about facial symmetry and attractiveness, saying people who have symmetrical faces are more attractive, and someone responded, ""Not all people who have symmetrical faces are attractive.  I think X celeb who has a symmetric face is ugly."" True? I'm sure it is, but no one was ever saying every single experience fits the general societal norm.  People are saying, ""Look, here's an issue in which women are getting the short end of this stick."" The relevant conversation around that is what that experience looks like, why is that happening, and what can we do to change it.  It's not ""But, I'm a man and I have a short stick too! Let's talk about that!"" 

I would argue that this is a violation of rule 4.  It's not relevant to our experience as women and it's not about women.  It's relevant to men's experience and is about shifting a conversation about women onto men.

The other common time it is brought up is when a woman is talking about her personal experience.  Hypothetical example: ""I was told by a male hairdresser that I shouldn't cut my hair off because boys wouldn't like me.""  A response such as, ""Not all men are like that. I know that some male hairdressers would be happy to cut your hair how you like it."" doesn't add to the conversation.  It doesn't change what happened to that person and it doesn't change the fact that women are repeatedly told throughout their life times that they need long hair to be beautiful and to attract men. It's just not relevant.

The only time when the ""not all men"" response would be appropriate (especially in a space intended for women's perspectives) is when someone has made a tactless post generalizing gender. ""All men suck!"", in which case, the best response would be hitting report and pointing out that is a violation of rule 3. ""No tactless posts generalizing gender.""

We have a rule banning posts for which the ""Not all men"" reponse holds value.  As such, the ""not all men"" response is not appropriate in this subreddit.  I suggest we have a FAQ section, as other members have suggested, and also a list of discouraged comments with links explaining why they are discouraged and possible, more appropriate ways to address issues and engage in constructive debate.",77,t3_25si6v
20140517115313,Nora_Oie,"Is it relevant that not all women are ""told throughout their life times"" that they need long hair to be beautiful?  

I am assuming that this message must be sent out from somewhere (fashion magazines?  Disney movies?)  We don't watch much U.S. television at my house.  My aunt, who was a hairdresser, was all about short hair for women.  All the women I knew growing up had short hair.  Mine was short for much of my life (it's longish now, it was longish in high school).  

My point is that women do not have monolithic experiences and, as a woman, I feel shut out of some discussions here because my experiences are different.  I've always thought different, been a so-called ""tomboy,"" was encouraged by my dad to be one (but not so much by mom, but that was okay too, I'm glad I had *some* feminizing influences).  I grew up with horses, an outdoor life, and feminist teachers and support groups in high school (and this was in a rural community, I was lucky, I guess).

I went into a male-dominated profession (it isn't so much, any more - because there are lots of other women like me).  

At any rate, the only response we should have (according to your logic - please correct me if I'm totally misunderstanding) to the haircutting story is:  that hairdresser was wrong!  Or, look how much culture pervades the mind of that hairdresser!  In short, I'm at a total loss to know what to say (other than repetitively parroting versions of what I just typed) to a person who posts here for support regarding one moronic hairdresser.  (BTW, women who are hairdressers can resist cutting off hair just as much - but that's considered derailing to say, is that right?)

So I'm right to just skip such threads and let the echo chamber effect take place.  I have nothing against echo chambers, they're a part of many ancient rituals, and in fact, chanting and dancing basically do the same thing.  I'm thinking of Clytemnestra's tomb, where the echo effect is very strong and the few things people were allowed to say resonated over and over.  

Anyway, I think I'm getting it.  ""Not all men"" or ""not all women"" are not acceptable responses to ""my hairdresser is a jerk.""  Echoing back ""yes!  your hairdresser is a jerk!"" is indeed comforting.

My only ""but"" on this is that my own problems (and I'm a woman too, and sometimes I'd like support) do not usually fall into areas involving simple gender programming (I know all this programming exists, I study it for a living, but that puts it at a remove from me; that was a deliberate choice I made, and I too like to stay in like-minded communities).

There are some incredible people on this subreddit.  If we are women, shouldn't all our experiences be relevant, though?

Bottom line, what, in your opinion, is supposed to be the right response to ""I was told by a male hairdresser that I should cut my hair off because boys wouldn't like me""?

We are dedicated to thoughtful and meaningful content, not bickering and fighting about men vs. women. But above all.. INTENDED FOR WOMEN'S PERSPECTIVE.

If I protest someone making a generalization about men, I'm not saying I'm entitled to put my opinion into every conversation about women.  And I'm also not taking part in a conversation *about women*, it's clearly at that point a conversation about men.

As for ""[a space] where we could talk about things from a woman's perspective"", as far as I can tell protesting such a generalization is not against the rules of the subreddit.  Maybe you could argue it violates some interpretation of one of the rules, but the mods don't seem to think so as they don't generally seem to remove such comments.

And there are places on reddit where people can enforce a ban on those comments.  There are also places where men can't comment at all, or where certain viewpoints can't be criticized, and nothing's stopping anyone from making more of them.  The only reason to want those rules to apply here is that this subreddit is bigger than those others - but I'm guessing it's bigger in part due to comments being less policed.

I really appreciate how respectful you're being of this sub and its members. It's awesome that you recognize this sub as a place of reasonable-ness (shut up it's totally a word) and level-headedness. That's what attracted me to this place at first, too. To be honest, I never understood the MRM's vendetta against the ""worst case scenario women"" as you put it. As you've noticed, it quickly becomes being forced to assume every woman is this Jordi Arias person (I'm going to assume she's like Sarah Palin or any one of the women the GOP has been trying to parade around to try to get female voters back-they're just as bad as the men in their sexism towards both men and women). It's just so damaging to think that every single woman ever is so horrible and that they are the root of the problem and that they should fix it. Also, I like to think that reading others' perspectives makes you a better *person*, if we are going to continue this trend of not impressing gendered standards onto anyone. ;)

But what you have to understand that for the most part, in the context of this specific sub, we kind of just know that the poster/commentor of course doesn't mean all men are a certain way. I go to my friends who are girls and complain about how guys suck because my boyfriend is being X or Y, and they reply back with essentially the same thing. We all *know* that all men aren't like that. It's just easier to say, and it's implicitly understood by everyone involved. It's just a vent-session that was *never* meant to be heard by the people it was about, because it could easily be misunderstood. I'm going to quote the OP again to hopefully get across my point: 

>No, this is not a ""safe space"" like a ""safe room."" People can come and go, and people can flame here.

20140517163501,keepcooler,"While I'm not OP, I can somewhat relate to her sentiments. The idea of occasionally not wanting to hear anything a guy has to say come from the idea that guys sometimes cannot empathize with certain situations. Sometimes I just want to rant about something that happened to me that men *may* not be able to relate to. I don't want logic. I don't want to have to explain why I felt the way I felt. I just want an audience that will immediately understand and empathize. 

Hypothetical Example:

I'm walking to my car in a parking garage late at night. Several yards behind me is a large man who is going in the same direction and getting closer to me. He enters the dark stairwell shortly after me, at which point I become highly anxious and fearful. Adrenaline is coursing at that point. Long story short, nothing happens... We each go to our separate cars. 

When I go to vent about this, here's what I don't want to hear: why were you so afraid? If nothing happened, what's the big deal anyway?

These are questions that will most likely be asked by someone who has never been in a similar situation, and most likely by someone who is not female. Men *may* not be able to empathize as well with my rant. 

TL;DR: the statement, perhaps, isn't ""I don't want to hear anything that men have to say"".

People have always used appearance as a proxy of internal qualities and it is impractical to change that.

Overweight people usually do not spend time working out, be selective of what they eat, and generally lack self-control (I was slightly overweight but have lost 20 lbs since then) While this is not necessarily true because genetics play some role, it is thought to be accurate enough on average and that's why we see fat people being judged nowadays.

Lawyers and bankers can be perceived as incompetence or untrustworthy by clients if they don't dress in business formal. Would you trust your doctor/lawyer/financial advisor if he/she dresses like a hobo or a hooker?

These things do not reflect their competence at all but are commonly used by people to judge others' characters.

I'm taking your general thesis to be, as you previously stated,
> People have always used appearance as a proxy of internal qualities and it is impractical to change that.

This can be divided into two parts
1. People have always used appearance as a proxy of internal qualities.
2. It is impractical to change this [judgements of character based on appearance].

The first thing I find horrid is that lack of quantification in front of ""People"". Without quantification it reads like a claim about all people. 

""All people have always used appearance as a proxy of internal qualities"" is disproven readily by a single counter example. I'm such a person who does not make inferences of character based on appearance ... therefore that factual claim is false.

A common move here, once a counter example is found, is to suggest that one's unqualified generalisation was not intended to apply to all, but some. That, in your case, the intention was ""Some people have always used appearance as a proxy of internal qualities"".

There are other quantifications you could choose, like ""half"" or ""most"", but I'll go ahead an supply you with the more defensible quantification.

Now, so quantified with ""some"", that part of your thesis becomes true. But it no longer has the force which it sounds like it did, without the quantification. For now it becomes easy to see that if some people can *not* judge a persons' character on the basis of their appearance, which is entailed by the current quantification, then there is no necessity that others *do* so judge.

/u/Nora_Oie reasonably brought to the table the example of race
> People make huge judgments [sic] (and always have) based on skin color, so it's impractical to change that?

Your claim 2., ignores that the civil rights movement in the US, as one example of many, has been successful at significantly reducing not only judgements of character based on race, but the unjust discrimination that flows from that. This is all that one needs to demonstrate that significantly reducing prejudice is both practical and achievable (thereby falsifying part 2 of your general thesis).

Your
> Racial stereotypes are unfortunately still prevalent today. But I wouldn't try to demand the society to change overnight because it takes time

Ignores precisely that it was in virtue of the demands for immediate change made by, in the example to hand, [Martin Luther King Jr](http://www.quoteswise.com/martin-luther-king-jr-quotes-9.html) ...
> We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. 

... that gave effect to the right course correction of the juggernaut of society. While this is a course correction that predictably takes time, for unjust attitudes and practices this will be time that takes too long. But while society is not on the right course we ought demand that it change course.

20140517133344,PirateBagels,"You are not alone! It may feel like that, but know that you're not. Lots of these experiences sound similar to my own. You have a right to be safe from sexual assaults at all times, just like every other human. You have a right to your dignity, like everyone else. You have a right to love your body, a right to your safety and security, and the right to say who, when, where, and how others touch your body.
I'm still in the process of figuring out how to advocate for my own safety and protect myself. It seems like every time I go to a party strange men grab my ass and grope me. I don't go to as many parties, and I don't wear what I used to. 
What I've found helps is surrounding myself with female friends. We are always looking out for each other at all times. I have a couple guy friends who I can trust, that I've known well for years. When I'm on the street, or walking from somewhere, I don't smile at men or make eye contact with them. It's just a good way of showing you are absolutely not interested. Some of my friends have fake wedding rings as a way to discourage aggressive men.
Ultimately, it can be hard to find your strength and dignity in a society that generally encourages a specific view and treatment of women. It's a societal problem that's generally (and I say generally because there are some kickass men out there) only recognized, legitimized, and addressed by the people it negatively affects.

20140517163127,SpaceWhiskey,"I'm so sorry that you've experienced what you have. There is something deeply sad about our society where on the one hand, women are expected to maintain a certain level of beauty, but those who qualify then become subjected to a different but equally shitty style of judgement and abuse. 

I was heavy throughout my late teens, lost weight/got fit in my early/mid 20s, gained a lot of it back for a few years and am now fit for the second time. If it makes you feel better, society will treat you like shit no matter how you look. When you're heavy, people just ignore you. You make a joke and not only does no one laugh, their faces express shock that you dared, as an unattractive person, to speak at all. When I got in shape, I had a bartender roll his eyes when I told him that no one had ever offered to buy me a drink before. I was in the process of turning one down from a guy who I had no intention of interacting with and he said ""Well you're used to this, right?"" It was one of the first times I'd ever gone ""out"" all dolled up, at my friends insistence. I guess people just assume that attractive people have always been attractive. I don't feel comfortable grind-dancing, I wasn't there to hook-up, it was an overall crappy experience. It's awful that women who qualify as attractive are expected to deal with ""the consequences"" of that beauty, which in the minds of some means harassment, dismissal and erasure. Or being used as a sex object. When I was heavy for the second time, part of it was because of the shock I experienced from street harassment. I ate as a coping mechanism, and in some way I think I wanted to be left alone, even though I liked the way my body looks fit. It was an overall awful experience, and I'm glad to be out of my 20s.

This might get a little rambly, as it's the weekend and I've had a few drinks, but my best advice would be to not take shit. If someone sticks a camera up your dress, shame them. Call attention to it. I certainly wouldn't have had the nerve as a 17 year old to do anything about it (lord knows I've frozen embarrassed in many situations that I wish I could go back in time and change) but all one can do is move forward, and the next time something like that happens, make a scene. A calm, confident, ice cold scene. Who cares if they call you names or frigid or any of the things that I've been called since I've started to stand up to the sexist shit that gets flung my way. My personal favorite thing to say is ""You know that's not okay, right?"" Like when a guy I've never met before sits down next to me on the bus and puts his hand on my knee, asking where I've been all his life. ""You know that's not okay, right?"" Or when someone catcalls you. ""You know that's not okay, right?"" And it sucks that this is something women have to think about, but consider investing in something like pepperspray, familiarize yourself with it, and always have it at the ready. If street harrassment is something you experience, whether or not you plan to strike back verbally, having pepperspray or something similar is, unfortunately, a smart thing to carry.

All the negative things aside, please love your body. A very good friend of mine gave me some solid advice many years ago, on how to feel more comfortable in your own skin. She calls it the ""roll in bed naked and feel sexy"" technique. So many people in this world, men and women alike, assume that women exist beautifully for the sake of others, when there is something so wonderful about existing beautifully for *yourself*, regardless of how that beauty manifests. Keep using makeup, if it makes you happy. Keep wearing skirts if it makes you happy. Even if these things are only done in the privacy of your own home. I'm sure you already have, but if you haven't there are many awesome fashion subs linked in the sidebar. 

Please never be ashamed of yourself. By all means, feel sorry for the people who try to bring you down, but you've done nothing wrong by being born beautiful. ",9,t3_25swvp

Dress the way YOU WANT, granted a self defense class is always a nice one to have in the pocket (I recommend Moi Tai). But the bottom line is you should not have to stand for any form of persecution from anyone. SA far as the gym goes I would recommend finding a BIG (gender irrelevant) friend to accompany you, preferably to their regular gym where they know the patrons and have a rapport. That being said in my city we have female only gyms. Anyways the take away from my rambling rhetoric;
- The adversity you face will probably never go away, however this is by no means your creation or fault, never let anyone tell you otherwise.
- You have the inalienable right to dress as YOU see fit.
- Will it is true you may have to exercise a little more caution due to your looks, you should never apologise or be ashamed of them.
- Most importantly the people immediately around you are the most important, it is essential that they support you even when you feel society does not. A strong group of friends who you trust is very important. 
A little side note on the bars as I find this to be the most problematic area. When I go out with my friends I usually get relegated to the guardian role, (because apparently rubbing you junk on someone is an acceptable form of saying hi) I have come to terms with this. I would rather maintain my sobriety than have anything happen to them. And I have a few scars to show for it.

20140518004729,Pretty_Alone,"I'm so sorry you have to go through this.

I totally understand where you're coming from. You seriously aren't the problem though. I'm the opposite body type (lanky, barely any curves, barely any breasts) and I get this shit all the time as well. Although, I'm ethnic as well and have been offered modeling contracts too. I've never been offered hooters though, since I seriously have *barely* b cups. This type of behaviour still happens. A girl posted here a week ago or so saying she was afraid of going outside and could barely live her life anymore because of this type of behaviour towards her and I identified with her so so well it was a little disconcerting.

Don't hate your own self. People who do this shit will do it regardless of your measurements or your clothing. I'm the opposite body type and I dress really really conservatively, and I still get this.

I think everyone who gets this harassment goes through these stages. It's kind of like the stages of grief.

* Denial, trying to ignore it, especially when it happens the very first time and you're in shock a little bit.

* Anger, screaming at the people harassing you, hating people, hating yourself, hating society, being beyond yourself with anger at this existence and this reality.

* Bargaining, trying to dress differently to deter the harassment (it never works), walking in different areas, walking with a bitch face on, trying to hide yourself, trying to be less than you are, looking into surgery, getting rid of makeup, doing anything and everything you think you might have to do to get this harassment to stop while still being able to at least live your everyday life.

* Depression, you know this one, I know this one. I don't think I need to elaborate on it.

* Acceptance. I don't know what to tell you about this one, I'm not there yet, I'm hoping it'll come.

As for practical advice, I don't know how much help I can be, I don't have it figured out yet. The skirt and dress thing: I put leggings on under everything regardless of weather. That way, even if someone does try to do the upskirt thing, I'm less vulnerable. If they try to get a picture, I'm still covered and if they try to feel me up, it's less disturbing and I can stop them before they get any further.

I always put on a normal layer of leggings and then black footed tight over those leggings so it's totally not see through in any way (so people can't use sheerness as an excuse or something), then I put on a cami that has an elastic bandeau around the breast area, and then I put on whatever else I'm wearing that day. The cami eliminates any cleavage I might ever have and makes my breasts less visible if whatever I'm wearing is low cut.

I don't necessarily do all this just to hide myself. I still do this even if I'm wearing jeans and a t-shirt because I think it'll slow my future rapist down and give me a better fighting chance.

If I only wanted to hide, I would go the sweatpants route but those are easy to rip off and I also still needed to dress appropriately for work and internships and school and such.

I know this is all a very bad mentality and I'm not giving any solutions to the root problem but this is what has worked for me (in helping me keep my sanity and being able to live my life). It gives me mental strength. I still get harassed, I get grabbed a little less but even when someone does grab me, it's never skin on skin anymore.

I know in an ideal world, the solution would involve reforming people and ending the harassment. I've never been able to.

I don't have any real solutions for you. I know the proper advice is not to hide yourself and to not let these people affect you but I guess I'm a hypocrite.

I'm at this point in my life where I have developed a physical aversion to being touched and feeling their disgusting eyes on me. I've been getting heavily harassed for years and it takes a mental toll so before anybody starts judging me for acting the way I act, please consider that. I know it's not right and the fact that I don't have any solutions bothers me too but I just haven't found anything else helpful yet.

I'm only offering this advice as an alternate to surgery/throwing away your clothes; and I'm assuring you, there is no need to be ashamed of yourself, you're not the problem by any means.

You've stated a few things about your particular case:

1. The alleged assault occurred in October.

2. You reported it in January.

3. You have had a preliminary review in which the Honor Council found the accused ""not responsible.""

4. You've (appealed?  requested?) a formal tribunal which will review the details of the case.

5. Somewhere along this timeline (I'm assuming after your preliminary review?) you verbally accosted the accused.  This is an important to recognize because a lot of Universities have strict policy against any sort of retaliatory behavior.  If you did lash out at him after he was found ""not responsible,"" you may be in violation of the honor code that you agreed to when you enrolled.  Food for thought.



There are a few other facts about how these kangaroo courts work generally that are also of note:

1.  There are no formal rules of evidence or chains of custody.  This means that any text messages that you have can be submitted as evidence and will not be under nearly as much scrutiny as they would in a real court.

2. The standard of proof is ""a preponderance of evidence.""  This means that when evaluating the circumstances, they only have to be 50.001% sure that your story is the truth and his is a lie.  Compare this to much higher standards used in a ""real"" court.  Standards in place to protect the innocent.

3.  When going to the tribunal, he does not have to right to question you directly.  In fact, if you do not wish to speak to him at all, you do not have to.  This is good for you and awful for him because he loses out on the ability to directly confront his accuser.

4.  It varies from University to University, but you are generally allowed to have advocate present on your behalf.  This person is not allowed to speak for you, but rather counsel you as you go through the proceedings.  The accused is also afforded the same privileges with the same stipulations. 

5. Most lawyers won't touch any of these internal cases with a 10 foot pole.  Contact a local rape crisis center to help navigate the kangaroo court.



To sum everything up:  the rights afforded the accused in this particular circumstances are MUCH, MUCH less than they are in a ""real"" court.  By the lax standards alone, I would not be optimistic about filing formal charges against him through the police.  



The key to ""winning"" your tribunal is to focus on your hospitalization as evidence of a ""hostile educational environment.""  The fact that he now is listed as the accused in two separate cases doesn't hurt either. 

 

The main reason that colleges are obligated to investigate sexual assaults on campus is:

Sexual assault => feeling unsafe at school => hostile educational environment ===> sexual harassment.  Because of this, sexual assault and rape are treated EXACTLY the same as run of the mill sexual harassment.  They are afraid of a lawsuit.



You cannot prove what happened or didn't happen in October.  But you can assemble evidence to show that you are currently in a hostile educational environment.  Ultimately, that will be the way you win.",10,t3_25tc6c

Please note that I am not saying that I find him sympathetic.  He was a evil man that created violence and I'm a not a person who admires that type of behavior.  

Hitler, also, was a male villain that was sympathetic (and still is to some people.)  He killed so many people in an effort to make his country better in his eyes and in his name others committed atrocities that will be in the history books for generations.

The reality, Pearson argues, is that men who are cast as evil are also victims of child abuse, broken homes, drugs, and mental illness, yet society and the courts don’t allow victimhood to excuse criminal behavior. Pearson makes the case that women are just as capable of extreme violence as men. The reason our crime statistics don’t reflect this reality is because of what she terms “chivalry justice”—excusing women for their actions by casting them as mentally ill or victims of abuse.

To me, there isn't really much difference between the evil and the good except their experiences and issues they may have been born with.  We like to think of the Nazi's as extremely evil, but most of them were just following orders.  Most humans follow orders to the point of committing evil actions, it is just that for most of us, we aren't in situations where we have such orders to follow.  Or take terrorist.  Another pure evil in our society.  How many of them were recruited as children and fed half truths, how many of them were given the evidence of world powers attacking indiscriminately again and again.  How many of them were led to blame so much of their lives on the CIA and such meddling in their country.  Offer that plus the promise of paradise, and I would say that many of us put through the same thing would end up the same.  When you look at their crime, it is hard to be sympathetic, but even someone who blows up a bus full of civilians was once a young child who could have led a happier life like one of us except that reality stole such form them.  Or for another example of evil, consider a child molester.  Once again, their crime leaves no room for sympathy, but once again view them as a young child.  Imagine having to tell them that they are going to grow up and find that they have a sexual attraction they cant fulfill.  That they will be stuck in a society where so much of popular culture is about seeking sexual fulfillment, and the rest is about finding romantic relationships.  And then tell them that they will never be allowed to have any of that, and if they even try to seek support, they will be vilified.  In a society that sees it as an evil to even suggest that someone deny their sexuality, you are going to make them have to kill theirs.  Or take the serial killer.  Often times they are inherently broken in the head... but it is still a tragedy.

I've not been shy about sharing my own experiences but really wanted to highlight the ibuprofen vs. other painkillers/sedatives/whatever else.  My experience with just ibuprofen was not at all bad.  Totally doable though definitely not comfortable.  By comparison, having an IUD inserted was worse.

It can definitely vary from one person to the next.  Personally, I would have preferred more but that wasn't an option since I drove myself there and because the clinic had other responsible party to release me to, they weren't able to give me ""the good stuff"".

On the other hand, I sat in the recovery area next to another woman who spent most of her time puking into a bucket.  When I asked a nurse if she was okay, she said that's often a side-effect of valium.  So I think I got off kind of easy in that there was none of the nausea and ibuprofen was sufficient.

It is pretty deeply ingrained in our society that there is.  One need only consider the topic of children and sex to see this.  Consider how hard it is for many parents to explain even the basics to their child.  They are outright ashamed and embarrassed about it.

Masturbation?  There are laws where I live that make it illegal for a parent to tell their child when it is/isn't appropriate to do such (they laws may not be really enforced, but there mere existence tells you something).  Until 2 years ago, two same age kids caught having consensual lewd interaction (doesn't have to be sex) could both be put in prison for up to 20 years.

They are thrown out into the world with almost two decades of being taught that sex is dirty, nasty, and illegal til you are an adult.  Sex is like a sinful pleasure, compared to cigarettes.

The term slut has been used as a slur against many women for many reasons.  It's a term to take power away from their sexuality or expression of it - apparently wearing a short dress and heels is TERRIBLE so the woman deserves to be shamed.  It's a way of trying to disempower her, make her feel bad, make her retreat, control her, sabotage her.

It is about hate, hating the empowered women.

I have no idea why you thought you needed to think of a very male-dominated activity as an example for me, that is irrelevant as is your analogy - which does not work, AT ALL.

Football players are a very definite thing that you can define, you can see, you can all agree that Bob over there is playing football.  It's also not an inherently negative thing.

Whereas a 'slut' is a very negative thing, it's also not something that is agreed upon.  It's been used against women for far too many reasons, or for no reason at all.
Any woman is in danger of being called a slut on the whims of the people who think it's cool to hurl those kind of slurs... as a form of keeping other people down, or triyng to disempower them in their own minds so they feel better.  It is a form of hate.

I think it's a rude thing to say but I don't thing everybody who says the word slut has those motives behind it, they're being an asshole but I wouldn't say its in the realm of power struggles and all that.

I used a male dominated activity because you were saying people who slut shamed hated women and their sexuality. I was trying to give the flip side of something toward the male gender because people don't often call men sluts, or at least don't do it seriously. Can you explain why my analogy doesn't work at all? I don't think it was the best example either but my point was that hating a part of who somebody is doesn't mean you hate their entire gender, race, demographic, whatever. 

Football players are a definite thing, yes. It is not inherently a negative thing to most people because of our culture. If we could imagine a world where playing football was more controversial and people ""football shamed"" or something, that would be more towards what I was trying to explain. Being a woman who is sexually free and sleeps with people as she pleases might be viewed negatively by some people in our culture, but that doesn't mean those some people hate women. I'm having trouble conveying what I'm trying to say.

I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to tell me but saying slut is a negative thing. I don't think it's used against women as a whole, but against specific women (not that that makes it any better or justified). A woman is indeed in danger of being called a slut by others who want to say mean things, but isn't everyone kind of at risk for being called something? Anyway that's not the point we're talking about, but again I don't think people say slut as a power struggle sort of thing.

20140517170733,futuremaude,"Ok, so let's talk about language; I love me some language, and I love me some language talks.

Slut-shaming and misogyny both fall under one word: sexism.  None of the three mean the same thing, but both slut-shaming and misogyny are sexist.

Sexism, by the academic and sociological definitions, is the discrimination against and oppression of women, who are in a disadvantaged social position due to their ""sex."" (/gender)

One cannot be sexist against men, as they are in the position of advantage in terms of ""sex"" (/gender), but one *can* be bigoted against them.  Still, we can't be sexist against them. 

Misogyny is specifically hatred of women.  While misogyny is certainly a component of sexism, sexism is not necessarily misogyny. Benevolent sexism is not misogynistic, but contributes to the perpetuation of misogyny and sexism, as well as slut-shaming.  

Benevolent sexism is best understood as the simultaneous elevation and devaluing of women to a status that is both super-human and sub-human.  It takes many forms, but some of the most common include ideas that women are inherently kinder, gentler people than men, and that women are also more emotional and delicate than men, so we need men's protection from the harsh world.  Benevolent sexism isn't misogynistic at all, but it is still entirely sexist.

Slut-shaming is a sexist act that specifically targets women and girls based on sexuality and sexual characteristics.  The word ""slut"" itself has a long linguistic history. Chaucer first used it to describe a sloppy man, then it became used to refer to scullery maids, which cemented its association w/ the feminine. Now, its connoted meaning is a woman who has sex or is sexy in a way that society abhors.

But as sorry_ari notes, this is a nebulous concept.  There is no universally accepted sexual standard that women can adhere to to avoid being slut-shamed. So slut-shaming reveals itself to be a sexist mean to exert power over women and girls, who are oppressed. 

There is no need to apply parameters to the sexual activity of ""sluts.""  It is specifically this lack of specificity that makes slut-shaming possible.   No one is checking anyone's sex-passport to see how many trips she's made.  A woman or girl can be called a slut for any reason.  The word ""slut"" is an oppressive tool to control women and girls and keep us ""in our place.""

Thus, the term slut-shaming is useful.  It identifies a specific tool of oppression, which is part of the sexist machine, and shames the sexist machine by pointing out that the act of calling a woman or girl a slut is an attempt to shame her, and by shaming her, it is an attempt to instill fear in all women and girls, lest they be dealt the same fate.  Invoking this fear in all women and girls through the ""examples"" helps keep all women and girls in a disempowered position.  

Is slut-shaming misogynist? Yes, in most cases, yes.  But are the two the same? No. But they are in bed together, slutting it up for sexism.",6,t3_25sx2s

20140517194234,Coramoor_,"I just want to make a comment on the ""Academic"", post modern feminist style definitions that have been taking root lately. The truth of the matter is, these definitions are nothing more than attempts to obscure the reality of the situation.

Aside from the absurd annoyance that comes with playing the oppression Olympics, the reality is that bigotry and sexism, while they do overlap quite a bit are not in fact the same thing.

The more traditional definition of sexism is far better simply because it is far clearer, from wikipedia ""Sexism or gender discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender""

The definition of Bigot however is ""someone who, as a result of their prejudices, treats or views other people with fear, distrust or hatred on the basis of a person's ...""

So if you were to make the statement, ""men make bad fathers"", that would be sexist, but it would not be guaranteed to be bigoted, which is where the post modern definition falls apart.

It means they were shamed for being a slut when in reality, they were shamed for other people being sexually attracted to them, something they probably can't and should never have to control.

Like, I've been called a slut for wearing a skirt - the same skirt that I wear to my office job at a bank. If it's appropriate for a bank, it's certainly appropriate for the street. That situation would be called ""slut shaming"" not because I am a slut, but because I've been identified as one for a behaviour (skirt-wearing) that isn't slutty at all. Forcing dress codes on teenage girls is slut shaming because it suggests that tank tops and leggings are ""slutty"", not because tank tops and leggings really are slutty. Dress codes shame girls for a sexuality that is projected onto them. There is nothing *inherently* sexual about a spaghetti strap or an exposed belly button.

I'd say that's what the phrase really means: shaming someone for being too sexual, when that sexuality is projected from the viewer onto them. Like that story about how a girl got sent home from prom because the dads were feeling too attracted to her. She was told she was dressed inappropriately. That doesn't mean she was dressed inappropriately - it means that her friends' fathers were having inappropriate feelings for her, and then projected that desire onto her as a way to rationalize and excuse their behaviours. ""It's not my fault - you can't help but feel attracted to a slut.""

 Slut carries a lot of weight with it. You regularly see women questioning their own actions once 'slut has been applied to them' maybe they felt fine about the sexual encounters before but I believe it is a term used mostly to degrade women.

Im fairly sure when most people have casual sex, their main priority is their own sexual pleasure. What you seem to be referring to is what casually called gold digging. Which I think is more about creating an entire relationship/attachment. not the act of sex itself. 

For a lot of people relationships are like a free pass on slut shaming. What we're talking about usually refers to a woman hooking up with a guy, and having no lasting relationship or connection (and hence not asking for money/gifts"" and being shamed for that. 

Its a different world for men and women. Reddit is full of guys posting about going to clubs , looking to pick up guys to take home. That kind of casual hookup attitude just doesn't see to be allowed for women. If a girls horny and wants to pick up a hot guy, and never see him again, everyone seems to immediately have a very low opinion of her.

Just to close, I think your assumption that there isn't a hookup culture for women is a poor one. There are definitely girls who aren't looking for relationships and want intimacy.

I'd imagine that a lot of your self worth is invested into the relationship itself and as such any negative trends in the relationship will similarly affect your self worth (which will then negatively affect the relationship, ahhh spiraling downward!).


It has some similarities to someone who puts their all into a job and then gets passed up for a promotion, and again, and again. That kind of trend can really eat away at your self worth, I mean you always thought you were doing excellent work, but they never promoted you, were you wrong? Was all your hard work really not very good? To be fair, much of this is predicated on the ingrained notion of the American dream - work hard and well, get promoted, get more money, do better in life. If you lived in a country rife with corruption where promotions are all based on who you know and who's son you are (I did that purposefully, the countries I'm talking about probably don't let their daughters work) if you don't get promoted it probably means little to your self worth because you know that working hard and well doesn't equal promotions and advancements.


To bring this back around, there is a general notion that if you pick the right person and you work hard at the relationship you'll be happy and the relationship will flourish. That notion puts everything on you. If something goes wrong in the relationship either you picked wrong and wasted two years of your life, or you didn't work hard enough to make the relationship work and clearly you're no good at relationships.


Both of those scenarios are utter fallacies. You could do the best work in a company and still not get promoted for innumerable reasons. In the same sense you could pick the right person and put in good hard work on the relationship and it still might not be filled with happiness.


But if I picked right then the relationship would be great, doesn't the fact that things are so rough inherently mean that I picked wrong? No, because the entire idea of ""picking right"" is a fallacy. there is no ""right"" person. You pick who you like at the moment, who seems right for you at the time. And to be fair, they might be almost exactly what you wanted and needed at the time, they may be near perfect for you, at the time. But times change, and so do people. A lot of times they change into people who you won't like and aren't right for you anymore, and they do that entirely through processes that you may have no control over, without any indicators that you could have foreseen. You may have hated mustard all your life and then one day in your forties you try mustard and realize its amazing. Often, people just change, and usually, its not about mustard.


How to regain self worth?
Well, you could remove your investment in the relationship. Yeah, you will have lost a lot, but it's like the stock market, you invested and you lost; you can either keep throwing good money after bad or you can pull out and start regrowing your fund. (This was a metaphor for breaking up)


However, if that's not the route you want to go then I suggest creating something. Pick something, anything, woodworking, gardening, writing, making origami. I personally write. I write stories with a hero and I always imagine myself as the hero. The actions my hero takes are the actions I take, and when I reread my work, however sophomoric it is, it makes me smile. Whatever else goes on in the world I have created this, from the eddies of the eternal nothing I have brought forth something unique. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, don't ask people for their opinions on whatever you create. There opinions don't matter (Note: ironically the more intelligent people are the harder time they tend to have doing this since they will tend to overanalyze their creative works against other creative works and see any disparities as proof of their lack of talent. So this can be a double edged sword, tread carefully, but it works for me)


Lastly, I am both a male and have only been in a couple of very serious relationships, so apologies if I wasn't the focus group you were expecting answers from. Worst case scenario, you can take this all to be nonsensical ranting, imagine how much smarter you are than this crazy guy on the internet, and maybe that'll give your self worth a little boost ;)",2,t3_25sk65

The key is not letting it. So you didn't win the genetic lottery. Not many people do. But laying down and letting your disease get the best of you is not the right answer. Fighting it with every tool at your disposal *is*.

It costs what it costs. You'll pay it eventually. But what is the value of *YOUR LIFE*? Because that's what getting help can give back to you. Months of your life that right now you are sleeping away. 

Medication is a funny thing and will take some time to experiment with, but trust me that psychiatrists are used to dealing with birth control pill interaction. About 50% of their clients would be on BC.

As far as I know there's no direct interaction between hormonal birth control and anti-depressants in terms of one causing problems with absorption of the other or anything. I've taken several different anti-depressants while on BC and I read my medication information thoroughly, and there has never been any mention of issues between them, nor have I experienced unplanned pregnancy.

When it comes to birth control and mood changes, I have had some issues there. When I tried the birth control patch it made me feel uncontrollably upset--it was so bad I couldn't even make it through a whole month. Other formulations (two types of pills, the ring) haven't given me the same problem. I'm on the ring now and have been very satisfied with the lack of side effects. Different formulations can definitely affect people differently in a dramatic way, so keep trying different approaches with your doctor and hopefully one of them will work out better for you.

Going on both antidepressants and birth control at the same time might be tough just because it would be hard to figure out which thing is giving you side effects. Many antidepressants lower libido (an issue that caused me to change to a different antidepressant), and so can BC. BC can cause nausea (an issue that made me change BC types once), and so can some antidepressants. Unless your doctor says otherwise, it might be best to work on one of the types of medication first until you're satisfied with a formulation and dose, and then work on the other.

I'm tentatively hopeful about the ring. That is one thing I haven't tried just yet. However, I've tried softcups for menstrual periods, and if the ring is anything like those, I'm not sure if I will be comfortable with it. 

>Many antidepressants lower libido (an issue that caused me to change to a different antidepressant), and so can BC.

This is also a concern of mine. When I'm depressed, everything goes out the window. I have no desire whatsoever. The pills I've been on have made me feel terrible, so my sex drive has been nonexistent, and so I feel even more terrible about it. It's an awful cycle.

>Unless your doctor says otherwise, it might be best to work on one of the types of medication first until you're satisfied with a formulation and dose, and then work on the other.

The problem right now is finding a pill that won't make me feel like I want to jump off a cliff. With previous pills, that feeling didn't settle in until later. The first couple months would be fine, and I could deal with any usual minor depression symptoms without any issue. 4-6 months in, I would be a total wreck.

The pill that I just quit made me feel so erratically different and numb that I couldn't take it anymore. That one was also 4 months. I'm not sure if it's my body becoming immune to... whatever? Because it feels like a switch was flipped, and then I want to not exist anymore.",1,t3_25teex

Your usual side effects with BC sound really harsh. :( That's like what I got when I tried the patch, but at least in my case it happened right away so I knew what was going on. The issue with the side effects worsening over time sounds very difficult to deal with.

I was constipated once, and took a lady laxative (not sure how they differ from dude laxatives but I digress) thinking it would help the situation. I was in graduate school at the time working in my studio when I made the horrible mistake of trusting a laxative induced fart…BIG MISTAKE!!

I, too, made the duck-walk of shame alllll the way down the suddenly interminably long hallway to the bathroom. I grabbed a giant forest-killing wad of paper towels when I got to the restroom, wet them, and managed to clean up. Luckily it was all trapped in my undies. I had to teach in 20 minutes and I'd walked to school that day so I couldn't pop home and change. 

Soooo I cleaned my bum and left my grossly soiled undergarments in the pad-box. I too was terribly embarrassed…but I recovered! And now it's kind of a funny story. Laugh or cry, I say. I choose to laugh! ",82,t3_25ts6f

The funniest was the time I shat myself at work. I was sitting at my desk, bashing away at my keyboard, when my bowels tapped my shoulder. 'Excuse me, BlackCat, but could you please visit the bathroom?' Sigh. 'Not now, bowels, *I'm busy!*' ... 30 seconds later: 'FUCK YOU, BLACKCAT, WE ARE AT CODE BROWN. REPEAT, CODE BROWN! IMMINENT EVACUATION!' 

I sprinted to the toilet like a bullet from a gun, butt unfortunately for me, my desk could not be further from the toilet. When I get there, I'm detained for a few crucial seconds by a twittering bunch of girls from another department. GET OUT OF MY FUCKING WAY. 

Just as I got to the stall and closed the door, the tsunami burst from the deep depths of my bowels. I was wearing tights (stockings) so the liquid shit pretty much went *everywhere*. In my vagina. Up my back. Down my legs. Did I mention shit in my *vagina?* And the smell? *Diabolical*. If Satan came up with a signature scent, that would be it.

What could I do? How can I hide that evil smell? I had nowhere to dispose of my decimated undies and tights. Shit shit shit. HOLY SHITUATION, BATMAN! I mopped up as best I could, wrapped the evidence up in a giant ball of toilet paper, balled it up in my jacket then told my boss that I was sick and went home.

RIP, lovely green lacy undies. Yes, I showered for an hour. No, by some kind of miracle I did not get a UTI. Mind you, my littlest girl regularly has shit in her vagina and she is a UTI-free zone. Looks like vaginas have that shit covered.",260,t3_25ts6f

When I started using a gas one around 13 years old, I wore jeans, steel toed shoes or cleats depending on the weather, a long sleeve flannel shirt, safety glasses, and a hard hat with a screen that pulled down over my face and ear plugs. The weed whacker was strapped to a harness that meant the actual flying string part physically could not reach my body. We also lived on the steep side of a mountain and on a gravel road, so a lot of the yard was very steep and couldn't be mowed and we had to keep the sides of the road clear. I threw up a lot of rocks and got hit once or twice, but nothing got through the layer of fabric, and I did some sliding down hills and things like that but never managed to really get more than a small bruise here and there. Even flying glass isn't likely to be at the right angle to cut through loose-ish fabric and skin, so you're pretty safe if you're covered and it's nothing to be afraid of. Now that I'm a young adult and stupid, I often go without the hard hat and long sleeves, but the eye protection and pants are vital since your eyes don't always recover well and most of what gets thrown, especially heavy stuff like rocks, hits below the waist.",1,t3_25u3td

Normal zits I guess you would say. Anyways. I went on YAZ. Almost immediately the skin was clear. But I also gained about 20 pounds. Had horrible mood swings, tired all the time, and I know it sounds crazy, but felt like my immune system was compromised. I was sick at least once a month with a cold/flu. I finally had enough and decided to come off a year and a half ago. Everything was fine til about 2 months later. Started loosing my hair. In clumps. Not long after this, my skin exploded. I mean the worst I've ever been in my life. Terrible cysts all around the jaw line and my back ( which I've never had before even as a teen) theeeeen I started having seizures and my whole right side of my body was completely numb. Like couldn't feel a fucking thing. Went and saw 3 different doctors and an endocrinologist. One of them said I was nuts and birth control would never cause these side effects. I opted out of going on any medication to ""fix"" any of these side effects and started eating clean, working out. Around 8 months the hair loss stopped completely. The acne continued until about 10 months. I still struggle with it, but IT IS better. Now I will only get breakouts around my period. I'm left with horrible scars and my hair is slowly growing back. My periods are relatively normal again, although my testosterone levels are low and my ovulation cycle is very irregular. All I can say to you, is it will get better. I swear to you. I was exactly like you, even quit my job because I was so embarrassed of going outside. Please feel free to ask me anything, i will help you get through this! I've never felt better being off the pill. My mood has 110% improved and I have not been sick once since being off of it. My sex drive has also returned. 
Some things to keep you positive and motivated... Drink tons of water. Herbal teas. Join yoga or a gym. Something to help you sweat all those nasty shitty chemicals out. Keep your hair tied back out of your face. Change pillow cases often. Keep your skin clean. Invest in a good skin regimen. I use dermatlogica and the oil of olay xpro microdermabrasion home kit. If you have the money, go get biweekly professional microdermabrasion sessions done. It's worth it. I go when I can afford it. I'm skeptical about getting laser treatments because I'm so fair skinned. I take multivitamins daily. I also take biotin/skin supplements for the hair loss. I would watch yourself with biotin though because sometimes it makes people break out instead of heal. I also take oil of oregano pills and the liquid. Sometimes even use a diluted solution for my face. I'll try and think of more and keep posting.

I can't say that I've ever had experience with people of this nature, but if you don't want her there then for the love of your baby/god/whoever do NOT invite her. I would think of it in terms of the future; would you want your child around this person.

As for your SO wanting his father there, I totally feel for him. But his father is clearly in the abusive cycle and won't leave the mother...I don't think he should be invited either unless it's explicit that the mother will not be coming. That of course creates a lot of drama, but who knows. Maybe it's the wakeup call the dad needs; get this abusive person out of your life so you can see your grandkids, OR not being able to see your own grandkids? It may sound petty and coercive, but I'm concerned about the effect this would have on the child, which simply should not be exposed to the mother, in or out of the womb! Abusive people can play off people's guilt; but the fact of the matter is that you DO NOT have to keep toxic/abusive people in your life if you don't want them there. DO NOT feel guilty about cutting them out (that's just what they are counting on). If you feel it's the best for your new family, then do it and stick to it. You can do this!",4,t3_25tl9g

My SO's father abused him and his mother for a long time and my heart aches for them; I want to stand up to him for my SO so badly but it's just not my fight. My boyfriend quite literally acts like it never happened. I can't imagine what goes on in his head to be able to detach what horrible things he went through. He tries to act like he has ""put it behind him"" (his words) but some things in the way he acts and such and he has told me a little bit about it, he breaks down crying and you just know there is no way in hell it's ever left his mind.

Sorry to sort of derail you, I just wanted to let you know that you're not the only one who is in that position. =/ All I know is that if he ever takes a toe out of line towards anyone (not just me) in my presence, there's going to be another fire in san diego because the ground will be on fire for how fast I've left their house.

I've been here just a long as you, albeit on different accounts. We must be looking at a very different subreddit, I completely disagree with you about the hostility towards men. There is definitely hostility towards a certain *kind* of man, that is the ""not all men"" man, the ""devil's advocate,"" the one who thinks he's so important that everyone simply *must* know his opinion and that it is a MAN speaking such opinion.

Comments identifying onself as a man should for the most part be downvoted if gender is not relevant to the discussion which is the point of the downvote arrow, by the way. Hostility =/= downvoting. I would say 99.9% of the time gender is irrelevant, and thus gender should not be mentioned.

Sometimes identifying yourself as coming from a different perspective is incredibly helpful. I've seen some comments here that start out with ""I'm a man so I can't completely understand but here's my input"" and somehow people interpret that as ""mansplaining"" (god I hate that word). 

I just have very, very, very rarely seen TwoX accept men at all unless they fit very specific requirements and even then it's kind of a luck of the draw. Just look at all the posts around the time of the defaulting. A lot of TwoX was *terrified* of the ""men invading"" because ""it's already bad enough as it is"" and people straight up telling men to fuck off this is our space and those posts getting lots of upvotes (agreements). Literally. Lot's of people with zero tolerance policies.

It's generally expected that the majority of people who are ""supposed"" to participate are women. Let's switch to race, maybe that'll make it easier. 

Do you think it would be appropriate for a white person to be up in a sub for black people telling them ""I'm white so I can't understand but here's my input."" Like, this person literally just said they don't understand, so instead of asking for help understanding or I dunno, maybe trying to understand it themselves, will say something along the lines of how the black person perceived their own experience wrongly, or will try to play devil's advocate just for the sake of it, or just other things that generally *are not relevant to the OP*.

TwoX was not terrified of *all men* invading, they are terrified of a specific subset of men who act like they have superior knowledge on topics they in reality know nothing about (mansplaining), or at the very least have not had a similar experience. I'm not even going to *start* on the people who think it's okay to try to play ""devil's advocate"" in a thread from a rape victim reaching out to the people here.

The downvote button is to denote that something isn't relevant to the topic at hand, you can call it hostile all you want, but that's what it's for. Plenty of men comment on here all the time, and no one really even knows about it because they don't feel like they need to shout from the rooftops their gender, and they contribute in a way that is relevant to the topic at hand, or they say nothing at all knowing that there is nothing relevant for them to say.

In those ""men should sit back and listen"" posts on here, some of the top comments were from men saying that they *agreed* with this; it's not hard to understand that in a place such as this you just don't say certain things because they're not considered appropriate.",6,t3_25twfk

And honestly, the men ""mansplaining"" on rape posts is something I hear complaints very frequently but something I've never actually seen in two+ years of being here. And using that as an example is taking your points to the very extremes.

I just don't think that TwoX should shut itself off from men simply because they didn't grow up as women. ""Sit back and listen"" should *not* mean ""you can read but don't you dare speak"". I think TwoX is often a bit too sensitive and interprets a lot of what men post as ""trying to tell me I'm wrong"" when it's just trying to provide another perspective.

We allow it from women why can't we allow it from men? TwoX is not a ""girls only"" club.

To cite an example, the first part they showed in the video of your first link is satire because the man was in the same feminine pose to portray his ""sexiness"", rather than exuding his sexiness in a more masculine way, hence why it is satire rather than an example of true gender role reversal.

Many home pregnancy tests (HPTs) claim to be 99 percent accurate on the first day of your missed period. But research suggests that most HPTs do not always detect the low levels of hCG usually present this early in pregnancy. And when they do, the results are often very faint.

Once upon a time, /r/TwoXChromosomes was a small community of a few hundred people - a little girly treehouse with very few rules where the posts were equal parts serious gender discussion, rage comics, nailpolish tutorials, period shit naming threads, scientific debate and rainbow cupcake images.  Because the community was so small and tight-knit, there was always a balance of different posts on the front page.  We are not and were not exclusively a gender-politics sub, and as much as possible, we'd like to welcome any and all posts that relate to the female experience - posts about your manicures and new trucks are as welcome as posts about date rape or equal pay.

However, as the community has grown, our ""frivolous"" posts, particularly image posts, started to drown out any serious discussion  Eventually, it got to the point where not only was our frontpage constantly flooded with image posts, but they'd *trend* for weeks at a time. A couple people would post a picture of their rainbow cupcakes, and everyone would start baking rainbow cupcakes and posting pictures of them on /r/TwoXChromosomes.  We'd get two weeks of being /r/rainbowcupcakes, followed by a week of /r/picsofmygrandma, followed by two weeks of /r/nerdymanicure and then a week of /r/lookatmyhaircut. We WANT those posts to be a substantial part of our community, but we want some room for other things too. 

In order to control the trending madness of the image posts, a couple years ago we instituted a rule constricting image posts to a single day of the week, so that we'd get to see both the silly image posts and the more serious content.  This was a BIG DEAL at the time - if anything, the uproar was louder than what we recently saw over the decision to join the defaults.  We were accused of being power-hungry tyrants trying to sap the joy out of the community.  Several groups splintered off to form their own subreddits where pics are welcome every day (if you'd like some lighter fare Saturday-Thursday, those communities are linked on our sidebar, and they're great fun).  

Silly images have always been a substantial part of this subreddit.  In so far as IFF keeps the lighthearted/silly side of /r/TwoXChromosomes alive, it is important to many of our users, and to the mod team.

Because of their strict rules they keep out a lot of the BS and have created a relatively safe place for women to read about feminism, but maybe not to contribute. They're losing some of their actual contributing members, which is something I've heard confirmed from other people in this subreddit. Men's rights and redpill are two other, more extreme examples, where if your opinion disagrees with the mob opinion, you are instantly banned. We all know the general consensus on those places. I wouldn't want us to become anything like that, turning away ladies from one of the few safe(ish) spaces on the internet for us.",2,t3_25uwvr

Personally, I think that while subs with all sorts of restrictions on who can post what are fine (and there are ones with these sorts of rules), but defaults ought to be generally open to people, since they're more of the public face of the site, and everyone sees them by, well, default.  I suppose r/askscience is a default...but I'm not so sure it should be, for the same reasons.

It's also one thing to have people held to academic standards relating to history, and another to hold people to the more vague, uncertain (and conflicting depending on who you ask) standards people here probably want.  You say ""inappropriate content"", but what is that exactly?  And for controversial topics, it gets much harder to decide this in an unbiased way.

Finally, my understanding is that r/askhistorians and r/askscience disallow comments based on the person's expertise and their adhering to neutral academic standards.  It's harder to do that in a subreddit about women generally.  But rules that were analogous to r/askhistorians would mandate deleting a comment from someone supportive of feminism who didn't have any particularized knowledge about it, while allowing a comment from, perhaps, a gender studies major who thinks it's all BS.

I worked in property management with my mother so I want to give you a few tips.  

1. If you don't have money for a deposit right now, look up online or in the phone book for a women's shelter.  What he's done is emotional abuse and they will take you both in if they have room.
       - If they do not have space available, ask if they can direct you to a shelter or safe house that can room you until your both can afford your own place.

2. Your lack of credit and your mom's bad credit may not disqualify you from an apartment.  I've rented to people that are seriously in debt but their jobs pay well enough that it doesn't matter, we made their deposit 1 month's rent so if they fall behind we have a cushion before eviction.

3. If you have no evictions then you are twice as likely to get an apartment.  Additionally, look for complexes or rentals with low deposits, mine was $200 on my apartment.  This is much easier to earn than a full month's rent.

4. Income. Combine your mother's and your monthly income together. As an example if this combined comes out to $1200 bucks, then you can afford an apartment that costs 1/4 to 1/3 of that combined income.  300-400$ would be an affordable rent in the companies eyes, or maybe higher depedning on who is in charge.  This is mainly what rental companies look for and they will verify your income with your employer or require pay stubs on file.  It may not be a glamorous place you get, but you will not be homeless.

5. Public assistance.  Do not be afraid to attempt to sign up for Food Stamps or Utility assitance programs.  In my area there are churches that run food pantries that give out food with no questions asked, some will also pay your rent if you attend their services and volunteer with them.  I'm not religious but if this were the only option to being homeless and starving I'd grin and bear it.
    Also, Community Action in your community helps pay deposits and first month's rent for homeless families.  


Good luck, and stay strong.  This is not yours nor your mom's fault.  What you have to do is cut off contact from Bryan and help your mom stay strong, help support her through this.  But, if she continually goes back to him or let's him string her along, you may have to make a decision on what you're going to do in regards to her as well.  

This is your chance to become independent and take charge of your life. I know you'll manage it, you just have to stay on top and stay strong.

Maybe because my late sister's husband was a slime ball con artist who created himself another family while she (unable all her life to believe anything bad about anyone) lived in his web of lies, I can believe this happened to your mother.

Anyway, it's going to be a rough trip for you and your mother for a while. She has some getting-her-act-together to do, big time. See if you have a local shelter where the two of you might stay temporarily. But it's your mother who's going to have to put the trauma aside and get a job or two.

20140518111211,Echost,"So, my situation is a little different. I met my Stepdad when I was about 3. He had a daughter a little older than me, but a little younger than my brother. So, we were all raised together, along with the daughter he had with my mom. This guy was a second father to my brother and I. In fact, he did a lot of things with my brother that my dad didn't do (although, my dad did some great things too). They bonded over hunting, atv riding, building race boats, everything boyish under the sun. This guy was there for every major development in our lives. 

3 years ago my mom passed away unexpectedly. Almost immediately, stepdad started joking about dating. I kind of thought it was odd, but maybe it was a nervous ""What am I going to do with my life now?"" type of thing. We go on with our lives, together. I moved in with him to help take care of my younger sister, and make sure things go okay. I moved states to do this. My brother calls him every day to check on him. About six months later I move out because it was just too crowded, but we are still in constant contact. 

A year or so after my mom dies, he admits he has started to see someone. No one likes this. I don't like it, but I'm the peace maker so I try and get everyone to be cordial about it. For the most part, they really are. There is a little tension, but nothing that isn't to be expected. I meet the woman, she is very, very nice. She has two adult daughters my age, seems to have a nice little life of her own. Very soon after this he says they are getting married. **Oh, and we aren't invited.** CUE sibling meltdowns everywhere!! I'm caught in the middle because I really don't want to blow this up, and my siblings are 100% against it. I have them calling me, I have him calling me, I'm brokering peace deals everywhere. 

So, they have this wedding 2 months later with his family. The people we have grown up to call Grandpa, Grandma, aunt, uncle, cousin and so on. Our family. It all goes downhill from here. He stops talking to everyone. He doesn't talk to his own blood daughters anymore, let alone my brother and me. The whole time they were dating, we never even met his soon to be wifes daughters. So, his own daughters have step-sisters they have never met. His own daughter has been in jail for 9 months, had a baby, and he has not spoken to her once. So, I'm left trying to parent an adult drug addict, who is only 4 years younger than me, on my own. Classy dude. 

He has this great life now. He bought a sailboat, my moms only dream btw. He had some moles removed from his face. He is always going out on the town, travelling...stuff he never did with my mom or us. And he doesn't speak to anyone from his old life except his  parents and siblings. In fact, his dad died recently...our grandpa, our BELOVED grandpa....and we found out on FACEBOOK. 


But you know what, my sister and my brother, we are so much closer now. We are own little family, and we turn to each other. So, I just want you to know, you guys will survive this. Sometimes other people suck. It doesn't matter if you've known them for 25 years, or 4 years. They can still screw you over and act like you've never existed. But you will live, and you will move on. And they will eventually be lonely pieces of shit who will have to own up to what they did.

As far as what happened, my mom died of an accidental overdose. She was only supposed to be on 1 Opana, and all her medication was locked in a safe that she had no access to. Only my stepdad had access to. We got suspicious last summer after some people said some things and requested the police report, ME report, and toxicology. She had 15 medications in her system, some of them redundant. There were lies in the police report. There were lies our stepdad had told us. My sister who was there with her boyfriend that night said Mom was fine until she ate dinner, and then something was wrong. She asked my stepdad to check on her during the night. He admittingly did not, and slept on the couch. He also now claims that my sister and her boyfriend were never there. We all know they were there, I talked to my mom before she ate and she told me they were there. I saw the police photos of all the medications she had in the house, they had sent them all to the ME's office. But, when I moved in several of the ones that I would later find out were in the  toxicology report were in the safe. When I spoke to the police, the detective had very detailed notes saying they took the medicine from the safe. We have a whole report of little weird things like this. We know right now there is no way to prove anything, there is no ""damning"" evidence. But, we made a very detailed report and gave it to the detective and left it in their hands. ",10,t3_25uqrp

Oh, okay.

Maybe people don't believe it's real because some girl calling up her mom's boyfriend's lover to confront her in the wee hours of the morning sounds fake. And if it's not, even in the heat of the moment, it's an incredibly immature thing to do.

If you're looking for help and advice, I would say take a step back and focus on yourself. I know you thought of this dude as your dad, but ultimately it's up to your mother and Bryan to sort stuff out between them. Getting involved in their love life/breakup/whatever is not only not your place, but it will cause you undue stress. Being supportive of your mother in a difficult time, and meddling are two completely different things. I have been in a similar situation (found my married dad's online dating profile), and my biggest regret is getting too involved in the whole debacle. 

If you are struggling for a place to live, I would recommend a women's shelter for you and your mom. They exist for these exact kind of situations.

It's okay, it's pretty common, it's normal.

People may not be well-designed for longterm completely monogamous relationships.  I mean this to apply to both sexes (but perhaps for different reasons, either cultural or inborn).

This man did father you.  Lots of us have complicated relationships with our fathers and mothers.  I have two of each.  That complicates things right there.  

Watching children grow up to fully embrace the (many) disappointments that their parents (may) bring is very hard.  My parents (one set) strove to be perfect.  That was very stultifying for me.  I became a perfectionist (long story).  

My other parents screwed up.  One redeemed herself...at least I think so.  The other was my bio-father (some would say my ""actual"" or ""real"" father - I disagree).

Throughout life, you'll have to choose who your family *really* is.  Even so, some of them will screw up (from time-to-time or fairly continuously).  Novels tell us this, history tells us this, we can look around.  It's all good.

First of all, begin to believe in others (outside your family:  the people at the housing assistance office; the people at the financial aid desk at your local community college (they'll help you with housing assistance AND financial aid for more education - everyone can always use more education - and they give a little stipend for living on - look into it, do your homework); the people who offer you a spare room to live in (they will).  

I have lived in my car (not longterm).  It's a long complicated story, but...it's sort of like other addictions (please pardon me if that strikes some people wrong).  You hit rock bottom and it really teaches you *not* to do that again.  It really does.  Seriously.  The moment at which each of us hits rock bottom, in an abusive relationship, can differ (and you could not be there yet, but your mom could already be there, it's all so difficult).

We cannot calculate whose life is worse off or more messy, we can only calculate...something like what you're calling ""recovery.""  Being whole.  We are always a fraction of wholeness (until we reach what the ancients called ""divinity,"" a rare state).  Your life is really difficult right now.  This is a lot for a 20 year old.

But remember, Bryan was only 8 years older than you when he began this pattern.  And if we factor in that males mature less quickly than females (okay, I can give sources, but just go along with this for the moment...) then you can feel better that you are already more self-aware and diligent in holding yourself to certain ideals than he was, when he made the fateful decision to move in with your mom.

Oh, I could say more (about the building blocks of becoming Bryan - PM me, of course, if you want).",-4,t3_25uqrp

2) Practice small phrases that acknowledge the compliment and immediately change the subject.  ""Thanks!  What brought you in here today?""  ""This weather brings out the best in everyone.  What brings you to us today?"" ""Sweet of you to say.  What can we help you with today?""

In short, it sucks that it happens but if you project comfortableness even when you are not, it helps to move things along.  

3) Depersonalize everything.  Don't make ""I"" statements, make it all about the company and your co-workers.  ""What can WE help you with?""  ""What brought you into the store?""  ""What do you like about <product>?""  ""They don't like it when we can't make a sale.  If we can't interest you in a product then we have to move on.""

4) Involve your co-workers- not in the actual interaction, but to let them know its not a thing you are courting, just a thing that happens to you (and them).  Don't frame it as dudes hitting on you, but frame it as customers being unprofessional, which everyone can relate to.  This one is tougher because other women might see you as a threat if you are pretty but having them on your side is invaluable. ""That was so awkward.  How do you handle it when someone is being forward?""  ""I hate it when people come in and then don't want to talk about the products.  How do you get people on track when you feel they are taking up too much of your time?"" ""I never know what to say to people who get personal.  Your interactions always seem to go smoothly and professionally.  Can we work out a signal where if I think a customer's conversation is going over the line, you can swing by and use your expertise to help them make a decision?""  

I've worked in retail/reception for years and the same qualities that get you hired- open, friendly, smiley- can work against you in a professional atmosphere when clients or customers take it the wrong way.  It took me years to feel at ease handling awkward interactions, but I worked hard at projecting an ease I didn't feel because the last thing I wanted was for it to become an even bigger thing.  My new go to to handle this is to say, ""Hmm.  I don't know how to respond to that."" and pleasantly smile without talking.

I was stalked online and men would send me flowers et cetera at work. I adopted a nickname totally different from my real name and had that printed on all of my name badges so they couldn't find my name in the interwebs. I hate the idea of wearing a fake ring because women just shouldn't have to do that sh*t. Now when men ask me for personal information I literally laugh it off, shake my head and them and just say ""That's sooo not appropriate.

""Do you get called beautiful very often?"" You could reply ""Not usually in such a professional environment."" in a joking manner that could give them the hint that they're making things awkward.

If they start bugging you, keep your replies short and just get back to your work. DONT laugh at their jokes. Ask ""Is there anything else I can help you with sir?"" making the point that your interactions are purely work related also helps. 

You're under no obligation to reciprocate flirting with someone if they're making you uncomfortable. At that point they're not there for your service, they're impeding your work and you could very well just ask them to leave if they get to that point.

It's also easy to underestimate the amount of unwanted advances someone in that position gets in a day. Yesterday was a slow day in a new store that hasn't really picked up yet. I work behind a counter that 95% of our customers have no reason to use at all and don't interact with anyone else and it happened twice in an hour. 

Saying that there's nothing wrong with taking every chance you get at the expense of someone else who is on the clock is pretty selfish. When you go to a retail store you should assume that the people working there are only interested in work unless they say otherwise. 

Even if it seems like you don't meet women elsewhere or women don't respond to you how you would like them to, a store isn't a dating service that lets you talk to any female staff member you like because they don't have an out. They are there to perform a job and provide customer service, and that should not include fielding requests for dates and phone numbers or fulfilling someone's need to flirt and compliment a woman who can't turn them down and walk away like they could outside of work. 

I think that if you want to apply a ""take every chance"" approach, try online dating. All of the women there are at least interested in some form of relationship, casual or serious. You can send a message to as many women as you want. They still don't owe you a response. A lot may not ever reply, but at least that way they can opt out.

Try not to think in terms of ""untaken chances"", and instead of actual people. No one has a right to another person. You aren't owed a chance with anyone.

You go to a grocery store and there is a woman at the cash register. You tell her you think she's beautiful. 

Maybe on your end this is just you being nice. You only see her once a week when you go buy groceries. You thought she was pretty so you let her know. It might brighten her day. You have absolutely no expectations of her and you don't say anything else out of the ordinary to her. It's completely innocent and harmless.

On *her* end, however, she checks out a hundred people a day, half of which are men. A good chunk of those men figure that trying to flirt with her that one day a week they see her is no big deal. None of them realize that they're not the ONLY one making advances, and those advances range from sweet and benign to sexual and inappropriate and all the way on to scary and dangerous. 

Your ""beautiful"" comment to going to be different to her than it is to you. To her, there's a good chance that this is going to escalate and encourage you to be more aggressive if she's polite to you and you get the wrong idea and think she's flirting.

Saying you look good doesn't always mean the other person is hitting on you. It's similar to seeing someone on the street crying and asking them if they're okay. *Some men* might do so to hit on you, but I think that if keeps with just a comment and no follow up when there's no feedback is absolutely not wrong.

Context. It's not because you're a cute representative that they should not take you seriously and instead hit on you. There's also a difference between a directive meeting room and a counter, mainly because of the power that is involved. Then again, you know that most big business-deals are closed in informal environments, where alcohol is served.

Let me repeat myself: it's about context, if you think that everywhere is a good place and time to hit on someone then you're a social unadjusted, but to think that it's always inappropriate, you're just plain wrong. Maybe for you it's always inappropriate, but that is not true for all people.

You don't need to tell me anything about how to conduct my work. I'm not the same person at my job as I am in my private life, but I do know how to say no without feeling awkward, gross, or insulted. I'm not that fragile.",-6,t3_25uqjn

I would not describe either guy as creepy, just a little awkward. One seemed to have a ""can't hurt to ask"" attitude, and the other seemed really nervous and shy. So not creepers or knob-ends. :)

Even though it's not ""fair"" that people have to put up with this while they're at work, the reality is that responding harshly could get me in trouble. My goal is to diffuse the situation without being rude, because customer service is a huge deal.  I'd prefer to say something funny that lets them know it's not appropriate but that I'm not upset with them or insulting them. Something like ""hey now, I'm at work, but no hard feelings!"" although that seems a little weird to say.

I had post-natal depression after the birth of our second child, and it was hell. Our baby wouldn't sleep for more than an hour at a time, and that was if she was lying on me. She would be on the boob for hours at a time. I was exhausted, a hormonal wreck, I felt like my entire life was slipping away from me because I couldn't keep on top of the baby, toddler, house, meals etc. 

What would have been the most help for me (and it may be different for your wife, ask her what she needs) would have been someone taking the baby off me and letting me sleep for a few hours. Take the baby where I can't hear her cry, and just let me sleep. Everything is so much easier to handle after a few hours sleep.

I unfortunately experienced ppd with my two oldest kids, quite severely with my oldest, and I experienced prenatal depression with my youngest.  

During the prenatal depression, I felt like my partner was just waiting for the right time to leave, that he was resentful of me being pregnant, that the baby would come along and I wouldn't be able to cope, etc -- none of this was true and my partner couldn't have been more supportive and involved, but all I could think of was things falling apart, him leaving me etc.  This coincided with thoughts that my older two had by then started being more independent, and that I was going right back to the beginning again; it made me think of every hard day and every thing I had done wrong with the first two.  This sounds similar to what you have described in your wife.  Now in some cases, prenatal depression is resolved a few weeks after birth, due to hormonal changes and so forth, but it can also be a pretty big red flag for ppd.  I had ppa (postpartum anxiety) after the prenatal depression.
A few questions to consider are obviously was this pregnancy planned, were there any issues during the pregnancy such as was it high risk, as obviously those kind of things, in combination with the normal ups and downs of pregnancy, would be making her more 'confrontational' or upset than usual even in the absence of a mental health issue.

It's a hard one, because a lot of the time the woman going through it doesn't even realise - they know they are angry, or overprotective, but they don't realise the extent or how out of the ordinary it is.  My advice admittedly would change depending on how you think she would react; first option would be to maybe mention to her that you have noticed a change in her behaviour, that you are worried about her and want to make sure you are doing all the things she needs you to do.  Or, possibly mentioning it to her GP if you think she won't be very open to that conversation, so her doctor can broach it with her as more of a 'checking up on new mum' thing.  I only mention these more passive approaches remembering how I reacted to any suggestion something might be wrong.

A note about postpartum depression too - sometimes it manifests as the opposite of what people have in mind.  For me, I became so overwhelmed with the idea that something bad was going to that I became very very overprotective.  I wouldn't let others hold him, and got anxious if they did.  I would sit up with him all night rather than sleep while he slept.  He was never more than two meters from me even when he was sleeping.  I had to do everything for him so that I knew it was done 'right'.  It doesn't always manifest as something that looks like 'disconnected' or sad.  So just be on the look out for those behaviours too.

The fact you have noticed something is up rather than just getting angry with her is a great, great start.  I'm hoping for the both of you that it was just pregnancy messing with her and that things will resolve, because ppd is not easy on anyone.  I wish you all the luck in the world getting her help with this, and hopefully things will start to get easier for all of you soon.",7,t3_25ulk1
20140518072054,spsprd,"Your wife needs to be assessed by a postpartum specialist NOW. Do whatever it takes to find someone; ask at the hospital where your daughter was born, search online, ask every OB-Gyn you can find. But get her treatment now. This is not optional.

Her hormones may be completely out of whack, and that can literally make people crazy. I have worked with women who had postpartum depression and even postpartum psychosis, and an imbalance with brain chemistry is absolutely the cause.

Don't feel guilty because of how you feel. Acknowledge your feelings for what they are, you are put in a tough situation, tough situations really take a lot out of a person. Anyone would be frustrated in your situation.

Do you have any family or close friends nearby? Ask for, and accept, as much help as possible. One of my clearest memories of the first week home with our daughter was the day my MIL came over and held the baby all day so I could sleep. She'd bring her in to nurse when she was hungry, but other than that, I slept. It was amazing. 

I haven't had the experience of bringing home a baby when I had a toddler, but I'd imagine any extra attention you could give your son would help, as well as showing him how to be a good helper. I don't have a link, but read something recently about the power of teaching toddlers to be ""helpers.""

Science is *always* worth arguing about.

For example, while I haven't yet had time to read the journal, one part stuck out to me: 

 ""The researchers found that cycle shifts in women’s preferences were more pronounced in studies that relied on an extremely long estimation of a woman’s fertility window (up to 12 days) when women are actually highly unlikely to become pregnant outside of a six-day period""

As far as I am aware the previous links between cycles and changes in behaviour are to do with hormones. Is The length of time you are able to get pregnant and the length of time your cycle is affecting your hormones the same? for all women? every cycle? I am not suggesting I belive this to be the case - I do not have sufficient knowlege in that field of biology to give an answer, But this is one example of an oversight that could invalidate the entire study, and why multiple studies are needed before the conclusion is adopted fully.



Look at science previously on Pot to see why this is important, every few years a new harmful effect is found, and every few years later is disproven by similar studies. Many of the things pot has been ""found to cause"" are actually now being treated with medical pot.

I understand where the bitterness comes from, I feel the dark taint try to grow within whenever a woman (or man) mistreats me for my gender. But I do my utmost to ensure it does not change who I am. We can't choose the dogs that live in our brains, but we can choose which ones we feed.

20140519091151,lisq,"Yes. This. Mutual masturbation can teach your husband a whole lot. Observing and sharing what feelings and what rhythm and pressure, what specific areas you liked to be touched in can be a really great way for him to learn about you...and vice versa.  If you masturbate already then you've had years of sexual practice and experiences with someone you love and trust (yourself) and sharing that with your partner can be very erotic and bonding.

This is especially true when you learn how men and women's bits more often then not need a little more then just penis-in-vagina to reach climax, and almost never climax at the same instant (like in the movies).

My other suggestion is that ""taking it slow"" may not make sense to your husband and he might have to be frequently reminded. Men can be ready to go in a matter of seconds, while women need 15, 20 minutes of introductory passion for everything to be fully lubricated and open.  It's not a rule. A lot of people like a quickie, but for starters you should take your time... he'll probably be VERY excited and enthusiastic, so he'll need to be gently reminded that you take longer than him to warm up. It's not that he doesn't know or care, it's that his passion can overwhelm his sense of time.


My final and most important point is **COMMUNICATION**  Any guy worth his salt loves to hear what his woman wants. Men love instruction. They hear ""I really enjoy sex, and I want you to do this and that to me"" and almost never hear it as ""you're doing all wrong."" Men LOVE when you advocate for your own pleasure because they are having sex with you in order to bring you pleasure. If they only wanted great sex for themselves they'd be masturbating, or they would be blatantly selfish assholes and you would have realized that before you even became friends.

Even with lube, you may end up ""pushing rope"" if you try to cram him in all at once. Instead, start out in missionary (him on top of you, your legs open). You may also need to put a pillow or two under your butt to get the angle right, depending on your heights and his penis size. Use your hands to line his penis up with your vaginal opening. Make sure it's right at the opening and not too high or low--I'm assuming you've explored with your hands before, but if not you'll want to do this in the days leading up to get familiar with your body. You may need to separate your lips down there with your fingers. Once he's lined up with the tip in the opening at an angle that feels comfortable to you, hold on to the base of his penis and have him gently rock his hips into you. If he only gets in partway, have him rock back a bit (but not necessarily until he comes all the way out) and do it again. He should get in a little more each time he humps. Once he gets past a certain point you may experience a sudden strange or painful sensation-- your hymen ""breaking"" (it actually stretches though, not breaks). This is normal and you can keep going with movement now that he's in you further. Although if you don't experience it not a big deal, since your hymen may already be stretched from other activities. 

Also, lots of good advice here about lube. I would recommend a liquid Astroglide over any gels, especially KY. Or even better, a lube that's glycerin free, since many people are allergic-- something like sliquid. Or if you're not using condoms, a lot of people rave about coconut oil or other oil lubes. I would say just have a few on hands so you can play around and try what you like-- I mean it's your honeymoon, so don't feel bad about spending money. Also keep some sensitive skin baby wipes nearby and towels to wipe up excess mess. The baby wipes are also good for cleaning either of you off after sex and will help prevent UTIs for you after you pee-- just make sure to wipe front to back.

20140518095304,communistslutblossom,"Lube preferences are pretty personal I think. I would suggest just getting a nice, simple, basic one -- don't go for flavored or warming or ""stimulating"" ones because a lot of people don't react well to them and that's not really something you want to deal with on your wedding night. If you're not using condoms, I'll recommend Liquid Silk, it's a more expensive lube (worth the $) and it's a mix of water and silicone based. Sliquid is a water-based lube that people tend to really like. Whether or not you need lube really just varies person-to-person, so definitely have some on hand because it's much better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. Needing lube doesn't mean that you aren't aroused, it's just that some women naturally produce more or less moisture than others.

I'm just gonna let you know about queefing, since I'm pretty sure your sex ed didn't cover that... you might have heard this already, but sometimes during sex, air can get trapped in the vagina and then it makes a noise very similar to a fart when it comes out. It can be kinda embarrassing but the best way to deal is to just laugh and move on. ""Laugh and move on"" is just general good advice for sex at any point, but especially when you're new to it, because silly, awkward things probably will happen, but they absolutely don't have to ruin or interrupt the romance of the moment. In fact, to me the best sex often includes laughter because I feel like it establishes trust and connection, like you and your partner are saying ""Huh, that wasn't ideal, but whatever I'm just happy to be doing this with you."" 

If your husband has never had sex before either, he might lose his erection -- again, just shrug it off. It doesn't mean he's not turned on or attracted to you, it's just that some guys lose their erection when they're nervous, and most people are at least a little nervous when they're losing their virginity. If it happens, just do other stuff (kissing, oral, cuddling, etc.) and try again later.

Assuming you haven't done this already, definitely have him put a couple fingers in you before his penis, this will make it easier/less nerve wracking when that moment comes. I suggest having him put in one finer, then two. This will also help you establish whether you're wet/aroused enough for sex, how much lube you'll need, etc.",31,t3_25uz6i

Have you masturbated before? Don't be afraid of self stimulation (rubbing your clit) during sex to reach orgasm, especially because a lot of women cannot orgasm with only vaginal stimulation. Porn =/ real sex (this may affect more your partner's expectations than your own). Open communication about what feels good and what/where/how your partner should touch you will help improve sex.

20140518091342,skittlesnbugs,"I had this whole thing written up about condoms... but then re-read your post and it sounds like you're not using condoms at all haha!

There's almost always a benefit to having lube nearby. For me personally, how much lubrication I have is entirely dependent on my emotional state. So if I get distracted or nervous? I dry up. If I dry up during sex, the friction has a tendency to give me microtears on the inside lining. 

This is less an issue if you're not using condoms, since he's providing a little bit of lubrication too! However, it can be fun to just have it right on hand. Oh he's a little nervous? Handy with lube! You're a little nervous? Either cover him in lube, or cover you in lube! The easier it is going in, the better time you'll both have.

You can also get variety packs of lube on Amazon to try out different types. They've got flavored ones, ones that go warm, ones that make you feel like a slip n slide (in a good way!) 

I can't personally speak towards the non-water based lubes, because I use non-latex condoms which means I can't mix them with oil based lubes. But the water based ones are super super easy to clean up. I like this one: www.amazon.com/Passion-Lubes-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant/dp/B00375LMRU/

The cranberries are an interesting thing. They've got mixed results for everyone. They'll work lovely for some people, and not at all for others. What they try and do is make the environment harder for bacteria to grow. If you've actually got an infection going on, the cranberries will do nothing. If you take a shot of cranberries daily? You might have a harsh enough environment to prevent it - but I'd take other precautions too.

20140518155429,Lynthesage,"Lots of good advice! Here's some life changing additions/affirmations, from someone who also waited until marriage -

 - affirming the communication! advice. Go slow and talk about expectations up front. Both of your main desires aught to be pleasing your partner (yes, I said it). When you BOTH have this loving attitude, sex can be such an incredible, relationship-affirming thing!

 - the above doesn't mean that you don't get YOUR needs met as well, though. Be gently verbal in what is ""working"" and what isn't, and realize that a session of great sex WILL mean that both of you may perform things for your partner that may not be your favorite, but drives your partner insane :) Just make sure to keep communicating so the ""give and take"" is equal.

 - probably the ONE thing that has contributed to our sex life the most for 25 years - **find a way to suggest that he make it the norm to let YOU finish first!** Remember - you can keep going after orgasm much easier than he can. So - After all the foreplay, after all the stroking and playing and petting and what-have-you... when it's time to ""get down to business"", ""head to the finish line"", or whatever you want to call it, my husband ALWAYS lets me finish first, then he finishes soon after. Oh, sometimes it's simultaneous, sometimes he finishes first by accident, or sometimes I feel I may not be able to finish and tell him to go ahead, but 80% of the time I finish first. My ""finishing"" position is almost always him on his back, me sitting on top. I can control the rate, the angles, the stimulation, etc. After hours of pre-sex and ""fun"" sex (trying new things, taking our time, oral, etc.), I can jump on top and finish in about 60 seconds, if I want to, lol!. Then I just ask seductively, ""how do YOU, want to finish, big guy!"", and he knows he can request whatever - his favorites, something we tried earlier that he liked, etc. And, he can concentrate guilt-free on his own mind-blowing orgasm. And, I get to participate and throw myself ""all-in"", because I've just had my own head-exploding climax and can focus on him.

I'm telling you, our sex life after 25 years is still awesome, and I get teenager-level excited every night we plan for an evening of lovemaking (which is once or twice a week, at least).

I've shared this tip with many girlfriends who were struggling in the married sex health situation, and many times it's been a game changer.

Especially as you get used to one another's sex drives, there are probably going to be times where he wants to have sex and you don't or you want to have sex and he doesn't. THIS IS COMPLETELY NORMAL. Don't take it personally, and try to talk through things with him regarding this. Feeling rejected by your partner is terrible, but it does not necessarily mean that he thinks you're ugly naked or something like that. If it comes up a lot that one of you wants to have sex and the other doesn't, don't freak out, but it is something you should sit down and talk about.

I think you can best simulate it by grabbing your top and bottom lips (on your face) near one corner of your mouth and pulling them them gradually further apart until you start to feel a little pain. You'll feel tension in the corner of your mouth and it will linger for just a little while. That's about what I felt down there, but around the entire edge. I continued to feel sore for a short while and I didn't feel ready for sex again for a day or two after. I imagine this may vary dependent on penis size but I don't know.

I also played with his flaccid penis afterwards because I'd never seen one before. They're strange and cool. My SO was fine with it when I asked. I still think they're really strange and interesting five years later. You might only get the chance after sex because a lot of guys will get at least semi-hard when their penises are handled. If they are completely flaccid they can bend in any direction and lay flat against his stomach. It's amazing.

Then, when it gets tough, she asks for extra money. Her opinion on abortion is totally valid, but she loses a lot of credibility after agreeing to that contract. Either the money was so attractive of her that she decided she didn't care that much about her morals, or she never had any intention of honoring that part of the contract.

They had a great metal gold-colored buckle to hold it all together. I used to wear them all the time, until my best friend saw them. 

She said they were hideous. That they're cheap and 'too ghetto'. She said I needed to get up to speed with fashion, because I clearly didn't know what I was doing. Needless to say, I put those shoes away and never wore them again.

Last year, I was packing my clothes. I was moving to another country indefinitely, and needed to bring only my *favorite* things. I remember looking through my shoes, and coming across those platforms. I had completely forgotten about them, but fell in love again the moment I saw them. My shoe size hadn't really changed since high school, and they looked so great...

So I packed them in my bag. Just in case.

When my friends saw those platforms, they insisted I wear them. All the time. They were actually surprised that I hadn't worn them in so long. And I felt like an idiot. I *liked* those shoes. Who cares if my best friend thought they were hideous? She doesn't speak for everybody. Most importantly, she doesn't speak for *me*.

One thing we can do in a situation like this is look carefully at the woman in the dress and listen carefully to what she likes about the dress.  ""You really feel beautiful in that dress,"" is then an honest statement and we can leave ""I think your dress sucks"" unsaid.

Over the years, the friend's daughters and I noticed that while both women said they were being honest, only my mom was making the cutting remarks (she did the same thing to me - honesty, you know, is the highest virtue!)

My dad and I talked to my mom a little about tact (which made her mad).  As the years went by, I realized my mom's tastes were, themselves, subject to several criticisms - but no one made them.  They were tactful.

So I think my mom died thinking that her honesty was still the best policy (she would sometimes reluctantly say that she was keeping her opinions to herself, which of course meant she had something else negative to say) AND that her taste was a bit better than other people's.  It is true that my mom, as a young woman, put more energy into hair and makeup than her friend, and that her friend was breaking some rules written down in women's magazines.

My mom was truly not jealous of her friend, and she wasn't trying to be helpful, either.  She really thought it was very, very important (in friendship) to express one's true opinion.  In my mom's case, it was usually a snap judgment, never changed, and it was years before I realized that many beautifully dressed people fell outside my mom's tolerances.

She was the same way with cooking, food, recipes, etc.  Naturally, as a kid, I thought my mom was a great cook, but years later, I question a lot of her practices.

But I've done that before. I find so many problems with clothes, especially during online browsing. The photoshopped colored options are what get me the most, and I probably messed with the bride's mood when I vaguely mentioned how bad it was. And everything else I criticized that was important to her. She didn't mean to hurt your feelings. She was just being an ass, and it probably comes from some sort of sass that already exists in her attitude or your friendship dynamic, and it's just hurting more now because this is such an occasion. Talk to her about it. Your best friend's going to feel bad that she had that impact on you.

I actually really like the concept of it. The top layer just needs to be dewrinklied on the skirt. After a few weeks, a while after you've gotten through this emotional pitfall with your friend, see how you feel in it.

also hell, as long as you like the dress it's okay. people - including you and your soon-to-be-married-partner - aren't going to be remembering the wedding for the dress as much as how happy the couple looked and how great the booze was ;) for everything else, including grass/dirt/wine stains galore and fuckups like my corset showing above my dress in a whole bunch of pictures because i lost too much weight after my last fitting TWO WEEKS EARLIER, there's photoshop. and for friends that won't shut up because 99% of it is jealousy getting the better of them, it's not their wedding and don't you forget it!

well i kind of lie. some people remembered my dress. but they're remembering the fact that it has two big pockets that i pulled all kinds of stuff out of (phone, a pack of tissues, inhaler, shout wipes, hair pins, a bandaid, a granola bar) more than anything else.

seriously though, i was having a mini I'm-fat-and-this-is-all-going-wrong-crisis right before the wedding, and i had to go back and look at pictures on offbeat bride and actually focus on anything but the big smiles and crinkled eyes and happy tears before i saw that everyone had scars and stretch marks, all kinds of bodies, all kinds of dresses/accessories, all kinds of styles of receptions, all kinds of EVERYTHING and more and I totally didn't see that until I was looking for it.

Point is your friend probably is regretting her words (assuming she's not stubborn) and definitely will when she sees you walking down the aisle on the day. The wedding is so much more than a dress, and seeing the full picture will help.

20140518164319,AwkwardBurritoChick,"I can relate to a flood of horrible memories coming up after being through a lot of trauma.  That was the first sign I finally was beginning to heal, as I had to stuff many things down or 'forget' just to survive the many years long situation.   The emotional period of finally allowing myself to 'review' everything I went through I realized at that time ""Oh shit... I'm finally SAFE now... "".    I am now anxiety prone due to my PTSD, but I at least now I know when my body reacts, the mind knows I'll be alright and will get through the moment. 

So in my opinion, if what I went through is like what you are experiencing it mean's you're on your first leg of truly healing.

As to having three children, yea it can be many things you describe but the pain and yuck stuff is temporary.  If it was that bad the human species would have been extinct by now. 

If you choose to have kids or not is up to you and the only 'right' thing for you is what is 'right' for you.

I appreciate how you realize that your future doesn't have be ruled by your past.  Sometimes you have to go through a lot of shit to get a beautiful garden. 

Part of my growth and healing was meeting my BF.  At the time I was going through that crappy part of my life I DID NOT want a relationship or ever could see myself in another relationship because of all the painful experiences via one night stands, drinking, the emotional abuse I was getting from my ex and his mentally unstable wife, and even my own parents.  It was like when I was down, people just trampled me down even more...  

So when I met my BF, it was upfront that hey, this is going to be a casual thing... maybe a few weeks. Though I rarely was with an FWB more than three times, our sexual chemistry was... well, outstanding.  He performed above and beyond his usual man bragging. 

Then a couple months later, and we started actually dating, he gave me an ultimatium.. we had to do overnights and spend time together... and SPOON. 

Whut the whut? Overnight? In a bed? All night? SPOONING????

The first morning he asked me jokingly how I did. ""I hated it.  You took up more than half the bed, I was on the edge all night where I normally sprawl, you're hot and sweaty... and no. Not fun"". 

Now? He goes to bed about 3 hours before I do and I will always spoon with him (sometimes leads to the fun stuff as a bonus) for about an hour... nothing makes me feel as safe and protected than being wrapped by his body.  And we're going on 11 years....

Seemed like everytime he went out there, in two weeks he had to go back again.... 

So I called my mom as I didn't know what 'to do' for him.... she said ""AwkwardBurritoChick... this is an easy one.  What you do is BE HIS FRIEND"".

20140518184149,futuremaude,"Forgive me, HawkeyeHanah, but I feel compelled to mediate here.  I don't think FreeCookies6 is trying to argue with you; rather, s/he is offering you a perspective that allows you agency, which is something you seem to be struggling with, although you haven't explicitly framed your troubles this way.

When one has been abused, teased, raped and otherwise mistreated as you have been (and as I have been), agency has been repeatedly denied.  How can we find our agency?  Because of the psychological torment we've been through, it can be extraordinarily difficult to even realize that agency is something we need and have lost, much less locate in the mental detritus created by our abusers.

I think FC6 is responding to that vibe in your post--s/he doesn't mean to be disagreeable.  I think s/he means to point out to you that pregnancy and childbirth aren't your biological inevitability or destiny, but *choices* you can make *freely*.

I think s/he means to empower you with the agency of being the *only person able* to make those choices for you and your potential future family.  

I, for one, applaud you for your soul searching (as I bet FC6 does, too).  I think you're doing tremendous work to heal.  And furthermore, it sounds like you *want* to be a mother, but your trauma interfered with your desire to mother.

I just wanted to point out that even though some people do have a hard time with pregnancy and childbirth, that's not always the way it is. Everyone is different and there are many women who have uneventful pregnancies and don't find childbirth horrible. 

If it was horrible for everyone, nobody would ever have more than one kid. 

When you do get pregnant, I would suggest talking honestly with your ob/gyn about being scared of the pain and talk about what your options are for pain relief. 
I think sometimes women are made to feel guilty about things like wanting pain medication and epidurals. If you need something like an epidural, it's not something to feel bad about. Do what you have to do. 
I know that I personally would never attempt a natural childbirth without pain medication. If other people find that works for them, good for them, but I don't want to go through that. ",5,t3_25vs4z

They're not as good (and when I mean good, I mean skill and competition level) because we haven't had as long to develop them (men have had thousands of years!). Men's sports get the best of the best. I know a pro football player who blatantly told me he doesn't even follow football, he's a die hard soccer fan but football is his job. As for women, if you play a sport your whole life, land a scholarship, play for a D1 school and get a great degree... well, when you graduate, you're going to make more money with that degree than playing a professional sport. It's nice because there's true passion behind those who do pursue it professional, but passion doesn't mean skills and without skills, there's no competition either.

The saddest part, is that the skill and competition level in youth leagues is astounding. I've seen U11 girls teams who could take on national teams if they were a little bigger, but it dies off throughout the years. It's easy to aspire to be a professional football player, with a mutli-million dollar contract, and hundreds of thousands of fans but to play women's basketball on a court smaller than the one you played on in college with fewer fans.

I will say, it's better in Europe. In Europe, there are sports clubs instead of individual franchises. In the US, it's New York Yankees baseball, New York Giants football, New York Rangers hockey, etc so you have a different team for every sport.

One night the poor Riviera wouldn't start. Got out to check the battery and realized the battery cable had a short. Wiggled it and got on the road. Problem? After so long on the road the vibration would move the battery cable around again. The car would die, everything would shut off, including the headlights. I had to coast to the shoulder, pop the hood, and wiggle it again. Did this all the way home. 

All of these car problems would pay off when I see a young woman who can't get her fairly new car running. The car won't crank over and I can see that she is scared. I went over to her and told her to lightly flutter the gas peddle while starting the car. Bam! That engine started purring and she looked at me like I was a god! ",3,t3_25vc2s

The filter a little less so. Why? Because the damn thing sat in behind the front wheel (so you had to get around that first), just above where the 4-2-1 exhaust joined 2 to 1. That created a little spot for oil to pool. It didn't matter what I tried, I always ended up with a little oil on the exhaust when changing that filter. The headlight bulb was a pain to change, too. Thankfully I only had to do it once. Right under the light is a tiny square hole to remove it. By ""tiny"", I mean about 2 square inches. Even with my small hands, I couldn't do it.

Not to mention the mom of Elsa and Anna has the same exact face as well. Which, biologically could only happen if she used mitosis. 

Although, these are whimsical cartoons and aren't restrained by the laws of biology. It's not that it's offensive that two sisters look alike, it's the inference Disney is making that although in animation it is better to have one character with many faces Frozen has many characters with one face.

Animation isn't bound to biological forces. According to the blog, it's not as appealing to make everyone look alike in a cartoon. I agree with this. Variation is much more interesting to me.

So I think the writer is inferring Disney is sending a message about beauty only having one face. Now that could be a huge assumption, maybe some of you think not so much. This was the origin of my curiosity, which I may not have made clear to begin with.",-1,t3_25viq4
20140518134847,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,"""Same exact face"" is simply inaccurate.  The differences are subtle, but it definitely looks like the degree of variance found in a nuclear family's common genetic makeup.  Different chins, different eyebrows, different complexions.  Saying it ""biologically could only happen if she used mitosis"" is simply incorrect, and that kind of lily gilding only hurts your case.

Yes, Disney holds and enforces a very particular notion of what beauty is and it frequently conflates that concept with the notions of virtue which it similarly holds and enforces.  The near-universal body and face types of female protagonists are problematic and the similarity between Rapunzel and characters in *Frozen* points damningly to this.  No argument from me.

I'm simply pointing out that all the rhetoric, time, and energy spent criticizing the likeness shared by three members of a nuclear family -- a phenomenon which occurs quite frequently in the real world -- serves only to undermine the validity of those very real points.

20140519030126,jennifuzzbox,"A few years ago I could have been writing this. People in my work life often comment when they see me in social situations how different I am... I was also traumatized by childhood bullying. 

It's gotten a lot better! I credit 3 things:
1. Creating a social circle where I can slip on what I mentally call my ""work hat"" when I go out and things get awkward. It started out accidentally - I started a blog about my city and made a reputation as a niche subject guru of sorts. I met people who were into the same topic - so when we hung out I kept my professional hat on and we always had lots to talk about. They had reached out to me as sort of fans/fellow enthusiasts, so I think I always felt like there was respect there and I knew where I stood and felt socially valued. A few years later I have this fun, quirky niche group I've kind of collected and we hangout fairly regularly. I have somehow never felt anxious around them. It also should be noted that the people I get along with best are also introverts who see my awkwardness for what it is and not misread it as rudeness. 

2. A good therapist. She helped me see moments where I could use the assets I do have in social situations more effectively, and problem solve ways around the roadblocks that trigger me. 

3. I can't stress this one enough. My significant other is a huge support. It's taken a decade and lots of me saying what I need but whenever I get anxious or nervous ahead of time he is a great cheerleader to help at least get me out the door. He prevents me from allowing my fears to mean I never leave the house. 

Good luck!

20140519055347,ShenBear,"Wow, this is eerily similar to what I've always felt. 

From the time I was a teen, I've always wondered if I might have some slight bit of asperger's. I work as a teacher, and am in front of students all day, have great presentation skills due to it...students love me...but one on one, or in a social group setting (groups of peers) especially if I'm with someone(s) unfamiliar, I have bouts where it just doesn't 'click' and I become an awkward, fumbling idiot (at least in my mind). Mostly this is when I'm not wearing my 'teacher hat' or my 'spouse hat' (as my partner and I have great communication skills, and I find it easy to relate what's in my mind). Due to this, I find it very difficult to initiate social contact. I find myself worrying how others will respond to me. Stress seems to be a trigger too. The more relaxed I am, the easier I find it to get out of my head and pick up on the clues. Needless to say, I'm quite the loner.

I play a lot of strategy games too, and I absolutely love challenges which make me use my problem solving skills. Reading is a sincere pleasure as well. 

Another MoO fan? That's something I don't see every day. What about Master of Magic? Cheers on playing my personal favorite strategy game of all time :)

I do have a question for you though, from one gamer to another. I've noticed more and more that I'm having a bit of reluctance when it comes to trying/starting new games. I've felt a bit of fear at having to overcome the learning curve. Older, familiar games have felt safer for me, when before I'd dive into a new challenge. Have you experienced this at all (since you mentioned old games you love to play), or is this something that is just me?

School assessments are often inadequate and sometimes biased toward suggesting less help for the child (to cost the school less). The better option in my opinion is to go to a child psychologist with experience in testing for autism.my opinion of the best option is to look for a multidisciplinary diagnostic team, which may include a pediatrician, speech therapist, occupational therapist, physical therapist, psychologist, and a preschool teacher. These teams can diagnose a range of developmental disabilities, and there's an advantage in having so many different perspectives all collaborating in one day.

We are all on a sliding scale of something, like this person over here may be on the autism spectrum (which can manifest in different ways, there are indicators but no textbook symptoms), that person could be suffering from mild depression, or be bipolar or whatever. It doesn't mean anything is broken in you, or that you necessarily need to be medicated. However knowing these things about yourself can help you compensate, and communicate better with others. 

I'm going to be honest, the social problems you're having is because of you. You are the common denominator here with all these different people, so you're giving off some vibe or saying or doing something. The good news about this is you're the solution as well, you can overcome this. I've been where you are so perhaps I can give you some pointers. 

Know that what you think, perceive, or feel to be true may not be so. You got all this baggage going into a social situation & with the info I see here it's almost like you're looking to be rejected or expecting failure. You don't feel the same way at work, so you project confidence there. Something else to know is everyone is at the center of their own personal universe. We all approach things from our own POV, and are inherently kinda selfish. That's not a bad thing, we all tend to focus on our crap first and others second, and everyone has their own baggage. So, coming into a social situation where folks dong know each other you may say something... and maybe they don't react the way you wanted or hoped and then feel rejected and give up. That's your perception though. It may be they didn't know how to react, or that they didn't find it funny, of maybe they broke up with their SO last night and are preoccupied with those thoughts. Point is they may not be rejecting you, they may just not be getting you yet or maybe their reaction doesn't have anything to do with you. Don't expect too much from strangers. It takes time to build relationships and make friends. 

Btw with these meetup groups you say you were rejected from... Did they like formally reject you by saying 'we don't want you coming back', or do you just feel blown off. If  it's the former, ask why. If it's the latter, that may be only your perception. It takes time to make friends. You may have to keep coming back and meet up with the same folks over and over again to build those relationships. It takes time, don't expect too much too soon and be open to whatever.

Granted, I don't have dysgraphia (well, not really) and I definitely don't have epilepsy, but I can totally relate to your AS and Dyspraxia.

Like you, I -can- pick up on social cues, mostly fluently, and seemingly automatically (as in, the process-to-reaction time to a social cue is around 1 second) but it's definitely not an ""automatic"" process in the traditional sense, more a case of learning things by rote.

I think that's probably why I actually struggle building relationships - both pleutonic and romantic, because the logical table of appropriate responses doesn't always cover conversations between ""after polite small talk"" and ""WOW I KNOW YOU SO WELL"" except in some small circumstances.

I love brazzledazzle's likening to natural social cues to colour blindness - it really IS like that because I don't really have a feel for what neuro-typical social cues are, just my crazy on-the-flying styling social cues based on years and years of trial and error.

I was significantly less functioning than I was when I was around 7 (I am now 27) - I was hardly in a wheel chair or anything! - but I was completely socially inept and even my dyspraxia was worse than it is now. I just wanted to say that others ASD/Dys* reading this, or parents of kids with this, it IS possible to actually override most of the traits to become ""socially normal"". Granted, some of the traits never really go away, mostly the little things (the small obsessions, the missing steps in an order of commands, the small social cues, etc) but for all intents and purposes, to the average person observing me, or even my colleagues around me, they have absolutely no clue I have AS.

Reading these sub-comments have made me feel all warm and happy inside that there are more people on the same level as me, as I said, it's a rarity to run into for me! Hence my ridiculously long (surprisingly long) reply. Like you, probably rambling too much now, so I'll end it here :')

B.) If you aren't finding what you want, start your own group. I recently started my own group and it's so nice to finally run things they way I have always wanted to. Totally worth the extra work that organizing requires.

C.) When you do physically attend a meetup, think of it as a low risk, low intensity way to meet new people to have friendships outside of the group. Make an effort to find out about people and if you get along, plan to do other stuff together. Waiting for the next Meetup is not really all that conducive to a real friendship.

D.) Depending on your interests, you will likely get a lot of weird, weird people at your meetups. But overwhelmingly, they are also very nice people. So swallow that discomfort and pride, and just talk to everyone. You will probably be surprised at what you learn about your fellow group members.",158,t3_25wurf

I grew up in a very well mannered family so like you I am also extremely polite and a true lady around people that I don't know very well. I don't gossip and don't like much drama. As a result I think it is hard for other people to connect with people like us. They really can't relate with what you like or dislike, what your opinions about things are, or  they don't have any stories that reminds them of you. So they don't have anything that they can relate with or remember you for. Once you start to let go it is much easier to make friends. Share small little details about your life with other. It does not have to be anything very personal. For example, I mentioned to a group of people that I love peaches and I can eat just peaches for dinner. After that one of the people sent me a link to a website that has the best sells amazing peaches. They were truly mind-blowing. So I emailed her back to thank her and buy her coffee for introducing me to that and we have been friends since. Share little details like that and it is easier for people with connect with you. And also it is okay to express your opinions. If they don't agree with you that is totally fine. You don't have to be in good terms with everyone.

20140519141451,throwaway887761,"This comment really resonated with me, and got me thinking about a part of my personality that's been there for so long, so deep at the bottom, that I can't remember a time before it was part of me. While I was raised to have good manners, my family is not well-heeled--we're just people. I was taught how to behave at a fancy dinner, and how to be polite to the waitress at a greasy spoon. 

But personality-wise, I've always been ultra-feminine and interested in being polished and poised. When I was a little girl, I loved books and movies set in the Victorian or 50s/60s era. I wanted to wear gloves and hats. I wanted to learn how to speak at the knee of someone like Henry Higgins. I actually taught myself how to walk around with a book balanced on my head. I never could connect with novels where a heroine from a high-bred family bucks against her upbringing...I would have *killed* to be sent to a high-class finishing school, or something like that. To me, it sounded like *fun*.

It occurred to me after reading your comment last night (sorry I didn't respond then, but it was late!) that maybe some of that puts people off. I know I stand and sit very straight--because that's what the antique self-improvement book from 1955 that I found at a garage sale told me to do, and I did it, goddamnit. When I was in high school, kids thought I had an accent--when I grew up down the road from them. I was just interested in speaking well. And sure, maybe I've built a very pretty package for myself, but maybe it's too fancy a package for people to feel comfortable around. Like a dress you love, but never wear because you don't want to ruin it.

Another question you could consider is how good you are at understanding social cues, body language, etc. If you really want to, read How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie for an in-depth look at social situations.


It kinda sounds like you have your shit together and are just frustrated at being alone on the friend ship. I feel ya. You just have to keep putting yourself out there and tell yourself that you might have been lame in middle school (weren't we all?), but you're now an educated, kind, intelligent, hard-working bad-ass bitch. Putting positive energy into making friends will eventually reward you, and you just have to keep pushing yourself to be social even though it might seem like people suck. 

Investing time in people leads to friendship, so if you have acquaintances, ask them how they're doing and if they want to check out a cool thing happening in the area! I hope you find some bad-ass bitches just like you :)",44,t3_25wurf

But I'm also rational and grown-up enough to nip that negative mental talk in the bud. So I doubt I'm missing things there. 

What might be more likely (at least, when I'm interacting with people in person) is that I think I might come across as a little cold.

Not being super outgoing does make it difficult. Just make sure that the person you're interacting with can understand that you're still engaged in the conversation, or else they will perceive the convo as one-sided and tend to pull back. If you find yourself not having anything to say, whip out a filler phrase like ""I'm just thinking..."" or just ask the person to explain what they mean.

* Your SO's phone was stolen.
* Someone took the phone home.
* That someone's SO saw naked pictures on your SOs phone.

This is where I'm confused...

* Lady posts your naked picture's to her SOs FB account? or your husbands?

* One way makes it sound as though she posted to the stealer's facebook account--and if that's the case, you're FB friends with them (I doubt this is the case, but that's how I initially read it).
* If she posted your photos to your husbands facebook account then it seems as though your husband and they guy have the same phone and she didn't even realize and started posting all your photos to your husbands page.  

**But** you also said, 
> *""And maybe the new owner was cheating because there were pictures of other women as well.""* 

How do you know this?  If this were the case, wouldn't it be your husband's phone? If you're saying your pictures were posted to your husband's facebook by this girl, and that there were other pictures of women on there...it would be your husbands phone, right? Are they pictures on your husband's phone that you know about?

Again, not saying your husband has photos of other women, but that part of the post is very confusing and she wouldn't have access to your husbands profile from her SOs page...I hope you can find your husband's phone...

I would suggest changing his password and removing the photos if you haven't done so already. maybe even sending an email to an address linked to that phone to try and get it back. Maybe he picked it up accidentally.

• The woman posted every photo of other women on the phone. And there were others that were not me. So i can only guess that the person who stole it just added photos of other women that they are seeing/friends with.

It does seem as though the damage has been done and you're not getting the phone back. I hope the police will cooperate but I also understand that if they tried to find every stolen phone, that's all they'd be doing. I live in a city and one time my coworkers phone got stolen. He was the asst. manager at the drug store we worked at. He kept calling and finally they answered. They set up a meet in a public place downtown. The thief said she'd be wearing jeans and a red tee shirt or something along those lines. He said he'd be in a blue jacket and khaki pants. Well he got near the spot, called her, said he had the money for the exchange, found the woman matching her description talking on the phone and actually stole the phone out of her hand because he wasn't wearing what he said. So while this method isn't safe, I'm just saying thiefs aren't the smartest people. Check Craigslist and eBay often. Keep calling the number. Even if it dies, they may have shut it off.

Unexplained bleeding and spotting can sometimes be a sign of more serious things, like an infection. Dont worry too much - the testing procedure is painless and these things are easiky remedied. The doctor will use a speculum to have a look at what's going on down there and take a few swabs for testing.

It might not be effective to replace all the pronouns because relationships where women are the abuser might work in slightly different ways. In a similar sense, gay or polygamous abusive relationships might function in different ways as well. This book focuses abuse dynamics in one kind of relationship.

No actual change to boob volume, but they might look nicer in a differently sized bra.

The pill does increase breast volume in some women. My sister, my best friend and I all found that to be the case. Note that it can come with a whole slew of other effects, I don't think it's a good thing to start on just for the sake of maybe bigger boobs.

Working out chest muscles can add a little bit of volume up top.

I'm going to go ahead and call bullshit on most non-surgical breast enhancers. Breasts are made up of fat. Which means you can build muscle underneath it (slight gains) or gain fat or maybe water weight. Fat you gain can't be targeted to any one region.

Once you get the right sized bra (after following the sizing guide), you will be able to easily scoop all of your tissue where it should be, which in time will be there permanently. Since learning how to do this, I've grown about 1.5 cup sizes. 

And banana, you are correct. There are no non-surgical breast enhancers that work, with the exception of the pill-and that is not a guarantee. The reason you gain boobs with the pill is because you are adding an excess amount of hormones to your body. Boobs are mostly fat, but their size is largely determined on the number of hormones you have. Personally, I have a LOT of hormones, which means I have decent sized boobs. 

Another thing to note about the pill and boob size is that there is *no* guarantee you'll keep the boobs you gain if/when you go off of the pill. Just like there's no guarantee the boobs you gain from pregnancy will remain (many women lose the added boob size, but plenty keep it). ",1,t3_25wqtb

I think it's better to frame it as ""I am totally into you and I want to play with your junk, but I have no idea what I'm doing, so if I am manhandling your penis, you need to tell me"" say this at some point when you two are rolling around together on a couch or a meadow or something. 

frame it as ""I am new at this and I want to try it out"" and don't just straight into P in V intercourse, and be sure to use protection.

that said, I found myself in that relationship giving a lot more orgasms than I received. it's easy for a guy to take advantage of ones inexperience and just be all ""but you didn't ask me to go down on you, you never said you wanted to get off, I thought you were happy just giving me blowjobs whenever I ask for them which is all the time"" 

Advocate for yo'self. (and use protection)

it is ok to set boundaries and say what you want. you don't have to live up to any standard but the one you set for yourself. 

also, sometimes your first time will hurt no matter how relaxed you are, there is such thing as an imperforate hymen and it's going to rip. this is not always true, (a lot of people have a first time that doesn't hurt) but it is sometimes true. on the plus side, it makes tampons much easier to deal with.

on using protection: put a drop of waterbased (think ky jelly) lube on his penis and then make sure there is no air in the condom by pinching the reservoir tip closed while he rolls it down the shaft.  take more lube (think handful) and slather it on the outside. if he tries to talk you out of the condom for any reason, 

**don't have sex with him.** don't even have oral sex with him, and I know that is a controversial opinion, but [antibiotic resistant Gonorrhea](http://www.cdc.gov/Std/Gonorrhea/arg/default.htm) is transmittable orally and sometimes asymptomatic, even if pregnancy is not.

I think a blend is still the best choice. Outright gender neutrality I believe, though I am not certain, may leave us prone to the prejudices of our imaginations.

So a heroine is presented as tough and sexy. Its really no different than the over the top Muscles that Heroes are given in the comics. They are Super. This is how it should be. 

Even in the live action movies, both sexes are objectified. Black Widow, Catwoman and Mystique are bent over in a skin tight suit. Thor and Wolverine and Captain America are walking around with their shirts off unnecessarily. I personally feel like this is the one area where objectification fits.

20140519102116,EbilSmurfs,"You are looking at things improperly. As a man if I want to go find a strong male character that is not all muscle I can and it's pretty easy. There are lots of media outlets where men are not overly beefy while still being considered strong, Ironman is easy to point out but not alone. Women on the other hand do not have this ease of access. 

Finding a strong, female character is difficult, can you name one that isn't a superhero? I would count the new Tomb Raider, but they had to reboot her entire character for that. It's much more difficult for women and girls to have a strong characters in media and the few that exist are also sexualized. 

The problem is not ""Superheros are fantasy don't take it personally"", we all get that. Both men and women fully understand that shooting webs from your hands is not normal, but women have far fewer non-super human people to look up to. Media bombards them constantly with hot women who dress suggestively and we get Thor *and* Kevin James (King of Queens) as people to look up to in some way. Yes, fat white males have a representative with a hot wife but there is no female equivalent.

",-4,t3_25xnzk
20140519110934,Precise_Masters,"Thank you for your response. It does give me a better understanding on why women would be upset about this. I just think that in the nature of this context (being comic book superheros) there is really no way in presenting heroic women in a light that would be acceptable other than allowing them to completely dominate in every story. Let me explain.

Using your last sentence as an example, lets just say we see the heroine you describe. Who would be her adversary? Heroes in comic aren't always dominant and many times barely make out of battles they encounter. Would you rather see your heroine getting beat within a inch of her life by some overpowering male super villain? I think then we would have complaints about women getting abused and looking helpless against a stronger man. I feel like there is no way to write this character without making her boring (though I'm no writer). 

Take Maria Hill for instance. The character that Colby Smoulders plays in the Avengers Movies. Doesn't wear revealing outfits. Shown with agency. Is an attractive woman but those attributes aren't accentuated. Yet does leave a lasting impression on anyone.

And as far as your ""women in refrigerators"" example, although you are correct, that role isn't given solely to women. Ben Parker, Buckey Barnes and Pa Kent are perfect examples of that. Male Characters that are killed off to ignite heroism or rage. 

So its not that what you ask can't be done. But will it appeal to enough people so that the character is profitable? Would you go buy a Maria Hill series comic? Do you think a large percentage of the comic book audience will? [87%](http://www.comicvine.com/profile/foxxfireart/blog/challenge-of-the-demographics-men-and-women/87487/] of comic book readers are male. Do you think they want to see Spiderman's package? You must have missed the outrage when they showed nipples on the Bat suit in the Batman and Robin movie. 

Again, I'm not saying its ok to objectify women in comics. I'm just saying in this context, it makes sense when characters, both male and female are objectified. ",0,t3_25xnzk

If it means we get more of Angela del Toro as White Tiger, then YES.  As long as she keeps picking herself back up again and keeps on fighting, even if it's another day, why wouldn't we.  That's what makes the ""hero"" part of super hero.  (If you not familiar with White Tiger think of Kickass except with hero has amulets that grant super powers.)

Also, why does the super villain have to be male?  Why can't we have more female super villains as well?

That 13% would probably grow, without losing male readers, if female super heroes weren't treated like walking pairs of tits (which is exactly what Black Widow is if you're new to the super hero scene).

There are very physically ordinary men in comics. Many put their smarts to good use and build elaborate robots and armor. For the women, what tends to matter is that they wear skintight suits and have huge boobs. I think women are tired of *always* having to be portrayed as sexually appealing to men.

Even if I'm just walking through the mall, I mostly see low cut tops and Yoga pants everywhere. However, thats besides the point, as most of these girls are women under 30 and the truth is Media does over sexualize women. 

My point is in comics, characters are designed to be over the top, larger than life figures. Men are given muscles the average man doesn't have. Women are given breast the average woman doesn't have or doesn't flaunt. But these people aren't real. They are creations from a person's imagination. If you were telling me every camera shot of Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama was a cleavage and butt shot, I would be upset because these are real people who have real influence on peoples lives. But instead I'm hearing outrage about made up characters that go around **killing people** for a living because they drew her breast too big and its sends the wrong message. Really? I mean no disrespect in saying this, but if you want your daughter to know that she is more than a sex object, you shouldn't be looking to fictional characters as role models.

20140519151244,codeverity,"> Women aren't just hyper sexualized in media, but in everyday life. When I go out to clubs, then majority of women I see aren't in business suits or nice lose fitting outfit. They are wearing thing that I would expect a sex worker to wear. Even if I'm just walking through the mall, I mostly see low cut tops and Yoga pants everywhere. However, thats besides the point, as most of these girls are women under 30 and the truth is Media does over sexualize women.

Even the ""positive"" compliments are really negative, though, because they teach people that what matters is how these women look.

The problem is that even these women in leadership roles who should be critiqued for their ability to lead & motivate are instead critiqued on appearance. I still put that in the same general category of problems like the over-sexualization of many fictional female characters. The point is that women are told they need to be sexy & attractive to be worthwhile, even if their appearance has nothing to do with what they do.

You're absolutely right. That is a problem, but its a problem because its real women who deserve to be recognized as role models for young women to aspire to be like. These are women who are active in our society and are playing a vital role in the world we live in today. Its sad that there is even an issue on the amount of respect they receive. 

But a fictional character created in a world of fantasy shouldn't have to be held by those same guidelines. They're not real. The only impact they have on the world we live is created by parents who failed to teach their children how to treat and respect people. They aren't role models. They're created from people's imagination. You don't find it silly that you're saying potential leaders of the free world and a figment of someones imagination should be respected in the same manner?",2,t3_25xnzk
20140519174254,ThePolemicist,"I think you're overlooking the imagery and effect the images have on people. I'm not only talking about children here. Go to a supermarket and look at the magazines. Most are advertised to adult women, and the images are of women in sexualized positions. 

From the time we are young, we're taught that what is most important is that we look good. Studies have shown that, time and again, women would choose a hot body over a strong mind if given an option. You can choose politics or fictional characters or anything in between, and you'll see one thing in common: the women almost always have to look good.

That isn't the case for men. A man like Chris Christie can be a politician. Comedians can look like Louis CK. We see morbidly obese male actors regularly. Male athletes can be ugly. It doesn't matter. For women, we are taught it *does* matter. Even if you look at fictional female characters, the women need to look good. Short & ugly Barney Rubble? Married to beautiful Betty. Fat & balding Homer Simpson? Married to tall & thin Marge. Look at popular television shows. In Seinfeld, you have a pretty unattractive Kramer, a fat George, a fat Newman, but Elaine is pretty. That is almost always the case. A man can be unattractive but still smart or funny. A woman can't. You can see it true in other areas as well. Olympians are the best in the world at their sport. We celebrate athletes like Michael Phelps. For the women, people usually talk about their skin tight uniforms. People tune in for the bikini volleyball or the skintight cross country skiing outfits. On Reddit, people post pictures of the ass of the track stars. Again, when it comes to the women, what matters is how they look, not what they do. The same is true, as I said, of politicians. When we talk about male politicians, we don't talk about what they look like. ""Oh, that Senator is bald and ugly."" We don't do that. For the female politicians, we do. ""Oh, she wears pantsuits."" 

The point is that there are almost no female characters--real or fictional--that portray women in any other way other than attractive. If a woman isn't attractive, we pick her apart to death. [Look at this post from /r/twoxchromosomes earlier this week](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25p6km/sarah_millicans_awesome_response_to_twitter/). That comedian was brought to tears by the cruel comments and tweets from people about her ugly dress. People called her fat and ugly. 

My point stands. Women are told from a young age (and are still told in adulthood) that they must--above all else--look *good*. Often, good is equated to sexy. Women are told how they should cut and style their hair, how it should be colored. How they should shape and shade in their eyebrows. How they should apply makeup and pierce their ears and wear jewelry. We're told how to inject ourselves to hide wrinkles, and we know how our collar bones should look. We know how our arms should be toned and not jiggly, how it's wrong if we have dark body hair. We know how we should keep our nails and paint them colors. We know how perky our breasts should be, and we have bras and Wonderbras and surgery to enhance them. We know what measurements our bodies should be, how our hips should flair from a tiny waste and into a pronounced booty. We even know how our labia should look, and how we should wax our pubic hair off. We know about stretch marks and cellulite and how to keep our legs shaved and smooth. We even know how to keep our toenails looking cute, and there are even toe rings to decorate them. Our entire bodies are objects, and we have to look good. If we don't, we're cut down mercilessly, even if what we do isn't based on our looks. You can be Secretary of State, and people will make fun of your outfit, if you're a woman. If you're a woman, you **will be** objectified. 

So, women are trying to stand up against that. It's not wrong to point out this objectification of women and show how ridiculous it goes. A woman can't even be in a fight and be a bad-ass without wearing a latex suit and flex in a way to show off her butt.

20140519122515,Skiddle1138,"I would like to briefly point out a few things that people often overlook in this discussion. The first is that women in comics aren't sexualized by men, they are sexualized by everybody. Even the female artists (Fiona Staples from the Saga series is one of my favorites) in the industry draw females in sexualized poses and give them small frames with large busts. From my perspective as an artist it is sometimes less about sexism and more about the stylization that is an inherent part of comics. Comics heroes were not originally meant to be realistic representations of the everyday man/woman, they were idealized. Superman still suffers from this, a man with only one weakness who could realistically kill almost everyone in his rogue gallery by throwing them into the sun is hard to turn into a good film. Newer comics tend not to idealize as much, but the original Marvel/DC lineup still has its original audience to cater to. In some cases it isn't a matter of strength vs sexuality when posing characters, it's strength vs agility. Female characters happen to fall into the agility slot more often that men but take Spider-Man and Spider-Girl and their poses become interchangeable. You could probably put him in nearly any female pose and it wouldn't look totally out of place. I recently saw a cartoon making fun of the way Black Widow splays one leg out when she lands, but that's something males do all the time in old kung fu films. You only notice it's sexual when a female does it.

I'm guessing that most of the people that complain about this either don't actually read comics or only read the big ones from the Mervel/DC universes. I own/rent many comics/manga/graphic novels and I would say that most that I own do not sexualize the women (examples for those that need them, I'm currently reading Attack on Titan and Habibi). Most portray them just as realistically as they do the men, the women aren't super busty and the men don't have giant muscles. What you see advertised is not a true representation of the comic industry as a whole, only the big names appealing to the widest possible demographic and the others that try and fail to hit that same demographic by mimicking the art styles of the big names. Smaller independent comics don't follow this trend as often.

It is a problem, if you consider an artist drawing a female how he sees fit to be a problem, but it's not quite as large as people make it out to be. You can find plenty of strong female characters when you stop looking in the best selling section of a industry dominated by males. You'll also find better male and child characters (see Tekkon Kinkreet for two badass homeless preteens).

I'm not great at tl;dr's, sorry. :(

edit: I know people mention girls having no strong female characters to look up to, but unfortunately you need to be active when presenting your children good role models in all areas, not just female heroes. People look up to the selfish Steve Jobs instead of the all but selfless Bill Gates as an example of business, or Lil Wayne instead of Neil deGrasse Tyson as a successful black man. ",-11,t3_25xnzk

Anime is, I agree, much worse probably in most areas regarding sexism, but it's also odd in that they have some great female character driven shows that are also loaded with fanservice. 

I only say that most probably don't actually read the comics because it's just probably true, people like to jump into comic discussions as if they've been fans all their lives when they only started liking superheroes when Raimi made a decent Spider-Man. That's not me being dismissive of females, that's me being dismissive of people who do that kind of stuff.

I think this still makes OP's statememt true. If women aren't in the majority in comic readership, then they are not the primary demographic. And given that we don't have the data on the sexual orientation of those women, there may me a percentage of them that enjoy the over sexualized artwork.

>When men are featured, they're not half naked in physically impossible poses like women often are in comics. Its a false equivalency.

They don't have to be have naked or in physically impossible poses to appeal to young teen women. Companies don't tend to market to women often through visual stimulation since women aren't as easily visually stimulated as men are. They do it psychologically. The target young women's emotions, fears, and insecurities. Have you ever seen a fat girl in a Victoria's Secret commercial. Nope. And you won't. You'll see the type of women men typically want to see. Not because they want men to buy underwear, but because they want women to think they can be just as appealing to men if they wear the same thing.

But I have to disagree with you 100% about parents only being able to do so much and its that mentality that is hurting our future Generation. As a parent, I take full responsibility in what my children learn. No, you can't avoid negative exposure but you can still teach you kids to make good moral decisions despite what they see. The feminine beauty ideal is only going to affect those who aren't taught how to love themselves and how special and unique they are. Children only learn from the outside world if that's all they're exposed to. I was raised in the hood. about 85% of the people i grew up with are dead, in jail or Drug dealers. I was exposed to the same environment they were. Went to the same schools. Played at the same parks. Listened to the same music. Saw the same shady influences day after day.

If it is a bad business decision, presumably the action comic book segment is (or will be) suffering financially as a result.

Neither example is sexist, nor is it a false equivalency. Rather, each form of media is targeted to a specific demographic: young people of a particular gender. 

In the magazines I mentioned, a cursory survey will reveal a myriad of images and verbiage pandering to gender-specific ""female"" roles (focus on appearance, fashion, dieting) and will further present men in a sexually objectified manner (currently ""hot"" male stars, boyfriend advice). Most of the denigration or objectification of males is text-based rather than visual.

I make a lot of concessions for his OCD, but your SO's behavior would be unacceptable to me. My SO is mildly homophobic (he's totally ok with gay couples but is largely repelled towards gay PDA) and it has nothing to do with OCD and more to do with his own personal values and preferences.

Your boyfriend needs to see a therapist. OCD is something that can mess up your entire life. Yes, you can have relationships, but if your behaviour is slowly hollowing out your partner's self-esteem, you both have a problem.

I'm not a fan of recommending you leave the guy, but if he refuses to get treatment, I don't really see why you should continue dating. Do you really feel like the positives outweigh the negatives? You said he makes you feel like shit, and that's something your partner shouldn't do - or if he does, he shouldn't be all ""That's just how I am, deal with it"". A partner should care for you, and for your feeling of self-worth. Your boyfriend uses homophobic and sexist language. He uses language that you have told him is hurtful to you. He doesn't seem to care for what you want in bed, or in this case, on the floor. He talks trash about women he doesn't even know, and he seems to be very negative about his previous girlfriends. 

Don't expect to be the exception. You will not cure him. You will not even make him better. Leave that to the professionals, and ask yourself why you are with this man.

THAT is OCD. 

Not wanting to see you because he hasn't showered has nothing to do with OCD. There are many people that don't feel comfortable going out without showering. OCD means that your showers can last for hours because the timing of how many circular scrubbing motions you made on one side of your head didn't match the other and you need to start the whole shower again.

Of course, I'm not there and I haven't read the Tab, so this is an outsider's perspective. That said, I think what you've written may not achieve your aims as well as you're hoping. 

For example, in answer to the question of why the workshops are compulsory, I would be more inclined to ask how many people had sex ed where none of this kind of stuff was covered. In that context, mandatory workshops might make sense - after all, you should already know this stuff, but if you've never had the opportunity to learn it, that may need to happen here.

And it also seems like you're conflating lad culture with the concept of homosociality, which is the formal term for non-romantic male relationships, and the basis of what you're talking about when you say guys need to call each other out. Like I said, I agree that unless guys call each other out, we won't get very far - it's a sad fact that a lot of guys out there don't respect the opinions of women, which is why we need organisations like Men Can Stop Rape. And I think that's the key - you need to take a step back and talk about the fact that a lot of guys don't respect women. Because if they don't respect them, why would they consider their consent important? *That's* really what this is about - understanding that a woman's opinion is just as valuable as a guy's.

But I'm not talking about calling out strangers by getting into fights, no, and I am talking about calling out harassment and discriminatory language, not rape. And I am indeed talking about friends. I don't agree that friends won't call each other out. Plenty of people are friends with others who don't share all of their views. People are generally uncomfortable with disagreeing with their mates, even if their mates have completely unacceptable views. So if we can encourage people to call out their friends then yes, I do think that will make a difference. Especially with guys who don't respect women, and won't ever listen to a woman telling them about what behaviour is OK and what isn't. I'm not sure where you're getting blaming from though, apart from the sense that we as a society are to blame for not having tackled this whole problem more effectively. 

This is a big problem. Really big. Incidents like Steubenville demonstrate that the guys who actually rape probably aren't likely to ""benefit"" from a workshop like this in the sense you're thinking. But those guys only did that because they lived in a place where they knew virtually everyone would be on their side.

20140519025455,greycloud24,"or you could just spread cultural awareness that girls have different desires and what is consent for one girl is not consent for the next. let's face it, the fact that many attractive women expect men to be aggressive is what is fueling this behavior. the men wouldn't do it if it wasn't working well for them. your message needs to be aimed at women as well as men. not the victims, but the consenting ones that are not victims but are enforcing and rewarding the behavior that is creating victims. 

a lot of this speech acts as if this is a problem of men's behavior. but men don't act in some type of vacuum. they learn to do what works. they wouldn't do this type of stuff if it didn't work. a lot of women go to parties, and they get drunk because they know they can use this as an excuse to avoid the ""slut"" label. so guys learn to get women drunk and to take responsibility, because this is what the women want. this is what they respond too. other guys see these guys succeeding with women, and they start doing the same thing. but then one of them runs into a woman that doesn't go to parties, that doesn't use this strategy to avoid slut shaming by other women. and before you know it what is a working strategy with a consenting woman in one situation is rape in another situation. and nobody thinks it is rape because they personally know people where this clearly is not rape. all of the sudden the song ""blurred lines"" becomes a message of what our culture has become. what is consent for one woman, is not consent for the next. what would be rape for one woman, is not rape for the next. and then you have a culture like we have today, where people argue over what is and is not rape. both sides of the arguments on rape have strong supporters because they know that they are correct. but they both are failing to see the situation from the other side. 

perhaps you should be pushing issues on women shaming each other. this causes demand for women who enjoy sex to act as if they are not in control of a situation that they are really in control of. they want to be able to sleep with men, but they also don't want to be shamed by other women. they also don't want to be turned down by future men because of things they have done in the past. their best course of option is to lie about how much control they had over the situation. perhaps this should be addressed. it is a large part of the problem. 

perhaps the guys should be confronted over shaming each other into seeking sex. sex is good and all, but it shouldn't be how men judge each other or how women judge men. it may be good to have more public acceptance of sex toys for men. perhaps there should be a push for some attractive male who turns down women and instead chooses to wait for the right one. this male should be modeled as being successful and worthy of modeling male behavior after. 

as for rape culture, the lines should be less blurred. a very important part of that is to have degrees of consent. some violations of consent are worse than others. these differences allow room for argument over what does and does not constitute rape. holding a woman down with a gun pointed at her head is rape and has a lot less consent than getting an anxious girl a beer to allow her to overcome her anxiety and take off her dress. both lack full consent, but one obviously has less consent then the other. they should not be conflated as being equally bad, they aren't equally bad, and arguments that state they are, invalidate all of the speakers points. 

rape needs to be seen as going both ways. forced to penetrate needs to be thrown onto the rape laws. an unattractive woman who gets a guy drunk enough to have ""beer goggles"" and have sex with her is the same level of rape as a guy who gets a girl drunk knowing that she has a history of losing control and sleeping with people when drunk. both examples are predators deliberately using alcohol to remove the other person's ability to make meaningful decisions about consent. 

the idea of rape culture is failing to mention an elephant in the room. male prisoners are the epitome of rape culture. they are the ones that people literally say that they deserve it. they are the ones that people laugh at when they hear they have gotten raped. they are the ones that people say they hope these men get raped. and that these men deserved to get raped and that they caused themselves to get raped. these are the ones who are violently raped and people make jokes about it. if anything is rape culture, this is rape culture. why are these men never talked about? why do they remain invisible? what does it say about our culture that some rape victims should be protected, but not all of them? and what does that imply about how we view men and women as victims?

Well, that's a tricky one. I myself have been in love with one of my best friends without making any move at all (I was just getting used to the concept of ""friends"", I had no idea what so ever how to initiate it, much rather what it means to be in a relationship with someone. In retrospect, I also may or may not have missed a lot of hints she made that she wants more). I was fine with it and think I made a good job in not letting it get awkward. But in the end, as long as you are fine with it, I think it's the decision of the one in the ""friendzone"" .

20140519152255,Shwirtles,"My husband works for a major video game company as a lead programmer.  There are exactly two female programmers on the very large game team he works for.  He has been there for 8+ years and there have been exactly 2 resumes from female software engineers in that time.  You can't hire what isn't applying or what doesn't exist.  I think you can look around any CompSci class in college and understand that there simply AREN'T many women in the field which then translates into there not being many women in positions of power and leadership in tech positions in game companies.  

There are many women in HR at this company in positions of power and leadership, there are many women who are artists at this company, fewer who are designers of various types, but in terms of the technical side of the industry there just aren't any female applicants even at the most basic entry levels.  But that being said, a really well established games company is not necessarily looking to hire entry level people fresh out of college unless they have some pretty spectacular game experiences aside from their schooling (making their own iPad/iPhone game is a great example in that it shows commitment and follow through despite this particular company's lack of mobile games).  

I, myself, worked in Quality Assurance (game testing) at this same company for several years before having my kids.  There were not many women there at all - maybe 50 total (and that's a generous estimate) in the entire department which grew to around 300 before I left and a lot of those 50 were in specialty testing positions (such as language testing for various locales).  In terms of women I worked with there were maybe 5-10.  That job did not require anything other than a college education and an interest in video games, coupled with a willingness to work really long hours for questionably adequate pay.  Many in the department hoped to work their way into a development job in design or art and saw QA as their foot in the door - some succeeded, some not so much. 

I was married long before I started that job and I think it helped me avoid most of the issues other (single) women faced in the department, most of which boiled down to the simple fact that their co-workers were very interested in dating a girl who liked games, but were often horribly socially inept having spent all their time playing games with other dudes.  There were definitely occasions where someone crossed the line into sexual harassment, which is a pretty relaxed line in most video game company cultures - if you can scream FUUUUUUUUUUCK at your desk at the top of your lungs and your boss is RIGHT THERE and completely supports your assessment of the FUCKED UP in-game situation and the language you used to describe it, well there's just going to be a lot more you can say without anyone getting offended!  

Anyhow, I can only say that the gaming industry is still a very young industry - nearly everyone working is 45 and under with many being between 25-30 years old.  And while being 35 myself I was in the generation that saw the first Nintendo and enjoyed all the games, not many of my female friends were playing them back in the day.  Unlike my husband and his friends who were doing NOTHING BUT PLAYING GAMES for their entire childhood... and adulthood:) So if you're super passionate about games as a kid you're much more likely to think ""you know I'm going to do my best to make a career out of this"" and then actually go do it.  If more women feel that way then there will be more women in the industry.  I would simply encourage women who are interested to make sure that they understand the industry and get degrees and work experience that will set them up for the jobs they want - the same advice I'd give to anyone interested in making games.

I know there needs to be more female protagonists. One of the graphics captions shows Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite, and says that games needs stronger female leads. It's painted in the light that Elizabeth ISN'T one. This idea I find to be as far from the truth as possible. Elizabeth is argued to be an equal protagonist in the main story, and the main one in the DLC. Not only that, she is a main component in the main story, and although she needs to be saved and doesn't fight, she holds her own. We lose our sense of morality for Booker as the game continues on, and her insight and assistance becomes vital throughout the story. Most importantly, we can see and hear her emotions and she becomes a real person in a fictional world. She's the shining example that 1) You do not need to fight to be a strong protagonist in video games and 2) The main protagonist isn't always the person that you're controlling.

We don't always need things surrounding fighting and war. I love platformers and puzzle games. I'd love to see adventure games and story-driven games to overtake the Call of Duty series and bridge the sex/gender gap for girls and help dissolve the idea that gaming is for guys.",6,t3_25y2pb

Even if they are targeted, and I agree that the women shouldn't be, that doesn't mean they'd be convicted, or even prosecuted.

These women had spontaneous abortions and/or stillbirths. Their pregnancies were not viable. Women's bodies naturally abort about 2/3rds of the pregnancies they create, often because said pregnancies are not healthy.  Abortion is a natural function of a woman's body and outlawing it is ignorant and stupid. So is insisting that abortion is murder. It is the natural function of a woman's body to kick out a bad pregnancy.

You should read the articles before you comment or at least read the headline. Then read an Embryology textbook; most zygotes and embryos die a natural death before they are born, far more often than they are able to develop into a viable human life. Punishing women for when pregnancy fails is medieval and misogynistic as well as anti-science nonsense.

I can't recall ever having a deep, heart-to-heart conversation with either of my parents. They just never gave me the impression that I could come to them with my fears, hopes and dreams.

20140520020441,spinnetrouble,"When I was in 8th or 9th grade, I remember my older sister (11th or 12th grade at the time) crying about how she couldn't have the relationship she wanted with our mother.  My sister was upset that she didn't feel she could confide in her, share secrets, ask about hair, makeup, or clothing, or any of those things that typical sitcom families did.  When she said this to our mother, she was told something like, ""That's not the kind of family we are.  We don't talk to each other that way, and we do not have that relationship with one another.""

I was pretty young then, so I'm absolutely positive that there was a lot of nuance I didn't pick up on, but I remember that I got the impression that it was because my parents were ""Old World"" immigrants and we were their first-generation American children.  They had their way of doing things and I believed that they thought of Americans as being too sensitive, impractical, and straight up unrealistic about a lot of things — family relationships was just one of them.

Thinking about it now, I don't know if our mother said what she did because of the way she was raised, because she didn't want to be seen more as a friend than a parent to a 16/17-year-old (who was a really well-behaved kid that stayed out of trouble), because she wasn't prepared to find a way to blend the American sitcom family with the way she was raised, because she just wasn't interested in it, or something else entirely.  

This is definitely an interesting question.  I know my mother and my older sister have done a little traveling together and both of my parents and sister visit with each other every month or two, but I don't know what my mother and sister's relationship is actually like at this point in each of their lives.

Even though your relationship doesn't seem anywhere outside of normal to me, I think that if you're unhappy about it and can't find a way to tell your mother that without her taking it badly, you should consider talking to a family therapist.  They know about people, and they specialize in family dynamics.  Talking it over with one may help provide insight on why your mother acts the way she does, what you can try doing or saying to overcome that disconnect you feel, or how best to handle the hurt or frustration if she doesn't reciprocate.  If it truly doesn't work out with your mother fulfilling the role you'd like her to, perhaps volunteering at a nursing home or rehabilitation facility that handles the patient's transition between post-operative hospital care and release to home would be a good option.  There are plenty of older, sharp-witted folks who would love to have someone to visit and chat with.

20140520082241,FancyBiatch,"I'm 32 and have started to realize lately that I have a similar relationship with my mother. Her and I were never close when I was growing-up - I could never ask her ""lady questions"" about what was happening as I went through puberty. I could never talk to her about boys or friends, or anything personal. No matter how I brought these things up, she would somehow take it as a personal attack of some sort - so I just kept it to myself as much as I could.

I remember when I was around 12 or 13, some kids at school teasing me because I hadn't started shaving my legs. So I went home & asked my mom if I could start shaving. She started *crying* & told me that I was too young to do such a thing. So I did it in secret. We never had The Talk. We never discussed anything beyond the most trivial of things.

She's much the same with ""disagreements"" (or different opinions) as your mother. I learned a long time ago to just nod and smile, and never bother disagreeing with her opinion. If I do, she takes it incredibly personally & it just isn't worth the battle or the inevitable crying. 

This really only came to light a few months ago. I asked my SO why he's so quiet when we go visit my parents (which is only 2-3 times per year to begin with); he tends to sit off in a corner, not saying much, not engaging in conversation or anything. He replied with: ""Your parents are too formal. Your mom is nice and all, and actually your dad is hilarious and awesome, but I never feel comfortable enough to really *talk* around them. It's awkward around them. Your mom always has perfect nails, perfect hair, perfect everything - she's not like a real person that I can talk to"".

It got me thinking about my conversations with my mother. It's all: ""how are you?"", ""how's work going?"", ""how's the cat/dog doing?"". And that's pretty much it.

My father and I get along famously, we can have in-depth ""arguments"" where we fact-check each other constantly, and neither of us take it personally. We can have long drawn-out discussions about topics that both of us (or one of us) are passionate about. But I feel as though my mother is a constant presence in these discussions - if we leave her out of the conversation for too long, she'll get huffy & we have to go back to the formal chit-chat to keep her happy.

On the surface, my relationship with my mother seems to *almost* verge on something that belongs in /r/RaisedByNarcissists, but I really think she just has 0 ability to connect with other people. There are stories from my childhood that I could tell that would certainly SEEM to belong on /r/RaisedByNarcissists, but in reality I had a good childhood. I wasn't abused. My parents went without so that my brother and I could have all the things that we wanted/needed. 

I think it comes down to how *she* was raised. Her parents came to North America during WW2, and they were exceptionally authoritarian & frugal (her father hand-made ALL of the clothing for my mom + her bother & sister). My mother wasn't raised by parents who she could connect with on any personal level, and I think she just accepted that as the norm.

I see friends of mine with tween or teenage children, and admire the relationship they have & wish it was something I'd experienced at that age. And once or twice my mother has even made comments similar to that.

(I was picked on regardless, and brutally for the next year--to the point where I wanted to kill myself. I told my parents as such and my mom became *furious* with me and grounded me. I think that experience just further nailed home the fact I can't talk to her about ""feelings"").",1,t3_25yt1m

It really bothered me for a while, to the point where I brought it up again when I moved out at 21. She said the same thing, but added something rude at the end ""if you can't accept that, then I don't know what to tell you, nothing has changed.""

My mom has always been kind of harsh, and I've just learned to accept that.

Same here.

My parents aren't monsters, but they aren't the nicest people either... although they pretend to be. Because of this, I spent much of you childhood keeping out of their way. I never formed a connection or any trust or love for either of them. Our entire family participated in birthday and Christmas celebrations, however the entire thing always felt like a theatrical production.

My mother had a nasty childhood and I suspect she wanted children so she could vicariously make up for what her childhood lacked. I think my mother was able to satiate this need early in my childhood and continued to raise me because she feared being judged as a bad mother.

I haven't spoken to my parents in over a decade.

I severed communication with them for several reasons: because I'd had enough of the pretending and watching them pretend, I realized that, if I were rushed to hospital in need of major surgery, they would be the last people I would want to entertain and I would never want my parents to come anywhere near my children.

I have never missed my parents or sought advice or comfort from them, although I do occasionally wonder if they are still alive.

I have as much interest in seeing my parents again as I do with any other anonymous strangers.

These things just happen in life, so please don't feel bad.",1,t3_25yt1m
20140520061001,nocte_lupus,"I feel much the same, with both parents. (I'm 21 so I'm still pretty young) 

A lot of people I know seem to have fairly close relationships with them, but for my family it just doesn't seem to work. It feels often as if any 'family time' was more an obligation like for the most part any 'let's go out as a family' rapidly faded off when I entered my teens. Like it was beyond the obligated age for 'take the kids out so we won't bother'  

They are fairly 'old' parents compared to some people I know which is probably plays some part and I don't think either of them had particularly nurturing backgrounds like my dad is the son of two missionaries and he got pushed into boarding school young, my mum was one of six kids and I think there were some problems. 

But yes there's also been none of that 'tell you about the family' like there's a few bits here and there but no real 'family heritage' and I don't have a lot of contact with extended family,( but that might be for the best actually)

My parents were pretty good on the 'material/physical needs' side but not so much emotional, I got bullied in school a lot and also I'm dyspraxic so I could've done with the support (still could) but it didn't happen and I've honestly never had a 'heart to heart' or a 'emotional comfort' thing from them really. And I just don't feel I can go and talk to them. And so haven't got the 'life advice' source or anything of that nature.

My mum did involve me with her crafting hobbies for a little while, but that didn't last. And also my mum isn't very 'girly' so I think the 'girls go shopping/night in/night out' stuff just wouldn't happen anyway but yes we never really 'hang out' like some people I know and their mums. 

And I've tried to talk about/involve my parents in things I enjoy but it doesn't work probably because some of it is gaming related or movies or tv and they just don't want to be interested, (my dad openly goes things like 'gaming is a waste of time' or 'wasting your life playing games' etc or even if you suggest him a film he'll go 'don't have time to waste')  like they both have a fairly narrow range of what they like, and even though I know there's a few shows my mum likes that I like she just doesn't want me there to watch them with her or anything. 

And just a whole combination of other things I think has just lead to it actually being 'better' for the most part with my family if to an extent we just do our own things (but I do have a fairly good realtionship with my older brother) and don't cross paths more than needed otherwise disagreements tend to kick off (usually my dad's doing but that's a whole other either but he has a very short temper and so there's often a lot of shouting in the house a lot of it gets directed at me and is often disproportionate for the thing that caused it and insulting and it kind of is at the 'I'm not making any excuses for him now' ) 

If any 'let's sit down as a family/do something/go for a meal' stuff happens, like when my oldest brother comes home for a visit it just feels weird. (Without the 'I don't feel anything I have to say will be valued/if I try to talk about something it will generally get derailed) 

I also get the feeling my parents often just don't want me around, like they don't want me taking up space anywhere that's not my room like if I'm in the living room on my laptop chances are my mum will say 'why not go in your room/the dining room'. 

So yeah it's much the same for me.

My moms a bit of an insecure person, so conversation before could be a little awkward because I was afraid I would say something wrong.  However now I just try to keep jn my mind whenever I'm with her how great I think she is and then I just tend to be nicer to her naturally!  Like, complementing her, write her a nice email for no reason, generally open up and be genuine about those positive feelings.  She is just so surprised and genuinely pleased!  She has opened up to me on a few things I know she'd never do before.  

Our relationship is awesome, I feel like she's one of my closest friends now.  Sounds lame but it's really great!  The tension that was there from teen years is gone now since we actually communicate in a genuine manner.  Obviously like with any friend there are little disagreements but that mutual respect is always there to fall back on.

Anyway OP I think if you want to be friends with your mom you really have to start by opening up.  Tell her you think she's awesome and you want to hang out more (if not using these words).

I love her to pieces, and I have no idea what I'd do without her, but my god she has a way of driving me up the wall. I think the main problems are the generation gap between us, the very different ways we were raised, and who we are as people. 

My nan was (and still is ) a very beautiful lady. She was a glamorous department store lady, often did modelling work, and ended up marrying a fireman (my grandad). She has very precise ideas on how a lady should look, how we should carry ourselves and behave etc... which I perfectly understand. She is entitled to think those things, as that was the culture she was raised in. My mother somehow ended up the exact opposite of what my nan wanted in a daughter, and thus I became a little version of my mother. We're tomboys who wear stompy boots, swear, drink excessively, eat excessively....

So while both my mother and I love my nan, we can't be close to her like a friend. We just cannot fundamentally agree on things, so having deep conversations about our beliefs just end up with offence all around. We talk about the weather, about what we've read in the newspaper, the neighbours, and our work. We aren't friends, but we're family, and that's all that actually matters.

I have a different perspective. I really empathize with your issue, I have deep, personal experience with it.

If certain material, images real or descriptive, will reliably cause an overwhelmingly powerful reaction in you, to the point where you can't keep it together then it's truly a serious problem.

> If someone had simply said [...] maybe I could have kept it together. [...] Regardless, I would have been a little better prepared.

Unless you're just making this up for attention and sympathy, a warning is useless. I'm going to take you at your word, it's real: It's not ""oh no, my feels"", it's ""oh my god I will vomit or faint""

What are you going to do? Run away every time it comes up? Unfortunately, you can't.

> First of all, I'm 25 and a completely independent adult, and as far as I know, I have not been ""obliterated"".

The difference between children and adults is that we adults can control ourselves. If you lose control you are effectively a child. There's very little point in debating whether whatever created the problem is ""valid"" or ""justified"". All that matters is whether or not you can cope. Adults cope. Children don't. Can you look at and discuss images of sexual violence without being involuntarily rendered into a helpless child?

If not, better do something because there are too many opportunities to be exposed to those topics and images over the coming *decades* of your life.

> Is it really that outrageous that the immediate family member of a rape victim would not want to look at pictures of sexual violence while they were still in the process of coping?

Happily, I no longer have this problem. I collected videos and images of what bothered me and consumed them, in the privacy and comfort of my home, until I was completely desensitized to it. I don't need any warnings and no longer have fear. It wasn't a fun process, but definitely worth it.

Medical students suffer this all the time. Watching videos of a living human being cut open and all the blood and gore that is surgery isn't pleasant. They routinely run to the bathroom to vomit and they faint in class. No amount of logic or rationalizing can help. Such imagery triggers a physical reaction in some people.

It always is, until you're the one being silenced.

It's a lovely thought, to have an internet - a world, even - comprised of all manner of carefully cultivated communities, where ""norms"" are ""enforced"" and ""interruption"" and ""derailment"" and ""negativity"" and ""threats"" are censored and violators are banned.

Then one day, you wake up and realize that there is no intellectual public commons anymore. The marketplace of ideas is a mini-mall, and somebody owns the escalators as surely as somebody owns every store. You work at a job where you're not free to speak because of professional standards and social norms; you go out into the world where everything is owned by a private corporation that has the right to keep its spaces nice and safe and sanitized (and okay maybe just a *bit* sycophantically uncritical of the self-appointed corporate caretakers;) then you go home - or just sit down with your phone -  to participate in the online world where literally every site is attached to an owner or administrator or mod or ISP whose standards for speech are non-negotiable.

Every once in awhile you may find yourself in a situation where you're ""allowed"" to say something controversial or gross or irreverent... and then you'll remember that all of those other nice, cultivated communities to which you belong - your job, most especially - can decide that you're just not a good fit anymore because they found out about what you said at the bar on a weekend, and it really reflected quite poorly on you, which of course also reflects poorly on them if they don't take ""proper measures."" Were you at the wrong rally? Did you fail to attend one? We really prioritize employees who *embody* our corporate message, dear. So sorry. Hope you find someplace you fit in - and just as some friendly advice, you might want to consider *adapting* rather than trying to find a place that fits *you*. That seems awfully presumptuous and entitled, and nobody really wants a presumptuous and entitled employee.

It will then occur to you that your freedom of speech extends no farther than being allowed to scream whatever you want into your pillow, just as long as it's sufficiently muffled so as not to disturb the neighbors. And you'll wonder how that could be, since obviously the 1st Amendment should have been enough to ensure that free speech always had its own little zone off to the side where it could be fully and robustly exercised.",1,t3_25xv9f

I've always been the fat girl, but I've also always been the confident/talkative/try to make everyone feel awesome and having fun all the time. Making fun of yourself, or having a laugh at your expense sometimes comes with that. & after toying with online dating (which has it's success, as it does horror stories), the best thing that works is learning to get over your stigma  of ""I'm the fat girl"". For the longest time I was always so focused of ""I can't do this/say this/wear this"" even around friends, because I was so focused (not so much on my weight), but on what others thought of me BECAUSE of my weight. 

So once I tackled that hurdle, I came to the next, which was dating. Before I settled down and was looking for something not-casual, I was OkCupid fiend. Not just for the male potentials, but just to meet new people in general & that turned out great. I found so many people who had the same interests in me.  The key is being confident, and don't try to be a catfish. If you're open and upfront with everything, things work out better that way. If you're ""fat/chubby"" and like it, be proud! Loud & proud, flaunt that shit. But if you don't wanna be ""upfront & confident"" about it, just don't make an extra effort to hide it. Always be yourself. :)


Rounding up my rant, not saying that being fat/chubby is bad at all. But I've been more happier in the last year of forcing myself into a lifestyle change (working out, eating properly, being more active) than I have my entire life. I used to find myself cancelling on plans,dates, just about anything, all because of my battle with worrying what others thought of my weight. Now that I am actively working to make myself appear better to myself (as weird as that sounds), I've found that my body itself just feels so much more incredible. My confidence (which was already sky high) is now super sky high, and I just generally feel awesome all the time & am so much more willing to do things.

However, no one seemed to want to call me their girlfriend. All that sex was fun for a while but then it got to a point where I really wanted a guy to commit to me and well, I wanted a boyfriend and to be in love. I realized that my actions actually kept guys from committing, not my size. I'm not saying that guys won't date a girl that sleeps around...not at all, but because I was more open to the stereotypical ""bad boy"" and guys who typically weren't interested in a commitment I was setting myself up for failure...fulfilling a self-fulling prophecy of ""no one will date me because I'm fat"". That is when I decided to go online and check out okcupid. I liked that they had a way to tell how much in common you have with someone, how compatible you are, etc. 

Now, if you do go the online route make sure you are open and honest about who you are as a person. Don't lie about your beliefs, skills, appearance or anything else in your life. The chances of you being a ""horror story"" go way down if you're simply honest about who you are. 

However, remember that it goes both ways. You may not find yourself attracted to the person you meet. And, that is okay. You may also find that you'll have to meet many people before you meet someone you find compatible. That happened to me before I met my current SO.

Super Metroid might be the best game in the series (and one of the best games of all times.) One thing I love about that game is that (unlike a lot of games today) there's basically no hand-holding, no NPCs, and no dialogue. They kind of plop you on Planet Zebes and let you figure it out. Despite having no dialogue, it manages to tell a great story.

Fun bit of trivia: Early in Super Metroid, you go down a long vertical drop then go right into a room with a bunch of broken glass tubes. It turns out this is where you fought the final boss in the first Metroid game. So the worlds overlap. Not only that, but [Spoiler](/s ""After you defeat Mother Brain in Super Metroid, the planet is set to self destruct and you have a time limit to escape. Eventually, you blast open a new path and end up at the same vertical climb to the surface, where you get to your ship.

When I found out that this was something I loved and was good at, I started working in internships with the local symphony and opera company. I am going to grad school to get my masters in arts admin and an MBA. This is perfect for me because I can make a difference in the musical community in a different capacity. I can make use of my musical training, for knowing the art form will help me make more informed business decisions and be an effective leader of an arts organization. I'm saying all this about myself to make the point that a musical education can be beneficial even if you don't want to play for a living!

I would make the most out of being in music school while exploring your other strengths and passions, music-related or not.

You are not ready for the real world.

As a waypoint, let’s just establish one thing up front: in the real world, nobody gives a rat’s ass about your “20 page research paper”. No offense. It’s not personal. It’s also not a function of the subject matter or anything else. It’s just not relevant to anything in the real world. Seriously. I had to write a 50 page (or was it 75?) paper for the “writing requirement” for my JD. (Yes, I can hear all you people with real graduate degrees snickering.) Never, not once in the 30 years since I graduated has anybody, ever, in any context, asked me what it was about. It’s just not worth even a warm bucket of piss. Nobody cares.

So she was clearly just trying to make polite conversation. However, putting that aside, a grown, mature person would have realized that when this woman, with whom you apparently have no real connection, was trying to find a common ground upon which you two might have a conversation. Another way to put this is that she was trying to be nice and pleasant. And instead you choose to engage directly and confrontationally. That will teach her!

That’s a perfectly good way to get people to leave you alone. Maybe not such a bad thing at your shindig to celebrate your graduation. But it’s going to be a long haul in life if you choose to redress everyone you meet who commits some kind of “ism” faux paus in your presence about which you feel strongly. You need to learn to control that before you wind up old, miserable, and alone.

And this will particularly short circuit any effort you make at a career. Your lack of self-awareness and social propriety isn’t going do you any favors in the working world.

I won’t go into how the title of your post screams ageism, or how these things play out in the real world. All I know is that you aren’t ready for it.

You're right, your personal experience wouldn't fit into my paper. Because it has nothing to do with my paper. My paper was only on relationships between women, so as a man you wouldn't fit into it. Obviously. 

Further, women make up 50% of the entire human population, so the likelihood that two women would be friends is pretty damn high, which is why they appear in movies more often, much more often than male-female twins. But if you're interested in movies like that, off the top of my head you could look into She's the Man and Eurotrip, which do feature those kinds of relationships, so your assumption that 'no movie has been made about you' seems unlikely.

20140519141606,Voerendaalse,"Facing it is a major step. I had to do a similar thing in the past. To me it was amazing how the antidepressants worked for me. They do not change who you are. They do not change things that you feel strongly about. You won't become a zombie without feelings of happiness or sadness. Definitely not. 

However, for me they made it easier to think less negative thoughts and more positive thoughts. It's a bit hard to explain, but while my world was exactly the same when I was depressed and when I was on antidepressants, when I had been on the antidepressants for long enough, I could again appreciate the good parts of my world, and I could handle the less good parts with more ease. 

(Disclaimer: I had to switch from antidepressant 1 to antidepressant 2... The first one had the side effect of me always having a dry mouth, which became a real nuisance, even though it was also working). 

It made me see even more how your viewpoint influences how you feel, and how two people can look at the same reality and one will be happy or satisfied, while the other will be sad and depressed. I took them for roughly a year or so and made some necessary changes to my life during that time (being on the antidepressants gave me the energy to make those changes), so that I could also come off them again. I have been without them for three years now and I'm doing fine. 

You don't absolutely *need* to go on antidepressants, but I would discuss the option with your shrink and compare it to other possible options. Is your shrink any good, by the way? If you don't feel a connection to your shrink and you don't think anything he says is working, then perhaps switching therapists might help. ",1,t3_25yp7e

PS. This *is* a weird way of thinking, by the way. To me, if two people split up, then they are free persons again. Persons who can then start loving someone else with all of their hearts. True, they will have memories of the previous relationship. But aren't we all shaped by our past? He is shaped by his past (which includes a previous relationship) and you are shaped by yours. 

By your reasoning, if you break up with this guy and then start dating someone else, he should also see you as second-hand and ""stained"" by the previous relationship. While in reality, you would still be you, and perhaps better aware of what you want and need from a relationship and what you can offer someone else.

I don't like the same things they like. I'm not interested in celebrity gossip or excessively talking about your SO or talking for hours about what you do when you are drunk.

20140519112524,artsyina90,"Okay, first off, breathe. 

Secondly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Some women just don't seem to click with other women. Sometimes that happens to me, where I tend to have more male friends than female friends. That doesn't mean I'm manly or not womanly enough or even boring, I just prefer no drama and just simply having fun.

I have had close female friends before, and I often felt like my interests and personality could only follow them so far. After a certain point, I was just not in the same zone they were in. They wanted to constantly go clubbing, drinking, shopping, and expensive restaurants. Me on the other hand, had to live more frugaly, did not enjoy the club much, and preferred to stay away from drama and gossip. I was definitely the nerdy/dorky one, and that left me feeling like I didn't really belong. 

So it may very well be that you just haven't found the right group of girls to hang out with. I now have found a few dorky ladies to hang out with and it just clicks. The friendship to evolve naturally, don't force it. Perhaps try looking into groups around your area of people that enjoy doing things you are interested in. Check out MeetUp.com. Don't limit yourself to just your work environment. 

Lastly, please love yourself. If you are criticizing your own personality all the time it will send off a negative vibe to other people. Love everything about you, even the things that are a bit hard to love. Improve on yourself, because you want to not because you feel it will make you more popular. 

I personally think that being unique is way better than being like everyone else. :) Good luck and you're welcome to massage me any time if you need. ",3,t3_25y87u

Texted each other, hung out, drank together, posting selfies. I had never felt more left out. It was clear that I was an outcast. Even in my closest group of friends I feel like an outcast. 

I've realized that I get along best with a certain kind of person. Accepting people, less judgemental people. The girls at my work were selective with who they interactive with, the popular people. Maybe I am a bit too quirky for those kinds of people, but their are definitely others who embrace anyone who is kind in return. 

Don't feel boring. Just because they don't click with you doesn't mean there aren't others who will. They might not exist within your work place, but they are out there. Even shy people can relate to other shy people. I often try to find those shy people, because they tend to be the least judgemental and accepting. 

I've often looked at other people and saw how easily they make friends. In highschool, there were students who could make an inside joke with any teacher and make friends in any social group.

20140520025425,greycloud24,"there are some things that most men have in common. there are some things that most women have in common. there are some things that most humans have in common. and there things that everyone in the world has in common (we generally don't give much thought to these things). 

people get uptight about generalizations, saying not all men are like that, or not all women are like that. but the reality is that many things are generally true, and there are only a few rare exceptions. sometimes the exceptions are so rare that to be an exception would be to have a ""disorder"". some times the exceptions only have certain windows of time. for instance women in general want to have children. some women never want to have children, but the vast majority of women will want to have children at some point in their life. some people will cry foul if you make that generalization, but those people are just being ignorant. 

media has distorted our expectations of reality. it has done this to most people (yes there are a very rare few who have avoided this). some people hate it when a generalization that is true of most people is spoken, because it conflicts with the false story told by the media. their feelings are hurt when they hear the truth, and they experience cognitive dissonance. they want to believe that the distortion is true and that the truth is false. but they inwardly recognize the truth in themselves. they are the loudest voices saying that not all men or not all women are like that. they want to believe that other people are not like that. sometimes instead it is solipsism (which everyone has, and nobody can escape from, this is one of the truths that people like to deny). people believe that just because they are not like that, that they somehow represent a majority of people. they fail to put two in two together that people are different than them, and that a certain generalization may not hold true for them, but still holds true for the majority of the population. 

the key to getting past all of this is to go look at the studies. not the magazines, not popular culture, not an opinion article, but the scientific peer reviewed research. sensitivity is nice to be inclusive, but sometimes hard truths are hard truths. dancing around the issue doesn't help people because it allows them to live in a comfortable delusion where they refuse to make their situations better. a person might be happier if you tell them they don't have cancer when you know they do. but it doesn't do them any service to lie to them instead of telling them the harsh truth that allows them to take action to fix the real problem. 

i have made countless people angry over telling harsh truths. i have been banned off of comment boards for telling harsh truths. but the reality is that no matter how much i sound like an asshole, i am just trying to give people the power to take control of their lives. if people learn to suck it up and be honest with themselves they can do things to make their situation better. they can see the options for what they are and make real decisions with real consequences. if i don't give them the truth, than they are living life blindly. 

in the end i feel it is better to give someone a hard truth than to lie to them. lying to them allows them to stay in their bad predicament and be more comfortable with it. telling them the truth allows them to understand why they are in their predicament and what they can do to change it. people will call me a troll for this. i don't mind. the harsh truth for me is that many people would rather be comfortable in a delusion than to have a better life. it saddens me, but i strive to make the world a better place, one broken dream at a time.

So if you have a job where that might be an issue you should consider surgical. Plus it sounds like you might be worried that it won't work, which you wouldn't know for sure until you retest some weeks later.

The good thing about surgical is that it's super effective, you usually get sedation so the pain is minimal, and the outcome is known right away when you get the ultrasound afterward. It's just one day at the clinic and you can resume all normal activity the next day.

Personally, I would get the surgical termination. It's just cleaner, faster, and gives more peace of mind. But in the end it's up to you and what works with your schedule. Good luck with whatever you end up choosing!",5,t3_25ys7k

So if you go medical, know that the pain is pretty intense and can last a few hours, and it can be a little scary to see that much bloody tissue come out of you at once. Its true that medical fails at a slightly higher rate, but that usually just means that you go back the next day and re-dose (at least thats what I did), without more charges or exams or anything. You will probably want an extra day for the pill effects to wear off (cramping, etc) whereas the surgical procedure leaves you free to resume your life the next day.

The dr was very understanding and it wasn't painful at all.

20140519195620,QueanB,"I think some of it is because we, as a group, can't decide on what we want to be called. 

A lot of us (myself formerly included) hang onto ""girl"" long past our teenage years, because we don't feel like *women* yet and because youth is associated with attractiveness which is of course heavily tied to our feelings of self worth. 

Girls don't like to be called women and women don't like to be called girls. Girls are fun and cool and immature. Women have kids and boring jobs and wrinkles and life experience. 

""Lady"" has connotations that not all of us embrace. It implies a certain set of behaviors. 

""Femme"" sounds, well... girly. 

And of course any term can be construed to be excluding genderqueer folks. 

It's the same with titles. Men are always Mister/Mr., regardless of age or marital status. A woman can be Miss, Ms., Ma'am, Mrs... and god help you if you use the wrong one. 

So guys think they are playing it safe by calling us ""females,"" but it really comes across as if we're another species. ""Female"" and ""male"" are best used as adjectives. Used as nouns, they will always sound clinical and awkward.

If we had a female equivalent to ""guys,"" a casual catchall term carrying no implications of age, maturity, or behavior, I think the widespread use of ""female"" as a noun would cease.",605,t3_25zk6q

20140519232402,rainfaint,"That was pitch perfect.

In the same way it can be confusing to know which terms to use when referring to a person belonging to a specific ethnic group, sexual identity, or ability status, it can be confusing to know which terms to use when referring to gender groups. 

Often, I genuinely want to engage in a neutral, inclusive, fair, and friendly discourse, but it feels as if the only words/expressions available all have potential to offend *somebody*. 

I'm just conjecturing here, but I think there is a possibility that when men refer to women as ""females"", they may simply be trying to have a conversation without stepping into some sort of linguistic faux pas that may be used by their critics to invalidate the entirety of their intended message. 

>If we had a female equivalent to ""guys,"" a casual catchall term carrying no implications of age, maturity, or behavior, I think the widespread use of ""female"" as a noun would cease.

""Girl"" **can be** infantilizing, and ""female"" is dehumanizing (unless it's used as an adjective, i.e., female scientist, female race car driver, female politician). 

Edit:

Because I'm getting multiple comments saying the same thing, let me clarify. ""Female"" used as an adjective is only non-offensive if you **need** to use it. Saying ""oh she's a *female* doctor"" is offensive, while, ""I need a female doctor,"" means the adjective is necessary. 

Also ""young woman"" can be used if someone is talking down to you (""young woman, just what do you think you're doing?"") but can easily be used in a non-offensive way (""you're a beautiful, strong young woman."")

My over-70 mom will still say ""female doctor"" instead of just ""doctor"" ... she's still stuck in this world where it's so NOVEL that a *woman* is a doctor that she has to call it out that way rather than just say, ""I saw my doctor and *she* told me ... blah blah blah."" Obviously, a woman who is a doctor is called a ""doctor,"" not a ""female doctor."" I smile and remind my mom of these things. I can't help myself.  

When you modify an occupation with a gender, it's confirming that the default is still male. And I don't believe we should assume that anymore, or use language that makes that assumption.

20140520091104,wandering_wizard,"Hey! I work at a shop that often deals with hair removal. There's a couple of ways you can fix your issue with longer benefits and no razor burn that shaving often has. I'll make a handy list

Epilation: cost $. Time between hair regrowth 2-3 weeks. Pain scale 3/5. Basically ask a local beauty parlor or department store for their epilator selection and they should be happy to provide. These are like motorized tweezers which pluck out the hairs at a very fast pace from the root, allowing for a greater time between regrowth. While usually there aren't many issues with ingrown hairs and no razor burn, while you are performing the epilation, it is going to sting a bit. However since you don't need to do it very often I think it offsets the pain.

Waxing: cost $$. Time between regrowth 2-3 weeks. Pain scale 3/5. Waxing is a good option, and you can either do it at a local beauty parlor. (While they do not display prices for chest hair, I'm sure something can be arranged) however if you feel uncomfortable, you can get home kits as well. Same kind of pain as the epilation so it is effectively the same thing, yanking the hairs out from the route. 

IPL system. Cost $$$$. Time between regrowth 6months to 1 year. Pain: 1/5. IPL may be an excellent option for you, uses light to tell your hairs to stop growing. It takes a few sessions to get going, and you shave in the meantimes but if you want some more perminant results, this is the way to go. However does have some drawbacks. You can either go for beauty parlor or home system, but both are pretty pricy options. Phillips Lumea is a good home system, but I'm not sure what prices are avalible to you (varies depending on region) so research is definately needed. 

Also: if you are black, red headed, pregnant or breast feeding or diabetic don't use this system. 

No!No: cost $$$. Time between regrowth: 4-9 months. Pain scale: 1/5. uses heat to do effectively the same thing as the IPL stuff, but doesn't have all those conditions on it. Also you don't have to shave to use it. 

Veet: cost $. Time between regrowth 2-3 weeks. Pain 0/5. It's like this cream stuff you can get from the supermarket. You put it on for 10 ish minutes then remove it and all the hairs. It good, but not if you have sensitive skin. ",1,t3_2603sv

You should schedule a follow-up appointment about a month later to make sure it's in the right place and for some trimming of the strings now that they've settled.

Scary things to see the doc about immediately: pain not controlled with OTC meds, sudden severe bright-red blood (more than a pad an hour), suddenly spiking a high fever (over 101F/38.3C) without other causes.

She came to visit a few weeks later. And we talked about every aspect of her wedding, except bridesmaids. It was the elephant in the room. But I wasn't comfortable bringing it up.

Oh. You and the bridesmaids. It was like a slap in the face. 

I thought it was telling that during the wedding shower, I was the one who got all of the quiz questions right about her life because I've known her the longest and was there for every event.

I thought it was shitty that she didn't ask me to do *anything* involved with the wedding. I am a vocalist, I'dve been happy to sing something. Or even hand out programs. Hell, I was passing out duties like crazy for my wedding so no one would feel left out.

Try not to get too upset even though I know it sucks.

20140520112250,Digitalis2512,"I'm pretty much in the same boat; although I haven't made much progress here are some nuggets of pseudowisdom for you:

1. Don't overestimate or underestimate what you expect to get from someone. Don't push yourself to feel something for someone; if you don't, then you don't. At the same time, don't just sit back and expect to be swept off your feet; put in your fair share of work.

2. Don't overthink or overstress the problem. Personally, I have always been a bit quick to nail problems about myself down as aromantic or asexual or whatever, when in reality it's most likely something simpler (although I don't mean to belittle those things). Make a consistent effort instead of trying to categorise your problems in order to put them down as beyond your control or not your fault.

Personally, my approach is just to focus on the people you do know instead of stressing over the ones you want to (or want to want to). So long as you can be happy with the way you interact with people, then relationships will happen by themselves. But hey I could be wrong :s",3,t3_260tuh

I see, I think that may have been why the online dating approach didn't quite work. Since on that people tend to want to escalate things quickly when at that point I'm more like 'Well, I'd like to get to know the person first actually'

online dating really goes as fast as you want.  If your wanting the get to know you phase spend more time talking to them on the phone, even if after the first few dates.  Or choose date locations where it doesn't move past your comfort level, don't go to their house for dinner or movies if your not ready for where that could lead. 

And lastly there is no such thing as the one, everyone person you will meet has flaws, you just have to determine what you feel to be a flaw you can live with and the ones you feel are more than you can handle.

There is nothing wrong with you - human sexuality is a giant spectrum and encompasses a million different orientations - and you are DEFINITELY not the only one who could have written what you've written here.

It's a side effect of existing in an age that actively discusses and encourages sexuality - the Victorians would have understood and accepted the introverted spinster but not the boy-crazy 16-year-old. So long as no harm is caused, nobody should be made to feel ashamed about acting according to their unique wiring. Just keep being you and keep all possibilities open. You might find that the wiring has changed one day, and want to revise your life path based on those new impulses. Then again, you might not. 

Oh, and pro tip from someone who's Been There, since you specifically noted that social interaction is an area with which you struggle: Start reading advice columns, as many as you can find. Google for them, find somebody whose advice speaks to you, and then go through years of archives and read 'em all over the course of the next few months. (A few starter recommendations: Carolyn Hax, Dear Sugar, Captain Awkward, and of course, classic Dear Abby and Ann Landers). Those did more than anything else to help me master the basics of social interaction that I just wasn't grasping - they'll teach you the basics of making conversation, what to say to people in certain circumstances, and WHY people say the things they say. Advice columns, when taken in bulk, are like finding the cheat codes to navigating your way through small talk and Serious Discussions. Some of the individual columns get a situation horribly wrong, but in time, you'll see the ""correct"" patterns develop and recognize them in your daily life.",1,t3_260tuh

One time I picked her brain about former crushes and nothing came up. I asked her why she didn't date and she said she was busy with other priorities. It wasn't important.

She was very shy and hard to read on the first few dates and then she proved to be one of the most caring, ambitious and mindful women that I've ever met. She was far from shy, it turned out, which was almost a teeny disappointment because of my own experience with shyness but it was also hugely awesome, too. 

Our love was very sincere and adventurous and romantic. 

It took almost two months to find our sexual synchronicity but... Goodness, once we did... One thing about our breakup is that I no longer have days where I lost sleep both in the evening and in that same morning due to sheet tangling activities.

It meant a lot to me that I could help her discover a new side to her self and I was careful to follow Dan Savage's Campground Rule.

Which is all to say, OP, who knows? Asexual? Gay? Bi? Pansexual? Romantic/aromantic? I don't think you'll know until you know. So long as you're gentle with yourself and gently poke at your boundaries, you may very well figure this thing out. 

I think it helped that my ex had a good girlfriend who gave her advice and pep talks about upping the ante with me. I was also a late bloomer so I was really eager to pay forward my experience and knew to take things at her pace.

I'm proud of my ex for having the courage to up the ante with me on her schedule. It was very sweet when she told me on her own time that she was still a virgin. I can't remember my reply but I imagine it was a smile and a knowing nod and a ""thank you for sharing that with me.""

For what it's worth, we broke up amicably because our five year plans were not in sync. That was a bittersweet realization but it is nice to think that our relationship may have been the inspiration for her to have clarity about what she really wanted, which was marriage and motherhood.

Though this seems paradoxical, I think this happens often. One way to work your way up in that kind of environment is to go out of your way to disassociate yourself from other women and typical ""female qualities"". You succeed *in spite* of the fact that you're a woman by doing as much as possible to get people to forget that you are one.  That involves internalizing a lot of stereotypes about women being inferior. You work within the sexist system to make it work for you, rather than working outside the system or trying to change it. It's a dog eat dog world---and the first dogs you eat are the ones as weak or weaker than you, if that makes sense. So eventually, you gain/maintain power by holding back people who are in the shoes you were previously in. On some level you might sympathize with them, but when there was no one to help you get where you are, you might feel like other women need to struggle the same way and prove themselves like you did. You see it as a rite of passage. 

I've seen a similar thing happen with racial minorities. A black man who makes his way up in a white-dominated field will sometimes do so by embodying sort of an ""exceptional black man"" status. People around him keep their stereotypes of blacks generally not being fit for the job, seeing him as an exception. Meanwhile, he somewhat resents or looks down upon other blacks who fail to be exceptional and instead confirm the stereotypes. He blames them for the stereotypes rather than blaming the system. In other words, he feels that it's up to other blacks to prove the stereotypes wrong rather than expecting white people to let go of the stereotypes. 

When Obama became president, for example, a lot of people argued that it marked a new age and some people went as far as to say it signaled the end of racism. The idea is that since blacks have the same rights as whites, they have the same opportunities, and if they just try hard enough, they can succeed on the level of whites. People who think America doesn't have racial inequality love to point to examples of blacks who have been exceptions to any sort of trend in inequality. 

Sorry to go on a tangent. In any case, my point is that I think a lot of women have internalized sexist views, and this obviously holds us back a lot as a gender.  I would argue that women who are in positions of power often get there by internalizing sexism and, even though they are in a position to change people's attitudes, they instead reinforce them. They end up being upheld as examples of how nothing needs to change about the system. ",7,t3_260jt4

A note on this as a male with a mother: I think alot of mothers have this concern for their sons, and it doesn't necessarily mean she thinks he is weak willed. Just as fathers fear their daughters being taken advantage of because ""we know how men think"" so do mothers think critically of the women their sons date due to their perspective.

The analogy extends to other areas. For example a banker may always be giving unsolicited financial advice to family members or a mechanic may nag his friends about car maintenance habits. Someone with expertise, real or perceived, on a matter will tend to be more critical about it.

But being an expat myself (not from India, but still an expat), I can see how the comments of people from other countries regarding our home country could sound arrogant.  I can totally relate.  However:

What troubles me is that most of the time the rant does sound like an excuse, like a ""don't talk about my problem when you too also have problems"" but the fact is that stating a problem doesn't mean to say that other problems don't exist.  The rape in Delhi was a shock, but people who followed the treatment of women in India knew that it was nothing new.  And it is endemic, it is huge.  It is not intellectually honest to compare the US numbers with Indian numbers in any way, shape or form.   Especially now when marital rape, even forcible ones, cannot be classified as rape.  Especially when child marriage is still there, and especially when the Indian family structure and dynamics  do not allow for women to get out of abusive situations.  

I don't think the US is great in anyway,  to either resolve rape cases or prevent them, but I do think it is better than India, and quite frankly, I am tired of being called racist and ignorant every time I say this or anything else about India, accurate as my facts will be, I am still called that.  Not by you, OP, in other discussions I had before.  That totally sounds to me like excusing India's treatment of women.  And seeing a problem in a country and pointing it out is not racism.

I think the greatest concern now is the election of Modi, who is nationalist and has been called a Hindu extremist because this huge swerve to the right screams that minorities (women included) will probably suffer.  Globalization makes it as such that all eyes are now in all countries, and this election really worries some people, not only in the West, but in India as well.

Stop taking out of your ass. He hasn't been called a Hindu extremist by anyone. He refers to himself as a hindu nationalist. If you read his campaign coverage, youll see that he ran on a plank of economic development, and not faith based nationalism, as opposed to anti-immigrant campaign  policies or bible thumping religious panderers in America.

But firstly I'd like to make it clear that I feel that India does have legitimate problems with women's rights and gender equality issues. The way I see it, India is currently in the midst of a massive turmoil which is bringing the spotlight on all the social issues that is currently holding them back in their path towards progress. But I'm sure that the Indians will face the problem head on and come up with constructive solutions, and when the dust settles they will emerge as a better and stronger nation.

Having said that I do see a lot of latent racism being directed towards India whenever there are posts highlighting the issues in India, especially on /r/worldnews. There is always a constructive way of highlighting the problem and suggesting solutions, the way that is followed in SRS related subs for example. And then you have derogatory, degrading and slanderous manner followed elsewhere that frankly reeks of neo colonialism and the white man's burden mentality. No one is stopping anyone from presenting the views and opinions in a constructive manner, but I don't see any point in gross generalization of a 1.2 billion strong nation in a tirade laced with thinly veiled racism and projecting the whole country as some barbaric backwaters deserving of unbridled scorn. Most of the people who engage is such discourse seem to take it for granted the immense efforts and struggles of the millions that came before us during the suffrage movement, civil rights movement and feminist movements. It is easy to deem a civilization as barbaric while it is engaging in its own reform movements, while we reap the benefits of the fights that were won by others who came before us.

Long story short, my mother had me when she was 16, just turned 17. She was not ready at all. Basically my biological father was never in the picture, merely just what we call a sperm donor...

Anyway, to keep it simple, if I had been in her shoes having grown up like I did, I would never have kept me. I would have much preferred her to have an abortion. She wasn't ready for a baby; mentally, financially, none of that. I grew up in unstable conditions, without a father, with someone who still needed to grow up themselves.

A friend once asked me about it all, asking me if I ever ended up pregnant with a baby would I keep it or have an abortion? Frankly, I do whatever I can to limit the potential of it even ever being an option I'm faced with, but my answer was simply, yes, I'd have an abortion. I need to be ready. I personally feel like its almost selfish to bring a baby into this world when you aren't ready for it. I'm glad I'm here, yes, but if I were able to go back in time, from a third party perspective knowing how life turns out, I would tell her to not have a baby. She should not have kept me! I think my religious grandparents had some influence into her decision to keep me as well, though I have never outright asked.

Anyway, that's just my opinion but I feel like it gives a bit of perspective. If I didn't have the inherent traits and personality I have, I'd most likely be a meth-addict crackwhore living on the streets given my living situations and childhood. My mother did the best she could, but she was not ready. She suffers to this day with mental, physical and emotional problems. I don't think it stems from her having me, but I think it plays a part in her lack of 'growing up'. Put simply, I was more mature and wise than her at the age of 13. I could make better decisions and choices. She should NOT have had me.

All this said, there are always different circumstances. Whatever YOU decide to do, you have my full support. I really think that nobody should be shamed into making such a heavy decision because really, all it hurts in the end is another human being, not you and your beliefs. **Don't let anyone persuade you to make such a heavy choice, because in the end you are the one that has to deal with it.**",279,t3_261i1l

If I was guaranteed a loving happy, stable family that were ready to have kids, then I would be fine with her keeping me and putting me up for adoption, no doubt.

I'm not upset at being brought into this world by someone her age, it was HER raising me, the circumstances, the upbringing and the lifestyle I've had to lead as a result has been extremely tough from her poor decisions and inability to properly take care of a child. I turned out extremely well and level-headed despite everything I have had to go through.

My mother has admitted that she knew before having me that she could never put up a child for adoption. She is way too easily attached and could never handle giving up a child that grew inside her and she bore.

I remember being 13 and all of a sudden getting constant male attention. Not just being stared at/watched, but whistles/cat calls/comments. Usually from guys much, much older. It freaked me out. Walks home from school were the worst, and I seriously resented a skirt being part of my uniform. I became very withdrawn, and would walk everywhere really quickly, with my head down.

Truth is, it does not feel safe to be a girl, and you will always get unwanted attention. Sometimes, sure, it's just guys being guys. But a lot of the time, - like when you're 13, - it's creeps being creepy. The two most important things to realise are, (1) it's not on you. It is never on you. You are not being/doing/wearing ANYTHING to invite or validate this attention. People who say otherwise are jerky jerkfaces. They're a large part of the reason that it is very, very difficult to internalise this, but it's so important. Never believe that you in any way deserve other people behaving towards you in ways that make you feel uncomfortable, or scared, or disrespected. Their behaviour is not on you. (2) you don't need a guy to protect or defend you. I remember in my first relationship, in my late teens, men would shout things at me in the street, and no matter how I myself reacted (which would be either ignoring them or glaring at them), I would be upset with my boyfriend for not saying anything. I myself am part of this horrible system when I feel more comfortable/safer being on nights out/in public when I'm with a guy,  and like it would be great for another guy to call Creep Guy out on his objectifying, misogynistic comments, but I can't. I'm still figuring this one out for myself. If someone actually puts their hands on me, I will verbally bite their heads off, but outside that I need to be seriously pushed before I'll say a word. It is probably safer, and certainly less hassle, to just ignore them. But it leaves a really, really bad feeling to not stand up for yourself, like you're being somewhat complicit.

So I really don't know what to say. Stuff like this weighs on my soul. It should not be the place of a 13-year-old girl to be telling people to stop looking at her as a sex object. How horrible is the world that they DO. I kind of give up on society, at this point.",43,t3_2627h9

That can help open a dialogue, so that if something is going on, she can tell you about it, and if it's just the normal growing up stuff that, sadly, most girls go through, it can open a pathway for you to talk about consent and how she has value that isn't dependent on her body.

Firstly I highly, **highly** recommend you get her a rape alarm. That's the most basic of things. If pepper spray is legal where you live then I also recommend that. If it's not legal then a body spray (not perfume) can also have a similar affect or at least buy her time.

I grew up in a military family with a retired infantry father who taught me bits and pieces of self defense since I was 8 and for my 13th birthday I got a tazer, pepper spray and a kubotan. At 13, I fully understood that these were not toys and these weren't things to take out and show my friends or things to take at all unless I felt like I was in danger. I realize that this girl is raised different, but I do think that after she takes a self defense class and taught some serious defense lessons that she should be able to carry pepper spray, obviously you're gonna have to make sure that she knows to NEVER take these things to school. One thing I've learned from my father is to always use the buddy system when possible. Please teach her that, even if it is another 13 year old friend. I think after suitable training and education that she should carry pepper spray, yes you can hurt  people with it, but there's not much risk for seriously hurting or killing someone with it.

The men and boys who are making her uncomfortable by staring at her are the ones who should feel ashamed of themselves. However, I know that I, personally, felt(feel) somewhat violated by the attention anyway. This was partially because girls are frequently 'warned' that boys ""have dirty minds,"" ""are only after one thing,"" etc. We're told that we should expect to be characters in exceedingly life-like sexual fantasies, essentially that the straight males around us will strip us down and make us the stars of pornographic movies without our knowledge or consent. What has helped me deal with the feelings of discomfort and violation this induces is remembering that the stuff which goes on in other people's minds is a far cry from reality. Sexual fantasies are as different from real pornographic movies (that actors hopefully *consent* to be in) as daydreams are from regular movies.

Similarly, I will remind you for the future to try to tone down your own impulse to check out younger women when you're around your niece. My Dad and I both liked to watch *Smallville* when I was 15-16. Unfortunately, he tended to ogle [Kristin Kreuk](http://look-like-an-angel.blogspot.com/2013/12/kristin-kreuk-smallville-promo-2001.html) whenever she appeared on screen. I was about the same age as she was, and witnessing my own father figure lust after a person so similar to myself made me very uncomfortable.

EDIT 3: I was understandably down-voted for an earlier version of this comment. For reference, here's what the 1st paragraph had said:
> Try to teach her that sexual fantasies are not so different from other types of harmless fantasies or daydreams. Most likely, there are a lot of people in her life who think it's their duty to warn her that boys ""have dirty minds,"" ""are only after one thing,"" etc. These people are also telling her that any time she steps outside, men and boys will (mentally) strip her down and make her the star of their pornos without her consent.

Yes teenagers have less impulse control, but it doesn't mean they have none, and regardless this should never be the burden for a young girl in any case.

You may think /u/starfuzion is being too extreme in their example, but that's just more of the ""boys will be boys"" logic at work at a much more ramped up level.

When that article came out a few weeks ago about the 14 year old who was raped and her rapist pled guilty and only got 45 days in jail because she ""wasn't the victim she claimed to be"" I actually started to question if *I* was the victim I claimed to be (kind of subconsciously) and I started having nightmares about my rape except that I wanted it :( it's been really traumatic for me these past few weeks since I read that article.

It's such a shitty thing to have to go over. But she thinks it'll help with the nightmares because my brain will stop questioning what happened to me.

Part of what is at issue in discussions is whether responses are constructive. Even poorly made responses can nevertheless contain something that aids discussion, solicits a further response that clarifies an issue or illuminates a truth.

You can't aim at a constructive discussion and rule out potentially fallacies replies ahead of time. The best thing is to point out fallacies as they are made.

On your specific example:

So, while I think that people who feel disgusted at seeing X in public are sad (I start feeling sad), there is no instant billborad in my head that says THEY ARE WRONG or THEY ARE BAD.  No, instead I feel sad, and, if they make their disgust really known, I feel irritated.  My feeling irritated does not make something else wrong - I need more than my feelings to make such a judgment.

To prevent the injust actions that flow from those feelings or prevent those feelings from distressing those that would feel them.

Taking the examples in turn.

> ""I am disgusted by those homosexuals kissing in public"".

Could well be based on the belief that homosexuality is wrong, perhaps for example in turn based on false beliefs about a God. It could be based, as part of this paradigm, of a fear of latent homosexual desires in themselves. 

It would be better to remove homophobia, something TwoX doesn't like (as stated in the sidebar), be having a person not feel homophobic rather than merely suppressins their homophobic expressions or actions.

> ""I just feel that a women's natural place is in the home, that's why I'm a house wife"".

In this case we could point out the her ""feeling"", as she calls it, could just be based in an internalised traditional sexism. A feeling that if she drops (through a consideration of the large body of reflection coming from second wave feminism), she will be able to free herself to choose her own life. Her current first order choices (being a housewife) are being imprudently constrained by her second order (perhaps unconscious) choices (beliefs about god-given sexist natural orders).

> ""I recoiled in fright at the spider"" but then I realises the shadow was not a spider.

Here a person can recognize that their feeling, fear, was based on the mistaken belief that there was a spider around. The feeling was wrong, in this example, in that the judgements about the world which gave rise to the feeling, were wrong.

> ""I feel like I'm too fat"" and goes onto develop Bulimia nervosa.

If a women who is uncontroversially of healthy body weight goes onto develop a serious psychopathology, vomiting up food and reducing her weight to dangerously low levels, on the basis that she ""feels too fat"" then usual solution is to try to convince her that her feeling is mistake (then fix is not just to tell her she is not too fat but to convince of it through an assisted process).

> ""He made me feel worthless by constantly criticising my every act"".

In this example, a spouse let's imagine, either takes unsound criticism from their partner or sound criticism as entailing that they are worthless individuals. This feeling of worthlessness can not only wrong but debilitating for the person feeling it. They could have a better life if they didn't feel this way.

>  You're not using the word ""valid"" in a way that's familiar to me, so you're using it in your own way

The fact that the spider was really a shadow doesn't make the fear wrong. What was wrong was the perception. More accurately, what was wrong was the mental habits that led to the perception (making assumptions, not double checking, not turning on the light, etc.).

You can't argue about other people's feelings (and in real life, everyone who does this is immediately on my real life ignore list.)  

I'd be very curious, rather than you citing silly things about validity in regard to feelings, how you deal with the fact that some people don't like you.  How do you deal with feelings in general?  Do you often find yourself arguing with others about their feelings?  How is that working for you?

A good rule might be that advice/dissent/opinions can be offered in a tagged post only if 1. the OP asks and 2. It is something helpful and appropriate that a reasonable person might say to someone they cared about who was going through the same thing. For example, a post about rape where the OP does not want to report. Someone respectfully explaining the positives that could come from reporting, while not attacking her decision not to, would be an example of constructive advice. Someone telling the OP that they think rape victims are obligated to report their rape to prevent it from happening to others, is a comment better suited to a debate thread because it attacks her choices. The need for this tag has not arisen out of 2Xers dislike of open discussion or inability to handle differing opinions but rather that nobody likes to be attacked, insulted, or pointlessly debated with when they are trying to work through an issue.

If they're upset that they have to stop and explain things to a someone, a tag like [no teaching] could let people know that we only want a discussion of the topic at hand in this post. If you have a question about something the OP said, ask it elsewhere. For example, if someone was trying to figure out what to do about their transphobic neighbor, and they were getting replies like ""what is trans anyway?"" or ""why not just dress like a girl so they stop?""

If they're upset that someone is invalidating their opinion, then like someone else mentioned, that seems like it goes against the rules anyway. I've seen lots of posts where someone asks a questions like ""my boyfriend said this, am I right to be mad?""

Removing us from the defaults would slow down growth, but not stop it, so these are problems we have to solve regardless.**
 
That said, our opinion that having a publicly visible women's space is important for the reddit community and women at large.  We are willing to make ourselves that space *provided that we can maintain the standards of a supportive and welcoming space long-term*.  To this end, we're taking in community concerns regarding troll and derailing activity, participation, gender-positive discourse, creepy PMs, voting patterns, etc.  We're keeping tabs on all those things as the subreddit returns to a new baseline, in order to determine what the long-term effects will be. We're watching various kinds of traffic, essentially.

As all of these things normalize, a much clearer picture emerges of what we can expect as a default subreddit going forward. Is the faster growth and higher visibility of the userbase generating more trolling and filth than we can keep up with? If the numbers that we had seen the first day had held steady much longer than it did, the answer would be ""definitely, get us out of here"". 

As it is, we're not sure yet.  Many things have gone back down to manageable levels, but some have not.  Random in-thread profanity trolling and the like is back down to workable levels.  Some things (like hopefully negative comments in support threads) we can address with a more targeted moderation strategy and more mods.  Others, like nasty PMs, have seen a secondary spike recently because of frontpage attention, and we're working on strategies to deal with them.  Some things, like in-thread derailment, are a deeper, harder to root out problem.  We don't have a line in the sand, but we are having constant discussions about whether we can deal with these effects, and our opinions are mixed.

My problem is that I'm not seeing this. The mods might actually feel that way, but it isn't transparent at all. I think a lot of people feel like their safe-space was hijacked without ever having had their opinion asked. I was under the impression that this was a community of people working together. What I feel it actually is now is a group of people making decisions without ever consulting the community. It was never put to the community to discuss whether or not default status was a good idea. I have yet to see a poll that would gauge how subscribers to the subreddit actually feel. Instead we're being told what to do. 

I don't think there's any amount of policing by the mods that will help this situation. This is no longer a safe space for many, many readers. At the very least, a poll of the community should have been done BEFORE default status was put in place. As it stands now, there is no way to take that poll because of the influx of new readers. Honestly, I'm just incredibly, incredibly disappointed in the way this was handled.

EDIT: Wanted to add that some of the anger and frustration that people are expressing about the switch to default comes from a sense of betrayal. And we've gotten no apology, no admittance that this wasn't handled well, no attempt to backtrack to non-default status(at least not that I've seen.)

But at least in my experience, it seems to me that women are less likely to do things that are difficult or have a high chance of failure than men. And I think a big part of it is when we have people who go, ""Oh well, that's very difficult.""

I think this is probably one of the few places where guy's education is right in that guys are allowed to fail. But I don't think we allow as much freedom for women. STEM in general can be really fucking hard. And this reputation I feel as though keeps many women from applying into the field. Moreover, I also feel as though men are much more willing to put up with constant failure while women are much more willing to, ""cut their losses,"" so to speak. It's strange because I've met women who are much, much, better students than me. But many of them flat out quit for fear of failure. 

I don't believe it is as simple as a confidence issue. There are nuances that make this complicated. Confidence I feel can be translated as, ""Oh this is easy I can do it."" Easy reward. But with a lot of other things, confidence also needs to translate as, ""I can finish this if I don't back down.""

There are a number of ways of going about this. Morey may not mind helping Glenda with something (assuming it's in his bailiwick). So whenever possible, try to share the help.

20140520133337,scubsurf,"I found this post through the defaults when I wasn't logged in, and I'm a guy, so you may want to take this information through whatever lens of influence the disparities between genders might lead to, but I've actually dealt with something very similar to this. 

I've been working at a college for about 3 or 4 years now, and I've worked in two different departments. 

I love the department I work in now. I enjoy my work, and I like all of my colleagues, subordinates, and bosses, and I'm in a position where I regularly receive opportunities to show what I'm capable of. 

The department I was hired into, however... well, it had some issues. 

What I've noticed to be fairly consistent between the two is that offices tend to be very insular. You won't really be fully incorporated into the office until you're no longer ""the new guy."" I don't know why this is, but it just seems to be the way it works. Offices with higher turnover tend to be more flexible, able to more readily adjust to newcomers, while offices with lower rates of turnover seem to be especially difficult for newcomers to transition into, to the point of being downright toxic.

My first department hired on a largely short-term basis, but it hired in waves due to grad students coming and going. This lead to a dynamic where varying ""waves"" of hirees formed cliques where the longer you'd been around, the more social status you had. 

I really can't stress how toxic the environment there was. It was ridiculous. Everything you'd described, I experienced personally, and I watched happen to others. Once I had some seniority there, I mostly just kept to myself because I didn't want to be involved in the nonsense there, but everything came to a head when one especially disgruntled employee wrote a 50-page letter full of complaints to HR. 

I had about 3 or 4 pages dedicated to my incompetence, unprofessionalism, inappropriate behavior, etc. The head of the department had about 10, and everyone else was sprinkled throughout. As best as I was able to figure out, the main clique of girls there had collaborated so that, as two of them left for other jobs, they worked with two others to set this whole thing up, thinking that they could clear out a number of positions in the department so that those who remained could move into the newly vacated positions. 

The irony is that, by including such a pedantic level of detail, they inadvertently also included their own incriminations, and rather blatantly were the only people not to be directly criticized in the letter. 

HR followed up on it but nothing was done, and eventually the remaining disgruntled employees left to other opportunities. 

I can go into detail about exactly what I was accused of, if you're curious, but it doesn't really matter; it was all generally very petty. 

What it comes down to is that in some work environments, you end up with people who are childish and petty for no reason outside of their own displeasure with either their work situation, or outside factors. The girl who was the main force behind the 50-page letter was a failed actress who kept telling everyone how much better educated than all of us she was, and how she should have a much better job with much better pay. Another was a failed model, who blamed her ex-husband for ruining her modeling career. Another girl didn't seem to have any particular problems with her own life, but having become close friends with the failed actress, she followed along with whatever the failed actress dictated.

The three of them meddled in any minor squabble and conflict that arose. They would feign friendliness with people only to extract information that could later be used to damage the person's reputation, or to create conflicts between others, or to potentially get them in trouble with their superiors. 

There may be better ways to deal with it, but there were only two solutions that I found. 

* Do not engage them. You know the saying ""keep your friends close and your enemies closer?"" Well, that. Sort of. Keep an eye on these people, but be aware that they are not your friends. Be polite and professional, and friendly to whatever extent you feel comfortable, but they do not need to know *anything* about you outside of what you do, have done, or will do at work. That's it. Listen to them when they talk and keep track of things, sooner or later they may well slip up and reveal something that might provide some hefty leverage for you if you should need it, but the best course of action is to mind your own business, keep them out of yours, and do your job as best as you can. Engaging them will only weaken your position, and fuel them in their efforts.

* Get out. Yeah, it sucks, it's pretty much the worst option, but if they don't leave any time soon, you'll be better off getting into a healthier work environment. I'm *not* saying ""abandon ship,"" mind you. I'm saying that you should put in your time there, earn yourself some resume fodder, and start doing favors for important people and see what you hear on the grapevine. Sooner or later an opportunity will open up and when it does move on.

The problem began when it started to effect our work. A
Rep would come in for product knowledge meetings. We needed these meeting to go over pricing issues, claims, etc. These were generally older guys that loved Jen and the her flirty ways. Fine, but we had pending issues to discuss. When I (or another woman) would interrupt them chatting about whatever club she went to and say "" Ok, Mr. G I really need to discuss these price lists with you..."" I would get an eye roll from the Rep and hear some comment like ""ok killjoy"". 
One day she was rushing to finish a job when a male co worker asked her what she was up to. She said "" Trying to get this done. I was given a deadline"" he said to her ""Oh don't worry about the deadline. The old hens are just ruffled over the new chick"". Whaaat? We had work that was due and couldn't be completed until hers was finished. It had NOTHING to do with jealousy at all. Months of this, day after day, naturally led to resentment. She ended up quitting because she didn't ""fit in"". Said we all visited but got mad when she did. The difference was we finished our work and didn't make other wait on us. Every outside person was convinced we were jealous and pushed out the pretty young girl. The fact was the pretty young girl had much maturing to do and wasn't ready for that environment.

This former boss worked on the completely opposite side of the building, never interacted with this girl's department at any point of the day, and vice versa.  I couldn't figure it out.  She started saying the same shit about my boss's right hand, also a woman.  She's loud and funny, and speaks her mind.  The insecure one harps on this woman, too.  Again, they don't work anywhere near each other.  I've seen friendships fall out over petty shit like this, all from working in the general vicinity of people in an office.  You cannot accurately base the intricacies of true friendship on the phenomenon manifested in office relationships and the gossip that spawns from them.  It's so mind-shattering to a regular dude who keeps to himself, i.e. myself.  Just put out positivity and efficiency in your workday.  If people refuse to return it to you, that's on them.

Second, it is not right.  I've also experienced this first hand at previous jobs which made me decide to never work for a female.  I know that sounds bad, but the drama is too much for me and there is ALWAYS some amount of drama (from my experience).

So here are my thoughts...  Age has something to do with it. You haven't ""earned your keep"" with the matriarchal society of your work family. You're the last one in and so you kind of have to prove yourself.  Meaning they haven't had to rely on you yet, so you haven't exactly proven your worth to their group.  It's a fine line you're walking with them...  Because if you push yourself too hard to prove yourself then you also become deemed ""confrontational"".  Education is another factor.  Women, especially older women, in a office setting can feel insecure with a younger more educated woman coming into a office.  You're threat to all of them, a possible replacement down the line in their job.  Their job is to essentially push you out or letting you into the group.  But it is a fine line, and you have to prove your worth to them - you have to find their weaknesses.

I see it happen routinely in one of my departments with an all female staff - its brutal and so unfair.  My boss, he cannot deal with it.  You won't find an ally with the men of the office but they will probably let you know just how they view the office full of women and their antics.  

I left my last job because of horrendous working conditions.  Women can be the biggest bitches to other women.  I learned a few things from that experience and now that I see it in the various departments and hear about it from younger staff, I see the game for what it is.

Some ideas to break the ice with these women...  Food.  Bake something, if you can bake.  If you can't, go to some fancy bakery and pick up something sweet and pretty - like cupcakes for each one of them in your department.  Ask them what they are doing for lunch and think of a place you are going and ask them if you can pick them up something.  Show them pictures of something, a dog or cat, garden, etc.  Ask for help about a non-work related item.  Sometimes gals just bond over talking about men. If so and so likes gardening, talk about it with them. If so and so like animals, talk about it with them.  Look at their desks, you can pretty much determine what they like by the things they are hanging in their offices.

Then if everything else fails, look for a new job.  It is not going to get any easier and you can't climb the ladder successfully in these conditions.

Good luck!",0,t3_2611yx

This would give her time to find a replacement and she would get her wish for me to just leave.

It will make you resent him. 

Basically this is him changing the terms of your relationship because of his beliefs. So for you to stay together, he is going to have to change his beliefs. Not all of them, but the bit about you being basically Satan's seductive minion. I'm not sure therapy would be much use but it couldn't hurt. To stay together for the long term is going to require a lot of mutual compromise on how religion is handled with children. While dogmatic beliefs can have many real benefits, usually the believer feels justified in making what would be otherwise unreasonable demands because they are in a more committed relationship with Jesus than you, and unless they accept that you are more important than making Jesus happy, they will feel justified in setting conditions on child rearing, your personal beliefs, and church attendance that you as a non-believer would never try to enforce on him for anything else. You have to compromise too in allowing him to do his thing, but it sounds like you already have done that. But he sees the truth that if he chooses you over Jesus, then his beliefs aren't matching with reality. So rather than accept reality he has to force you to change or get you out of his life because the fact you can be happy and fulfilled without religion is threatening to his beliefs. Sure you can let him have his beliefs, but you have every right to stand up for your own as well. If he can't or won't accept that, then either he needs to change or you need to get out. I've seen too many friends try to fake it, and it just doesn't work in the long term.

20140520101116,PoniesRBitchin,"There's lots of answers here, depending on what type of couple you are and what his beliefs are.

So for one, why is this that big of an issue for him when he doesn't go to church and (I'm assuming, since you said you may never get married) doesn't care about ""no sex before marriage?"" Why is this a dealbreaker when he picks and chooses from his faith? It's tricky to frame that in a non-judgemental way, and without offending his faith, but it needs to be asked. Why is this the thing he cares about when everything else is fine?

Also, Biblically marrying a non-Christian is permissible. Offhand I know 1 Corinthians 7:12-15ish talks about how a non-believer is made pure by their believing husband or wife. In other words, no one's getting corrupted, but the atheist or non-Christian is considered sanctified. His talk of Satan ""tempting"" him makes me wonder if he's just losing his own faith, and seeing you be a happy non-Christian is making those doubts about religion grow. Perhaps by pushing you away, he's trying to push away doubt about his faith. It's worth bringing up in a safe space to ask if he either needs more of a religious/church community, or needs support transitioning away from faith. A Unitarian church might be a good answer for the former, since it's open to many different beliefs (even atheism) and would allow for his open style of faith. On the other hand, if he's having doubts and decides to stop believing (or can't believe anymore), then he could need support transitioning away from his faith. That can be a scary time, and some people fall into depression or even get suicidal when they lose their religion. If that's what's happening, he'd need extra support from you (and maybe even Reddit's atheism or ex-Christian boards). Either way, he needs to sort out his beliefs.

Like everyone else said, there are plenty of couples who make it work when spouses have different beliefs. It already sounds like you support him, but him learning not to resent your different opinions may be something to work on in your couple's therapy. Again, a religious community might be a good idea for him, since it might be that as a solitary practitioner, he's just missing that sense of having others with shared beliefs. Currently he's mad that he's not getting it at home, but perhaps having a few people he could talk to about religion would make him feel better. Maybe that just means finding a Christian friend he can have coffee with once a week. Whatever works for him. Having some sort of outlet for his feelings may make him feel less pressured to have a Christian spouse.

But at the end of the day, if he was going to put imaginary beings above his very real girlfriend, there's not a lot you can do there. I'm sorry you have to be in this position, and I hope things work out.",10,t3_260zsw

These are really good questions that he does struggle to answer. 

I think the Corinthians passage refers to two people who marry as non believers, and then one finds the faith.

I've never begun a relationship with someone who wasn't Christian.

Your aspiration is to be a painter and they think art programs should be cut from schools because it isn't important. These are perfectly fine reasons to end a relationship. Why is religion not one?

I am more of a ""Ill show you where to look, but not what to see"" type of dad. I want them to find answers for themselves, and follow the path that makes them happy. Not be told that a life choice or a belief makes them a bad person. 

It does upset my wife at times. She is of the firm belief that if I don't believe, I will never get into heaven. She wants to spend eternity with me. Truth be told, if there is a heaven, I want to spend eternity with her as well. I love her. Unconditionally. But I wont lie to her about how I feel just to make her smile. 

I see it like this. If there is a god, heaven, angels and all that stuff, great. When its my time to kick the bucket and I have to stand before him and explain why I should get in, I can say I have lived a great life. I have three wonderful kids that I raised the best I could. I have shown them love. I have helped them to learn compassion. To help others and never expect something in return. I loved my wife, and only my wife. I helped people in need and did the best I could do to be a good person. I held high morals and was just an all around pretty nice guy. Yes, I made mistakes. But I learned from them and tried to not make them again. 

That alone should be good enough. If its not, and I am turned away simply because I didnt ""believe"", then whats the point. 

I would hope that god would go... hey man... I know I pretty much left shit for actual instructions. I never gave anyone any actual answers. But you tried. High five. Come have a burger. 

So, thats where I am. She has slowly started to come to terms with the fact that I will probably never believe. 

Remember...  there is a difference between believing and being a good person. Which would you rather have in heaven (if there is one)?

Sorry for the rambling... Just try to keep an open mind. Listen to his concerns, but also make sure he listens to you. Many people who are religious have a very hard time seeing the other side of things. They are so indoctrinated that even trying to see the other side of the coin makes them feel like they are turning on their religion. It takes time and baby steps.

20140520143407,SphericalBasterd,"A wise old Family Law Attorney once said to me, ""one or a combination of three things can destroy a marraige; sex, money or religion"". She was the attorney who arranged my adoption as a child, my Sunday school teacher and a lifelong family friend. I wish, in a way I had listened to her.

What she meant was that if a couple are too far apart on any one of these three things, there will be intense friction leading to resentment because they go to the core of who a person is and especially how they see themselves. When it comes to money, an irresponsible spender will clash with a spouse who is a saver unless they can compromise. Sex is the same. Let's say, for arguments sake that you only want sex infrequently but he wants it all the time. How long do you think that relationship will last? Religion is evey bit as deep as any of the others. For example: Taking his comment about the whole Satan tempting him; I would conclude that he believes in heaven and hell and the corresponding afterlives. The way he's looking at it, at the end of your respective lives, you will be in hell as a non-believer and he will be in heaven. I would say that that alone, assuming his love for you, would cause a great deal of angst for him. The other thing about religion is the community aspect. You didn't indicate that he attends church regularly, but it is a firm possibility that he will want to in the future; can you be honest with yourself and wholeheartedly join in, or would you have to fake it? If you had to fake it would you be happy? Could you indefinitely keep up the charade?

You have a lot of questions to answer about the direction of your future. If it helps; this crossroads always happens to thoughtful, self aware people.

20140520164933,proximaparada,"Hey, can totally relate to this. 

Had a relationship with a guy. He was everything: loving doting, faithful, funny etc. He also happened to really like me. Despite long distance, we were quickly and brutally falling in love. I started wanting to make it official, a dating relationship where neither of us saw other people. At first long distance was the issue, but soon it came to be that it was more than just that:  He was a firm believer and I was not. 

It was really hard. After the conversations we had together about it, I would have a knot in my stomach. I felt like he wasn't being fair to me, because in order to be with him I'd have to change my belief, whereas I didn't want him to change, belief or no. 

Obviously, when you care about someone this much (as I'm sure you know) it's worth investigating. I talked to local priests at a church nearby and they helped explain the importance of lining up values in a marriage, not just religiously, but financially for example. Together we talked about the central bible verses that guided him on this subject. That was helpful for me too: we talked about how a believer's life is meant to be laid down for God. In marriage, the two should be yolked together like oxen, so they can work together. If one is not heading towards the same goal (ultimately, following Jesus) then the oxen don't really get much plowing done. 

Anyway, from there I started going to a bible study just to explore and try to understand his side of things, because up to then I had never met anybody like him. I only had one religious friend and she acted far from it. He was different in that it guided his life, was important to him and really guides his actions. My friends reacted like most redditors have on here: incredulous, and though very supportive, just could NOT understand from his point of view.

Bible study really helped me understand where he was coming from. I got to ask a ton of questions and get thoughtful and developed answers. In turn, my beliefs DID end up changing, though only after a couple years of intense reading, contemplating, and introspectiveness. This may not be what happens for you, but I really do wish you the best in this situation and relationship. I know it was really trying for me, and although I ended up better for it, the process was still painful.

20140520083255,SometimesQueer,"Let me start by saying I hope this doesn't come off as anti-religion.

My faith, or lack thereof, however you want to word it, is a non-negotiable for me. I've read and explored many faith options, and I just... don't believe. I'm glad others have found comfort in faith, but I don't share it.

I could not compromise that for someone any more than someone who is firm in their faith could just *stop* believing to compromise for me. It's not fair, it could lead to serious resentment, and the world is not so small that we would need to settle for each other when we differ so severely on something so core to our identity and beliefs.

I could not attend church faithfully and frequently without my eyeballs falling out of my head. I could not in good faith raise children into a belief system I don't support, and I would always feel like I was forcing their hand versus letting them explore and discover faith for themselves.

As a point of interest, I'm concerned that it is strictly *on you* to convert rather than on him to explore outside his belief system. I would find this sort of thing unbearable. It's so core, how could someone I love expect me to alter such a fundamental part of myself for them without exploring the same option for themselves? I don't mean parties who differ should just automatically tap themselves out, but they can't lose sight of exactly what they're asking of their partner, and if it's a non-negotiable for them, *that's okay* but it is unfair to pressure you to meet that term. It *is* fair of them to decide what they need in a relationship, and it is fair of you to say, ""I can't do/be that, good luck"".

It falls under the same umbrella as kids v. no kids for me. I'm not saying one is better than the other in some kind of broad, all-encompassing sense, but either may be better than the other for people on an individual level. And I'm not saying compromise is impossible, it's just a much more severe compromise than say, blue or grey bedsheets or dividing household chores.",5,t3_260zsw

20140520104326,Amidship,"I wonder if it would be enough to tell him that you'll try.  I was raised without church in an ""atheist"" household, but attended parochial school from 2nd - 8th.  I was also baptized, which was important for my grandparents.  There was no conflict within my household with regard to religion, but my father took some heat from my maternal grandfather from time to time, likely because it was easier than picking on his equally faithless daughter.  I think I was just as surprised as everyone else when faith found me.  It came from a feeling of being blessed, or excessively fortunate, and grew from very positive community experiences.  Also, from more selfish things.  I got the idea that I should date religious girls when I realized that my Christian friends were often marrying … above their number.  I have only dated two women for whom church was important, and the most recent is now my fiancee.  She has stated before that the issue is make or break for her.  Previously, I was dating liberal artsy types, and that's still attractive to me, but there was always the specter of conflict there with regard to children, the nature of the union, etc.  I came to realize over the years that I wanted to marry someone with traditional views, who would think my oafishness was cute.  A girl I dated previously (2 yrs actual, prob 6 yrs in love), probably traumatized me with her ideas that a relationship should be a lease that terminated every 5 years unless there were kids involved.  She dumped me and then regretted it, but I was too hurt to reengage.  Traditional sounded good after that.  

All this is to say that we are all unfinished works.  Maybe you're scared of who your boyfriend would be without religion.  My faith (attempt at) has a calming influence on my life, and I definitely focus on the positive.  We are more alike than you think though, because I've read all of the atheist books, and I struggle with faith on a daily basis.  I ignore a good deal of the dogma.  The community aspect of our society's most popular religion (Christianity) can't be beat.  Maybe it would be enough for him if you could fake it a little, but at the same time he should understand that it's a struggle for you.  I agree with those who are saying that he needs to make a bit of a concession.  At the same time, maybe try a small prayer.

My fiancee has unquestioning faith which shows up in the smallest statements.  Platypus: ""I don't know what God was thinking when he made those.""  I don't think she's a 6000 year earth believer, but she believes a lot more than I ever will.  That's ok though, because I know she'll always be there for me, and her faith will keep us afloat no matter what happens.  

In summary, if this is your forever relationship, keep your head up.  He's go to understand that you're not a threat to his faith, and that the idea that you're a trial is misguided.  Maybe my experience can be a path forward for you, send the kids to a parochial private school as a compromise.  My school was Episcopalian, and it was academically excellent.",1,t3_260zsw

You could have those feelings, and realize that you live in a material world, and a world filled with physical beings that you can interact with, and that can help you out. Religion can fill certain needs, but religion is not the only way.

If you don't believe, don't push yourself to believe. Only be as open to religious claims, as you would be to any other claims and ideas. Give them a fair treatment. Same as you would evolution, string theory, and homeopathy. For some of them the evidence is immensely strong.

No, you should not. You should feel free to experience and explore what you want, and you should be open to change your mind about things as you obtain more information. But if he needs for you to convert for him to be with you, you're not that important to him. You're at best becoming a part of what he really cares about.

If he cares about you, and you care about him, different beliefs (that are within a certain threshold of each other), shouldn't be a deal breaker.

I wish you the best of luck in finding happiness and love. Ultimately never forget it is your choice how to live your life.

I am by no means any type of expert, this is just my humble opinion after 16 years of marriage with children and living over 40 years on this Earth, and I also know many in the Church:


- Unless the person keeps you hanging on, no matter how hot or perfect, the longer you are with someone, the more the little things become big problems. Once you ""have"" him your focus will turn to what you are missing in the relationship. 

- The more religious a man, the less rights a women has over her body and the less he will agree with your choices that go against his faith.

- The soul-mate of someone religious, is someone who shares the same vision of how to live life and the path to the after life.  

- Most marriages are hard, most women married > 5 years have serious gripes with their men. ""Men get lazy, and women get crazy"" is a line a mother I know told me once..


**if he fully accepts you.. I mean respects you and your choices because he loves you no matter his faith, then he may be the one.  But if he is going to put his faith over his love and respect for you, dictate what you can think/say, you run the risk of having a very hard painful time.**

Consider him loving God and his rules more than you.. how would that make you feel if it were the case?

I know you said that this only a small piece of the puzzle, but considering that you're completely supportive of his belief (even if you don't share it - and you definitely should not even think about faking it!) and he still thinks you might be a ""satanic temptation""... can you imagine what might happen if your relationship reaches a point where you're a little less supportive (or even opposed to some part of his faith)? I feel this could get really ugly really quick. And from what you described, if that situation ever came about, it sounds like he is definitely more invested in his faith than in you. **If he ever has to choose, he won't choose you.** That seems like an unhealthy basis for a serious relationship, to say the least.

20140520182912,fuckthisfuckthatfuku,"Hi. As much as I hate to say it, I can relate to this... My girlfriend and I just broke up tonight. Shes christian, I'm not. We'd have been together for two years 7 months if we had made it until tomorrow. We had a wonderful relationship, shes my best friend, and when we had disagreements, we talked things out. We had two arguments our entire time together which lasted maybe half an hour each, if that, and being with her has led me to some of the greatest moments of my life and helped me to truly develop into a better person. 

a little over two weeks ago, she told me that her parents had both been speaking with her and how she needs to think about how her relationship with me is affecting her relationship with Christ. We talked about it a few days later which ended with a really ambiguous and confusing ""break up"". The words were never said, and it only got to that point when I finally asked her ""Do you want things to end, you just don't want to be the one to end it?"". She didn't even answer that, just looked at me. We didn't talk for a week, until I broke down and texted her. Since then, we had been chatting and had a few serious talks about us. During the time since the ambiguous break up, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and getting advice. I met with her sister and talked with her and a pastor separately and asked them for advice on how I could reduce the tension and show her how much I care, and try to share in her faith while not believing it, and ended up writing her a long (for me) letter. I would have married this girl. 

She tells me she loves me, and how she really does want to be with me, but that she feels at peace with us separating. As things were ending and she was going to leave tonight, I told her I hope she finds what shes looking for. Her answer was ""I already have in so many ways"". I don't really even know what to think anymore. 

I guess the long story short is you're not alone. I hope that things work out the way you want them to. It's a really shit situation to have to experience and go through. If you want to talk to someone and have a sob fest, I wouldn't mind having someone to chat with. I wish you the best of luck.",1,t3_260zsw

This is what I hold as the core issue here: it's not about the color, or in this case, your beliefs per se. It's about the *how*, the *why*, the *when* -- basically, the history and thought processes that enable each of you to hold the beliefs that you hold.

But I don't see why it can't be God's plan for him, a true believer, to walk through life besides you, a nonbeliever, and to lead you closer to God through his faith and his example. That would also be the true expression of his love for you: trying his best to spend his eternity with you and putting in the time and energy over the course of his life to that end, rather than breaking up and letting you go to Hell so that he can ensure he ends up in Heaven. #whatdreamsmaycome

It certainly doesn't seem fair that he (seemingly out of nowhere) would deliver an ultimatum: ""believe the things I do or else our relationship is over."" Don't get me wrong, it's okay to have deeply-held beliefs which are a deal-breaker for a long-term relationship. But it seems that deciding what to do with your relationship should come at the end of a process.

I don't think *anyone* could expect you to just... flip a switch and suddenly believe in God. Hopefully he doesn't expect that! So, what I'm getting at is... would you be willing to give God a chance? I take it you have considered religious things and simply decided it's not for you. If that's a deal-breaker for you... then you guys have a problem. Either one of you changes your mind or the other... or it's time to move on.

BUT, no matter what *he* is willing and able to do, what if *you* were willing to give it a chance? What if you set a trial period (a few months?) and said, ""Okay, God. I like this guy, so give me your best shot."" Find a Bible and figure out what parts to read. Get in the habit of praying, even if it seems silly. He doesn't do it now, but maybe you could both try going to church a few times- that's something great that you can do together. Really give it your all. Take a test drive.

Surely that doesn't sound so awful? I dunno, maybe I'm reading your tone wrong. But it seems like you really love this guy and would be willing to give this a shot. Would he be open to trying this out? Who knows... Maybe nothing happens, the time comes to an end, and you both decide it's time to move on. Maybe *his* opinions will be different at the end. Or maybe something will change in your own heart. A change which simply requires time, like a planted seed, and can't simply be turned on, like a light bulb.

My wife and I have two good friends who faced something similar in college. The guy was a Christian and started dating the girl who was not. It wasn't an issue at first... but eventually it became one for him. She hated the pressure, which really wasn't very fair of him. But that was the situation. She loved him and decided to give it a chance. In their case, she started to figure things out on their own. I think they gave it a year? She started going to church, maybe attended a Bible study, made other friends who were Christians... The couple didn't talk about it much during that time. She didn't want to feel any expectations from him, and I guess talking about it made her feel like she had to offer some kind of report as to how it was going. She wanted to be free to figure it out with any expectations. Without the need to say what he wanted to hear or act the way he wanted her to act. He was completely understanding. He hated the pressure that weighed on his heart as well. He continued to cherish her and he gave her space and time to figure it out. In the end, in their case, she *did* come to believe. But it took time!

I hate moments in life like this, which blindside you and make you feel so... hopeless or helpless. Crossing my fingers that you are both willing to try out something like this... and that it works out in the end! Praying for peace, comfort, and wisdom for you both.",1,t3_260zsw

Man believes his religion is more important than his love for you.

If you do not believe, that is your business and you cannot pretend to believe - it would be futile.
If he values his relationship with his God more than he does his relationship with you, then he is *not living in the real world*.

Perhaps if you were aggressive about it, if you insisted he give up his religion or mocked it, he would be behaving reasonably, but he is not.

Interfaith partnerships can work, but only when one person is not trying to proselytise the other. If he cannot respect your own personal beliefs, then he is the worst kind of believer and you are never going to be his priority.

I am really sorry if this seems horrible, and I hope he comes to his senses. But in my opinion, the worst-case scenario would be that you convince yourself you are a Christian through fear of losing him, and end up living a lie whilst he gets to control every last bit of who you are under cover of 'religious conviction'.",0,t3_260zsw

This is something I've only come to understand in the time we've been dating - but I think all Christians are supposed to love God above all else, and have God as they're #1 priority. There are tons and tons of relationships where this works just fine. 

He is behaving reasonably - and we are trying to make the ""most right"" decision of what to do with the situation.

This -> ""he got the notion that our relationship is a trial, and Satan knows him so well and has tempted him with me and my dis-belief ""

I went through something similar with a women. My lightbulb moment. ""I want you to tell our future children that they will LITERALLY drink the blood of a man each Sunday"" woke me up.

What you are hearing is the religious establishment talking through this mans lips - he is deep in and can not think for himself.  It's too late for him.
He will take the churches side over you and your family, EVERY time.

He may have nice attributes, but, ask yourself, would you answer a dating profile if the first paragraph contained something to the above?
I doubt it.

The part of him behind thinking you are the devil, will snap at some point in your life, he may lose his faith, his reason to be a good person 
maybe lose the fear of god... etc... and he will take it out on you and the people you love.

Do yourself a favour, find a good honest atheist man who is the right person for the right reasons, not because of the fear of an imaginary
book character.

If you stay with him, you will have children, you WILL be manipulated in to bringing them up in his way as ""if you loved him you would do this... as you are a strong person... blah blah , besides if you don't believe its real it doesn't matter if we teach our kids this this and this"" ... nor are fairies, but
you don't base your life around them. 

Could you live with yourself if one day, your child / grandchildren turns to you and says, and sincerely means.. "" Mom, Aunt, Gran, you are the devil and we cast you out ""

You'll feel better eventually, go online, find some meet up groups, to do all the things you have been prevented or forbidden to do as part of your ""support"" for his faith.  I'm making an assumption here... as I had to give up things I loved to ""support"" their faith.

50 yr old woman weighing in.  As a step child and former step mother.

Do not worry about making her love you.  Do not expect reciprocation.  It sounds like you do not have kids of your own.  Your stepkids are just approaching the 'I hate you! Please drive me to the mall!"" stage.  Do not take it personally.  

If you feel like it's an issue, you can get family counseling.  It will embarass her no end, and maybe even get her to adjust her attitude, but don't count it.  She is entering the attitude central stage of her life.  Let's hope she grows out of it by the time she hits 20.

Keep the rules that you have.  Be kind and respectful.  Do not let her push your buttons.  Do not let her get away with anything (or the boys for that matter).

Get her involved in constructive activities.  i.e. she needs a sport or music.  Doesn't matter what it is, but it will instill discipline and the ability to work with others.  An afterschool club is also good.  For boys - Boy Scouts is my usual recommendation.  For girls - depends on what interests her.  I am not familiar with the Girl Scouts program beyond Junior Scout, but that may be a good option for her.

It helps her have a positive outlet and exposure to positive role models, outside of you.  

The family nights are a great idea!  I personally tried to have dinner together as a family every night that we were together.  

And listen to her.  When she talks really listen.  When i was a step-mom, my 2 step-sons would share things with me that they wouldn't share with their father or mother.   And I would give them suggestions based on what i saw as their strengths.  For example - one was worried about fitting in at his high school (going into 9th grade).  I talked to him about finding a sport.  It gives him a group of guys to hang out with and helps him with playing on a team, etc.  He decided to try for football (he had the size).  He went to the daily workouts over the summer, and really impressed the coach with his work ethic.  He made first string freshman team, and after the 1st game, was moved up to JV, after a couple more games, he was moved up to varsity.  After never having been in any sport!!  HE was so proud of himself!  It even helped him get a scholarship when it was time for college.  ANd he wrote an essay for class about how it was the decision that had the most positive impact on his life so far.  That made me feel really good!! ",11,t3_261jns
20140520152620,Melmoe,"My stepmother came into my life when I was 9.  She had not yet become a mother but she had been in a relationship prior that involved a child.  Not to say she was ""bad"" at being a mother figure but she definitely lacked the experience of what being a mother meant and how to navigate those waters.  

I am now 34 and she is one of my best friends.  She ended up having two kids with my father and at that point it really clicked with her.  However, some of the things I remember being really special with her was when she would take me for one on one time. One of the best times I remember was her taking me to get my own face wash, lotions, makeup etc at Bed & Bath.  Also we would go to movies and watch ""chick flicks"" together.  She didn't talk about my dad or my mom.  She asked about me, my school, friends, crushes, etc.

You may not be able to get this family time you are envisioning.  Boys have some strange phases too.  However if you can establish a relationship with just her, excluding everyone else in your time with her, it might be easier come the time you gather as a family.  

Don't try too hard though to be overly nice etc.  Just relate to her on her level.  She is growing into a young woman and probably likes clothes, makeup, manicure and pedicures.  She is exploring her inevitable womanhood early, it is a great time to be a part of that transition and become a valuable resource for her to rely upon with questions and information. 

One on one relationships are important to kids in this age range.  Often they are treated as one in the same, but they need that individualized affection and it is probably more acceptable for you to give it than the parents.  ",6,t3_261jns

Boys hide their emotions. So just because you are not experiencing anything doesn't mean they are ok with everything. 

If you really want a happy family, stop making it about you and make it about them. 

combined families always make the mistake that they think everyone should be treated equally. It is just the opposite, everyone wants to feel loved and special and not forgotten in the fray.

1. Take an active genuine interest in something that she likes, preferably not with a strong connection to dad. This is both difficult and easy because it's tedious to keep a constant active interest you didn't develop on your own but it also doesn't require you to break down emotional wall directly.

2. DO NOT TRY AND FORCE IT. It's been reiterated enough elsewhere but its too important not to throw in.

3. Don't lose hope. Kids get upset with their parents all the time (biological or otherwise) and can be cruel about trying to hurt you. It's, usually, not because they are mean but because kids are short tempered and don't think about the big picture.

4. Be thrilled and encouraging of accomplishments. Not overbearing mind but make her aware that you know about the good things shes doing (school, sports, etc.) and that she knows she has your support in those things.

5. Remember the purpose is to establish your relationship as a 1 on 1 not as part of the larger family.

family boardgame night sounds fun. 

diagnosing your stepdaughter with loving her dad too much sounds horrible. are you a psychiatrist? is the child seeing a psychiatrist? has any kind of a professional made that observation? if not you need to knock it off with the armchair psychology.

 it makes you sound like somebody trying to justify hating their stepdaughter. ""she's got a disorder! she's sick in the head! it's not that I'm in any way intruding on her family or disrupting her life then demanding to be loved and respected with nothing to back it up"" <- that's what I hear when you diagnose your stepdaughter with a Oedipus Complex. also the female version is an [Electra Complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_complex) so, at least get your terminology straight.

also, if you *are* a psychologist then you know it's unethical to diagnose someone who isn't your patient.  double-knock that shit off.

anyways, back to what you can do to win over the 10yr old:

stop trying to get her to like you. stop trying to get her to like her dad less. you're not her parent so treat her the way you'd treat a nibling. authoritarian parenting strategies just encourage kids to lie to you, so explain why you are doing what you are doing and expect the same ""because I am the adult"" doesn't count as an explanation. 

don't act possessive of her dad around her. don't fight her for his attention. you two have different relationships with the man and he is capable of loving you both. acting possessive (for example: dad is doing thing with daughter, you come over and demand his attention through some kind of PDA) just makes you look insecure. this is one of those art of war type of occasions where not acting, is to act as though you've already won. 

my problems with my stepmother all stem from the fact that she would like my dad to spend less time with me and my sister. now that we are adults that takes the form of demanding to move him out of the state. (and away from her own daughter too) this kind of atmosphere makes me feel unwelcome around her. it's hard to like somebody who has made it clear that they want nothing to do with you.",5,t3_261jns

20140520164431,horsefish5,"Coming from someone who's had a lot of issues with their step mum trying to force her way into my life by trying to take the place of my mum (who I lived with full time), I really think that the role a step-parent plays in a child's life can only be decided by the child. She's young but 10 is definitely old enough to start to realise what you need from your family - any attempt of yours to try to act as a family unit when she already has a mother she loves and who is being excluded from that family will be difficult for her to accept. Remember her family unit was always her mother and father, for the majority of her life - that's not something you can change quickly, if ever.

I wish my step-mother had tried less to be a mother-figure and put less emphasis on us being a 'family' when my real family had been torn apart by my parents divorcing. I wish she'd tried to be more like an aunt or a family friend, someone to stick up for me and give me unconditional support rather than force out my mother and pretend I didn't have a life before she married my dad (for context, I was 6 when my parents divorced and 8 when my dad remarried). And I knew these things from the moment she moved in with him and created her 'family' out of nothing from the ashes of my family.

Tread carefully with her, and don't force her to be close to you until she's ready - pushing yourself on her will just make it take longer. 3 years is not a long time to adjust to such a fundamental change in her life. I hope this doesn't offend you and isn't out of line, but you have to remember they are *not* your children; but it sounds like you already love them a lot so I'm sure they will grow to love you, they just might not realise it for a few years yet (this seems to be a common theme with teenager-parent dynamics in general).

My advice would be this: Don't kill with kindness. I know that you have already been with them for 3 years but continue with a mentality of 'start as you mean to go on'. Punish them when they are doing wrong. Do NOT indicate to them in any way/shape/form that you have no control or authority to ground them.

I will agree that the step-parent is not on the same 'level' as the others, but she is still important. Her views on raising children matter.

Also, It may come across that my most important peice of advise is to discipline the kids. That's not it. Nor do I advocate physical punishment!

That said, I've carried a baby to term and placed her with an incredible and loving family that I got to know during the pregnancy. I am honored to be able to continue that relationship with them to this day (five years later). We keep in close contact, and I get to visit them every once in a while (I moved out-of-state, otherwise it would be more frequent). It was not an easy decision, but it was the right one at that time. 

Two years ago, I had another unplanned pregnancy (fucking Nuva Ring does not work, people!), and decided with my partner to have an abortion. Again, not an easy decision, but it was the right one at that time. 

In my experience, being confident in my decision to have an abortion  is a million times easier than choosing adoption, and I truly believe that my adoption journey has been the easiest and most loving scenario possible. This may seem shocking, but it is my truth. 

I just want you to remember that talking hypothetically is great and these conversations between partners should occur more frequently...but how you feel when you may actually be pregnant could very well be different than how you THINK you may feel now.

I think it is wonderful that we live in a society that allows women to choose what they believe to be best. For me, I could never get an abortion, call it pride, call it responsibility, hell, call it me being brainwashed. It's just not something I feel comfortable with (you could even call it catholic guilt from the way i was raised). My SO would MUCH RATHER me choose abortion over adoption or even keeping the child. I've made it very clear that at this point in my life, I would keep a baby if I get pregnant. I'm 25, I have a job that pays well enough and a family that could support me emotionally, so things are different.

Summer is coming up...that means more street festivals, music festivals, outdoorsy stuff. Those could be good places to meet people. 

Professional networking events are also a way to meet people. Since you have a legitimate reason for talking, you can get a feel for a person without the pressure of framing it as a courtship. It also helps to zero in on people who have similar backgrounds and lifestyles to you.

OKCupid is a bit better than POF but I used it for 5 years with nothing more to show than a handful of responses...and less than 3 dates.

eHarmony is better than either of those but it never connected me with anyone I had a spark with.  I went on 10 dates in 2 years and had maybe 30 PMs from women (and about half that in responses to those I would PM first).  

I used Match.com after a bad breakup with a great lady I met during my day job (she was 6 months out of a 7 year marriage...separated for 4 of those years) who wasn't ready for a relationship yet.  

I had 22 private messages from women within 48 hours of putting up almost the exact same profile I had up for years on OKCupid.  Over 50 private messages before a week had gone by, and I already had a date setup before the first week had gone by.

I setup 9 dates with 8 different women in the first month and I am not kidding when I say I found ""Mrs. Right"" on Match.  It took me less than 2 months on Match.com to find that person I always had dreamed of having in my life.

We have been together a little over 9 months and this has been the easiest, least stressful, most loving and fun relationship I have ever had.   We already are talking about the future (marriage, kids, where we would live) and our respective families adore our 'better half'.   

Perhaps it is different for those who live on the coasts, I don't know.  I hail from a small city in the midwest. 

I can say that both men and women need to make their profile interesting to the other sex, funny, a little revealing, and HONEST. 

Include a bunch of pictures of yourself as well if you want any sort of a response.  A lot of smiling pictures is best.  Especially pictures which are clear...I can't tell you how many profiles I would breeze past if the lady had no picture or only a head shot photo.

**Paid for dating sites weed out a lot of undesirables.**   Guys who are looking for sex but not about finding a long term relationship are not usually willing to shell out cash to a dating site.   They only do the 'free' profile thing on paid dating sites and mainly use POF and Craigslist when they can.   

Men willing to shell out cash for a paid account are normally serious about finding someone.  

I tried finding a lady via the old fashioned ways of Church, club, volunteering, community events, coffee shop, art show, bar, bowling ally, friends, weddings.  Made friends but no one that 'clicked'. No sparks.

By using the online dating sites, I was exposed to more women that I would never have had a chance of meeting otherwise.   I expanded my preferences to a 100 mile radius on Match.com and found Mrs. Right in a small town just 45 minutes away.  She is a 4th grade school teacher, 4 years older than me (40) but honestly we don't notice an age difference at all.  It never comes up.  Here is the thing.  I live in a small metro area of ~225,000 people and pickings are slim for a guy who is my age.   I'd probably never met anyone I would make my wife if online dating wasn't available. 

I wish you all the best and if anything I said helps, GREAT!  If not, I apologize for wasting your time and wish you the best of luck anyway.


**TLDR: I'm a guy. I used pretty much all the online dating sites for 10 years.  2 months of using Match.com and I found the woman I know I am going to marry and feel she will be my 'forever wife'.  I give some advice above and wish you the best of luck.***",1,t3_261zsw

Second, based only on what I know about my cycle, immediately after your period is an unlikely time to conceive.  Generally you don't ovulate right after you finish your period.  Sperm can live 3-5 days so it's not impossible, just unlikely.

Nausea, cramping, fatigue, among others. Our minds had her body completely convinced she was pregnant and it was nothing. Anyway, especially at a time like this, It's important to try not to psych yourself out too much. It's utterly amazing how effectively your mind can trick you.

Also as a side note, after spending so much time preparing ourselves mentally that this was a possibility, it was actually pretty devastating when we found out she wasn't pregnant. After all that worrying, we were never relieved that she wasn't pregnant. After a couple of sad weeks we decided to give it a try. Fast forward to today and she's 18 weeks pregnant.

My advice would be to A) buy a pack of cheap pregnancy tests online (Amazon has really cheap ones, eligible for free or Prime shipping!) and test once a day with first-morning-urine until you get a period - the negative tests will give you some peace of mind, hopefully; B) go to your doctor about the frequent urination/weird pee - those are classic UTI symptoms, and UTIs can escalate to more serious infections really quickly.

They take a long time to bring up to speed, there is no guarantee they'll be around long enough to finish a job once they are up to speed, and the work they do has to be checked by a responsible person as the level of their work hasn't been verified through experience. A lot of engineers are busy as shit, and simply inviting that conversation with a new person can turn into a major drain on productive work.

5.  They're a bit afraid of you. With all of the supposed*stories* of *spiteful*  women claiming harassment at the slightest offense, they may be scared that if they glance at you the wrong way, it's off to HR and a pink slip for them.

As one of the few women in the office, I felt like a had a black cloud hanging over me.  Whenever I entered a room, there would be a gasp of air and everyone would suddenly become silent and bury their faces in their work.  Not wanting to even look at me.

You cannot get your ex to stop drinking. There is nothing you can say or do that will make him quit. I think it's a little odd she's contacting you and I would be wary of it. If I was in her situation, I would contact his parents or his old rehab group, but not the ex as you can't provide anything additional to this situation. I don't mean to be mean, only blunt - but whatever you did to get him sober last time, it didn't work. You do not hold the answers for how to keep him sober. 

I believe that alcoholism is a ""spiritual"" disease meaning that alcoholics have problems, even without alcohol in their system. Hallmark traits of alcoholics include manipulation, selfishness, and self-delusion. It is possible he has asked his new girlfriend to contact you, and has some ideas about what to do if he gets your information. His history of violence sounds very serious, and will only get worse as he continues to drink. Alcoholism changes people. I was so radically different year to year, girlfriend to girlfriend that I was often unrecognizable to my old friends. Sometimes better, like when I got really into fitness and better style, or moved to a new city and took a new job, and more often times worse like how I gained weight, started smoking, stopped working out, stopped being a part of my community. Although you knew him, you do not know what he's like now. What he likes, doesn't like, what makes him happy, calm, safe, angry, stressed can all be different as prolonged alcohol abuse begins to change the brain. 

You've done all you can. Take it from me who has been in very dark and depressed places thanks to alcohol - there is nothing you can do. ",10,t3_261g3u

Not only is appearance largely irrelevant in the field, losing weight can actually hurt a singer. Their body is their instrument. Sometimes extra weight is an important part of it. Not to mention that losing weight can require a tremendous amount of time and energy for some people. I don't think it is fair to expect singers to exercise a couple hours a day and diet when they already lead very busy lives.

Wait, I'm not trying to be argumentative, but if fat people aren't eating too much (barring the people with medical issues) without burning enough calories, then how *are* they getting fat?

I personally (a normal sized, all around healthy person) lost 40lbs in about 5 months by eating less large meals.  No working out.  I know many people who lose weight this way.  Eating more than your body needs or can burn will cause it to hold on to the weight in most circumstances.  I don't think anyone believes that if a fat person stops eating too much the weight will magically (quickly) fall off, but there will be a difference in time(again, barring any other medical conditions).",13,t3_2624vn
20140520170543,pizzaandburritos,"Yes, eating more than your body burns is how you gain weight, and eating less than you burn is how you lose weight. I just mean that it's important to consider that food is only half of the picture. The other half is how your body metabolizes the food and responds to exercise, which is largely out of your control. People have different genes and age, stress, hormones, medical conditions, etc. all factor in. 

It frustrates me when people assume things about someone's health or lifestyle choices on the basis of their body, when everyone's body handles food and exercise differently. I probably eat more like a slob than a lot of people who weigh much more than me, and I can get away with it because I'm naturally skinny. On the other end of the spectrum, I have a friend who gained a huge amount of weight as a side effect of medication. She used to be skinny and now she eats less than she used to and is still fat. 

As for people who got fat by overeating, that usually happens over many years. That means they aren't eating a huge amount of extra calories per meal, it's just the fact that they are adding up over time that causes the weight gain. Undoing that damage is quite difficult. So what I mean is that losing weight is not a matter of just stopping unhealthy habits, you actually have to eat less than what your body is burning, which can be quite difficult. In your case it sounds like it wasn't too difficult and you were able to see results, which is great. I just mean there are some exceptions. 


There's a double standard women face by being criticized for their appearance far more frequently than men, and on top of that, I think a lot of men don't understand how much more difficult it tends to be for women to lose weight/how easy it is to gain weight. Our bodies are designed differently. Men don't deal with changes in their hormone balance in the way that women do. So it just seems especially unfair for men to critique women on weight. Firstly it's not relevant and secondly it's not their place to judge. ",7,t3_2624vn
20140521005034,greycloud24,"women get shamed for being fat, men get shamed for having a low income. these are comparable. many women are looking for men who make more money than them, they want a guy who is a primary provider. some women are not like this but they are relatively rare compared to the ones that are like this. men generally don't care that much about women's income. 

men find it important to have a woman they consider physically attractive. this is comparable with his income. the richer a man is, the more likely that society expects him to be with a physically attractive woman. the more physically attractive a woman is, the more that society expects her to get with a rich man. 

so when you hear a guy fat shaming. just keep in mind that men get shamed or passed over completely for not making much money. and women call these men derogatory things if they are not trying to improve their lot in life and still expect to be highly successful with women in relationships. 

a fat woman is like a man with no job. a fat woman who embraces fat acceptance is like a man with no job and no ambition to get a job, who wants to be praised for it. an attractive woman is like a man with a high paying career. woman's body is like man's wallet. they are both judged by each other. and they both objectify each other in the process.

People can be addicted to lots of things. I know lots of people addicted to coffee who would probably be better off not drinking as much of it, but I don't think it's society's job to stigmatize that.   Some of the most respected classical singers have been overweight and being fat actually can help you be a better singer. It is silly to use that to criticize them. I believe smoking is unhealthy but if an actor in a movie is a smoker in his private life, should I use that as a reason to criticize his acting? To me it is irrelevant.

",-1,t3_2624vn
20140521042544,pizzaandburritos,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music

In common usage this is what ""classical"" means. Maybe you are thinking of ""classic"" music, which could just mean the classics of any genre. 

Unhealthy choices do have negative externalities. My original point was simply that one cannot always assess a person's health choices based on their appearance. I agree that in *most* cases fat people are unhealthy, I was just pointing out that sometimes that happens due to medical conditions and sometimes slim people are actually quite unhealthy but better at hiding it. 

The reason a fat tax doesn't exist is because it isn't feasible to measure someone's choices about their health, and thus the extent of those externalities, with a simple measure. In Japan for instance some employers use waist size as a measure of fitness and charge more for health insurance to the ones with bigger waists. If your waist is bigger than average because you're 6'5 and 250 pounds of muscle, you get charged just like if you were obese. Those kinds of exceptional cases are why these types of policies aren't popular in America. It suits the American ethos better to tax the habit, not the result, and it's easier to enforce, too. That's why we tax cigarettes and alcohol, we don't tax you based on how black your lungs are or whether you are an alcoholic. In that framework it makes more sense to tax unhealthy foods, not tax people for being fat. 


I agree that being fat is undesirable, but there are plenty of things that are undesirable that just aren't relevant in certain contexts. If we started policing every field in the public eye to get rid of people with undesirable traits, where would we stop? We'd be getting rid of lots of people who are good at their jobs based on qualities that have nothing to do with their performance. 

I'm not here saying we should celebrate fatness or that this woman should be encouraged to be a model. I'm not even saying it's bad that people mention that she is fat. I'm saying it should not be the primary basis by which she is critiqued by professional music critics. Their job is to critique music. It's problematic that some of these critics didn't even mention her singing ability in their reviews. It would be like a political analyst writing a review of Obama's performance as president that focused entirely on the fact that he smokes and left out all of his policies. There's no social stigma against saying smoking is bad, but that doesn't mean it's always relevant.",2,t3_2624vn

having someone who really is there for you, literally there for you, who can hold you, might bring you the comfort you desire. i don't think any amount of technology can make up for this. and it sounds like you have a history with some trust issues (which i totally empathize with). long distance relationships are unhealthy for anyone with trust issues, because you aren't there to verify or discount your fears, and those fears can run away with you. this will bring you discomfort even with the most loyal people, and your trust issues will either smother them or push them away. you need someone you can trust, and the only person you will trust is the one who you can look into their eyes, and feel their embrace. you have to feel the love, otherwise your fears will get the best of you.

when you are going through your menstrual period your bodies hormones are changing levels. specifically progesterone is coming off of a spike causing a cascade to start with some mineral corticosteroids, this causes salt retention (and corresponding water retention). salt retention is the big one here as it can effect the fluid levels of spinal ligaments (causing them to lose fluid and shrink the area between spinal disks, potentially pinching nerves which would be a sharp pain going down your back, and likely to the sides of your waste or down the back of your butt to your legs). this is followed by an estrogen spike which will end up effecting a lot of tissues, but one of the big ones is your kidneys releasing vasopressin (aka ADHD) and erythropoietin. the vasopressin can mess with your vagus nerve (the one primarily involved with all of your digestive processes and also effecting your heart rate and breathing rate), while the erythropoietin starts a cycle of replacing lost red blood cells. 

you may want to consider these if the problem is not easily found. a lot of doctors look at the simple things, but fail to consider all the hormone pathways involved if that is not their specialty.

There are are clear biological difference between boys and girls, like girls growing and maturing faster, which can easily account for their better grades for equal effort to boys in early grades, since their brains are slightly more developed.

To me it seems like she is saying that boys failing in schools isn't a problem. The wage gap persistence isn't indicative of it not being a problem because many boys who do poorly in school end up in prison or unemployed.

I think what is problematic (and I wouldn't want to use the term mansplaining since it's not really accurate in this context and unnecessarily pejorative and condescending) that she's trying to highlight is the idea of equating the wage gap with women's tendencies to be less competitive than men and then explaining this ""tendency"" as something that's natural and inherent to women.  That's what the article she links later is positing-- that sexism basically plays no role (or if not no role, then an inconsequential one) in the resulting wage gap - and that there is nothing sexist about assuming women are naturally demure, naturally anti-competitive, naturally less demanding of an equal wage (so why should we give them one, and why is it a problem).  Which is obviously hog-wash. Even if there are tendencies on either side of the gender line (which is debatable given the state of nature versus nurture research into gender roles), to base compensation on gender because of gender tendencies is still discriminatory of diversity in a workplace.

My main disagreement with this article is that I see it as ""what about the womenz"". The wage gap should not be used to detract from underperforming boys and I think it does a great disservice to the issue for the author to conflate the two.",0,t3_261p9v

There's a video on the front page right now that's blowin up about this (boys doing poorly in school).

Interesting that it makes it there so quickly and this article, on a female-positive sub gets pretty much buried.  

I don't think this article is using the wage gap to detract from the issue of boys performing poorly in school, because I think they're very much related, and I think the article suggest that.  

Boys preforming poorly compared to girls in an environment where diligence, subservient and near mindless obedience and demureness is rewarded *is the same problem* as women preforming poorly (read: making less money) in an environment where competition, assertiveness/bossiness, and ambitiousness is rewarded- because sexism exists and enforces gender roles on males and females.  

The whole point of this article is that you can't equate girls doing better than boys in schools to doing better in the workplace eventually.  The problem is that the reaction to the information about boys preforming poorly in schools has largely been ""must enforce more gender roles!"" to fix the issue as evidenced by that video that's blowin' up.

1. Force yourself to communicate verbally. You no longer have the luxury of using body language, passive aggression, silent treatment, gifts, etc to make your point. You have to just say it.
2. Schedule time every day to talk. Like a 1 hr Skype session every night at 10 PM. Or, text consistently throughout the day. (Or both, depending on your relationship).

1. Expect it to hurt for a little while, because you have had this person close to you for so long. Change is hard. It's even harder when there are lots of other things going on in your life too, and you will both probably be stressed by the change. I'm not saying this to scare you, just to emphasize that it's ***okay*** if you're doing everything right and things still suck for a while. That being said...

2. Pick up your own hobbies. For me, socializing helps a lot, but I saw below that you don't make friends easily. Doesn't mean you shouldn't try, but you can also pick up other hobbies. I game, craft, ***exercise*** (this is a huge one because it keeps your overall mood stable), have ""girly days"" where I do my nails while watching netflix... The goal is to be happy by yourself, because if you spend too much time being depressed about your relationship it'll eat away at it, because you guys need to make happy memories too even while you're not together.

3. Set up a Skype schedule based on how much you both need contact. If you both like to talk ***all*** the time I would still suggest not doing that, because you should both be spending time doing those other hobbies to work on yourselves. For me, I'm an extrovert and my SO is an introvert so we put an hour-long cap on our Skype calls so he doesn't get overwhelmed and I don't feel like he's the one choosing to end the call. I don't know what your relationship dynamic is like, but this is what works for us.

4. Have a Skype date night! Make some dinner, pour some wine, sit down to a video call, and watch something on Netflix/streaming site of your choice at the same time.

5. Do your best to enjoy your time apart as well as your time together. I used to be almost codependent, but now I take more time just for me and it's made me a happier person overall. I still love spending time with my SO and would do it more if I could, but every cloud has a silver lining and I'd rather see it that way than be depressed about not seeing each other as much.

6. Don't make texting an obligation, or you'll both feel like you're dating your phones instead of each other. My SO and I text each other throughout the day if we think of something to say, but we don't expect an immediate response and don't freak out if it doesn't happen. You ***should*** be busy enough in your day-to-day life that you can't text 24/7, IMO.

7. Don't treat the time in between visits and calls as limbo, just waiting to see/talk to each other again. This is a surefire way to ensure you're depressed and lonely. I know I keep repeating it, but for me the most important lesson was to learn to take care of myself through hobbies and things I genuinely enjoyed.

20140520171126,lockedge,"While I don't agree with the wording of #1, I can agree with the general message. Women need options, and for most women looking into abortion, adoption simply isn't one.  Especially in the USA where the healthcare coverage is abysmally inconsistent and there's no stable maternity leave regulations (especially no paid maternity leave). Some adoption agencies can help try to procure financial support, but most often it's needed from the potential adoptive parents, so it's just shifting the financial burden around and making adoption less likely, funding less likely. A push for goverment-funded support would be an idea, perhaps covering the medical and resource costs of pregnant women committed to adoption/parenting? I suppose that's me agreeing with #3 in general as well...there needs to be an influx of resources, a massive influx.

I mean, I know pro-lifers don't want abortions to happen, but if abortions can't happen, then society needs to be changed to accommodate the needs of women and the masses of children they will  be bringing into this world. Social programs will need, likely, exponentially more funding than they receive right now, and much less reliance on private charities and donations that aren't stable/dependable enough to meet that sort of demand. A legitimate option isn't simply another word in a list, it has to be realistic and beneficial.

I can agree with #2 in principle, but I think women just need to know they're strong enough to make any sort of decision about their pregnancy, and that no matter what they choose, they'll be able to make it through.

I'll disagree with #4, because while I'm sure abortion can be mentally traumatizing/harmful to some women, I know a few who were, and remain, happy with theirs. If the ""hurts forever"" is a reference to the fact that a fetus will be aborted, and it's hurt by its life ending...well, I guess by those standards, yeah. But many don't see fetuses that way.

With #5, if the pregnancy care centres were able to provide all the resources and services Planned parenthood offers, while not being oppressively religious, then I suppose there wouldn't really be that much harm in the decison outside of there not likely being a unified group to donate to, eaning some care centres could go underfunded.

#6....there's no such thing as a ""real man"", and that's just heteronormative, IMO. Not all women looking to get abortions are heterosexual or even bisexual. They don't necessarily want or need men in their lives to love and protect them and their theoretical children. I mean, yeah, it'd be nice for friends and family to take that role, or boyfriends/fiances/husbands if they are relevant, but it's just kind of a problematic reason. Women need support from their friends, family and community. There's no need to gender this.

With #7, I'm pretty some some Planned Parenthoods offer prenatal care, but I figure there are certainly some that don't, probably depending on what state they're in. That's certainly something that needs addressing.

I have to disagree with #8, at least on a legal level. I think it'd be harmful to implement a right to life for fetuses within our current context, because society just isn't ready yet, and doesn't have the infrastructure or resources prepared to handle that sort of future in the country both short-term and long-term. That, combined with the swath of potential legal issues of women's rights during pregnancies (there are a number of cases across the years revealing how dangerous and barbaric these legal issues can be). 

BUT, all in all, I like where this group's heads and hearts are at, and at least they're seemingly interested in dialogue about ""If not abortion, then what?"".",8,t3_261x8f
20140520145253,bananapajama,"Brave post, shafonfa. :P

Some of these make some really good points. While I dislike the ""non-violent"" phrase as word choice, I agree about the sentiments behind #1-3 + #7. I think most other pro-choice women would also agree that we absolutely need affordable pre-natal and peri-natal care for women, and particularly both medical and psychological care. If you've got the choice between inexpensive abortion and expensive no-support pregnancy / adoption, it barely even registers as a choice. 

I personally would take issue with #5, because pregnancy care centers  don't necessarily seem to provide many of the other services that PP provides, including pro-life friendly options like birth control, STD testing and gyno exams. I'm not familiar with the strict definition of pregnancy care centers, so please let me know if I've got a misconception.

I also find #6 to be distasteful in the same way that the ""real women"" phrase leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

#4 also seems to contradict many of the posts I've seen. Some women never think again about their abortion, other women do find the memory quite painful. Others fall somewhere in between.",7,t3_261x8f
20140520151341,shafonfa,"Yep, I expected #4 to be seen as problematic. Ah well, nothing is perfect. You're absolutely right, a negative or painful after-experience is not universal for every woman.

Pregnancy centers are loosely defined. There is one in my area that is wonderful-- it's run by a faith based group, but they give free prenatal care, ultrasounds, and counseling to women who need it. They do inform women about abortion, even though they don't offer it at their facility. But I know many pregnancy centers are not so thorough as to offer actual care, and can be downright manipulative as well. I wish the term was better regulated... Similar to how the word ""Realtor"" can only be used by licensed Realtors, maybe ""pregnancy centers"" could be evaluated and given the title only if they're up-front and not manipulative of women.

20140520113806,shafonfa,">I knew a dozen girls in high school who dated guys in their 20s and I feel like most girls tend to be more attracted to 30-year-old than 17-year-old celebrity.

More often than not, these sorts of relationships are predatory. Not saying a legit healthy relationship is *impossible* between, say a 15 year old and a 22 year old or something... But generally speaking, what would anyone in their 20's see as attractive in a high schooler, apart from easy manipulation?

How old are you, by the way? When I was a high schooler, I didn't see it as quite so creepy. Now I get it, though. ",3,t3_261hpg

I can only base this on my own experience but looking back, I have always acted like a grown up, but I knew nothing about life at 16, that's just too, too young.   And Europe, well, I went to study abroad there for a semester and I left my heart there, but their age of consent is bad judgement in my opinion.  


Being that according to what I have read, the brain won't be fully developed until a person is in their 20s, I don't think it should be 16 at all. Now, this could be wrong, I don't have the source, but I have read reports that the part of the teen brain that's not yet fully developed is the frontal lobe, the part dealing with judgement, impulse control, judgment, and emotional control. So when teenagers engage in risky behavior, it's not just that they don't have enough experience to know better, but their brains can't fully understand the consequences yet.

So, in my opinion the risk v benefit ratio is outweighed by the danger of exposing teenagers to circumstances they're not fully prepared to deal with, be it sex, be it driving, drinking, etc.  Which reminds me how weird it is that one can drive, vote and even join the military at such a young age, but can't have a beer before the age of 21.",1,t3_261hpg
