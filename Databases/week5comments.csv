It's important to see that not all Black women are uncomfortable with the way they look and it's incredibly condescending to push these fantasies of the poor Black girl wishing she had blond hair and blue eyes. Some of us are incredibly proud of our beauty in spite of what media and society tells us, and that should be celebrated.

As usual with these kinds of posts, I'm kinda side-eying comments directing the convo to the pale girl struggle. It's cool that you can find similarities in your own experiences even if you're not Black, but being picked on in middle school for being pale is not the same as the systemic damage that colorism/shadeism inflicts on women of color. I hope people realize that.",8,t3_26379r
20140521215757,nixie_nox,"That is the problem. It is not always that someone is complementing because they think that the woman wants  to look European, but it is because she is black that she is beautiful.  I think black women are stunning, because they are black. Not despite being black, and I think often times these comments are misconstrued as the first. 

It is well known that black women are invisible in the media. 
So society is trying to make a conscious shift to make it known that black women are beautiful and they don't want them to feel invisible. Just like any civil rights movement, it is going to be awkward and slow and in small steps. But criticizing it from the getgo is going to make it halt altogether. 

But I also always see comments like yours all the time that basically sums up: "" no white girl has a right to complain"" is also counter-effective. Being discriminated against in the beauty category is not  strictly a black woman's category. And no, it doesn't stop at middle school. 

I personally suffer from rosacea, which is hereditary condition making a bright red face. It lowers self esteem, self confidence, causing sufferers to avoid social interaction. 

Right now I am watching this horrendous ad campaign from a prescription company for rosacea that is literally called rediswrong.com.

If that isn't offensive, I don't know what is.

Regarding non-viable pregnancies:  Some people out there would be happy to elect representatives who would eliminate all abortions except for those that are life threatening for the mother.  There are lots of fetal abnormalities that won't threaten the mother's life but the child, if it lives through birth, will almost certainly die soon after, and those few brief moments of life would be painful.

EDITED TO ADD:  [Here](http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf) is a very enlightening guide to the rules on abortions state-by-state.  *41 states prohibit abortions, generally except when necessary to protect the woman’s life or

Late-term abortions are performed because there is some severe abnormality with the fetus or a problem with the mother's life.

20140520164823,Lil_Boots1,"I'm very happy for you and your growing family, but I think with a little introspection you'll find your pro-choice self again. It's possible to reconcile your pregnancy and baby as a blessing with abortion being a necessary legal option for other women, even if you morally disagree with some of their choices. There are many people who are adamantly politically pro-choice who don't want or even approve of abortion from a moral standpoint. There is a pretty diverse spectrum under the pro-choice umbrella, and it's ok to fall anywhere on it or even in the pro-life category. 

To me, though, it sounds like you're currently in awe of your own miracle and it's blinding you a little bit to why it's not a miracle for everyone and why abortion should probably be a legal option whether you approve of everyone's reasons or not. Most people don't really approve of the attitude that having four or even one abortions is something women should do casually, but I don't really think that I want someone who clearly doesn't want children badly enough that she had four abortions in what sounds like a relatively short timeframe to be raising children, either. Moral disapproval of her reasons doesn't make me want to make her actions illegal because it doesn't change her underlying attitude. It just makes me want to give her access to really reliable, fool-proof birth control for as long as she wants it.

But even if you do find yourself permanently somewhere a little more conservative on the spectrum, that's ok. We all change over time, and it's more important to be honest with yourself about how your stance and beliefs are changing than to adhere to a belief system that you don't identify with anymore just because you think someone would disapprove.",21,t3_262aei

I mentioned in another reply that I definitely know many women who have had no attachment to their baby during their pregnancy, whether it was wanted or not (a lot of the times a planned pregnancy actually, they were shocked to feel...nothing), and I get that.

It's one thing to read about ""pregnancy"" in a textbook, to see ladies smuggling beach balls at the grocery store, and watch the usual 5 minute panic we see in movies, loosely depicting birth. It's quite another to experience it all for yourself. There is so much that nobody tells you, or that you really have to experience to understand. 

In early pregnancy, feeling sick, I found I really sympathized with abortion. Why on earth should a woman have to go through this involuntarily? Later, as the baby grew and started to move, the feeling changes. I'm not alone, I have a little person in there. He kicks back when I push on him. He's real, there's just this bit of flesh between him and the world. And as things grew more awkward in the last few weeks, once again, I was just looking to the prize. I get a baby at the end, so I can get through this.

And when you hold *your own*, it's hard to believe anyone wouldn't want that. Knowing what it is to hold your own newborn, it puts that much more gravity on choosing not to go through with a pregnancy. You are giving up the most wonderful feeling, the greatest love.

But then I think, how horrible if I weren't in a position to care for my kids? If I held this baby for a day and had to give her away? Or if I had no husband to support me while I cared for her, forcing me back to work? Or even, if I already had enough children, if this one would push me over the edge of sanity. If this child was not a thing to love but an incredible burden, a person so deserving of love but not getting any from its own mother because of the inopportune situation. 

Man, it's hard. We all stand somewhere on it, and I think as we become mothers, our hearts just ache all around for other women who have to make such hard decisions. .... or if they're easy decisions, the ignorance of what they're missing out on.",10,t3_262aei

He hates it if I'm not ""all there"" when we have sex, so after a lot of discussion he decided (because I'm still happy to have chore sex with him) that he'd be most comfortable if I was the only person to instigate sexual actions and if I stopped the second I started to feel like it was a chore. For example, if I feel the urge to perform oral sex on him, I do so, up to the point where I can tell I'm going to freak out (and it really is a wall, isn't it?

When the food stops, they will continue to peck at it until they pass out.  Why?  Because maybe the next try will give it food.  

As has been said earlier, abusive relationships start out great and slowly eat away at the victim's self-esteem over time.  Also, they aren't bad all the time and the bad times are blamed on the victim.  Positive and negative reinforcement is given randomly.  It keeps the person off balance.  ""If only I didn't do ____, things would be good.""  ""If only I did ___, things would be good.""  Except navigating the chaos and predicting reactions is actually impossible.  So effort and emotional energy is spent navigating the minefield, that there isn't anything else left to step back and look at it objectively.

Disagree...I've always thought it must be terrifying to be a guy in that you can't really know for sure if you have a kid out there somewhere or if someone you slept with got pregnant.  Of course a kid out there would be a much bigger deal (in terms of affecting someone's life) than an abortion, but I nevertheless think since that entity is half his, he has a right to know.  This definitely does not supersede her right to be safe and like I said, if this is her concern, she should absolutely not tell him.  Still, many people seem to be saying ""just don't bother to tell him, it makes absolutely no difference"" and I disagree.  I think he has a right to know and I would want to know if I were in the same situation.  In a similar vein, I've always thought I'd want to know if someone was cheating on me, even if it was in the past.  I think it'd my choice to use/mull over that info as I choose and this guy should have the same right to deal with her getting an abortion instead of not being given the opportunity to know.

don't tell him: nothing happens.

To me, lying about birth control and then not telling him about the pregnancy is doing two wrong things to him, just because he was ignorant of what happened doesn't make it ok.  People can and should think about their safety and obviously everyone is going to decide this on an individual basis, but I think people should also keep in mind (as long as they feel reasonably safe to do so) people have a right to know if their actions resulted in a pregnancy and/or abortion.

She seemed to be a booth person that was involved with the company in a meaningful capacity of some sort that maybe didn't extend to coding, or not primarily coding. It seemed like her contributions might have been more marketing, since she wrote all her company's tweets. So maybe a little bit more like Jared than Dinesh.

It seemed like an overly contrived plot, which didn't have much pay off in terms of character development or humour, so on that level I wasn't so impressed. (We've already gotten cringe-he's-so-awkward-with-women humour last episode (or the one before that?) with Gilfoyle's gf and this one wasn't anything new, excluding the ""you're attracted to my code"" line.)

It would be nice to have a female engineer/programmer get mixed in, but it would be important to avoid tokenism. 

The women to date have largely been objects of sexual desire. Gilfoyle's gf as Dinesh's object of desire. The TechCrunch Judge's wife (or wives, although one is only mentioned) as Erlich's object of desire. Blonde programmer with pink hair as Dinesh's object of desire. Women who thinks Richard is obsessed with her, whose only characteristics seem to be a sympathy to gay polyarmous people and use as a potential object of desire. The stripper. Are there any more women?

>In the Q & A, one of the first audience questions came from a woman who asked whether the show planned to feature any female engineers among its characters. It was clearly a query the show’s writers and cast were anticipating. (At SXSW, nearly every panel or Q & A I sat in on had some version of this question, including Mindy Kaling’s.) Miller tried to make a joke of it, mentioning how few women are present in the real life Silicon Valley, but it fell flat and sounded less like a bit than a defensive posture. It’s also not entirely accurate, as women comprised 50% of SXSW Interactive’s attendees this year. Judge answered more simply. “Yes. We’ve talked about it. We’re only two episodes in, give us a couple more.” Fair enough.

I think someone's pointed this out already: the woman does not identify herself as a programmer. In her final scene she admits her company role is purely in social media. The entire point of her character was to make fun of the guys happily working for her for free. She didn't seduce them into doing it, she wasn't wearing a low-cut top, she was just a female who asked them to write code for her. I guess Dinesh no longer finding her attractive when he accepts that she's not a programmer is kind of a good message? If we're going to get analytical about it.

The majority of the women in the show so far have been props for the 'computer guys are so awkward/clueless around women' stereotype. Like awkwardly avoiding the stripper, or how every party they go to they say something along the lines of ""dude, there's like 12 women here"", and then all look terrified/delighted. Monica has been boss, and I hope they never develop a romantic entanglement between her and Richard, because I can kind of see that coming and it would be so blah.

I can't see 'Silicon Valley' ever being a show with a strong feminist message. But it's also not entirely sexist crap. Sure there's only one regular female character so far, but she has so far been shown as the most competent and together character out of all of them, and her looks have not been a factor. So I don't feel bad about the show just yet.

[Between 32-38%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States#Reasons_for_abortions) of abortions are because women are either not ready for a child or have already had all the children they want to have. You're not alone in this.

Consider talking to your doctor about longer-term birth control options, like male or female sterilizations, regardless of the choice you make.",6,t3_262jt4
20140520204642,y_x_n,"You and your family will be okay, don't beat yourself up about it, it's probably the effect of increased hormones and pre-abortion anxiety. I think it's better to go through with the abortion than to not be able to provide for the new baby and the rest of your kids. Your boyfriend supports you and will not hold it against you, so you shouldn't either! Focus on your current family and your 3 kids, be the best mom you can to them, and be more careful/safe in the future :)",2,t3_262jt4
20140521130153,thisismysecretgarden,"I work at a pregnancy clinic and see women facing this type of decision all the time. I would never try to convince a woman to keep a pregnancy, or sway a woman in any direction. The most important thing about this decision is that it needs to be YOURS. In order to help yourself emotionally after, you need to fully own whatever decision you make. That being said- in my experience, I have found that women who have children already and women who are unsure about having an abortion are typically the ones who regret the abortion. I have also seen that when women have abortions due to financial reasons, once they are in a better financial state, they may regret abortion. I guess they forget how hard it was financially at the time and think that they could have struggled through it.  I have heard horrible stories of how women who were in similar situations had abortions and then ended up emotionally wrecked. We even have post abortion counseling for women who are hurting from it. I also have frequently seen women getting pregnant and keeping right after having an abortion, perhaps subconsciously making up for the past abortion.  

Again- I am NOT saying that all women or even majority of women who have abortions regret them and have prolonged emotional issues after. This is only my observations in this distinct set of circumstances after seeing hundreds of women facing unplanned pregnancies. 

Bottom line- Thoroughly consider all options and imagine the effect each would have in the future, so that you may fully own any decision you make. ",2,t3_262jt4
20140520193955,AnotherAnonymousAcct,"Abortion isn't the only choice.  It may be your best choice, but none of us can fully know.  If you're not sure about having the abortion and afterwards come to regret it, it's entirely possible that a change in your mental health can have a worse impact than just another brother or sister for your kids (and the associated lower standard of living).

I strongly suggest you look into adoption.  Preferably not a random, never meet the parents and never see the kid again type adoption, but one where a couple is looking for a new baby, you get to meet them and varying levels of involvement can be had throughout the child's life.  I strongly suggest looking at Planned Parenthood's site as a quick, naive googling led to a lot of less-than-stellar anti-abortion sites ([Planned Parenthood Adoption Information](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/pregnancy/adoption-21520.htm)).

However, I'm not suggesting it saying that it's even a viable option for you.  Only you can know that, but the worst it can do is give you a more informed opinion over your final decision.

My boyfriend and myself had failed birth control....and through a lot of struggle with emotions and logical sense, we decided to go through with it.

A year ago, I was told the strings weren't visible, but they could have just shrunk up a bit inside. Since I didn't have any changes (my periods didn't start back up, etc) I didn't worry about it, because my Gyn wasn't. She did warn me that if they moved too far up they'd have to do a procedure under anesthesia to remove it, but most women this happens to they just use misoprostol and a numbing agent and can still get it out. This is just what happened. Getting the new one inserted was crampier.

- ""How do you know the bride/groom?""

- ""Don't you think bride/bridesmaids look gorgeous?""

- Talk about the decorations/location/food

- Talk about your cousin/any memories you have about her

- Ask people questions about their job/family/travel/study/children

People love talking about themselves. Old people especially love someone to chat to, so if you're feeling a bit panicky, maybe go up to one of your older relatives or anyone old and start them off with some family questions and they'll usually carry you away with chatter.

What I like to do is find a group of people and sit down with them, so that I can be ""in"" the conversation without having to contribute too heavily or lead it. If you want, you could ask your cousin to introduce you to some of the people she invited. If she doesn't, you could always just go up to people and introduce yourself as the bride's cousin, seeing as people love meeting everyone else at weddings.

20140520184206,Penguin_Dreams,"The good news is, most people are extroverts and love to talk.  If you come prepared to ask a few questions, it's pretty easy to get people started and then just nod and um-hum at appropriate intervals and if you can, comment or ask more questions about what they've just said.  Most people will happily keep talking on and think you're a wonderful conversationalist.

Is this a plated reception or a buffet?  A sit down dinner will be easier since you're seated with a table who will largely talk amongst themselves and all you have to do is sit and smile and maybe comment on how beautiful the ceremony was, or the food, or maybe some random current event topic.  Don't talk politics, but maybe scan the news for interesting headlines in case anyone else brings it up.  If it's a buffet or if there's a wine and cheese thing before dinner, grab a drink, check out the spread, remark on how lovely it is, find someone you know and just stand next to them and hold your drink or a little platter of cheese and fruit.  Smile and nod.

It's okay to duck out a little early.  Give some time, as much as you can stand, after the cake thing, and then make your goodbyes to the bride and groom.  They won't care that one person is leaving early.  They're super busy and overwhelmed and will just be happy you came and didn't cause any kind of awkward scene since you're probably a pretty quiet person.  You can do this!",3,t3_262mck

At the wedding, there's at least one thing in common, that's easy to strike up conversation about. ""Hi, I'm unfashionabull. How do you know the bride/groom?"" That can lead to other obvious questions, ""oh, you met them in college, what did you study?"" ""Oh, you work with him? What type of job do you do?"" You can talk about how you are her cousin and feel bad that you don't get to see each other often---that can develop into talking about where you live or the last time you saw her. 


Of course there is always ""Doesn't the bride look gorgeous, I love her dress/make up/hair?"" ""The ceremony was really nice"". ""They got really lucky/unfortunate with this weather"". ""The bridesmaids' dresses are nice, I like the color"". Random comments about what's going on at the wedding.....mostly positive.


Do you not have any other family going? I went to my cousin's wedding this past weekend and flew down with my dad and brother.

Java is a good language for working in teams, but it's restrictive when you first start out.  If you use Windows, a copy of Visual Studio is well worth it.  C# is basically an updated version of Java that is controlled by Microsoft.

On the Mac side, Objective-C is a good language, but it completely limits you to a Mac platform, and when things break they can be hard to fix.  Also, Objective-C is different than a lot of other languages.  C, C++, Java, C# and JavaScript have a lot of ideas in common (not counting closures in JavaScript, and the extra stuff in C#).

I know back when I was in middle and high school though we couldn't just put up posters if we felt like it, anything that anyone wanted to be posted had to be approved by administration, and then we were told where things were allowed to be posted (on a bulletin board, or teacher's door with their permission, not covering other postings, only for 2 weeks etc etc). You might have to jump through hoops like that, and it's quite possible you wouldn't get permission, on the grounds that it's disruptive or something else. That reality can really suck, but it's something they have the power to do, and frankly there isn't much you all can do to change it.

The petitions could also be deemed problematic, based on my memory of school rules. Most likely they were deemed a ""distraction"" which is probably a valid point if they were being passed around in class, that is pretty close to the same as passing notes, which I would guess isn't allowed. Even if it was just in the cafeteria, I'm sure the administration can come up with something that permits taking them away.

Going forward, you all just need to be careful about how you spread your message, and figure out what your goals are. Maybe work together (and possibly in tandem with some older people) to write an editorial for a local newspaper, or try to get a conversation started on local news. It all depends on what you want. If you want major changes that's going to take time, likely a few years. If you want some minor tweaks, or a little more consistency, that might be able to happen in a couple weeks.

Someone else mentioned parents calling, this is probably the best course for change. Taxpayers are paying for the schools and thus have a bigger voice, since none of you are likely paying taxes (or voting) your voices really don't count for anywhere near as much, it is easy for people to dismiss you all (rightfully or not) as discontent children, it isn't as easy to do that about 100 adults calling the school.

Another important thing to consider is where the dress code is set. Obviously, the staff at your school is enforcing it but they may not have any power to change it by themselves. When I was in school all our dress codes were set by the school board (over all the schools in the county), if you actually want changes in the dress code make sure you're appealing to the right people, it may not be the school administration, it might be the overseeing school board.

Are you trying to say that my views excuse us from self-control? If so, that is incorrect. Actually, it will teach us more control to not have the dress code because then we are the ones who have to decide what is and is not appropriate in society (and don't have to depend on an outside source to do so).

i think the most important thing to recognize is that there is endless room in your heart for love. just because you still love boy A does not mean that you do not also love boy B. it just means that your eyes are opened to things that boy A brought to the relationship, and because you have experience with these things you are able to miss them (you never miss what you have never experienced, and you don't regret the loss of something you have never had). 

i would suggest that you go to r/redpillwomen and learn how to be a better woman. this will give you the ability to push your guy into being more motivated and more outgoing OR it will increase your own options and allow you to find a better boy C (or even potentially get boy A back if that is what you want).

20140521094159,hadoryu,"I think one of the harshest and most important things I learned in life was that you have to look out for yourself first and foremost, because nobody else has a stronger incentive to do so.

The way you handled your previous friend is amazing and you deserve props for being so level-headed and firm in redefining your relationship. Friendship is a concept that implies mutual benefit and nobody has the right to expect or demand that you remain in a relationship that is asymmetrical in that aspect. Don't cling to friendships for the value of the concept itself and be mindful that toxic friendships will only block your way to good ones, among doing asorted other harm to your life.

You will find more and better friends if you remain open to making new friends and place yourself in an environment to meet new people. You're still quite young and I am quite confident you have many, many nice people yet to meet in your life. Don't approach friendship as a thing that you are in need of, it can only come naturally.

Most of all though, remain aware that your sense of self is something you own - you and nobody else. If you feel there is something about you to change, change it as best you can. If you feel there is something about you that is good the way it is, nobody in the world has the power to tell you otherwise.

If not, go to a doctor and ask about it. There could be nothing wrong, but sometimes chronic UTIs can be caused by structural abnormalities.

1) ALWAYS PEE AFTER SEX. This is SO important! Keep yourself well-hydrated, because if you do, then you should be able to go before and after sex. If you try, and you absolutely can't go, then hop in the shower and wash your vulva with soap and water. DO NOT douche. 

2) When you use the bathroom, always wipe front to back. If you wipe back to front, you're dragging bacteria into your urinary tract. Make sure you only wipe front to back.

3) General hygiene. Wash your vuvla with soap and water every day. Once again, this does NOT involve douching. Just make sure you're keeping those outer surfaces clean.

4) You can take cranberry pills. They help prevent UTIs, and some people find them helpful.

5) SEE A DOCTOR. Sometimes a helpful option is to go on low-dose antibiotics for a few months to prevent UTIs. I know you had a bad experience with some other antibiotic you were on, but there are a few options here. If you talk to a doctor about it, they can put you on a different antibiotic. Also, this is a *low dose* that you can take every day, or every time you have sex. The lower dose should cause fewer side effects. Some people stop having UTIs altogether after they finish this months-long course of antibiotics.

To control the IC (it has no known cure), she was put on a tricyclic antidepressant to calm her bladder.  Some home remedies included pelvic stretching and a change to her diet (every case of IC is different but things like reduce consumption of acidic food/drinks, caffeine, artificial sweeteners, alcohol).

Last year I was plagued by the same cycle of recurring UTI and yeast from the antibiotics used to treat them.

I'm not a granola girl. I believe in controlled, double blind studies and SCIENCE! But I was desperate, so I spent some time on the internet and found a few things that mitigated the side effects. I'm not saying no antibiotics, I'm only saying help your body along.

For the UTI, **D-Mannose** from the health food store made a huge difference in clearing the UTI, and also heading off a new one that was brewing (you know that feeling when it is coming). Less time on a antibiotic, less yeast. Why had I never heard of this before? I HATE cranberry juice!!!

For yeast I found the probiotics helpful, both capsules of lactobacillus and kefir. Kefir is loaded with all sorts of digestive probiotics and in addition to being a nice yogurt smoothie-type drink, helped my body recover from the wipe-out of multiple courses of antibiotics, especially my gut.

Finally, be **more proactive with your doctor. There are some conditions that mimic recurring UTI** that are not as common and may not be on your doctor's radar. A friend of mine was finally diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis after a long trial with multiple doctors who just wouldn't listen to her symptoms. Some STDs also mimic UTI.

My closest friends told me that they thought it gave me a ""cute"" character. Though my parents supported me, they said they thought I was a bit crazy for thinking it didn't look good. The doctor had told me beforehand that while he could clearly see what I was talking about, he did not think my new look would make me ""more attractive."" 

Nobody at all noticed I'd had a nose job when I came back after break. To me it was a huge change though because it had legitimately distracted me when looking in the mirror prior. I did feel better and stopped being so focused on it in the mirror and in pictures.

But I was not completely happy with the results. I had thought my new nose would give me a certain look and frankly, it didn't. The doctor promised it would look ""better"" based on my own definition of what I wanted and thought beauty was (the popular scoop nose slightly smaller which also included shaving down my hanging columellum and evening the nostril flare on both sides). The doctor said to wait a few months for things to settle and when I still wasn't happy with it, I completely understood how and why people can get obsessed with ""beauty"" and have multiple surgeries...which result of course in a ""fake""/surgeried look. To this day, I have residual nerve damage that causes a constant but now faded sense of one nostril being itchy.

Almost five years later, I was looking through pictures of myself and decided it WAS cute before the surgery; your face changes over time when your baby fat deposits go away, it just takes a different shape that results in the look you get where people start to be able to tell you are late 20s/early 30s ie an ""adult."" Now that it's almost 10 years later, I wish I hadn't messed with it until I knew what my adult face would eventually look like. Mostly because everyone's face IS uneven and it's just part of their charm. I comfort myself hoping that perhaps it won't eventually grow quite as large as it would have as I age (your nose and ear cartilage never stops growing).

You might legitimately be able to get yourself up a point on the 1-10 hotness factor. Maybe you can understand this, but attractiveness can be almost 100% the person's attitude, style, and this includes they way they hold their facial features to represent how they feel which is mostly something you can control. This is because the way you make other people feel based on the vibe they get from you has a huge impact on how they judge your look. For instance, you can make a drastic change to your regular facial expression just by being mindful holding your eyebrows, cheeks, mouth and jaw in a certain position until you change the tone of your muscles (eg people who always look grumpy, nervous or ready to fight vs those who look like they just smelled some roses and see a rainbow ahead). You can think of it as acting until you get a new look. I did this myself to try to stop my brows from furrowing as I realized at one point I was getting a crease between them. I also changed the way my smile looks through practice.

I'm sorry you weren't completely happy with the results. This is my main concern as well. You said in another comment that I should look at before and after photos and I have done just that! I save pictures of noses that are similar to mine and pictures of after results that are either what I'm going for or that are too much for me. I'm trying to be very realistic. I also found a picture of a nose that is just like mine and that my surgeon did and I really love how it turned out. Of course I'm still going to ask for more photos and make it clear that I don't want a big change. 

I do have a little baby fat in my face but I seriously fear that years are only going to make my situation worse. My nose has already grown a lot and my face is most likely going to slim down too. I do not have a cute nose and I'm certain it's not just in my head. I actually think that larger ethnic noses look gorgeous but I'm Scandinavian and we usually have those cute noses but mine is really off and it ages me horribly. My friends haven't said anything either because well, this is the way I look and they love me for who I am. Just like I don't see flaws in my friends.

My main concern is that the change will be too big although the surgeon that would be doing my nose is known for not cutting too much!

It's totally fair for you to have priorities and boundaries for your relationships, and if you're expressing them at the beginning (and reiterating them), then your partner should know what's expected of them. If they then begin making romantic advances, they've breached the contract - kick 'em to the curb.

On the other hand, what's not fair is to demand that they don't have emotions about you. If they become more enamoured than they expected, that's not their fault. If they begin to express that to you, they're over the line - but they can't help feeling how they feel. And sure, maybe you can HOPE that someday someone will be honest with you about having that feeling, and be the one to do the splitting up, but that's really unrealistic. If someone is romantically attracted to you, and you've said you want to keep it strictly sexual, _of course_ they're going to be afraid to bring it up to you - they don't want to lose the connection you DO have.

Overall, if you don't want to be ""deceptive,"" you should make sure you're not sending them any confusing signals with your behavior. But in my opinion, the type of relationship you're looking for is extremely rare. The ""fuck buddy"" set up rarely leaves both parties satisfied. Someone almost always gets hurt in the end.

Not necessarily. As you yourself noted, this ""intimate"" act exposes a side that people don't usually get to see. Since perceptions vary, people experience it differently.

As things are over, I'd suggest you to try and not make this mistake weigh more than it should.

Make the morality of your sexual behaviour from now on more important than just the absence of physical virginity. There is no reason to change yourself just because things went wrong once.

As for the lack of consent: There are two ways of showing acceptance, namely verbal and via gestures.

In my relationship, for one, we don't ask each other whether we want to, but once we position ourselves accordingly, we rely on body language to see whether the other is willing.

The truth is: if a guy asks that every woman, he is most likely tp never have sex again. Women dont like to be asked like that... yeah feminists, vote me down, but its the truth and any guy who has slept with a hand full if women can confirm.",1,t3_263uey

20140521135007,praeth,"Then US law and I don't agree. The wording in your cited paragraph fixates too much on verbal expression, even though much of communication does not involve verbal cues. (eg. the ""freezing"" you describe in my eyes equals non-verbal refusal, which would - in a hypothetical scenario - in my opinion make it rape, even if she said yes. if we were to judge by your word-focused standards, this wouldn't be rape as long as she said yes, and he acted on this verbal expression - still assuming both were inebriated.)

In any case, I am still confident that my point is valid. I sadly can't argue with you if you claim that her being drunk left her too confused to react, but his being drunk didn't leave him too confused to understand that body language supposedly doesn't mean anything. 

You cited:
> the misdemeanor charge applies to ""whoever engages in a sexual act or sexual contact with another person and who should have knowledge or reason to know that the act was committed without that other person's permission.""

That's the very point I've been doubtful of all along, and I said so. I even made it my main point in this whole discussion. He knew beforehand, but maybe didn't know at that moment. She knew beforehand, but did not know at that moment. 
We're moving in circles, and as long as you refuse to even consider he might have been drunk enough to not remember her previous statements, there is no way to have a sensible discussion. (""He might have been..."" - ""No, he wasn't, he knew!""... Neither of us can say for sure.) I've all the way been stating, that, IF he didn't remember, and IF he was drunk enough so that reason and knowledge weren't given anymore, his actions couldn't be his responsibility alone. In that case, and in that case only. If you refuse the possibility that this case occured, there is nothing more to say.

Yes, you may have had a penis in your vagina, but you didn't really have sex. Virginity is more of a mental thing, being that some women consider oral sex losing it, and some will have anal sex and still consider themselves a virgin. Many virgins who are raped still consider themselves virgin. Some women break their hymen horseback riding.  Sex is much more than the physical act of a penis in a vagina. So whether or not you were raped, you weren't having sex. You seem very upset at yourself. Go easier on yourself. If you want to consider yourself a virgin, you can. Who cares what anyone else thinks. 

I lost my virginity after waiting until my 20s to a drunk one night stand. I don't believe I was raped because I was well aware of what I was doing even though I was drunk. But I did have some feelings of regret and felt like- well I'm not a virgin anymore, might as well sleep with anyone who wants me. I was depressed.

20140521194722,baby_lawn,"Depends. Depends on what your issues are, what kind of therapy you go to, how much you want to get out of it and how much you believe you can get out of it. most important is finding the best therapist for your needs. I went through a blend of specialized therapies that are ""teaching therapies"" (half therapy half class): dialectical behavior therapy, rational emotive behavior therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. I learned actual skills, like how to manage harmful emotions ( big one for me is rage) in a healthy way and how to communicate properly and effectively. I unlearned a lot of things too, which was very difficult, like how to dwindle my negative self-talk. 

If you are lucky, you are taught these things growing up and learn them from competent parents or other guardians. A lot of people are not, and struggle throughout their whole lives without knowing that they don't have to, or develop negative coping mechanisms for life in general such as drug abuse, eating disorders (includes overeating and binge eating which is very prevalent), cutting, building a wall and becoming emotionless, etc. ",6,t3_264spk

My mom encouraged me to see a therapist when I felt kind of depressed, but she never forced me. Did you have to force your daughter to go/drive her yourself? How did she feel after the first session? Did she feel it helped/wanted to go back? Or did you make her stick through a few before she started to see the benefit?

I went, of my own accord, but only once or twice and didn't see any benefit. I felt the therapist was poking at all the wrong things. Not sure if I didn't give it a proper chance, or there was really nothing the therapists could do for me.",9,t3_264spk
20140521214016,angelbyday,"I never forced her. She has an older sister with aspergers and saw how much therapy helped her sister's social skills and general anxiety. 

The first few sessions, my daughter got angry and numerous times told me therapy was useless, but went back to humor me, and because I make our therapy days into little events out together, so we'll stop in a park for a picnic after our session, or grab a cup of coffee and chit-chat before we go in, or occasionally take the entire afternoon to go window shopping after we're through (usually after a tougher session).

Now that she sees the benefits, my daughter can go by herself if something happens that I can't make it, but she prefers me to go along, since it's turned into our special time.

I'd give therapy another chance. It took a few months to really see some changes, and there have been times where I feel like it's hit a plateau, or she's sliding back a little, but the overall progress has been amazing.",34,t3_264spk

I had difficulty making friends when I was moved across the country from California to Ohio my sophomore year (my grandparents moved back there to buy my maternal great grandpa's house/farm since he was too physically ill to stay there. Everyone wanted the house to stay in the family), and my mom made special days like that for us every week. I always looked forward to it since the kids at my new school were mostly really conservative and we just didn't mesh. I did make a best friend and some others within the first couple months of moving (non conservative ones who were mostly transplants as well), but she and they got distant for part of my junior year because some people thought I was too weird and uncool or some bullshit. We ended up figuring out that one girl just felt threatened by me-she wanted to be the ""original, artsy, indie music girl"" in our grade, but she was really extremely conventional in every way. She got pissed when I won ""most original"" for senior superlatives the next year. High school is stupid sometimes, right? I'm glad to be a decade past. Anyway, they all apologized for sort of ditching me by our senior year, but my mom and I continued our once a week ritual, it was great.

20140521140712,tehcharizard,"The high school I went to had a dress code. It was... really not the big deal it's made out to be online. Skirts had to be ""fingertip length"", no spaghetti straps, no obscene language printed on shirts, etc. It was practical and nobody made a fuss. It was enforced evenly across the board- I remember a few guys being made to change their shirts for the strap rule.",15,t3_264kev
20140521120623,Sugarcomet,"As someone who wore a uniform (as many schools in Ireland do) our dress codes were strictly enforced. I feel that it has little to do with body shaming and more to teach teenagers how to dress for certain situations. As an adult if your place of work is ""professional attire"" you cannot go into work in an item of clothing that is not appropriate. I think it's a good thing to teach young adults what is and isn't appropriate for professional situations and in my opinion school is a professional situation. We had rules about your skirt hitting your knee, your socks being certain lengths (below your knee or just above your knee, had to be navy in colour) or your tights being navy and a wool material (not sheer). We were taught that if we didn't follow these rules we would be made go home and change or we would get detention or get in trouble. It didn't matter if the rules were ""fair"" or not, we were in an institution of learning and as such we must dress professionally. Outside of school a lot of the clothes I wore would have been in no way appropriate for a professional environment (because I got very large breasts very early on and didn't know how to dress for them). 

I went to an all girls school as well just to explain my experience. We were never told to roll our skirts back down to just above our knees because it would cause our male classmates to stare or to be distracted (as we had no male classmates). We were told to roll them down because the dress code says they must be below the knee and rules are rules. You would know which teachers would let you away with it and which teachers would make you kneel on the floor to show that your skirt did touch the ground (which would mean it was at your knee). 

In my opinion if you want to have a dress code you should have a uniform. It means that teachers have concrete things to mention of your clothes are inappropriate. When the dress code in my school was broken it was never because someone was wearing something ""too sexy"" it was because it was the incorrect length, incorrect colour or not allowed to be worn. It gets rid of the view that someone with a small chest can get away with wearing X and someone with a large chest not getting away with wearing X because everyone is uniform! There are always arguments about dress codes but I feel having a uniform gets rid of a HUGE amount of the idea of body shaming in regards to dress codes. I also say this as someone who hated her uniform because it didn't look nice. As an adult working in a professional industry now I think it was a great thing to wear and a great lesson to learn.",64,t3_264kev
20140521195144,sericatus,"I think it's obvious that if dress codes are teaching women top brew ashamed of their body, this happens in  work place as well (you've learned to internalize  accept that shame as something that's made you successful.), and that school uniforms are only making things worse, as they're just a really strict dress code.",0,t3_264kev
20140522031532,Sugarcomet,"I don't agree with you at all. If I'm in my place of work they don't care about me being ashamed of my body. They care about me looking professional if I'm dealing with clients. If I wear something lowcut because wearing high collar things makes my chest look bad and a client complains that I was dressed not professionally my company isn't going to care one bit about me being ""shamed of my body"". They're going to care that a client felt I wasn't dressing professionally and I could be fired over it. That's the real world I'm afraid.

20140522090320,Sugarcomet,"I believe that how dress codes are implemented by staff members in schools can make women feel ashamed about their bodies. I don't agree that dress codes themselves can shame women. Saying that you must dress a certain way to look professional is fine and is teaching women what it is like working in a professional environment. Telling women that you can't wear x,y or z because it will ""distract boys"" is what teaches them to be ashamed. It's not the dress code itself that's the problem (in my opinion) it's the reasoning behind it.

",3,t3_264kev
20140522092305,sericatus,"OK, but that reasoning is the exact same in both cases: in work and school, there is a need to dress professionally.

The idea that it distracts boys is just one small example of the bias the author of this article includes.",2,t3_264kev
20140522093153,Sugarcomet,"Dress codes exist to give guidelines on what will not look professional (once again in my opinion).

I'm a rather large chested woman. I know the pain of trying to find shirts that close and don't show cleavage and trying to find professional attire that doesn't make me look like a bad halloween costume of a sexy librarian. One of the other bias the author includes is how a girl with a large chest will be called out as looking inappropriate in a piece of clothing and a girl with a small chest will not. That makes sense. I can't wear very fitted shirts because I look like a porn star, which doesn't look professional. Many of my female coworkers can wear fitted shirts and they look lovely on them and professional. You do need to dress for your body type because something that looks fine on one woman can look completely inappropriate on you. That's how bodies work.

Saying that though the whole prom thing is crazy. In my school when we had prom we could wear whatever we wanted. There were no dress codes and trust me after years of uniforms low cut dresses and short skirt were everywhere!",3,t3_264kev
20140522095545,sericatus,"The aithor of this article could just as easily say

According to employers, women's outfits – their bodies, really – are too distracting for men to be expected to comport themselves with dignity and respect. 

The workplace and the school are the same on this regard. There is a need to dress professionally, and that specifically means not wearing clothes that reveal or emphasize ones body. Some might say this is to prevent distraction. Some might think there are other reasons for it.

20140522100625,Sugarcomet,"I'm sorry I actually think we agree! I think dress codes are great and there is a need in both schools and workplaces to dress professional and I don't believe most articles when authors write things like ""the girl was told to go home and change because her outfit 'distracted boys' or that the girls outfit was 'too sexy'"". A teacher or principle wouldn't say that because they can get sued. I agree with you that workplaces and schools have a need for people to dress professionally and that the authors writing is actually quite biased. I don't think women should be ashamed of their bodies but I don't think dress codes cause that. Articles like this with rather biased writing also teach young women (who read articles like this) that dress codes are criticising their bodies and that when a teacher says that they're dressing inappropriately that they should be ashamed. In reality the teacher simply means that the girl is not dressed appropriately for a professional setting and the dress code is teacher young people what is and is not appropriate to wear in a professional setting.

How often do I see high schoolers walking around my town and I say to myself ""her shorts are way too short"" or ""I can see her whole stomach!?""  The problem with kids is you give them an inch they take a mile. You say ok skirts to the knees are ok and people show up with skirts a little above the knee and then shorter and shorter until the school has to say no more skirts only jeans allowed now. It sucks that our society has certain norms that are expected but I think kids need to learn them early so they know what is appropriate.

Schools with uniforms make it easier to prevent stabbings and shootings and beatings that come from students who go to other schools, which is more or less analogous to the safety reasons they're required in chemical plants and mines where I'm from. They make it easier to prevent gang violence by eliminating ways to display colors. They provide a great equalizer in a country where there's a huge gap between the rich and the poor. They do in fact serve a purpose in public schools, at least in places when there are serious security concerns which anymore is every school in the US. Keep in mind that we don't have the same culture that they have in places like Scandinavia. Even with a dress code, we had kids in middle school wearing shirts with naked women and racist slang on them. It was offensive and disruptive to have them in class, and it was disruptive but necessary to remove them. A uniform would solve that problem.

As for stifling creativity, there are so many other outlets for creativity, from hairstyle to painting and diagrams and playing at recess and decorating notebooks and binders and singing and playing instruments and doing some of the creative reports we had to do that involved mock trials and play acting and dioramas. And then there's all the time that kids spend not in school where they can dress however they want and explore that outlet for creativity. It's not necessary to make schools less safe and to increase bullying and to open students up to incredibly sexist and racist propaganda to prevent stifling creativity. Uniforms are the best option we have to deal with all of those things, and we have many other options to allow creativity in school and they still have fashion to express themselves outside of school.

Then it sounds like your uniforms were poorly chosen and the policy was poorly enforced. Places with good uniform policies don't have the expensive but cheaply made problems or the problems of insufficient outerwear. My boyfriend wore a uniform all through school and he loved it, as did all the people I've met from his alma mater. They had a choice of corduroy pants or plaid skirts, plain button downs with no logos, and ties for the boys. It wasn't the prettiest uniform, but it was simple and practical, could be cheap especially if you bought used, and it was enforced pretty strictly for everyone. 

When uniforms are done well, they're excellent, and just because you had a shitty experience doesn't mean uniforms in general suck.

I decided to go the public school route with fashion anarchy, and while sometimes it really sucked, at least I could buy things that didn't make me look tremendously heinous, or made me feel physically ill.

Besides, while useful at times, uniforms don't fix everything. My friends at the catholic school had to adhere to the uniforms, but jewelry, makeup, hair, and phones (along with bodies that could fit into the uniforms well) became the ways of attaining status instead of clothing, which aren't really much better, as they still included body, class and gender policing. There's always a hierarchy like that, and I've never really understood the idea that uniforms fight that effectively. Is it effective for somewhat leaning what culturally appropriate clothing is for when they graduate into the workforce? Sure, but that's about it, from my vantage point. But if people are going to implement them, there should be a number of acceptable options per article of clothing for students, to ensure some flexibility.",2,t3_264kev

The junior cycle one was the good old shirt, loose jumper and tartan skirt with knee socks combo. The senior cycle one was pinafores which were actually cut properly with socks, shirt and jumper. The junior one was green, senior one was blue. The senior one was far more mature looking and actually looked good on more mature bodies.

There are many places that sell button downs and navy blue corduroys, which means there were many options, and you could have your button down taken in or whatever you needed. My SO is not an average sized man, and as high schoolers, he and his brother were both over 6'5"" and under 180 pounds. They were tall and lanky and awkward looking, but they could buy whatever size they needed from wherever they wanted as long as it didn't have a logo on it or the logo could be taken off.

20140521222940,PornTrollio,"I hope you don't consider my opinion as one of the ones you mention from men, but here goes:

High school age boys can and will sexualize a woman regardless of attire.  All the girls could be wearing LDS style dresses and it would not matter to their hormones.  Consider the excitement an exposed calf aroused in Victorian times...  Point being:  adolescent males will be 'distracted' by girls no matter what the girls wear and adolescent girls will be, likewise, 'distracted' by boys despite the boys not wearing short shorts or showing midriff.  

(I think the stated goal of 'preventing young boys from being distracted""  is a poor way of phrasing a more difficult to describe idea than it is a case of blatant sexism.)

Many high school girls recognize this attention and dress in a way to generate it.  They are not innocent bystanders in all cases.  In my highschool years the girls who regularly got in trouble for breaking dress code with 'slutty' wardrobes did it specifically for attention.  (Two that I knew very well got this desire for sexual attention from being abused sexually, but this is not going to always be the case, of course, plenty of kids just do shit to get attention for attention's sake.)

Young men and women alike do not need to place such value on sexualizing themselves for attention.  Their time being educated in adolescence is a good time to try to enforce that this is a negative behavior.  (Every other form of media they are receiving is telling them the exact opposite, might as well attempt to give them the voice of reason and maturity.)

The dress codes prevent girls in this instance from seeking this attention with their bodies and the boys from giving it.  Both sexes are distracted/distracting each other in a situation where they should be focused on learning.

As a side thought, which do you think does more to promote negative body image in young women:  Pictures of scantily clad and idealized/sexualized women in magazines and tv?  Or the few very attractive peers in high school who 'dress slutty' receiving a great deal of attention from young boys for it?

I would guess that they more readily compare themselves against their peers than some person in a television show, and see the attention those girls get from the boys that they personally know (or maybe have a crush on) by showing of their 'perfect' bodies. (this makes sense to me, but I have never been an adolescent female so feel free to correct me here.)

Last week, she calls all the female students to the auditorium. While we have uniforms (white top, black bottoms) many of the students blatantly disregard with no consequences. With the rising heat, our female students had begun to dress in way that was a bit too revealing for an educational institution.

It should be unisex and practical and in my opinion it should be at about the level of many entry-level or minimum wage jobs, since the goal of school should be to prepare students for the working world. 

So to me, that means that it's ok for a school to say that holes in your jeans and micro mini skirts and workout clothes and crop tops are not appropriate for this setting. It should not be stated as too sexy or too distracting for other students, just as too unprofessional for a school environment. It is important to learn how to dress appropriately for a situation if you're going to thrive in modern society and especially the modern workforce, so I don't have a problem with having a dress code or, better yet, uniforms. I do have a problem with how they're often enforced in a slut-shaming way.",15,t3_264kev

20140522132753,exposure_therapy,"Update to my earlier comment: [Here's](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/05/22/buyer-beware-can-trust-cheap-plan-b-one-step-amazon-com/?utm_source=nar.al&utm_medium=urlshortener&utm_campaign=FB) an article that was just posted by NARAL. Basically, the argument comes down to this:

> It is normal for prices to vary from store to store, but such a steep drop in price raises red flags, especially since the wholesale acquisition cost (the cost for wholesalers to purchase the product from the manufacturer, Teva Women’s Health) is estimated to be $32.50 for Plan B One-Step. Wholesalers then sell the product for an estimated $39.00. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that any Amazon.com vendor would be able to acquire Plan B One-Step wholesale and sell it for $16 without taking a substantial financial hit.

Of the different Amazon sellers investigated by the articles' authors, Pharmacy Consultants seemed the most cooperative/forthcoming with information:

>Another vendor, who operates under the name Pharmacy Consultants and sells Plan B One-Step for $16.90, replied to RHTP’s requests stating that he was a licensed pharmacist and was able to sell the product at a deep discount because of a wholesale supplier, although this information is not available on the seller page. When asked about his credentials, the vendor replied that he was a licensed pharmacist in Ohio. He was clear to note that his product “is not from [a] family planning clinic or shop lifted medication.” One review noted that the product’s box arrived opened, the foil encasing the pill was ripped, and the pill was cut in half. After the reviewer notified the seller, he sent her a new package immediately. Another reviewer noted that the product they received was close to being expired.

Still not sure what to think, since the package I received had been opened, but it seems that this was done to add an anti-theft sticker, and the pill itself didn't appear to be tampered with.

One thing that I read in the article that I wasn't aware of before: **apparently thanks to the ACA, if you have health insurance, emergency contraception should be covered, just like any other oral contraception.** I just logged in to my insurance plan's website, and ran it through the ""drug cost estimator"" - it checks out! Apparently I wasted $60 at CVS *and* $20 on Amazon, because my copay would have been $0 if I had used my insurance card! ",1,t3_264xoa
20140521173719,exposure_therapy,"Do you have a link for that? 

I bought Plan B via Pharmacy Consultants (the company mentioned in the article) on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EIQUH5A/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) last month. It arrived in two days, and appears to be the genuine product. It looks exactly the same as the box I saw in CVS.

I also just searched the NARAL website, and can't find any mention of it being a scam...",3,t3_264xoa
20140521204742,VandyGirl,"The post is still up on their Facebook page but they haven't said anything more about it. I think there are legit cheap sellers of it on amazon- people just need to be careful they're buying from legitimate sellers. ",4,t3_264xoa
20140522091719,exposure_therapy,"Thanks! I'm now following the discussion on their facebook page.

Now I'm not sure what to think. I haven't actually taken mine yet - I used it once before after a condom broke, and when I saw it advertised at such a great price on Amazon, I decided to buy one to keep on hand in case it ever happens again. This box looks exactly the same as the one I bought at CVS. However, I just went and opened the plastic tamper-proof packaging, and the weird thing is that the cardboard ""tear here to open"" strip on the actual cardboard box is *already torn* (it was impossible to tell when it was still in the plastic packaging). However, the blister-pack containing the pill (as well as the part of the box that surrounds the blister pack) are in perfect condition - so even if someone did open the box, it doesn't look like the pill itself has been tampered with or replaced.

This seems kind of fishy, but I'm not quite ready to throw it out until I get more information. (So far NARAL hasn't cited a source, but says the info came from their ""allies."")

On the Amazon page, there's a review by someone who received a box that had clearly been tampered with, got it replaced through Amazon, and is encouraging others to buy only from Pharmacy Consultants. That makes me think there were *other* Amazon sellers that were selling fake pills, Amazon got rid of them, and now the only seller that's left is Pharmacy Consultants - and even if they *are* legit, those reviews for the other sellers are still there, confusing potential customers (since Amazon attaches the reviews to the product, rather than the seller).

There are other Amazon reviews (as well as posts on NARAL's facebook page) from women who say that they bought it from Pharmacy Consultants/Amazon, and took it, and it seems to have worked (they're not pregnant, at least). So some facebook commenters are suggesting that the reports of a scam are just confusion from that one Amazon review, and others are suggesting that anti-choicers are spreading *rumors* that it's a scam, to stop women from buying it!

In any case, if I have reason to take Plan B before NARAL posts an update, I won't be taking this one. However, I'm going to hold on to it for now, in the hopes that it gets proven to be legit.

EDIT: Inside the the cardboard box, there were two anti-theft stickers (the kind that set alarms off if you try to steal something from a store) - so if the Amazon seller also had these in a brick-and-mortar store, that would explain why the box had been opened. That's the only reason why I'm not panicked about the box being open.

> after reading this subreddit I am beginning to think that I should take issue with this

If you didn't have issue with something before, don't let a bunch of other people in different situations make you ""think you should take issue"" with anything. 


Anywho, if it hurts you, talk to him about it. He seems pretty sensible but also pretty down to earth. I joke with my GF all the time, though she thinks women are pretty too, so we can commiserate about the cute blonde that walks by and how we wish her shorts were a bit shorter, etc. We watch tv shows and talk about which one of us gets which girl - but at the same time, I would be comfortable with her joking about sleeping with guys too (rare, but she does come out with the occasional ""oh I would tear his clothes off"" or similar) 

The ""joking"" about friends thing is where the line gets crossed for me. Because I know there are many of my GFs friends that I find cute and would be interested in if I were single. I just don't let myself get to that point because she IS the only person I am interested in, and having cheated on past ex's, I recognize the pattern and do not ever want to step foot on that path again. 

But in the end, it's up to you two to discuss, maybe he doesn't have a filter for when he should and shouldn't joke about good looking women. Maybe he is a cheater. Maybe he is devoted to you and just likes to joke around. If you aren't happy, talk to him. It is possible for two people to be great, but not great together. I do know, though, that I'm definitely using that line later tonight while I'm working and my GF comes out to bug me while I'm elbow deep inside my computer chassis ;-) ",-5,t3_264cwr

You should perhaps read up on the psychology of abusers and abuse victims. 

There are people who have been brutally raped and beaten by lovers and family members and who don't think it's wrong because they've never heard anyone say it's wrong.

I will agree that if they have had a serious talk about it and it hasn't changed, that there is an issue - but again, I completely disagree that it is a specific person's fault. It is a compatibility issue (if he is genuinely not serious about sleeping with another woman).

I just want to take a moment to clarify that all relationships are different because this felt like a very narrow view of relationships. Not all of them are 50/50 or even 30/70. Relationships work when the give and take is equal to what both parties want and it makes them happy.

It honestly made me feel disposable, like as soon as another girl became available I would be dumped for him to chase after her (and I was!).

When I found my new bf though it was like night and day. He is SO respectful about that.

Leave him.
I don't believe you are truly happy together. (Your username says sad girlfriend in it) If you were both happy, this thread wouldn't exist. 

I think because you have some happy times together, it overshadows his bad behavior. Just because he gave you some happy moments here and there, doesn't excuse his emotional abuse. 

I think people hold onto abusive relationships because they focus on the good times, and the fact the good times happen fewer, they are more cherished and thought about, as compared to a partner that will give them more good times than bad. 

Telling women their place isn't my idea of a joke.

Example, typical bad boy who cheats on his gf, hits on her friends, etc, but one day he picks a nice flower and gives it to his gf. That one time overshadows the bad things he has done, because this seems so great in comparison to his usual behavior. 

There are people out there who will make you happy and also not feel the need to tell you about their desires to sleep with your friends.

No you aren't. You have happy moments, and other moments where he hurts you immensely by saying these things. Even the worst abusive relationships have their 'we are so happy' moments.

The fact that he knows this hurts you and he continues to do it is something you need to think long and hard about. If you knew jokingly telling him he was fat or his penis is small would upset him and wreck his self-esteem, would you continue to do it? No, you wouldn't, because that would be cruel. So why are you giving him a pass on this and making it the 'I'm so happy, except for....' in your relationship?

No relationship is perfect, but the 'except for...' should never be a huge red flag for abuse. I have an incredibly happy marriage 'except for' the fact that my husband pulls clothes out and leaves them on top of the dryer and it drives me bananas. When your 'except for...' is such a bad thing that you have to make up a throwaway to even ask the question, it's time to take a very honest look at whether or not you want to be treated this way for the rest of your life.

Of course we should always talk to our partners about this stuff, so that's the first obvious suggestion. Talk to this guy. You've been together 7 months, he has to have some great qualities. But a dude who makes bold statements and then hides behind the idea that it was all a joke is at best not good at relationships with humans or at worst slimey and cruel. Tell him how you feel.

This guy sounds like a jerk who is really good at camoflauging it. His ""jokes"" don't sound like jokes to me. He's trying to dominate you in a way that seems playful so you won't pick up on it and get defensive. I get the feeling that it'll only get worse as he ages. 

Also, constantly talking about sleeping with other women? That's just plain disrespectful. I mean, human nature is to look around and admire/lust for other attractive people. It would be suspect if he never expressed any indication that he found someone attractive. I mean, I know my boyfriend appreciates a good rack and as long as he's discrete, I don't mind him looking. But he's never mentioned a desire to sleep with another woman, let alone said it repeatedly and in front of other people. 

The way I see it you have two choices:

1. to break up with him because he's a jerk and you don't have to put up with being disrepected and possibly cheated on down the road.

2. Lay down the law and say you don't like what he's saying and doing and if he wants to continue being with you, he'll be respectful and considerate.

Obviously I'm leaning heavily toward option #1, but you're the one in the relationship, you're the one who knows whether it's worth attempting to save and you're the one who knows how he'll react to being told that he's in the wrong. ",6,t3_264cwr

In the absolute best case he has some problems understanding appropriate humor.

I can only offer, like so many others, advice founded in personal experience.... Have you tried bringing this up to him? I find that there's nothing more disparaging for me in a relationship than being negligent to my SO's sensitivities. I think before you make any rash decisions about splitting up, you should try letting him know how much this bothers you, and why. Be clear that you aren't asking for an apology, because up until this point, he may have not been cognizant of how you felt about this. But also be clear that this sort of behavior makes you uncomfortable, and it would mean a lot to you if he made an effort to stop or wean off on these comments significantly. You may be pleasantly surprised by his reaction. There are plenty of times when my (ex) SO's would bring up things that bothered them that I honestly was ignorant to. 

**ANECDOTE**: For instance, I am in the habit of yelling at people while passing by in the car. It's not mean spirited. Often, I'll pay a compliment, or even reach out for a high five. This bothered my ex a lot (specifically to women alone later in the evening), because she herself felt that when she was walking alone near after dark, the slightest things would throw her psyche out of wack. She had a tendency to believe this of other people, and that my actions were inconsiderate, so I should stop.

I didn't respond defensively. It was a habit I had gotten into growing up. My friends and I used to do it all the time. Things like that never crossed my mind. I apologized for making her uncomfortable and promised an effort to stop, which I did. 

Anyway, if you approach the topic calmly and ask him to stop (for good reason), then you are on totally just grounds, and it shows you respect him enough to appeal to his mature nature. If, moving ahead, he continues to act this way, then you've done all you could do, and have every reason to break it off, and to believe he's a sexist :D...Hope everything works out!

Next I looked at the ages of roommates. I tended to look for people in their 28-30s because that's the type of low-key drama and maturity that I find livable. I looked for women, although I would have been fine living with a guy. I just find guys to be pretty messy. But a craigslist-savy girl won't always post her gender to avoid solicitations and penis photos.

If I find some place I'm curious about, I'll send an email introducing myself and then hopefully they'll send a reply. More often than not their full name is in their reply and I'll google that. I'll also ask to friend request them and thoroughly go over that. 

I also judge pretty hard on their grammar and spelling. If they type liek dis u no der gon b sum drama.

Edit: I avoid hard partiers, and shut-ins. I always ask if they have problems with open communication and how they feel about dishes.

Or I feel like it's not my home it's theirs. They're always home, they're always in their room (and I have no idea if they're sleeping), I feel like I really have to limit any social activities that take place in the apartment. I pretty much feel as if I have to be overly considerate.

I also noticed that shut-ins have very low tolerance for repeat over night guests, and that's always a major source of tension.

Walking on eggshells is really on the person doing it, it's their own behavior. Some people really can't be reached, and will retreat, but assuming every quiet person is difficult to live with is ridiculous. We're all different.

It's pretty unfair to label slightly less social people as passive aggressive with communication issues.

But on the other hand a comfortable living situation is very important for me since I just want to come home after a stressful work environment. My home is very important to me - its my resting place where i can pull myself together after falling apart during the day. So for me there's much more risk over reward in giving a shut in a chance due my past experiences. I would rather just eliminate future risk for someone I mesh well with right off the bat. 

Of course, automatically assuming that every quiet person is passive-aggressive or all the same is ridiculous, and I know all people are different. But at the end of the day, I'm really not going to settle with a questionable quiet stranger when I know there's a better living situation (for me) if I keep looking. My post simply describes the way that I do things, it's not a call to arms against shut-ins just like I'm not condemning hard partiers because I think they tend to be loud and inconsiderate (but no one has given me any flack for this).

In my eyes, it's just an incompatibility issue and not a people issue, and I really don't feel bad about being selfish and protective about my living situation. Have you never been utterly miserable in a mismatched roommate household? I have. It's truly awful, so I will do what I can to not put myself in the same environment, even if it's a little unfair.

I tried to explain it before in another reply, but if you think that I don't like shut ins or think they're terrible people or I can't be associated with them; you're wrong.

Ultimately, I want to come home to a stress free and comforting environment and a harmonious roommate relationship is part of the package. 

I've been in enough living situations to recognize what works for me and what doesn't. I prefer to live with someone where we connect and mesh really well versus someone that takes a lot of effort just to talk to. I am also a pretty big introvert and I recognize that repeat rejections aren't to be taken personally, but for me those are roommate bonding experiences.
I know not every person becomes great friends wih their roommate or even relishes the idea. But it's a friendship that I've found that I really cherish.
I wouldn't say any of my experiences were bad - just learning ones. And a living situation is something that I can easily control for what best suits me. 

I can easily be friends with an massive introvert - grab a coffee and hangout, but coffee mates are much different than roommates.

You should see if that's an option. 

In any case, ask for a Skype interview. You can even create a throwaway account on Skype for this. Ask for a tour of the place beforehand via your webcam (However, there's always the possibility that they're not giving you a tour of the actual place you'll be staying at).

* Meet ALL the roommates first. There will be a few signs of crazy evident. I was silly enough to agree to the place without meeting one of them, and when I met him, I was gone three hours later. 

* Ask what their policies on drugs and smoking are. I messed this one up as well. Get it in writing if you can, making it easier to leave if they don't stick to the agreement. 

* See if there are any student-specific housing websites. I looked at a few where I'd be living with an older couple etc, or with a single-parent family with a college aged daughter where the parent travels. In the end, I couldn't take them, because they weren't comfortable with my boyfriend visiting occasionally, but if I had been single, or only there for a couple of months, it would have been really good. 

* Red flags: how well maintained does the house look? If it's dirty/falling apart, they definitely have a landlord that doesn't care, and they don't care. Messy is ok, but dirty can be a red flag. 

* Are they doing things by the book? Not sure about the US, but in Australia, there's a stack of paperwork that needs to be done. If it's not happening, that's also a red flag. 

* Finally, see if you can put off signing the lease till you've been staying a few days. If there is a problem, you can get out of there. You'll then be stuck for accommodation, but at least you're not locked in.

No steps will guarantee your safety, but here are some suggestions:

* You have to see the place. You have to get everything in writing. One of the places I was trying to see turned out to be a Nigerian scam (became obvious very quickly when they couldn't show me the place). But even if the place exists, make sure everything is discussed ahead of time, make sure everything is in writing, and make sure you understand how your point of contact is related to the building (are they subletting to you? are they the owner? family of owner?)
* Tell people where you are going. I would let my boyfriend know by email or chat the time, address, phone number, other information when I would go look at prospective places. Or bring somebody along if you can.
* Keep your eyes open when you visit the place. Look for little clues about cleanliness, potential drug use, whatever might be important to you.
* Ask about financial situation. I filtered a lot of places just by asking about financial situation gently. One guy was clearly jobless and in desperate financial straits because his roommate had moved out. I didn't want to be saddled with his problems. You have to make sure the rental agreement won't make you responsible jointly for the rent, so that if a roommate falls behind you will have to pay up or be evicted too. There are places that do that. You also don't want to end up being responsible for finding the next roommate...ideally you want a rental agreement that extends exactly for the duration of your stay. Admittedly month to month is tricky to find in many places.
* Do a google search. I found the perfect duplex that was too good to be true. Turns out a registered sex offender lives in the other unit. The state registry even listed some details on his crime and they didn't seem very pretty. I decided to pass.
* Make a list of questions to ask to keep you organized and not let anyone's smooth talking ability charm you out of clear thinking. I did this with my craiglist search for a car as well. Very helpful technique.
* Finally, if it makes you feel safer, just pick a certain type of roommate. I lived one year with people who were all my age +/- a few years, recent college grads.

In the workplace, there is a general understanding that familiar touching needs to be strictly accompanied with verbal permission, and even then may not be appropriate.  Handshakes and hugs are appropriate situationally, but pokes, pinches and rear end slaps are not appropriate because they are childlike and quasi-sexual behavior. An employee working in a professional environment needs to understand that their desire to touch someone else, even in a playful or joking way, does not trump that person's desire to remain untouched. This is the same for men as it is for women and it should be upheld by our company.""

When a boss tells to his employee (or a mother/father to a boy) ""quit acting like a little girl"", what they're saying is that being a man is better, he shouldn't want to be a girl.

In the professional environment is the same, the use of authority to embarrass you and make you do or accept things that you're not comfortable with, because he has the power and you don't, so if you want to keep your job, you better accept your fate. With the added offense that even when a co-worker (in this case a man) occupies the same position as yours, he still feels entitled to kiss you or spank your ass with a stick because he is a man, and therefore, superior to you, who's just a woman.

[Here's some excerpts from the Australian Public Service (APS) ""Respect Summary Guide""](http://www.apsc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/7872/Summary-guide-2011-Final.pdf)

*What are harassment and bullying?* 

* Workplace harassment entails offensive, belittling or threatening behaviour directed at an individual or group of APS employees. The behaviour is unwelcome, unsolicited, usually unreciprocated and often repeated. 

* Bullying is a form of harassment and is also a failure to show respect and courtesy. 

* Workplace bullying can also take the form of abusive group behaviour (sometimes called ‘mobbing’). 

*Workplace harassment and bullying can be:* 

* intended: where actions were intended to humiliate, offend, intimidate or distress, whether or not the behaviour did in fact have that effect, or 

* unintended: which although not intended to humiliate, offend, intimidate or distress, did cause and should reasonably have been expected to cause that effect. **In the case of sexual harassment, it only needs to be shown that a reasonable person would anticipate the possibility that the behaviour would offend, humiliate or intimidate.** 

*Why should you focus on it?* 

* The culture of an organisation can either lift agency performance or inhibit the achievement of outcomes and the demonstration of appropriate values, attitudes and behaviours. 

* Harassment and bullying have a negative impact on performance and, regardless of whether 
the behaviour occurs across the organisation or in isolated pockets, it often reflects unhealthy organisational and management practices. 

* Harassment and bullying often coincide with high levels of absenteeism, poor performance, 
high turnover and low organisational commitment. 
What is the cost of harassment and bullying to your agency? 

* Harassment and bullying are costly and impact on individuals, the team and the organisation 

* In 2009-10, around 17% of APS employees surveyed indicated that they had been harassed or bullied in the past 12 months 

* Bullying constitutes a significant risk to the health, safety and wellbeing of the individual and 
can lead to serious psychological injury 

* Your organisation’s reputation can be damaged through adverse media coverage and your organisation will not be regarded as an ‘employer of choice’ 

* Costs of dealing with complaints and litigation are high—and may include payment of damages 

* Direct salary costs, workers’ compensation and lost productivity arising from workplace bullying have a significant cost for the Australian Public Service 

* Workers’ compensation claims for psychological injury are the most expensive type of claim 

* In the Commonwealth jurisdiction, workers’ compensation claims where harassment or bullying is the cause of the injury make up 45% of all ‘mental stress’ claims

*What behaviour is expected in the workplace?* 

Employers and employees have shared obligations for creating respectful and courteous workplaces. 

Employers want a productive workforce that manages its performance and achieves results. 

Employees want to work in a place where: 

* they know what is expected of them 

* the workplace is safe and they are treated fairly 

* their skills and contribution are recognised and valued 

* training and development support career progression 

* they can work harmoniously with others. ",1,t3_26543c

20140522011703,blueberry_deuce,"I had a coworker (let's call him Jay) who was a little bit sleazy and would occasionally flirt with our female customers. Luckily it didn't seem to get to the point where anyone was offended (probably helped that he was attractive), but I did tell him one day that it's probably not a good idea to flirt on the clock. He stopped but was a bit begrudging about it.

One day an older gay (relevant) man came in (late 50s early 60s). I was helping him at first, but as soon as he saw my coworker Jay, OG (for old guy) only had eyes for him.

OG was practically drooling over Jay, looking him up and down and undressing him with his eyes. He asked Jay if he likes to work out. Jay said that he works out regularly. OG asked him which gym. Jay tried to change the subject to the products we were offering. OG said that he wanted some new underwear, so Jay pointed him to that section. OG said, ""Would you please pick out a pair for me? I want some that you picked out so I can think of you when I wear them.""

Jay turned red as a tomato and just stopped talking. He went in the back room and didn't come out until the guy left, I ended up ringing his items for him.

Jay came out of the stockroom with a whole new perspective on life. He apologized to me (as if I represented women everywhere) for flirting with the customers, something he hadn't taken very seriously before. He also said that he would think twice before flirting with any woman ever again, even if he was out at a night club, because of how it made him feel when OG undressed him with his eyes. It made him feel bad to think back on the times when he had aggressively flirted and potentially made someone uncomfortable.

Now on to your situation: It isn't your responsibility to make this man understand *why* he has to follow the rules. It was the responsibility of the people who raised him. Failing that, it's his boss' responsibility. If he is too stupid to understand the ""why"" behind the rules, that's his problem.

And you USED CONDOMS. Which is awesome and the right thing to do.

It sounds like you two need to have an honest conversation about where your libidos are at. He sounds frustrated and you sound resentful . Some one suggested a night of romance and I second that. Don't make sex (or at least PIV) a necessity. Tell him you want to ease back into it so you don't feel pressure or get performance anxiety.

She and her BF had pretty much stopped having sex for a few months and it had gotten really weird, much like the situation you describe.  What I told her was, at some quiet moment when you are both home, just give him a blow job.  The nice thing is that if you're at a point where things are super awkward, with a BJ you don't have to look at him necessarily, you can just pay attention to the task at hand. He'll think it's great, and have that feeling of intimacy again, while you can still be in control somewhat, and maybe not have to open yourself up all in one go like you would if you just initiated full on sex.  Also, after the BJ he'd probably be super into cuddling, which would be nice for building further intimacy and getting comfortable with him again.",2,t3_265bu1

But I was able to make a point of wanting to be intimate - BJ is very helpful for this, especially since the issue of me being jumpy (so annoying) doesn't come into play.

I would be very happy to go to a therapist - as I've had good experiences with them on my own (and actually seeing one with a former bf was helpful) but he has NOT had good experiences and this seems to be one point he won't concede. ",1,t3_265bu1

So I started by giving him Hand jobs and BJ's, because even if I'm not in the mood he still is and I can help with that. When we get the chance we have sexy shower time. 

I understood that it was me, I needed to change, so I did. I started to initiate things more often, sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, but I tried. The more I tried, the more I wanted it. Are we back to where we were? No, but it's better than where we came from! 

Pick a night, wear something that makes you feel sexy and head out to the front room. Turn off the lights, look him in the eyes and tell him you love him, then turn off the tv/computer and straddle him. If he starts to say something, kiss him and keep kissing him until he shuts up.

I’ve heard of lamisil. Is it to be taken orally? If so be careful, as it can cause liver damage. With out re reading your post, I believe you said you have tried the anti fungal ""pills""? They did not seem to work. For both the yeast and the hand and foot, I would attack it directly, not through your body. Like I said dryness is probably your best bet (i know you can't really do that with the yeast infection, but i know there are creams and medicated douches you can use, if you have not already,) you need to at least clear up your hands, as that’s just asking for re infection. I can do a little more research for you, and I wish i could send you some money, but the 7 mth old uses up all my extra funds or I definitely  would buy the stuff and mail it to you. I'll take a look, and see if I have any of the tanactin in my house, that’s half way there. I can send it to a P.O box or something. 

All the stuff I’ve recommended is topical. applied directly to the affected area. Here is some info on Lamisil. http://www.drugs.com/lamisil.html

I don't know if that’s the route for you as a typical dosage is 6-12 weeks, and that will run up a nice little drug tab, plus pretty much no caffeine products. That may not be an issue for you however. 

my last point, if the lamisil is for the yeast infection, give it a shot, since its pretty severe. If its for the feet and hands, IMHO I would not hold high hopes. Creams and powders for the external stuff. Sorry I can't be of more help, as i'm not well versed in yeast infection, but i am very good at finding information. I'll see what I can do.

Another option is to call your general practitioner and explain the situation and see if you can delay or divide up payment over a period of time, and in some countries doctors may have samples of the drug you need. If nothing else, you could call them up and ask for advice on what to do, they might also know of low-cost or free options :)

I'm going to tell you one thing, though: You're probably not infecting everything. Often with fungal skin infections, those are the everyday fungi we normally carry around on our skin, and most of the time most people do just fine with them, so don't worry too much about other people right now, okay? They're going to be fine being around you with standard precautions, and many will understand some of what you're going through. What you can do so far that doesn't require medication is keep things clean and dry, to avoid an infection on top of the one you have. If you can afford cotton gloves (they are usually quite cheap), put those on for protecting your hands - perhaps get two pairs so you can wash the one pair and wear the other.

Your body is not well now, but it's still the only body you have, and you can do a lot of cool things with it once you get a bit better, even if it doesn't feel like that right now. And I really think you can get better. Maybe not perfect, but definitely better!

There's another fungal infection responsible for roughly 5-10% of yeast infections called Candida Glabrata.  The symptoms are exactly the same but traditional yeast treatments have ZERO effect. The infection is resistant to Azole treatments. Some people can go improperly diagnosed for years. It can infect **vaginally**, on your **skin**, scalp, throat etc... 

There's a few treatment methods. The first is boric acid for two weeks, the second is 3-6 months of nystatin. The third is treatment is given by IV but you'll want to avoid it. 

I had a year of misdiagnosis, untreatable yeast infections. Finally a culture turned up C. Glabrata. I did a multiple week treatment of boric acid and it's been gone for a long time.

It's also something you can try to correct inexpensively on your own.

In addition, I found several years ago that I was allergic to parabens, which are in nearly all anti-itching creams (like cortisone).  Mild allergies to antibiotics which have occurred from low-level use over time (e.g. Neosporin allergies) will cause similar local inflammation, pain, and itching.  If you do have an allergy to a treatment and have been applying it regularly, you may want to consider that the infection is being knocked out but the inflammation remains from your body reacting with each application of treatment.  


This was the case for me with atopic eczema that did not respond to treatment short of prednisone pills (not a cream!).    Once I found out I was allergic to parabens, I was able to just swap to ointments in place of all the creams in my life.


For UTIs and such, I just drink liters and liters of cranberry juice when I start to feel like maybe one might be creeping up on me.  It does prevent microbes from ""sticking"" and becoming an infection for a variety of body parts, even if it doesn't prevent their multiplication directly.

My best advice to you is actually something my current SO said to *me* while I was (openly and honestly) dealing with your similar issues while new to the relationship. That is- ""You now know what to (or not to) do in the wrong relationship, but how do you know what to do in the right one?"" This floored me. I just had to do what felt right, and trust him...and myself. A big thing was I didn't do *anything* I wasn't ready for and wanting to do.

20140521115114,badwu1f,"OH GURL. 
I shit you not, I am in *the exact* same situation. Just started dating this phenomenal guy who takes the best care of me and is just amazing in every single way. 
Yesterday, I sat down and had a huge heart to heart conversation with one of his best friends, and I told him how I felt about everything, and how I was incredibly happy, but also incredibly scared. I didn't want to get hurt again, like I had in the past. I've been abused physically, verbally, and sexually. I've been cheated. I'd been pregnant and miscarried. I've been straight up manipulated and used for sex.

Needless to say, it's been a rough ride. 

But you know what his best friend told me? 
He's not those guys. And that I needed to tell myself that every single morning when I woke up, because if something were wrong, or if something happened, he would tell me. 

I see all these girls snap-chatting him, facebooking him, commenting on his Insta, but I remind myself that I'm in the picture, and it's blatantly obvious that I'm there because I'm in so many of his posts everywhere. This girl he's known forever? Don't even worry about her. She's been sitting in the friendzone for years. 

Trusting him? I know it's hard, but sometimes, just sit there and tell yourself every morning when you wake up that so-and-so is not going to be like the others. And he won't be if you don't let him. If everything stays happy and honky-dory, you'll be happy and so will he. Sometimes you just *have* to trust them. And if they fuck up, that's on them. And you have EVERY RIGHT to bitch them out and beat the bejeezus out of them. 

Girl, I hear you, I do. I've been struggling for *years*. I'm finally hoping I can be over my little issues that I've got (because I have a shit ton and it sucks). 
But sit down and talk to him about it. Ask his best friends how they feel about you, and how they think he feels about you. Communication is key. 

I hope that makes sense, I'm at work. 
If you ever need more help, you've got me here, because I am so in your shoes right now! 

Much love, good luck!

20140521115503,SquirrelGonzo,"Well that sucks! (I don't know you, so forgive me for dragging on,)

It's normal and it's okay to have worries and concerns about other women in your SO's life. However, you have to learn to recognize and ignore the irrational worries and talk to your SO about the legitimate concerns that you have when/if they occur. 

You're both going to have sexy dreams about other people, you're both going to check other people out and there will always be those lonely gents/ladies who see what you have with your SO and try to push their way in to take what the two of you have-we're all human-and eventually that stuff is going to happen. (So is the occasional 'dry' period when it comes to sex.) 

Ultimately you have to decide if your SO is worth it to put yourself out there-heart exposed, just like your SO has to make that same choice for you.

What has helped me with those fears is focusing on self-improvement as well as your SO. What do you want out of life? Is there a class you've always wanted to take? Do you have fun goals that you can do together like hiking, video games? Think about all the times where he made you smile or did something for you. Do something nice for him. (It doesn't have to cost anything.) Go do things together to build that trust up! Sex is great, but remember that having sex is only one aspect of being in a relationship-not the definition of having a relationship.

Talk to him about your concerns and fears and ask for his help on it. He might have some suggestions that might help out, who knows! 

Best of luck!

We all do something that isn't exactly taking good care of our bodies, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't get treatment when something goes wrong. In this case, if you have PCOS, the PCOS itself can contribute to obesity, meaning that while not taking care of yourself definitely doesn't help, the deck is stacked against you as long as your condition isn't being treated. Losing weight will help the symptoms, and treating the problem with the right birth control or something like Metformin can help you lose weight. 

This is also something you need to get diagnosed because there are a lot of things that it puts you at risk for. For example, you're at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea, which if you're also obese means you're pretty high risk for those even though you're young.

Not going to lie, I was super nervous that it was going to hurt after reading a few stories but my girlfriends have all had it done and they assured me that it was probably going to be uncomfortable but not painful at all. I didn't shave or take a shower before I had it done and my gyn didn't care so don't worry about that at all! :)

Your gynecologist is going to insert a speculum in you, which may look a bit intimidating, but don't let that freak you out. He/she will lube it up so it'll slide in more comfortably and this is just going to open up your vagina so your gynecologist will have access to your cervix. If you're a virgin or if you don't really use tampons, you might not be used to the feeling of something inside you, but that's okay. You'll just feel a little stretched and it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. Your cervix will then be swabbed a couple of times (this was actually the weirdest part for me because you kind of feel like your cervix is being tickled? Not sure how to describe it, but think of the feeling you get when you hit your funny bone). 

And then you're done!

Just remember to relax! Easier said than done, I know, but it'll make the whole process that much easier. I was a bit tense when I got mine done but fortunately, my gynecologist was very patient with me. Again, it shouldn't hurt, but you can always tell your gyn to stop if it does. He/she should also have speculums of different sizes available so you may ask for a smaller one if that makes you feel more at ease. The whole thing shouldn't take more than two or three minutes and you'll be done before you know it. :)

There is this very common attitude that all teenagers are somehow unhappy and that this means that they basically cannot suffer from actual clinical depression. This is wrong. There is also an attitude that it is supposedly *impossible* to take children's and teenagers' emotions and problems seriously, because they are so irrational, or because they would abuse any such attention, or because it ""builds character"" and they need to tough it out, etc.

There were at least three severely mentally ill kids in my class at high school, me included. I suffer from avoidant personality disorder and dropped out at 16 after a failed suicide attempt. During my entire time at school, my problems were mostly ignored, and when they weren't I was blamed and scolded for them. Same for a male friend of mine who eventually changed schools but continued to be very troubled. Teachers and parents did nothing but yell at him and blame him. The third one, a girl who self harmed and who I think may have had borderline p.d. also was treated like this and dropped out, giving up on her dreams of becoming a scientist.


People complain that ""troubled teens"" are acting dramatically to get attention. Thing is, how else are they going to get it? I said so many times that I hate school; ""many kids do, that's normal."" I said so many times that I'm sad; ""there's no reason to be sad"". I said so many times that I'm scared; ""that's normal during this phase, you'll get used to it"".

When a child or teen injures themselves, or in the thankfully rare cases of school shooting or such when they harm others, all the adults are so shocked, and everybody keeps on asking, ""how could this happen?""

It could happen because nobody takes the problems of young people seriously until it ends in some kind of visible, physical catastrophe, and this needs to change. So maybe when a teenager constantly seems down or depressed, talk to them, instead of calling them ""emo"" or ""histrionic"" and accusing them of trying to get attention. Maybe they need attention, and then it's the duty of teachers and parents to give it to them.",4,t3_2665w9

Adolescence is a very turbulent time: you are discovering who you are as a person and what the ""real"" world is like. It can be very scary and threatening and teens have normal, expected reactions (if sometimes unhealthy). 

Part of the problem here is that mental illness very clearly garners more attention for a person. If a person feels they lack the attention they need, subconsciously they may start thinking there's something wrong with them (mental illness). If we start fawning over kids, making a big deal over their struggles, they will perceive these struggles as a bigger deal than they might actually be. It goes both ways. ",2,t3_2665w9

Isn't ""big deal"" very subjective? Who's anybody to tell anybody else how much they are suffering? I think that's a very difficult decision to make, and I would absolutely err on the side of caution by taking any emotional problems seriously - even if they are completely normal and not at all pathological. I think in many cases, problems could perhaps  be deescalated *before* they become long-term, difficult to treat mental health issues. I think there's no need to ""fawn"" over kids with problems, it would be enough to listen to them and  take them seriously. If a kid says they can't stand it any more in school, I think it's much better to give them some time off, have them see a counselor, and make a decision with parents, teachers and the child together as to what to do now, rather then just say ""oh, they'll get over it.""

20140522093806,Onefortheisland,"""Banning"" any kind of material is a very a slippery slope. I've tried to talk to people about establishing guidelines for what is and what is not appropriate to bring to meetings, as well as how artwork should be displayed. I actually think that the ""hold up your artwork and talk about it"" format isn't a very good one, as it doesn't give anyone a choice as to whether or not to look at the artwork. I know that, if I'd been given a choice, I wouldn't have looked at D's artwork. I know that A felt the same way, like she'd been forced to look at something that made her uncomfortable.
Bringing in previously published material that does depict a rape scene (such as ""Watchmen"", ""Locke and Key"", ""Sandman"", etc) is different, but only because of the format it's being presented it. If someone brings in their own original artwork, they're usually holding up large individual pages. If someone brings in a copy of ""Watchmen,"" then the book is sitting on the table and is closed. A person has the option of picking it up and flipping through it. 
I also think that the difference between something like ""Watchmen"" and D's work is the context. In ""Watchmen,"" the attempted rape scene is crucial to the plot; if you were to remove it, the story wouldn't make any sense. D's work was just a rape scene; if you were to remove it, then there wouldn't be anything. It was gratuitous. ",2,t3_2663l1
20140521210610,janeylicious,"I wonder if you could run with that ""no explicit content"" rule in a different way: OP suggests to M about limiting graphic stuff to specific meetings noted well in advance so you basically force D to show up with his art only at certain times and nobody has to attend if they're uncomfortable with D and D's work or anything along those lines.

I would also just confront D like you suggest too, at least once. If that doesn't work, I would probably show up all the time but leave without saying a word every time D shows up.",11,t3_2663l1

It's not that I don't understand your art, I just don't agree with it."" Also, ask him why he likes the stuff he likes. If he's making caricatures of misogynist porn because he's trying to make a statement about the objectification of women, tell him he needs to do a better job expressing his message. But if he's doing it because he hates women, get him to say it out loud. 

Maybe graphic material isn't grounds for removal, but continued failure to take constructive criticism and cultivating an unsafe environment for members of the group totally is. I can appreciate that the leader is in a tough position--to ban this guy would be an active choice, and if he makes the passive choice all of the women just sort of leave and he can pretend it's not his fault. But you can explain to him that what he's doing is issuing a de facto ban against anyone who's made uncomfortable by illustrations of graphic rape i.e. a lot of people.

I'm not sure the inner workings of the club but maybe suggest any comics shared are shared with the understanding that if someone wishes to discuss it further as a group- they can. Instead of Mr.Uppity getting private talking to's. And of course, this goes for mainstream work as well, so no artist feels singled out. Ask to incorporate an ""open discussion"" situation. People should be able to express themselves freely without fear of shunning. Clubs shouldn't feel like a professional environment where you must go to ""higher ups"" to voice concerns.

I try to be honest with people and to offer constructive criticism when possible. I told both D and M how the art made me feel: it made me extremely uncomfortable and honestly made me wonder if this was how D views women, as objects to be defiled. I explained that, to me, the art said, ""I hate strong women and want to defile and violate them. Women are inferior beings and I do not respect them."" M basically just nodded and said I was entitled to my feelings (his way of saying, ""I don't want to get involved with this"").

Be frank and make it clear that there is more to your club than some jerk who likes to make rape comics. Ask M directly exactly his opinion. Don't allow him to give a politicians answer. I'd suggest THAT conversation in private though as I personally feel it's important to give him a chance as a friend, and not feel like he needs to give a leader's response.

You could dig in for a fight with M, but he’ll probably just dig his heels in because if he was going to take D to task over this, he would have done it by now.

Sucks to be in your position. All I can think of is perhaps offering an alternative meetup for your friends in the group and the girls who were driven away. You can lay out your own agenda for the group, and that way there won’t be any grounds for that kind of art to be displayed.

The only people in my group who read my work are the folks in the writers' group, and that's a small group. Scripts are posted online and people can choose whether or not to read them.

What I actually want to say, is that following this pregnancy, however it turns out, You should look into more discrete methods of birth control such as Depo Povera or Implanon.

Also there wont be any pills lying around your house for your husband to find.

Implanon is even better because it lasts 3 years, But it is a rod that goes in your arm so if your husband touches the under-side of your armpit for any reason he may feel it. It can also be bruised for a few days after insertion. But again, No trying to organise scripts and no pills lying around. 

If you are sure you are finished having children, you could look into more permanent sterilisation, If you are comfortable living with the lie, you could tell your husband that fowling your third pregnancy/ recent ""Miscarriage"" you developed some scar tissue and for medical reasons had to have this procedure, it was not a contraceptive choice.

That isn't what this post is about and I'm not here to discuss what life is or isn't.  I am here to discuss the relationship.  Here we go:

I really think you need to discuss the fact that your marriage is quickly headed towards crisis and you need to get into marriage counselling or think about getting divorced... as in, you need to SERIOUSLY think about getting divorced and you need to talk to your husband about divorce (or annulment or separation, at least).

I am not saying this to be mean, I am saying this because the issues you are bringing up go to the absolute core... the absolute *foundation*... of the relationship.  In marriages, some issues can be worked out and differences can be worked around, but this just doesn't seem like one of them.  

If this were just about birth control, you guys could probably work through/around it somehow (although the inability of you both to discuss it in a mature manner is discouraging, in itself).  

The problem is, we are talking about abortion. The fact of the matter is that your husband believes it is literally *murder*... not hypothetically, not in some circumstantial grey area... murder.  If you get the abortion, even if it is your body and your choice and *you* don't believe it's wrong, your husband believes that it is literally one of the worst kinds of human atrocities possible.

So think about this: if your husband ever finds out, your husband will be convinced that he is married to a murderer (again, realize I am not saying abortion is murder, I am saying that your husband will certainly see it that way, nonetheless).  Not only that, but even if he doesn't find out, you will always have to go through life/marriage knowing that you aren't really the person he thinks you are.  How does a marriage stand without even the most basic level of understanding between partners?

And the fact of the matter is, you guys have grown so apart in beliefs/worldviews that you no longer agree on what life, death, and murder even are anymore... and you guys can't even talk about it or agree to disagree.  How can a marriage stand on such a rocky level of communication and such a fundamental difference of belief... especially when that difference can't even be discussed in any substantial way?

Unless these issues are addressed and you can both actually grow closer to one another and mend the rift that has so clearly entered the relationship, then I just don't know how the relationship can work out long term, regardless of whether or not you get the abortion.  If you do get the abortion, however, then I think you need to get a divorce or separation first because either he will find out and the marriage will fall apart or he won't and that giant elephant will always be in the room... and I just don't know of very many (if any) relationships that can handle those kinds of secrets.  

Little white lies exist in every marriage but this isn't a little white lie we are talking about.  This is a fundamental difference in world view compounded with a complete inability to discuss your differences in any meaningful way... which is crippling your ability to get closer as a couple where it matters most--in knowing each other and loving each other as you *really are.*  Before you make any decisions, you need to talk to your husband and get into marriage counselling or you need to discuss divorce.  Just my .02.

**EDIT:**

Although many people here are going to hate me for this, I also need to add:

>I'm not against a third child, but right now I want to focus on the two we have, get them both walking, talking, out of diapers.

I find this to be kind of alarming.  You are willing to have a third child, but you are also willing to put your marriage in an existential crisis and do something that your husband views as *murder* because the timing is just inconvenient to you?   It leaves me wondering if you really actually even care about your relationship any more or if you simply have grown that far apart? If you are really at the point where you are willing to jeopardize your relationship out of a sense of mere convenience, then I don't know if counselling is going to help.  I could understand it a little better if you felt really strongly against ever having children again, but it just seems as though condoms and abortion are sort of interchangeable to you.  It just seems like you've already made up your mind that there isn't anything there worth saving. 

Something just seems off.  There are plenty of couples that unexpectedly have a third child at an inconvenient time and then decide ""that's it... we are done having kids"" and get the man a vasectomy or go on a more permanent/long term form of birth control.  It seems like maybe your decision has a lot more to do with your feelings about your relationship and, maybe, some kind of resentment you are feeling about your life together than the kid or the timing.  If you are a stay at home mother, is the issue really the timing or saving the marriage, or is it the insecurity/fear of your way of life changing dramatically that is actually the concern here?",4,t3_265uml
20140522183343,forthelulzaccount,"I was with you until that edit. 

Don't emotionally police or try and make it about her feelings about her husband. If her other two children aren't out of diapers and she isn't able to handle having a third, that's definitely a good reason. 

The husband doesn't believe in birth control. That includes condoms. This isn't a matter of her having some strange womanly ire against her husband and taking it out on a fetus. This is a matter of her believing that it is best for her body and her OTHER CHILDREN if she does not have more at this time. ",-11,t3_265uml

I was not in a place I could even afford a healthy pregnancy without taking food out of my daughter's mouth, so I decided to terminate the pregnancy. The person I was in a relationship with at the time respected my choice, and helped me out driving me back and forth and going to doctor's visits with me. I went on to have a lovely child (with him!) We've been married over ten years now) and don't regret the decision. 

I had one other time where I used Plan B very shortly after we were married (he knew) when we had an accidental condom break and I was a little worried about possibilities. I just wasn't ready to change our family in two ways so abruptly, since we didn't live together until after the marriage. (Custody agreement, again dating myself.)

You have made up your mind you don't want another kid. You seem like you have a plan on  how to obtain an abortion, so make this plan come true.

Now, the issues I see:

* you hide around your husband that you take daily medicine. He should know of your medication (and vice-versa, and you both about your kids medication) if only for emergency situations.
* You hide from your husband that you pay money for things he disapproves of (and since you are a sahm, I suppose you have shared finances)
* You don't honestly talk about birth control with your husband, that should be a topic where a couple (regardless of married or not) come to a consensus
* Your husband doesn't respect your wish on using any form of birthcontrol, I don't see any chance to make this survive a relationship in the long term

My stance on the matter (not catholic, but christian) is that you should come to a consensus for birthcontrol and use some form or another. Not consenting to any further sex before you got to an agreement might help persuade him NFP is a viable option even for a catholic family (look into what the new pope said about birthcontrol, I think there is some serious reform on its way). Most catholic couples I know used some form or another of birthcontrol at one point or another of their life. 

So, get your abortion, talk with your husband about you needing some birthcontrol and try to come up with a plan which suits both of you. (even if you do nfp, you could just deny sex when you are fertile, but it works best with involvement of the male partner). In the long run you have to decide if you want to continue living with these lies (there are quite a few years for you till menopause), try to reconcile things with your husband around birthcontrol or ultimatively leave him if he won't respect your bodily autonomy.

Your relationship can come out stronger than before from this. Finally talking trough this issue and coming to some sort of open agreement will lift a weight off your shoulders and help you model healthy relationships to your kids. They do notice you sneaking around your husband. Do they see fear from your husband in your actions (and think it's ok if a wife fears her husband)? Do they see disrespect in your actions (and think respect isn't important in a relationship)?

She had been friends with him for years, but chose not to tell him. She had the abortion, (and since many years later has a new baby and new husband), but when the man found out she had the abortion without telling him it severed their friendship. Now I can't speak for her whether she regretted not telling him or not, I can just say from the outside looking in, it ruined them. Or, at least, him.

You have all given me a lot to think about regarding the state of my relationship to my husband and my motivations for thinking about terminating the pregnancy. I'm not decided on it, which is why I posted in the first place.  I just know when I could do it if I were going to.

20140522001101,mundabit,"This article really opened my eyes, I grew up in a very sex-positive household and my school was also very sex-positive. I knew that Abstinence only education existed and that sex-negative language was often used to teach kids about sex. I have even witnessed very sex-negative (in particular negativity toward female sexual pleasure) attitudes among the medical industry with Doctors I sought to help me improve my sex life. But I had no idea that the ""Sex is for procreation only"" mentality was so pandemic. 

It makes me sad, Do the parents and teachers not enjoy sex themselves so they pass on those negative experiences? or do they really not trust their children enough to use their knowledge to make informed choices.

My Mother and Grandmother weren't quite as liberal as Alice Dreger is. Both my mother and grandmother suffered endometriosis, vaginsmus and other issues that made sex painful for them, so while they passed on amazing knowledge of how sex and intimacy works, I never received first-hand accounts of how good sex can feel. My grandmother was a midwife so the mechanics of sex, reproduction, menstruation etc were all explained in enough detail that I too could probably pass the nursing exams before I was 8 yaers old.

A lot of that has changed now that I am older, I also experienced a lot of pelvic issues, but was perfectly placed to have them seen to and find treatments, I helped my mother get treatments and her case was much more straight forward and she had an almost immediate recovery. My relationship with my mother regarding sex is unique and many people consider it disgusting and unnatural, but for us it feels healthy. We have gone shopping for sex toys together (we've even taken my grandma shopping for sex toys) and mum talks about the men she's with and how her orgasms felt after her cervix was removed compared to before. She has driven me to appointments to help my pelvic issues and come in with me to stick up for me with misogynistic doctors who think that its ok for a woman to be in pain during sex because its the potential pregnancy that matters.

I was always told that sex is something you do with love and with kindness and with respect. that it is a gift you give and receive and for that reason its best when its wanted. And that was enough to make me wait for the right person, I didn't need to be fearful of sex, I needed to be excited for what sex could be if I did it right.",3,t3_265q9v
20140521181957,pamplemus,"i believe that honest, comprehensive, factual sex education is crucial to healthy development. however, i think certain topics should be reserved for certain stages of development. it's hard for young children to grasp the general idea that not every behaviour is age-appropriate for them. going on adult rides or watching r-rated movies, for example. they want instant gratification, which is why i'd worry about exposing them to the idea of recreational sex and orgasms and how pleasurable it all is. i wonder if it would encourage them to engage in sexual behaviours with each other. but hey, maybe i'm wrong. it's an interesting discussion though!",3,t3_265q9v
20140521184810,whisperingmoon,"I agree that it would have to be a complex dialogue... That said, I'd hazard that most children above the age of six or so also understand that alcohol is something that adults are allowed to have for pleasure, while children are not. They understand that many adults drive cars for fun, but that's something that they won't be able to do until they're older.

Obviously, these are not the most apt of analogies when the issue is complex, but I think it speaks to the capability of children to understand social rules. Adults can do some things, kids can do others. Kids have a very intimate understanding of what *is* and *isn't* allowed, and they enforce it aggressively. (If eating in class is forbidden, and they see you eating in their class, they will call you out. More than an adult would, at least for non-morals related offenses.) They understand rules and respect them generally speaking, especially prior to puberty-- which, let's be honest, is the group people are terrified of teaching. 

So if people were to tell children: sex is a nice activity between adults, assuming the adults both want to participate. It's not for children because their bodies and hearts/minds aren't ready. One day, you may want to have sex. You don't have to have sex unless you want to. It's okay to be curious about your body, and the bodies of other people, but remember that the most important thing of all is to be safe, healthy, and happy-- and not to hurt other people's safety, health, or happiness.

Etc. 

I think being honest about pleasure and sex would, interestingly enough, have a greater potential to protect children from predators, assuming it were explained delicately and well. When I was in elementary, in the early 90s, hand-puppets tried to teach us about ""stranger danger"" and how to respond if a strange adult touched you... But of course, being a child, I took this very literally and was *terrified* of people accidentally brushing against me in the supermarket or the mall or any other crowded area. (""Those adults are trying to touch me! They want to hurt me! That's not right!"" -- the inner monologue of me, an anxious child.) 

Kids are the masters of literalism... Ever see a child hold their finger an inch from their sibling's face and say ""I'M NOT TOUCHING YOU"" for hours on end? Ironically, by trying to protect us from being too graphic-- which obviously is still a concern-- my teachers had given me a fear which didn't make sense. If they could have been more open from the beginning, then maybe it would be easier to say, ""while sex is a nice activity for adults, in private, it is not for children. Adults are not allowed to do sexual things with children: it is wrong and it is against the law. If anyone does something to make you feel uncomfortable, tell someone you trust, etc."" 

Oh, and being told that queer people exist would have been a welcome addition to the curriculum. LGBT people don't get sex ed in schools because everything is based on reproduction; maybe a pleasure model would be more inclusive.",11,t3_265q9v
20140521190149,pamplemus,"oh, i think your suggestion is perfectly reasonable. i've read a few other articles on this subject, and some of them suggest statements way more graphic than that, which is what causes me discomfort. i don't think that going on about orgasms, sex toys, the g-spot, etc. is acceptable until late childhood at the earliest.

and i absolutely agree that this mindset would allow for more of a focus on LGBT-related sex issues (though sadly, that probably won't happen anytime soon for political reasons...), but i still think further elaboration should wait until a kid can fully understand sex and all of its complexities instead of just the physical aspect of it.",2,t3_265q9v

And I wish people would stop saying and thinking things like rape being worse than death and that its better to fight to death than allow someone to rape you. 

I chose otherwise. When I realized they were much stronger than me, that I was not able to escape and that they were using more force if I fought I just stopped. I decided that it was better for me to get raped but remain otherwise unharmed. They would either rape me or beat me and rape me. I thought, that the rape would last some time but I would be able to walk away, no one would have to know and I could keep wearing my t-shirt and some day have kids. Damage control. 

So I stopped fighting back and just lied there, staring at the brick-wall. Thinking to myself it would not be forever. They would stop eventually.

I suppose in the eyes of law and reddit that's consent and not real rape. However, after a while, when my rapists didn't get a reaction from me even if they slapped me or janked my hair, one of them called me boring and the other one figured there was something wrong with me. They stopped and left. They probably wouldn't have, would I have kept fighting.

20140522023153,woopwooppoowpoow,"Facepalm. The lack of empathy you have is staggering. Are veterans always able to defend themselves? Are all people veterans? Are all people stronger or more skilled than their threat? What if the people attacking you were veteran Gurkas (please look it up if you do 't know of them)? What if in my initial situation there were 2 other guys sitting behind you, and you unable to see if they were holding a gun or not. But the implied threat was there. Would you risk it? 

The whole point of the implied threat is that you can threaten someone by mere presence without outing your weapon. You don't need a sniper or an overt threat to make it clear to someone that they **may** get the shit kicked out of them or worse if they don't comply. And many people, veterans included, would rather comply than risk getting themselves into a situation where they have more to lose than their wallet. 

And while to you this is clear extortion, is it really? Let's fast forward to a trial. The defense lawyer shouts up and down about how in the defendant's view and all of the bystanders (defendant's friends) he was merely being friendly and asked for a favor. It's than your word against theirs. You think people will convict beyond a shadow of doubt? Fuck, I would not convict since it's clearly a he said he said. 


And THIS is why merely the lack of no does not signify a yes. Fuck an extorted yes does not signify consent. If you are a woman who went into a room to, let's say, sleep off a bit too much to drink, when a friend from your entourage comes in and proceeds to initiate sex and you freeze up  and merely sit there non responsive in fear. Here you were sleeping and a second later you wake up to a 100 pound heavier man touching you without consent. He tells you throughout his completely one sided advances he KNOWS you want this, and thaf everybody at the party saw it too and that everyone knows what you two are doing here mutually. He basically force feeds you a version you realize you have trouble fighting against. And you realize if you fight back, you might get injured and pain and that's scary. But worse still you might make a scene and have your entire entourage look at you like a fake rape accuser or a flimsy bitch who can't decide what she wants. And that nobody will believe what happened. So you are frozen in fear and in pain and you close your eyes and wish this wasn't happening.

Are you fucking telling me that is not rape? Because I can guarantee you in the rapists' eyes you WERE flirting and you did not just go to the room to sleep it off and you NEVER SAID NO OR FOUGHT BACK. Fuck it, many rapists will conjure even fake positive responses and say you were obviously into it. Some rape victims will ask for a condom so they at least do 't get pregnant and this is often seen as a sign of consent. 


So please put down your military experience and think about context. Fuck it, rapes happen in the military too. If a new female recruit is in the shower and her superior comes in and initiates sex without getting a yes first you think he is not raping her? If she knows her career hangs on his word and she knows he is the kind of vindictive dick who would punish her for saying no, you think her submitting is consent?

20140522110243,greycloud24,"the situation she described had the attackers hand on their shoulder. and i am not saying every veteran, but i clearly pointed out 82nd airborne. i will be a little more clear. 1/325 airborne infantry regiment. let me expand upon that. not a single guy in our unit doesn't go through unarmed combative training. if you served in my unit, you would know how to break that guys arm. you might even laugh that he had his hand on your shoulder while threatening you. this is an extremely dumb position to be in while threatening someone. 

let me give you an idea of how dumb. so an attacker comes at you holding a knife blade in hand, handle pointed at you and he has the blade pointed into the crook of his shoulder. do you feel threatened? do you view this person as a credible threat? 

yes there are many other veterans out there and many young MMA fighters who could kick my ass. there are also just strong people who may be proficient with high school wrestling or back alley brawling. there may be ex prisoners who learned to fight in prison. these people could all be expected to give me a run for my money. but if they put their hand on my shoulder, they are clearly signalling that they aren't one of the ones, that they are the idiot who doesn't know what he is doing.  an idiot who thinks the strategically sound thing to do is to place his hand on someone's shoulder would get owned by me or anyone else who knows how to perform the simplest (and fastest) of standing arm bars. all of this is besides the real point.

if there was an implied credible threat i would give up my wallet. but now that isn't grey area anymore. it is black and white. 

so a girl is dancing, at a party with a guy. she is giving him all the indicators that she is interested. she doesn't know him very well, he is much bigger than her. they go back to a room, and she decides this isn't a good idea. but she is afraid of saying no. now imagine the other guy has no idea that she is indicating no with her body language. he has mild asperger's syndrome. he is incapable of reading her body language. if she doesn't tell him no, if she gives him no indication that she does not want to have sex after explicitly giving him indications that she did want to have sex, than it isn't rape because he is completely unaware. in his mind she is consenting, he isn't trying to hurt her, he isn't trying to rape her, he would have stopped what he was doing had she simply spoken up. 

i would venture to say that the vast majority of men have no interest in raping someone. the vast majority of women, also have no interest in raping someone. but if she doesn't communicate her lack of consent in some manner, than they won't realize they are ""raping"" her. and in this moment i wouldn't consider it rape, and at the bare minimal it is mutual rape because she has presented herself as willing when in reality she was not. she took away their ability to give meaningful consent into being in that situation by not communicating her lack of consent. it doesn't have to be autism, there are many guys who aren't very good at picking up on body language, add beer into the mix and you have wandered off into some pretty grey areas. its on both of them to make their intentions known. its on both parties to communicate where their lines are drawn, and what they are willing to do. deceit at this point is tantamount to raping the other person. 

now that doesn't mean that there aren't some serial rapists out there. i just don't think that these men are more common than about 1 in 50 to one in 100. for every serial rapist there are 25 dumb guys that need to be told ""no"", and they will be happy to oblige (ok they won't be happy but they will also not rape her, they might feel like she led them on, and she is a bad person for having done so, but they won't turn it into a rape). the serial rapist is a new beast altogether. he wouldn't take no for an answer. but he is far from common, and if you cater your behavior to him, you might get ""raped"" by several other guys that would have stopped when you said ""no"". 

most guys are good people. if that weren't true the world we live in would be a very different place. there are just as many true autistic people (probably more) that have no desire to rape anyone, but they also don't do well with reading body language, and could be expected to be completely ignorant of all non-verbal communication (some so ignorant to not even be aware that it exists and other people use it). the girl who ends up with one of these guys and asks for a condom has consented to them. if everything she has effectively communicated to them says ""yes"" than she can't turn around and say she was just kidding she really meant ""no"". at that point she is raping them. 

so if you are afraid to say ""no"" to someone you know nothing about then there is a 50/50 on whether you raped them or they raped you. it could have been a serial rapist, it could have been some autistic person, there is an equally likely rate of either. but then there is the other 24 guys that are just social retards. they need a clear ""no"" as well, because now the refusal to say no puts it up to a 4% of it being rape, and a 96% chance that had the girl said no, it would have stopped. basing your actions around the serial rapist is a terrible idea, even if you did figure out a good strategy for one, they would learn to work around it, and figure out a new way to rape people. 

saying ""no"" prevents the majority of bad situations. but it won't protect you from a sociopath who has decided to rape you. if he is determined enough, nothing will stop him from raping you. 

locking your car will prevent some mentally challenged kid from accidentally getting into it thinking it is his. it will also stop the majority of simple thieves from getting inside. a determined car thief is just going to break the windows and get in anyway (or a host of other ways to break into a car). you don't protect your car as if everyone was a determined car thief. and you shouldn't try to act as if every stranger was a determined rapist. saying ""no"" clears up the grey are for the vast majority of people, its like locking your car door. it does a real good job against the majority of people. but the determined rapist won't listen. then again, if you say no to the determined rapist, at least you have determined that he isn't one of the good guys, and its not likely that this will escalate the situation. 

if i said no to a robber who was using subtle but real threats, he would likely escalate. when i see that he is escalating i can change my mind and give him my wallet. but if i give my wallet to anyone who asks for a dollar, than a lot of bums will be falsely accused of robbery. and if a lot of bums were getting falsely accused of robbery, the police might be skeptical when someone reports a robbery.

Are people so freaking unaware or not paying attention to cues to notice someone is seriously not enjoying themselves? **The whole point if sex is ongoing feedback.** If the positive feedback stops why the fuck would you continue having sex? You're suppose to enjoy yourself and at the same time try and do stuff so the other person enjoys herself too. It's basically absurd to suggest someone can fuck an unresponsive living corpse and assume it's consensual, fetishes aside.


I literally am appalled that you think one can confuse someone who is frozen up by fear with an enthusiastic, positive moaning, grabbing herself and you horny woman who wants it. Really, man?

No, I would absolutely notice, and ask what's up and make sure everything was ok. But at the same time, people can be weird. I know I'm not the only one who has been in a sexual situation and not been completely comfortable, but when asked what's wrong responded 'nothing' because you just kinda want it to be over with rather than create issues. If the random guy in the ally in your first example said ""you're sure you're ok with this, right?"" Right before you handed your wallet to him, it wouldn't really change that a lot of people would want to get out of the situation so badly that they would just say yes. 

>Are people so freaking unaware or not paying attention to cues to notice someone is seriously not enjoying themselves?

No, people do, but some people really don't show it when they are enjoying sex. It kinda sucks, but it happens, and you don't really know what you should do differently, and they just act like everything's fine.

It's basically absurd to suggest someone can fuck an unresponsive living corpse and assume it's consensual, fetishes aside.

So you're saying if someone is being raped they have to be totally unresponsive. How is that different that saying they have to verbally say ""no"" or saying they have to fight back. Do you think that nobody has ever had sex they didn't want to have, but they just decided they would rather pretend and get it over with rather than trying to stop it? You don't have to enjoy sex for it to be consensual. And you don't have to not enjoy it for it to me nonconsensual.

Yup, that's what I would do, but if they are really shy, don't you think they might just say they are comfortable or that it's ok even if it isn't?

>So is it a lot different? No it's fucking not. You're trying to put the burden of rape on the victim go signal and portray rapists as clueless bumbling but innocent idiots who just assumed since 9 signals were given than it's right too ahead.

Absolutely

> Why? Because non rapists are aware that they are relying on implied consent and if it gets unclear it's your responsibility to make sure the consent is still there.  

Absolutely, and after someone asks repeatedly to make sure everything is ok, and the other party isn't showing any weird signs, it's not rape then?

>I have had my SO realize something is wrong when I had a cramp in my leg and I was pretending it away not wanting to ruin the flow. **he still fucking noticed because he was aware of me**. 

So if you were an amazing actor and he didn't notice, it's rape?

Yeah, but as much as you can try to pay attention to those things as much as you can, nobody is psychic.

20140522063500,woopwooppoowpoow,"You are literally trying to muddy the waters by making an already absurd example even more absurd. 

So not only do we now have a woman who is going home with a guy she flirted with, initiated sex and then changes her mind and says no, but now she is a Hollywood actress level faker of pretending to want it, the other guy is a decent bloke who even asks her if anything is wrong, and she convincingly gives a Richard the III level speech to the guy to convince him everything is fine, all while being afraid and in pain and terrified. Yeah, sure, this is the issue with grey areas of consent. This contrived example. 

I'm sorry but what is your point? That because someone can in absurdis fake non verbal consent, the lack of verbal consent or dissent it is automatically consent? So basically if we go to bed, and I don't say no verbally, then no matter what happens afterwards it is not rape? So that unless I say no, the default is yes? 

Let's make it clear here. Rape is not an accident done by people who are merely careless. It's not the semen equivalent of dropping a slice of buttered bread on the floor. It is your responsibility as a party to sex to check for enthusiastic, and positive consent. If you do not, it is your **choice** to do so. You don't rape by mistake the same way you do not cheat by mistake. There is always a choice on what you willingly do to the other person and. Series of choices narrowing down the options available further. And with that choice of actually doing something to someone's body comes the responsibility to check for how that is received. 

If you are an intimidating bloke, you should be aware you are intimidating and how that can affect people. If I am a 6'4 300 pound guy, I will damn sure not hold a stranger chick in the corner of a room alone and start undressing her. Unless she has been begging me to do so and we had an ongoing and mutual thing. I would approach her in a way that she cannot feel pressured whatsoever. Fuck it, I'd allow her to make a step. Even if by doing so I might miss out on some willing but shy sex, that is a small price to pay then to risk having even one chick feel forced to play along because I physically dominate her. Again, with power comes responsibility. And if it is in your power to dominate someone so they submit from coersion it ks your duty to manage that power. 

Just look at dogs who instinctively do this. An older or bigger dog will not play threateningly with a smaller dog/puppy. If the tiny dog gets actually scared and not play scared they back off. If a dog can do it so can a human. 


But let's be serious here. I can't say I have met accidental bullies, nor accidental rapists. Rapists who coerce know exactly what they are doing. If you are a guy who wants sex at all costs, you **will** make consent blurry by trying to make your date drink. You **will** hit o. A person you know, with whom you are intangled in a common friends group. Because everyone hates standing out or embarassing themselves by having their friends know every dirty intimate detail. You **will** manipulate verbally or ask repeatedly after several noes until the person submits (common psychological effect when badgered with the same question). You will physically prevent someone from moving but avoid actual harm. You will prey on people who are shy, unassertive and likely to fold under pressure.

Why? Because this gets you sex. Coherced sex but in the eyes of the people around you both went in the room, and she didn't fight back. Or said yes eventually. Or was too drunk to handle a psychological manipulation. Because there won't be physical trauma, just psychological. And because people will immediately focus on the victim's responsibilities and not the accused. Did she say no? Did she say no clearly enough? Did she fight back? Did she ask for a condom? Did she report right away? Was she crying when reporting? Why was she pretending to be happy at the party afterwards of ot wasn't just regret sex. 


So no, let's not muddy the waters and put all weight on the potential victims' shoulders. It is everybody's responsibility to make sure consent is there.

20140522081606,secondaccountforme,">You are literally trying to muddy the waters by making an already absurd example even more absurd. 

If it's an example that could happen, it's something that needs to be considered. 

>So not only do we now have a woman who is going home with a guy she flirted with, initiated sex and then changes her mind and says no, but now she is a Hollywood actress level faker of pretending to want it, the other guy is a decent bloke who even asks her if anything is wrong, and she convincingly gives a Richard the III level speech to the guy to convince him everything is fine, all while being afraid and in pain and terrified. Yeah, sure, this is the issue with grey areas of consent. This contrived example. 

I was talking about a person who goes home with another person they flirted with, initiating sex, decided they are uncomfortable, but shows extremely minimal signs of discomfort because they don't want anything to be awkward. The other person senses a little bit of awkwardness that could potentially be discomfort and asks if anything is wrong, and the partner, not wanting to make things awkward or just wanting to situation to be over soon, or maybe just because they are shy and can't speak their mind, ensures them that everything is ok even though it's not, and does their best to pretend as such. They may or may not be afraid or in pain or terrified. This is not a contrived example. I myself have been in a lot if situations like this. Sex is all about communication, but it's a two way street, and sometimes it's hard. 

>I'm sorry but what is your point? That because someone can in absurdis fake non verbal consent, the lack of verbal consent or dissent it is automatically consent? So basically if we go to bed, and I don't say no verbally, then no matter what happens afterwards it is not rape? So that unless I say no, the default is yes? 

No that's not my point at all. My point is that things need to be communicated clearly. That doesn't necessarily mean verbally, but just enough so that the other party knows the situation. I am just as responsible for making sure my partner knows I'm consenting (or not) as they are for doing the same for me, and they are as responsible for making sure they know that I am consenting (or not) as I am for them. If I want to stop having sex, I can't expect them to read my mind and know that unless I clearly communicated it to them somehow (though words, or though things like body language as you described).  If we go to bed, and I don't do anything that they could pick up on that would signify a withdrawal of consent whatsoever (no freezing up, no lack of moaning, no dead fishing, no ""no"", no ""slow down"", no ""stop"",) then it's consensual.  If I make the decision that I would rather just pretend to enjoy the sex that I'm not enjoying so that I can get it over with and not create a weird situation, that is me giving consent. If I decide the next day that I should have shown some signs and tried to stop it from happening, that's me regretting having given consent. This is something that has happened to me multiple times, and many other people as well. 

> Let's make it clear here. Rape is not an accident done by people who are merely careless. It's not the semen equivalent of dropping a slice of buttered bread on the floor. It is your responsibility as a party to sex to check for enthusiastic, and positive consent. 

Consent doesn't have to be enthusiastic or positive. Bad sex isn't rape, it's just bad sex. I've had sex where partway though I just decided I really wasn't having any fun, and while it might have been nice to just stop, I didn't want to make things weird, so I just lay back, eventually fake an orgasm and let my partner finish. Deciding to do this instead of stoping *is consent* but it's not positive or enthusiastic. It's the sex equivalent of ""This gift from my friend really sucks, but I'll just pretend I like it a throw it away later so things don't get awkward"". 

>If you do not, it is your **choice** to do so. You don't rape by mistake the same way you do not cheat by mistake.

>There is always a choice on what you willingly do to the other person and. Series of choices narrowing down the options available further. And with that choice of actually doing something to someone's body comes the responsibility to check for how that is received. 

I absolutely agree. Not checking for consent is a problem, and it's something both parties are responsible for, right along with clearly communicating consent. There is always a choice on what you communicate to a person, and if you choose to communicate that everything is fine even if you're a little uncomfortable, or the sex isn't that good, or you feel a little sick, or your vagina is getting kinda sore, or they are riding your dick in an uncomfortable way, etc, then that is consent for them to continue. 

>If you are an intimidating bloke, you should be aware you are intimidating and how that can affect people. If I am a 6'4 300 pound guy, I will damn sure not hold a stranger chick in the corner of a room alone and start undressing her. Unless she has been begging me to do so and we had an ongoing and mutual thing. I would approach her in a way that she cannot feel pressured whatsoever. Fuck it, I'd allow her to make a step. Even if by doing so I might miss out on some willing but shy sex, that is a small price to pay then to risk having even one chick feel forced to play along because I physically dominate her. Again, with power comes responsibility. And if it is in your power to dominate someone so they submit from coersion it ks your duty to manage that power. 

Lots of things can make someone intimidating. I'm sure guys are very intimidated by extremely beautiful women. Hell, I get intimidated by small guys with cute boyish smiles.  But yeah I agree if you're intimidating, don't do that kind of thing. That said, you do go after shy but consensual sex, you're an asshole, but not a rapist. 


>Just look at dogs who instinctively do this. An older or bigger dog will not play threateningly with a smaller dog/puppy. If the tiny dog gets actually scared and not play scared they back off. If a dog can do it so can a human. 

Yes. If the smaller dog communicates it's fear to the other dog, and the other dog picks up on it, it will back off. 

>But let's be serious here. I can't say I have met accidental bullies, nor accidental rapists. 

Exactly. You don't commit rape by accident. If you ignore signs of lack of consent, that's absolutely rape. 

>Rapists who coerce know exactly what they are doing. 

Yes

>If you are a guy who wants sex at all costs, you **will** make consent blurry by trying to make your date drink. You **will** hit o. A person you know, with whom you are intangled in a common friends group. Because everyone hates standing out or embarassing themselves by having their friends know every dirty intimate detail. You **will** manipulate verbally or ask repeatedly after several noes until the person submits (common psychological effect when badgered with the same question). You will physically prevent someone from moving but avoid actual harm. You will prey on people who are shy, unassertive and likely to fold under pressure.

Um no. The majority of people do no such thing no matter how much the want sex just like how the majority of people don't steal just because they want something and don't have the money. The people who do are criminals, in this case, rapists. 

(Although I'd point out that asking repeatedly is hardly manipulation. If you give consent just because someone asked over and over again, and you aren't in some kind if situation where you fear what the person might do if you say no, that's consent)

>Why? Because this gets you sex. Coherced sex but in the eyes of the people around you both went in the room, and she didn't fight back. Or said yes eventually

What's wrong with eventually saying yes? I've been in situations were someone hits on my repeatedly throughout the night and I slowly gain interest despite my previous lack of such. Maybe my friend went home with a guy and I feel lonely, maybe the hotter guys left. That's still consent. 

>Or was too drunk to handle a psychological manipulation.

Yeah alcohol is a huge problem in these situations I won't argue with that. 

>Because there won't be physical trauma, just psychological.

I would hesitate to call a less than desirable consensual one night stand ""psychological trauma""

>And because people will immediately focus on the victim's responsibilities and not the accused. Did she say no? Did she say no clearly enough? Did she fight back? Did she ask for a condom? Did she report right away? Was she crying when reporting? Why was she pretending to be happy at the party afterwards of ot wasn't just regret sex. 

I think that people will focus on both of their responsibilities, but because one is the 'victim', it will seem more directed at them because people won't find it hard to believe that the accused didn't live up to his responsibilities. But most of the things you listed there are completely irrelevant, and are not responsibilities of anyone involved in sex, which is clearly why you listed them, so your point stands on those counts. 

>So no, let's not muddy the waters and put all weight on the potential victims' shoulders.

Let's not. Let's put the weight were it belongs, which is a case to case issue. 

>It is everybody's responsibility to make sure consent is there.

And it's everybody's responsibility to make sure their partner is able to relatively easily determine consent is there. 

>err on the side of the fucking caution and either make sure or stop.

Absolutely. ",1,t3_265lim

As long as your partner really, truly cares about, your comfort is all that should matter.  My husband doesn't enjoy sex if I am uncomfortable in any way.  We will stop or adjust.  It's not a big deal in any way if things go awry no or years from now.  All that matters is that you and your partner are supportive of one another.

Sex for the first time is different for everyone.  A good rule of thumb, whether it is your first time or 100th time is to make sure you have some sort of foreplay to get you in the mood.  Or perhaps a little lube can speed things along if you feel you need the help.  Sex is a fun, funny, awkward thing we do that brings a great deal of intimacy and pleasure...or shenanigans.  Hopefully someday you can laugh about it.  I know it all new and you are probably very insecure about a lot of small things but as you get older and have more sex you will learn to be more at ease when things don't see to go perfect.

Not everyone bleeds a ton.  Some people do.  Our vajays are all different.  Don't be afraid to take some time to heal before having sex again.  It may still be uncomfortable or painful the next time, but try to relax and not tense up.  That can make it more painful for you.  For me, personally, it took a few months of sex to stop hurting.

He was embarrassed because he didn't finish, I was upset because I thought he was mad it didn't go well... it was just an awkward mess all around.

It's been almost three years since that happened, and I'm still with him and sex is fantastic. Sometimes we mention our horrible first time and laugh over how hilarious it is to look back on.

Now, this may be things that you already do - But this advice helped me out of exactly the same situation you were in. Basically you need to keep very clean down there, and let plenty on air into the area. 

Wear *cotton* panties - without panty lines is possible - your vulva needs air.

Sleep with *no pants or panties on*. Feels weird at first - but air to the affected area really helps.

Shower in the morning, *and after you have gone number two*. If you can't shower after going to the bathroom, wipe with wet pieces of toilet paper. 

Obviously wipe front to back - bacterial infection (even a minor imbalance) is very likely to be the problem. When you have had all these kinds of medication, your natural flora is messed up. That means you have to be extra cleanly.

And if you really are pregnant you don't have to have the baby. It's your choice what goes on in your body and if you aren't ready for kids now then you can terminate that pregnancy. 

It's going to be okay even if you are pregnant, which I think it's incredibly unlikely. Don't stress for a week over a test that can take all that away, if it shows positive that just means you need to see a doctor. ",1,t3_266krm

break-ups can be truly traumatizing, especially because you two dated for quite a while and seemed to have a special connection. it's okay to grieve, but try not to let your grief distort your thinking. if you believe in soulmates: clearly your ex isn't your soulmate, because if he was, you'd still be together. and if you don't believe in soulmates: chances are, there is someone else out there who you will fall in love with just as deeply and genuinely as you did with your ex.

i know it's easier said than done, but try not to focus too much on the past. what's done is done, but you can still decide your future. sit down and really consider whether or not you're ready to be dating yet. and regardless of what you conclude, continue to work on yourself and stay involved with family and friends.

20140521185731,ltl_ms_thrwaway,"Sorry for the epically long post but your question struck a chord with my and I want to save you 8 years of heartbreak.

In no uncertain terms: it will get better and you will find someone you will love (and who will love you) just as much, if not more.

Take it from a wizened old woman (at least in Internet time): When I was 18 I met and fell in love with the man who I was certain was the love of my life.  To me, ""Joe"" was perfection; an Adonis and Einstein rolled into one.  We had a wonderful relationship for 2 1/2 years before things ended; my fault but that is a story for another day.  

I was completely crushed and thought that at the ripe old age of 21 I would die alone and only be discovered 6 weeks later, half-eaten by my enclave of calicos. But I didn't.  I moved on.  It took a lot of time, tears, Oreos but I got better; some days were harder than others.  I had other relationships and things were going well for a while but I still had this nagging feeling that I had missed out on the one great love of my life. I made the terrible mistake of using ""Joe"" as my unit of measure against which I judged every man I dated and of course each would come up woefully short.  

After one particularly nasty break-up, ""Joe"" and I reconnected. I thought that this was my second chance at the fair tale I had clung to for the 6 years since our breakup! But ""Joe"" was just the shell of the man I knew; the kind, thoughtful man I knew was replaced with an ambivalent bro with a drinking problem. Departing for the walk of shame from ""Joe's"" apartment one morning I told him that he needed to call me, sober, the next time he wanted to spend time with me, to which he replied, ""Of course! I will call you tomorrow!"". I knew before the door closed behind me that those were the last words he would ever speak to me.  Yet, I was okay with it.  Perhaps because it finally clicked that all this time I was just in love with the beautiful 18 year old version of ""Joe"" or at best my dimly faded memory of him. 

I can't saw I will ever 100% get over him; he was my first real love and I will always love who he was.  But he isn't that person anymore and can never be that person again. There was a reason the two of you broke up in the first place. Relationships must be sustainable in the long-term and as brutal as it may sound it is better to rip the bandaid off now and end it than drag things along.

I will not lie; it may take you a lot of time to get over this guy and find the relationship you are looking for.  I recommend filling your time with friends, hobbies, work, or school.  Keep yourself too busy to think about anything but what you have in front of you.  Meditate.  There are points , post-""Joe"" break-up where I think I really should have talked to a therapist about my feelings; I think I would have accelerated the healing process.  Consider if this might be right for you. I promise you that you will get back to good.  You are not alone in your feelings and don't be afraid to acknowledge them but do not get quagmired by them.  It took a lot of awkward first dates and hours worrying that I would never find anyone but I am now engaged to an amazing man who I can truly say is the love of my life.  Just keep swimming, my dear!

TL;DR - It gets better!  There was a reason you broke up; remember that.  Mourn your loss but do not make yourself a martyr.  Do whatever constructive activities (yoga, painting, programming, etc.) you can think of you distract yourself from constantly thinking about you beau. When you are ready to open your heart again, love will find you. ",1,t3_265pfd

And it ended. Disastrously, I might add.

I was lucky enough to already have someone else who supported me and had already been enamoured of me for a while, and now we have a wonderful relationship.

But while I was still with my ex, I felt the same way you do now: afraid of being alone for a very long time. No one ever feels like your first.

So you know what? Rock being alone. That's right, go ahead and rock it. I wish I had time to be alone before dating my current boyfriend, because I honestly have no idea how to live my life as a single person. If you can do that, your relationships down the road will only benefit.

Have fun. Have friends. Find yourself, however you feel is right. And when you meet that special person, they will love you more than you ever thought was possible.

Good luck. :)

ALSO:  As a sidenote, don't worry about the ""click"". No checklists, no instant chemistry. I promise you, you will miss out on some amazing guys if you look for someone with the same feeling.

But the larger discussion here isn't about how to provide mental health services to people that need them (that's a whole other discussion that we SHOULD be having), this is about how to effectively run an institution of higher learning so that it best serves the overwhelming majority of students, faculty, and the demands of our society.

First off, it's interesting that someone thought this article was more appropriate to post to /r/TwoXChromosomes instead of say /r/psychology, /r/academia or any other subreddit related to the material.

Anyways... What people [identify](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2000-07436-018) with is truly remarkable, even when they have [overwhelmingly](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21359617) convincing [evidence](http://psi.sagepub.com/content/13/3/106.full) that their beliefs and behaviors are actually what's causing them more harm.

Certainly, it doesn't seem like ""such a big deal"" for a professor to list some things in the beginning of their syllabus that ""any rational person"" may recognize as ""complex"" subject matter that for some humans may be ""emotionally difficult.""

And... everything about that is exactly the problem. So, by making this kind of concession, you're actually opening up your professors, students, and your institution as a whole to possible legal liability.

Next, we have the ""any rational person"" argument. Someone with ""triggers"" is already not a ""rational person."" A [rational](https://www.google.com/search?q=rational&rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS569US569&oq=rational&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l3j69i60l2.774j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8_) person is one that isn't experiencing any ""behavior-inducing emotions."" Giving any official recognition to ""Triggerites"" (I'm not trying to be funny or insensitive, I literally have no idea if there's already a name that they prefer to use or not) then immediately exposes anyone else involved to a hazardous legal situation because everything then become defined by someone or someone's that are self-admittedly experiencing a completely subjective and irrational state.

Thirdly, since using the PTSD framework is the only way that any medical field has attempted to understand anything near this topic, that means that Triggerites (not to be confused with the relatively small percentage of PTSD sufferers that the above article identifies) are largely ""self-diagnosed.""

Ironically, you could legitimately have a situation where someone's ""trigger"" is other people having ""triggers.""

Education is difficult. Learning is difficult. Educators cannot teach and the majority of students cannot effectively learn in an environment that requires self-censorship extremes.

How long before the first Triggerite claims that because a university's ""Violence in Africa"" history class deals with trigger-inducing subjects for them, that the university is itself unlawfully discriminating against them simply by offering the class? You may think this is a [fallacious extreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum), but there is good precedence in U.S. law which shows that once ""legal momentum"" is generated, it continues until stopped by another ""legal force.""

How do you think someone would feel if they had to get up in the middle of class and walk out because it was ""rape discussion time"" or ""[talking about dads](http://i.imgur.com/2fTeo07.jpg)"" time? There is literally no way to make a positive education environment for people that make these demands (or require this level of emotional attention, whichever way you prefer to conceptualize it).

And, contrary to what many people in this comment section are advocating, education is not therapy. Education is a way to prepare people for living in the ""real world"" which is the same place that so criminally underprepared Triggerites to deal with the trauma that it (the real world again) dealt them.

The natural extent to which this system of trigger warnings escalates towards is:

**Education: Warning, actual information about objective reality may be discussed and/or encountered. If you have any emotional triggers, do not attend.**

There is no way that the above statement would not be interpreted by a Triggerite as being anything other than inherently discriminatory.

If someone's personal goal is to give infinite attention to each individual they meet in life, that's fine. I'd say possibly even admirable. But it isn't a mandate we can force everyone to follow.

However, when you're a profit-driven institution that's attempting to meet the demands of thousands of students using an assembly line-esque factory model, that level of attention is not possible.

Someone further down in the comments already stated, ""especially if your peers are invited to share their opinions on the subject. no rape victim wants to hear a bunch of uninformed college students talk about how false rape accusations are just as bad as actual rape, blah blah blah. it's uncomfortable and upsetting and really destructive to a learning environment.""

Nothing could be further from the truth. That person with that opinion actually exists. Learning how to constructively communicate with people of differing opinions is absolutely one of the most important aspects of a college education.

And, would that student be legally liable for ""triggering"" another student? Could that student suffer academic consequences for sharing their ""honest opinion?"" If this was the case, I sure know I'd prefer to pay for a class that advertised, ""No Triggerites Allowed,"" because it meant that I wouldn't be legally liable for mentioning something about cats when I was unaware that someone else in the class had a bad experience with a [cat](http://i.imgur.com/aZpSKZ0.jpg) once.

Sure, being in kindergarten that's paid for with public tax dollars in a country where the [average citizen is essentially below the average human ability level](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-adults-score-below-average-on-worldwide-competency-test-2013-10) and has all kinds of irrational beliefs that they force their government to try to ""educate around"" may be necessary, and is also probably one of the major reasons that Americans constantly underperform academically, but this isn't an optimal way to educate.

Lastly, there's also the issue of whether or not we as a society want to allow the acceptance of this behavior to grow. And [grow it does](/r/TumblrInAction). Certainly, allowing people to connect their identity to their trauma is bad for the individual as one of the studies referenced in the original piece found. Even more troubling is how humans seem to be inherently programmed to use memes. This is especially disadvantageous as people adopt ""negative memes"" and then define their [society](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/lewisconfession.html) and [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture) based on those memes (and yes, one of those links is about how teenage girls ""having some sport"" because they were ""bored"" led to women being burned at the stake. That is a real thing. That happened, and no, it shouldn't come with a ""trigger warning."" Reality is more important than how anyone feels about it).

Education is all about empowering people. Sadly, despite what many others believe, empowerment doesn't come from demanding that others work around your sensibilities and limitations. Empowerment comes by developing the skills necessary to thrive in any environment.",2,t3_265ngy
20140522134924,Babbit_B,"""Triggerite"". Cute.

I can certainly identify with frustration when people attempt to shut down discussion of X or Y subject because ""it's triggering"" - and I say that as someone who, setting PTSD aside, has a whole host of phobias that mean there are things I'd prefer not to see represented from...I dunno. Spiders to sponges. 

Taking that as a model, I'm certainly not going to shriek oppression if I stumble onto a thread called ""Fluffy Kittens"" and it's full of spiders - much less so if I click on a thread called ""Huge Spiders"" and it's full of spiders. Nor am I going to lose my shit if I attend a university where they advertise a course called ""Spider Snogging 101"" (gag). I just won't sign up for it. However, in the first case at least, I don't see how it's imposing on anyone or censoring anyone to ask if they wouldn't mind naming the thread ""Fluffy Kittens (TW: It's actually huge spiders) so I can refrain from clicking in the first place rather than clicking and then doing the spider dance for twenty minutes.

Now, surely this should be extended to the scenario we're discussing. In a women's studies course, you can sensibly expect there to be discussion of rape, and in a law course about violent crime, you can sensibly expect there to be discussion of assault and murder, in the same way I'd expect pictures of spiders on the Huge Spiders thread. In a literature course, it might be kind (which I realise is not the same thing as necessary, but I don't think it's a bad goal) to offer a trigger warning for a text that involved a graphic description of sexual assault, warfare or other common PTSD triggers.",3,t3_265ngy

That's your problem. It's incredibly annoying to tell someone they're attractive then hear them say ""No I'm not."" If he didn't think you were pretty, he wouldn't have complimented you (or married you) in the first place. I understand you might not *feel* pretty when he compliments you, but you need to learn to bite back your initial reaction and just smile and thank him for the compliment. It'll make you both feel happier-- him because his compliment is being accepted graciously and not just pushed away, and you because I think you'll find that if you stop calling yourself 'not pretty' you're going to begin to feel prettier.",3,t3_265j8v

Like I said, he clearly does... or he wouldn't be complimenting you. Even if you don't agree with him, honestly I think it's rude to just retort to a compliment with ""No I'm not."" You could at least say, ""Aw, thanks for complimenting me. I don't feel so hot right now but I'm glad you think I do!"" 

If you want him to compliment you when you're all dolled up, then tell him! He's not a mind reader! Just say something like, ""Hey I really appreciate when you compliment me but I would appreciate it if you told me I looked nice a little more often when I get dressed up.""",2,t3_265j8v

Let's a look at some examples.  Internet atheism is a good one.  In real life, these atheists go to work, go to class, pay bills, and live a very similar life to a believer.  But if you look at the internet atheist, it is ""GOD is a faggot and the people that believe in it are st00pid, Christmas isn't even the real birthday, I eat children because I'm evil lol.""  

Next up, take a look at the liberal/conservative INTERNET views.  In real life, a conservative may support gay marriage.  A liberal may wish for tax cuts.  But not on the internet, because it makes everyone into a radical warrior.  Unless you are down with a $15 minimum wage, single-payer healthcare, and basic income, then you are not a liberal.  If you think that a dude should be able to marry his boyfriend, or that businesses can be dicks, then you are not a conservative.  Because of the anonymity that the internet provides, liberals = libtards and conservatives = racist hicks.

The theory is that words like Congress*man*, alder*man*, police*man* and council*man* make those professions of power less available and attainable in the minds of young girls who may want to be those things. The truth behind the words is that the ""-man"" ending on words in English only means ""-person"" and does not actually have a male or female connotation, just like in our word ""mankind."" This could be seen as an example of what you call **""whiners can't be bothered to do a quick google search to find out the actually definition""**.

If we know that gendering words has the power to cause harm, then why is the evil force that is designed to oppress half of the world's population named after men? (patriarchy) And why is the positive, benevolent force that fights to free those oppressed named after only women? (feminism). This implicates all men in the oppression and turns any woman into an admirable freedom fighter. 

The civil rights movement in the 50's and 60's in the United States did not name themselves ""Blackists"" as if they wanted to take a white America and turn it black for themselves. They called it ""human/civil rights"" so as to take an America that was already both black AND white and make it more fair for everyone. Just so, we should call feminism something that does not sound like taking an ""evil male patriarchy"" and feminizing it, but something that takes the diverse world we already have and makes it fair for everyone.

One of the great thing about social progress is that feminism is part of mainstream public discourse these days. I've been following feminism for about 20 years and the inclusion of feminist voices in mainstream media, particularly in the last five years or so, has grown incredibly.

Not a day goes by when I don't see a feminist opinion piece or feminist issue raised in national or regional newspapers or on evening television news. These voices are loud and present. I struggle to see how prominent feminists who appear almost daily in the media are somehow less loud than anonymous Tumblrinas or commenters in /r/feminism (which isn't anywhere near as radical as most Redditors would have everyone believe).

Rarely does anyone on Reddit actually name a feminist, they just point to Tumblr or SRS. No one knows the name of ""Big Red"" and they point to one protest of a Warren Ferrell event which, if they watched the video of the event itself, would hear Warren Ferrell state he's only ever been protested against once before in his professional career.

Feminism has always had this myth surrounding it about being anti-men, anti-feminine, anti-sex, humourless and angry. I used to think those things too before actually reading feminists texts, and realised that it's incongruent with the vast majority of the movement.

 false rape accusations are terrible and wrong and their discussion is important. I'm just concerned about *how many* posts there are about it and none about, well, those people who get actually raped.

If virginity were really that special, men would be focusing equally on men's purity. The fact that they zero in on women instead tells me everything I need to know about it: absolute bs.",3,t3_266vwr

You'll never get her to change her beliefs - they're probably too sunken and, in fairness to your mother, probably very applicable to the world she lived in as a young woman. Thank goodness the world has moved on since then. But it's not too late to start setting boundaries. Think about the topics of conversation that are off-limits to her. Your relationship/sex-life, for starters. If she tries to bring it up, say 'I am not going to talk about this with you'. If she persists, you say 'I will hang up the phone/leave this house if you don't stop it'. And follow through.

I am still a Christian but much more liberal in my beliefs. I recently brought up the idea of moving in with my boyfriend to save money (even mentioning that I'd move in his guest room), and my parents flipped. I told them I was just THINKING about it, and they acted like I was already devaluing myself. My dad asked if my bf and I had had sex. I wanted to say that was none of his business, but I lied and said no... I'm 26 years old. I was expecting more of a, ""We don't think it's a good idea, but you're an adult..."" I'm still struggling to assert my beliefs and opinions around my parents, but it's a work in progress.

I am so sorry about what happened to you. Without knowing your mother, I'm guessing she's coming from a place of love and concern but is instead repeating the lie that was passed down to her by her parents/society. Unfortunately, it sounds like she severely damaged your trust and it will take time to build that up again. I know how painful and scary it can be to stand up to your parents and be completely honest, but I do think it's important. I would encourage you to write a letter to your mom about how she made you feel. That way, you can get all your thoughts out without worrying about losing the nerve to say it when you're face to face.

There was a time when I just kept my feelings to myself, and lied when need be, because I knew from experience that my mother didn't want my honesty, she wanted my compliance.  Over the years though, as I've gotten older, braver, and just more secure in my own opinions and beliefs, I have gradually moved into a more ""adult"" relationship with my family, simply by setting boundaries.  If there is something we disagree on, I say ""I know we disagree, but this is how I feel/what I believe.""  And while I don't mind talking with them about why I believe what I do, I make it clear that it has to be a two sided discussion, and I refuse to engage if I'm just being fussed at.  

One of the most empowering realizations for me was that as an adult, I had the power to walk away.  If I needed to, I could get in my car and go home.  Not that I have ever had to do that, but just knowing I have that freedom allows me to hear them out without getting upset, and allows me to love them for who they are, not who I wish they were.

As for being honest about sex, my hat is off to you. :)  I've only been sexually active for the last year (related to said conservative upbringing) but I would not tell my parents.

Your mom needs to get over herself.  Please don't change who you are for her preferences.  You've been granted a life of your own. It's a wonderful gift!  Don't waste it by letting your mom live both hers and yours.  She's got her own life to lead.  That's her gift from the world.  She's trying to be greedy by having more than one.  

Don't let her!

You are your own person, not an extension of your mother.  And God DEFINITELY isn't punishing you for not showing blind obedience to your mom.  It's troubling to hear her take the lord's name in vain in that regard.  I'm not religious but even I know.  

She should absolutely know better!  This is a direct violation of the third commandment!  She is literally taking the lord's name and using it for her own vanity, equating God's goals with her own!  Indefensible for anyone who is a true believer!

Your mom has her own hypocrasies to worry about, just like any person.  Don't let her talk down to you from the pulpit.  You are an adult now with just as valid an opinion on any matter as she has.  Act like it, stand up for yourself, and don't be surprised when she lashes out from seeing her position challenged.

This rebellion is important though.  Just like cellular mitosis, you've got to distinguish yourself as an individual entity before you can lead your own life.

20140522130701,Gosset,"I struggled with PTSD and several other health issues and was in a immensely difficult space after having flash backs and hallucinations and coming to terms with the fact I was abused during my childhood. 

During this time my mother was no helps what-so-ever and it really affected me and my ability to say no and tell others what I wanted and need.

The first thing I have to say is you have to no you're a person and entitled to your own beliefs and needs. If you NEED something then you can't let other people (within reason) tell you otherwise. This is anything from your sexual needs (as long as its safe, sane and consensual crack on) to emotional needs.

This being said she's a person too and it took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I wasn't helping the horrible situation between my mother and me. I needed to be open and honest and accept she was the way she was. Once I'd accepted that occasionally she was going to be stubborn and wouldn't always understand my needs it became a lot easier to handle. I stopped asking myself ""Why arn't you supporting me and being such a cunt?"" and started realizing that with patience and persistance I could get my point across and it eventually came to a point where we madea break through after months of being patient in which she said ""I know I've been an ass and I can't cope with what you went through, I'm trying but it's difficult because I feel responsible and I don't want to think someone hurt my baby girl. You're not my baby girl anymore but I can't help but think about you that way. I know you don't want a job right now but I didn't have many of the opportunities you had and it hurts to think my bright baby would waste her potential. I know you'll get to it in your own time but if you could be patient with me I'll try my best to help you as I can""

It was the best thing that's happened between us; being honest and open and realizing that allthough we're meant to be there for each other all the time as family we can't always do that and being honest means we can get past both of our shortcomings.

If you feel you can't open up through talking my best advice would be to write a letter and explain you're point of view. But sometimes it's just best to accept them for who they are; avoid some things until their ready and take a gentle stance on what matters.

That's actually not surprising, if you get this kind of dogmatic all-or-nothing stuff from your mom regularly.  People who are all-or-nothing are often really loud about it and really good at shutting other people down, especially if they are an authority figure and you are being raised in a family system they control.  It makes it really hard for the rest of us to explore nuanced points of view.

What I found (similar mom) is that trying to address what she'd already said was pointless.  I waited until the next time I had some outrageous behavior to report (that I didn't want to lie about or that I thought was pertinent to conversation in some way or because I wanted to disagree with her) and made a conscious effort to listen to an equal number of minutes as what I'd just used up (which was usually 2-5 minutes).

If she tried to start it again later (usually on the phone), I practiced ""gotta go, bye!"" (I'd heard other people do this successfully by then) in my head and then learned to apply to mom in real life.

Our relationship thereby began to get better.  There was a sort of dull, sour period before it did, but by the time she was 70 and I was 38, it was much better.  I'm glad I stuck it out with my mom, in the end.  She was lied to and heavily shaped by her own sucky family.",1,t3_266vwr

The problem is what to do/how to act if they go against what you feel if right and correct.

What your parents have done is to create an atmosphere where they have forced you to lie to them about what is going on in your life.

My advice to you would be to ask your mother what kind of relationship she would like to have with you from this point forward.  Does she want a relationship where you feel safe to come to her and tell her what is going on in your life or does she want a relationship where you hide everything from her?  The ball is in her court...give her her options and make her decide.  You are no longer under her control, you are the one in control of the relationship...make that clear.

It does become a fine line though.  I have always been 100% truthful with my children (now 26, 22 and 19) about my feelings on sex and drugs and my experiences with both when I was their ages.

I did buy my sons condoms before they were sexually active just so they would have access without feeling “weird” about asking or having to go buy themselves.  I just bought them and left them in their rooms…no conversation, just in a bag along with their deodorant or whatever.

I always told them that while I DIDN'T think they were old enough, I wanted them to have protection and the knowledge needed to make the right decision for themselves.

It was the same thing with drinking or drugs, I didn't WANT them to smoke pot or get drunk BUT that I wasn't stupid and I know they would probably try it…IF they did I wanted them to call me and not try ti hide it and drive under the influence.  They wouldn't get IN TROUBLE, but that there would be some consequences.  Like the first time my oldest got drunk, I woke him up the next morning at 7 AM and made him mow the lawn with a hangover…oh well like I said…consequences!

Anyway back to the fine line.  Now my kids are like I said 26, 22 and 19 and they tell me everything and sometimes I think…wow do I REALLY want to know that???

When you talk to your mother, know that was she is looking for are signs that her daughter is healthy. The best way to do this is make the conversation reassuring to her about your health (mental, sexual, whatever, mothers aren't allowed to talk to you about this but they worry about it constantly and it manifests itself as compulsive and overbearing behavior).

As an exercise I would consider writing a speech to your mother where you are only allowed to mention topics your mother is concerned about. It can be entirely your own words and your own experience, but your not going to throw ALL of the ugly facts in her face (because this will upset her) only the ones that give her anxiety. Tell her you value yourself, that no one else is going to get that intimate with you again soon without earning a lot of your respect, and that you think your relationships are meaningful.

Remember who you are to your mother. When you speak to her she does not see an outspoken young women, but instead she sees the child that she is so concerned about. She's not worried about all women who sleep with men, she's worries specifically about you. If you talk to your mother about the issues a mother worries about you'll be able to get past her anxiety much easier. Remember that your relationship with your mother is firstly for the family, and your own personal beliefs come 2nd. What's important to her is the family is healthy.

This is typical small town school politics run amok. Conservative districts  are influenced by the surrounding society- it's very likely that teachers and kids attend churches in a place like this and that churches influence the local social systems-and it comes down to a teacher who subscribes to the ""punish the girl (and in this case her child too) for having sex"" belief system being a holy hypocrite on facebook (though I do realize there is no express mention of the teacher's religion or lack of- it just isn't a stretch, because the idea that this girl is setting a bad example is definitely connected to the fact that she had sex, and the child is the evidence of such on display- these are the ways that a small minded and heavily religious community perceive a young woman who becomes a mother while still in high school.   As if leaving her name out of your post makes a difference! 

Thankfully, there was no facebook when I was a kid in a podunk school district in the 1980s. I knew teachers like this one. I was made to go to church, and there were two little busy body teachers there who were terribly concerned for my soul (and my hymen) when I was at school. 

Edit: I know I'm going off in several directions at once, but I think the religiosity of a location affects even those who don't attend the churches, since there is a push to spread the particular vision of morality that is held by these groups, and they have a lot of influence on small towns and often schools.

The teacher comes back the boy and two girls go to the office start explaining everything yada yada then on the bus home (don't know why he wasn't sent home immediately) he says he is going to kill them all again and especially one of the girls who is my neighbor. So our neighbors call in to the school and ask if anything is being done to protect their daughter and take this kid out from the kids the school acts like my neighbors are crazy and over reacting and tell them they will handle it. So then the next day the school administration talks with the class and tells them its their fault for making this a big deal for telling their parents and everything and that they can't tell their own fucking parents what is going on,  now the kids won't tell their parents what is going on. Like where does the school have the authority to tell kids to not tell their parents what is going on, the school is handling this in the worst way possible. Another great example is my mom works inside the classrooms as a reading aide helping slower reading kids in a small group so she was in a first grade class and she over hears the teacher yelling at a kid my mom looks over and sees the teacher just laying into this kid screaming at him this is one of the things she was saying, ""you are the laziest kid ever doesn't anyone at your house care about you or love you?!""

It's not wrong to think that, but it might be illegal for your company to act on that. 

Firing someone because she's taking time off during a pregnancy invites a lawsuit.  You say that you are not legally entitled to days off, maternity leave, etc.  You only need 50 employees to be covered by FMLA. You only need 15 to be covered by the ADA (pregnancy might be a perceived or actual disability) and by Title VII (gender discrimination).

All the Sister1/Sister2 drama aside, I would start looking for employment elsewhere.  Don't make a big production about it...don't let on that you are unhappy in your current position, just start looking, get all your ducks in a row, and then resign on good terms.

First of all, at your current company, you are not ""legally...entitled for days off, maternity leave etc.""?  No bueno.  I'm guessing this small company has an informal, non corporate operation.  That has its advantages (more personal, less bureaucracy, family atmosphere), BUT, that informal/non corporate culture is also the same thing that enables Sister1/Sister2 to carry on as unprofessionally as they have been.  I'm guessing your company doesn't have a formal HR department or IT department?

Your supervisor brought in a temp to make up for Sister2's slacking.  OK.  So did anyone ever sit down with Sister2 to discuss her absences?  Did anyone ever sit down with both Sister1 and Sister2 to discuss their job performance?  Does your company do performance evaluations?  I'm guessing the answer is NO to all of the above.  What it sounds like to me is that since nobody in your company is a formal HR professional, nobody is comfortable reprimanding/warning employees, so they come up with band-aid solutions like hiring per diems.  That doesn't solve the root issue of Sister2's work ethic.

I've worked with several pregnant women in several different companies.  None of them behaved like Sister1/2.  My pregnant friend commuted 1.5 hours from NJ to her demanding NYC job via walking/bus/subway right up until, like, 2 weeks before she gave birth.  The only instance I've encountered of a pregnant woman taking it easier than normal on the job was one coworker who started taking the elevator from floor to floor in her last trimester, as opposed to the stairs.  THAT'S IT.  Nobody was taking extra breaks, extra days off, surfing the internet, shopping for onesies.  Sister1/2's pregnancies have nothing to do with their work ethic.

Every woman is different. Some women have very difficult pregnancies and by comparing them to your friend makes it unfair to women who just physically can't be fully competent in a work environment or require more time off.

I also, and this is my opinion, is if you can handle the morning sickness and can stay home from work because you faint while pregnant or have loose frequent bowel movements, then do so, don't mess around with anti-whatever medications that have unknown consequences.

You may do better in a different sort of office or other work environment.

I spent ten years in a small business- a sales office with no more than 8 employees including the boss. This office had an open floor plan- no walls, no cubicles- just an open albeit L-shaped room. This meant there was no privacy at all, and when someone did need that five or ten minute mental break, others could see them and see if they were internet surfing or texting or doing anything besides working. It also meant we heard each other on the phone with clients and vendors. It was a highly critical atmosphere. It brought out the worst in everyone- including me. I found myself spending too much time thinking about the people at work. There were some really extreme extremes that occurred in this office. The kinds of things that happened there don't happen many places one might work. I am referring to physical violence, verbal abuse, public humiliation, and more. Without getting specific about those instances (I have in plenty of other posts, and there's just too many crazy things to list) I mention them only to say that this office I worked in was on the extreme spectrum of what sorts of shit lies beneath the banal surface of the small time sales office. This environment was toxic beyond your wildest imaginings of an office. It was terrible for my health in several ways. If I were you, I would look elsewhere.

A boss that knows something is wrong and does nothing at all about it is going to be frustrating - even if they have a legal reason for it, like waiting for a bad employee to no longer be pregnant, or in my case- I got to endure a painful 6 months wherein we all knew the young employee in the office was screwing the old man at the biggest client's office. My boss waited a miserable 6 months because it was enough time for the old man to get tired of the girl and not take his business elsewhere when she was fired. During that 6 months, I got to endure whispering in the break room, collusion between her and the other younger ladies in the office- as if we had no clue they all partied with Mr. Moneybags and that tons of whispering in a supposedly professional office is normal... sexy Halloween costumes specifically engineered for taking cell phone pics and sending them to the old man (she was a sexy football player- of his favorite NFL team), her coming to work with hickies from an old man on her neck- and her fights with her young husband bleeding into the office. 

Anyway - like I said, ten years of this...at the end of ten years I was an overweight smoker with no energy. Now I'm a much healthier weight, no longer smoke, and work in a job that requires both physical and mental agility and work. I am a lot happier.",2,t3_26794m

There's always a middle ground, like asking your bridesmaids to wear black dresses - that way they can either wear one that they already have or can pick one up for cheap.  Most women who agree to be bridesmaids expect to pay SOMETHING, but I agree that it shouldn't be too much.  

In my case, I told my bridesmaids that I could afford to give them $100 towards their dresses and them let them pick them out - they each ended up paying an additional ~$30 towards the dresses because the ones that they liked the best were over $100, but there were other options under $100 they could have chosen if money were an issue.",2,t3_266puo

My bridesmaids and I have been best friends since high school. College, relationships, and life in general has scattered us to the far corners of the state, and my very best friend is far out of state. It sucks. I don't have very many other friends, but we've fought to keep in touch and see each other as often as we can. Those girls are gold.

We've been promising each other a girls weekend for some years now, but life always gets in the way. When I got engaged, I told the Maid of Honor, ""I love you. I don't care that you can't help with the planning. I don't care what you wear. All I want is for you to confer with the girls and make that weekend happen for all of us, and stand with me on my wedding day.""

I knew asking my girls to go to New Orleans for three days was a lot. We are seasoned travelers and know how to have a great time on a tiny budget. I would NEVER expect them to pay for my portion of the hotel, meals, burlesque class, drinks (beyond our normal system of taking turns) or anything else. 

They all have a decent selection of dresses ready to wear in their closet, and are fully capable of doing their own hair, makeup, and accessorizing. I trust them completely, and I know they are going to be beautiful.

$250 is not..unheard of for a bridesmaid dress. But *my wedding dress* was less than $100.

I would talk to the bride. Be honest and tell her you can't afford the dress, and give her ideas of similar dresses that are more friendly to your budget.

>Individuals with this disorder usually suffer from 2 or more psychiatric disorders. Thus, 2 years after therapy, even though two-thirds achieve diagnostic remission and significant increases in quality of life, 53% are neither employed nor in school, and 39% are still receiving psychiatric disability financial support. Pharmacotherapy can exert a modest beneficial effect on some core traits of borderline personality disorder.

>These emotionally unstable individuals need a long-term mentor to establish a stable, supportive relationship in which clear and consistent boundaries are established. This mentor must have the patience and strength to withstand the patient's many crises and limit-testing episodes. Communication should always be clear, honest, optimistic and directed towards teaching more mature coping skills. This mentor could be a primary care physician, or some other qualified therapist. 

.

This is purely my opinion, as I know almost nothing about the disease itself, but reading about it, three things come *immediately* to my mind:



1.  For this to work, she must be in therapy.  She needs a safe place to run to when things get too tough.  I would assume that it would be a mistake for this ""place"" to be you, because you're emotionally invested and probably can't distance yourself from the situation enough to help her.  So your primary concern should be that she is in constant therapy and meds (if prescribed).  Don't fall for the ""I don't need meds / I'm OK / Therapy isn't working, etc.""  Your relationship with her, in my opinion, should be contingent to her promise to stay in therapy and follow the treatments prescribed.

2. Talk to her doctors about children.  Is it advisable to have them?  Are there risks?  Be prepared to and make sure both of you can live with the answers that you get,

3. Take a good introspective look into your heart knowing that this is long term and that it is incurable.  It concerns me a little bit that you wrote this post because she was screaming.  I don't want to be judgmental. especially about something I don't understand quite well, but I think that there's a possibility that she will scream a lot.  Are you the person who is going to be there when things get really tough?  Can you take it?  The last thing she needs is a person walking in and out of a relationship with her, but you have to worry about yourself too.  You must know that relationships are hard, and yours will be harder than most.  This is a big responsibility. Don't kid yourself into thinking this isn't going to take a toll on you.  It will.  The question that needs to be answered with the utmost honesty here is:  Can you take it?


If you can, let me tell you, she is a damn lucky girl.  I admire you and wish you both all the luck in the world.  And one last thought:  Don't forget to take care of yourself.  Rightfully so, the assumption is that she will be the one who will be mostly taken care of, so make sure you have a support group and positive, encouraging people around you.  Ask for help when you need it and try to be involved in something you're really passionate about, so that you too, have a safe place to turn to when things get too tough.",9,t3_266uxp

I'm just projecting here from very little info, but I'm actually wondering whether OP would give himself permission to leave if it became necessary somewhere down the line.  I know a couple of very codependent couples where one partner's stuff is frankly out of control, and the other partner just sits there and tolerates it because that's just how things are.  It can take years to get to that state and then you don't realize how much you are putting up with.  (""We can't have people over because it upsets Dad to have people in his space, and then he will yell at us"" -- this is not the kind of thing normal people think, but it was absolutely status quo in my family.  I still can't believe the kind of crap I had to deal with, and then unlearn as an adult.)

20140522130030,Magdalena42,"Really sorry this is so long.  While it’s really difficult to give solid advice on the internet (and while I would caution you to be wary of getting mental health advice on the internet), I have some experience working with individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).  That being said, I am certainly not an expert in this disorder.  Every case is different, just like every person is different—symptoms and their severity vary, treatment options and coping skills are not universal, and the trauma history and other factors that contribute to development of this disorder are different for everyone.  I can only tell you, in a very general way, what I’ve learned through my work experience. 
	
A supervisor of mine once aptly described living with BPD this way:

“Imagine having no skin.  Every touch, every movement, everything, hurts.  People with [BPD] have no emotional skin.”

BPD can come with constant fear of abandonment or rejection, paranoia, emotional instability, and outwardly inappropriate emotional responses (among other things).  People who suffer from BPD often express suicidal ideation, attempt/complete suicide, and/or engage in self-harming behavior (which has no lethal intent).  Rates of completed suicide for individuals with BPD are between four and nine percent.  Unfortunately, many individuals with BPD will frequently express suicidal ideation or make suicidal gestures without actual intent to complete suicide for secondary gain of some kind (to prevent a perceived or threatened abandonment; to get admitted to a hospital where they will receive lots of care and attention from staff; to “show” someone how much they were hurt by their behavior; etc.).  This is dangerous for two reasons:  (1) it can result in genuine expression of suicidal ideation being minimized or ignored by mental health providers and (2) gestures can unintentionally result in actual lethal harm due to unforeseen circumstances.  

Having a loved one with BPD (or a personality disorder of any kind) can be extremely challenging.  Many mental health providers (outpatient therapists, etc.) refuse to work with this population because of the high demands on a provider’s time and attention, and the huge risks involved (high rates of completed suicide, etc.).  But when you love someone with a mental illness, you don’t really have the choice to just walk away (at least, not without causing extreme emotional pain to you and to them).  

I would recommend finding a support group in your local area for family members and friends of individuals with personality disorders.  You can do this by consulting your local NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter, or by contacting a local hospital.  You need to take care of your own needs first.  That may sound heartless, but there’s some metaphor about not being able to pour water from an empty jug (you can’t care for someone else if you have nothing left in you).

I would also recommend doing some reading on this condition.  A book I have heard is quite helpful (and co-authored by an individual with BPD, if I remember correctly) is called Stop Walking on Eggshells: Taking Your Life Back When Someone You Care About Has Borderline Personality Disorder.  There is also a separate workbook.  *DISCLAIMER* I have not actually read this book.  I’ve just heard good things, particularly from a friend whose mother had a diagnosis of BPD.  Other books I’ve heard good things about is I Hate You, Don’t Leave Me, and When Hope is Not Enough.

Now, there’s good news and bad news.

Good news:
BPD is treatable!  In fact, it’s highly treatable (some studies estimate as many as 70% of BPD sufferers are able to find relief from their symptoms).

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) has been found to be very effective for symptom management.  It focuses on grounding techniques, distress tolerance, and emotional regulation (among other things).

Furthermore, symptoms of BPD tend to naturally decline with age.

People with BPD are not monsters, or evil.  They can be incredibly loving, and creative, and kind, and fun, and intelligent.  There are so many good things, all of which I’m sure you recognize in your girlfriend and love about her.

Bad news:
She has to want to participate in treatment (like any other kind of mental health treatment).

This is not going to be easy, and if she is totally unwilling to examine her own behavior, or to make any effort to change, well…  it’s time to consider moving on.

No one wants to have BPD, and many times the alarming behavior exhibited by individuals with this condition is totally and completely out of their control.  However, it CAN BE in their control.  It’s a long and hard road.  There will be setbacks, and discomfort, and struggle.  I’m not sure if she has a trauma history (generally people with BPD do, but not always), or if that history has ever really been addressed, but it will need to be, and that can be seriously painful.  

One more thing:  Are you sure she has BPD?  Has she been officially diagnosed?  Is she in treatment?

*TL;DR:  BPD is treatable, if you’re willing to put in the time and effort and stick it out.  Practice some self care, learn what you can about the condition, and stay strong!*

I appreciate your quote ""Imagine having no skin. Every touch, every movement, everything, hurts. People with [BPD] have no emotional skin.""

Read the account of why she fled drunk:


"" This case arises out of a domestic assault incident that took place over Memorial Day weekend in 2011. Appellant Jennifer Marie Axelberg (Axelberg), her husband Jason Axelberg (Jason), and two of their friends were staying at a lake cabin in Mora. On Sunday night, Axelberg and Jason were drinking at the nearby Fish Lake Resort. After they returned to the cabin, Axelberg and Jason started to argue while they were outside the cabin. Jason pushed Axelberg and hit her twice on the head. Fearing for her safety, Axelberg got into her car and locked the doors. Axelberg retreated to the car because she felt that it was the only safe place available to her. Axelberg did not believe she could outrun her husband. And she could not go inside the cabin, because Jason was between her and the cabin. Finally, Axelberg could not call for help, because Jason had her cell phone. Even after Axelberg got into the car, Jason continued to yell at her and started hitting the car’s windshield. Eventually, Jason climbed onto the car, started screaming, and broke the windshield with his fist. Axelberg then started the car. Jason was still on 3 top of the car, but he eventually climbed off as Axelberg started driving. Jason ran after Axelberg, yelling. Axelberg drove nine-tenths of a mile to Fish Lake Resort, the closest open business. Jason and one of the friends then walked to the resort, where Jason again confronted Axelberg in the parking lot. Someone at the resort called 911.""

Given the circumstances, it's hard to see her as being in the wrong.""


By the way I lost a cousin to a drunk driver and I myself was rear ended by a drunk driver while I was riding a bike at age 14 years.

I still prefer she drove away drunk than got killed by a husband.

Its almost as if because she was drunk (as was her husband) that she deserved to be killed by her husband.

As for my favorite Mn Supreme justice Alan Page:

""
Among the dissenters was Justice Alan Page, who wrote that the court had in essence concluded that losing the privilege to drive is a small price to pay for saving one’s life. In doing so, it failed to adhere to case law and “the constitutional mandate to do justice,” he wrote.

The court’s decision implies “that the necessity defense is unavailable not only in cases of domestic abuse, but also in cases in which a victim’s seeking refuge from a violent physical or sexual assault or kidnapping, and the court’s decision thus discourages those individuals from seeking shelter in a motor vehicle as well,” Page wrote.""

OP quoted one of the dissenting justices:

>“that the necessity defense is unavailable not only in cases of domestic abuse, but also in cases in which a victim’s seeking refuge from a violent physical or sexual assault or kidnapping, and the court’s decision thus discourages those individuals from seeking shelter in a motor vehicle as well”

I don't think this ruling actually negates the necessity defense, I think it says that the necessity defense is not carte blanche to take actions that endanger other people. But the potential to discourage people from seeking refuge from abuse is the a real concern here. I really don't think there's a good ruling here; to me it's a question of the lesser evil, and I'm really not sure which ruling is the lesser evil here.

I want to wear hijab but it's extremely difficult because of the way people treat you and react to it in some places. I will be out with my bf any day and no problem at all. If I decide to put a scarf that day around my hair, I can get dirty looks and some people even look at my bf like he's somehow a bad person. I don't want to wear hijab full time because I am not by my behavior a good example of a Muslim person and do not want to act badly with a hijab on which would cause bad publicity for the rest of the Muslims. If they see you do something stupid, then you are a stupid person. If they see you doing something stupid with a hijab on, then it's somehow your religions fault.

If someone dramatically changes their hairstyle, it can make them difficult to recognize.

In some African countries the girls shave their heads and the boys sometimes grow it in locks. I know in Ivory Coast to go to some schools you actually need to shave your head if you're a girl.  For the Sikhs people of India hair is not to be cut and gets very long, therefore being wrapped into cloth turbans around the head. Some country whose name escapes me at the moment, in South America has a lot of women never or very very rarely cutting their hair so a usual display is a lot of women with below hip level hair. 

All around the world hair is worn and shown differently. Russian orthodox churches actually wear ""hijabs"" during their services. 

I don't think it's fair to focus on one type of hair garb and deem it problematic just because it makes some people uncomfortable. I can understand a greater discomfort towards the niqab and burqa as even to me personally it's a bit weird but I realize that it's normal to them and if they so chose to clothe themselves then that absolutely doesn't concern me. 

What I don't understand is why there is so much concern with identification. You still see the person's face, which with the hair are the only things an above neck ID picture will show. And besides it's not like in North America the majority of muslimas wear all black long robes, it's a colorful blend of local fashion and Islamic dress and beautiful shaylas, Amina, pashmina and cashmere scarves. It's not restrictive in fabrics, colors, patterns or thickness. You don't have to listen to what some imam in the other part of town thinks of whether you wear pants or not, you pray 5 times a day and you decide for yourself where your personal limits are regarding clothing. We don't receive pamphlets every month on what's allowed or not.

Even if you're wearing the niqab in Saudi Arabia there is a line for niqabi ladies to get ID'd by female officers. you have to prove your identity some way or another.

What is beyond bewildering is how the population likes to scream that the terrorists are being accommodated. There was a hair salon where the old owner, a white atheist man, opened up the back of his store to be renovated and put curtains so if Muslim women wanted a haircut they could come to his salon and have it done with a female hair dresser. Most of his salons employees were already females and they would just rotate depending on the clients.

The media went nuts

If it was federally required for identification purposes in legal documents, absolutely I would remove my top, and so would my sisters (then again, been screened in airport security lately?). Just two months ago I was asked to remove my cross necklace to take a picture for health insurance renewal (which I must remember you doesn't even HIDE anything - or is it different because it's a dominant religion here?). Did I make a fuss about it? No. Of course there isn't anything wrong with doctors wearing a hijab - that was not my point, I'm fine (hell I even think it's a good idea to avoid contamination - like the hair nets in food joints). But it's NOT fine to hide parts of the head for identification purposes, ESPECIALLY for religious purposes. And no, there isn't a crisis - neither did I say so I think.  

What I don't believe truly is the real choice part. Wearing it because it's part of your religion IS a choice (as you could just stop practicing so vehemently). But that's like saying that because a hockey fan believes that wearing his helmet everywhere will help his team he's exempt for it - and THAT is consistency of belief and actions, federally. You don't exempt people from rules and laws because they believe something - ESPECIALLY NOT when you say you're a religiously-neutral government.  

I'm not talking about your ancestry. I don't care WHERE you come from. You're following the Kur'An and that's fine. What is NOT fine is putting your religion above civilian law. And please don't make a point of Drainville - it was an abomination that I completely condemn. Neither was it a question of religion - Drainville is a town plagued with racism and intolerance - the hijab issue for legal pictures is a matter of regulation.  

I understand the whole racism issue - and I am a fierce fighter for ethnic acceptance (I feel dirty even writing this). It's completely wrong. But the hijab issue for pictures is not a matter of racism. It's a matter of treating EVERY PERSON OF THE POPULATION equally. You're not against that, are you?

I'm not telling you to stop wearing the hijab. I know you people get a lot of flak for it. And I agree for the stupid people part, and for the part where they tend to lump in minorities together. What I find even more hypocritical of you is that you said that you don't ALWAYS wear your hijab. So if you sometimes not wear it in public, why would you INSIST on wearing it on pictures that will end up on legal document?

Yes, you are people. Yes, the idiocy and venom thrown at you is ludicrous. Yes they are your lives (and by the way, as far as I am aware, it's illegal in Montreal to hang around in bikinis - it has to be covered until you reach an area of water contact, like a large public fountain or a pool or a beach) - but once you step into legal matters and proceeding, your life is on standby - you are no longer an individual, you merely represent your identity of which religion is a footnote. It's like that for every single person in this province. And I find it very sad that you say that wearing the hijab is not a day-to-day or week-to-week decision - considering you said in the last paragraph that you DO sometimes remove your hijab in public to avoid further staining the reputation of Quebec Muslims. And if you ask me, the spiritual journey of mankind becomes even greater when you transcend physical matter and think of it on a higher level. Anchoring your religion to a set of items make you uncertain, doubtful when isolated from them. Wear them if you want - but don't sever the connection to a higher being because you need to take off the icons of your religion.  

Sorry if I came across as dissing the hijab as a whole - I am not. You do whatever with your head. I was simply stating the whole legal issue of covering your head for identification purposes.

LOL, you'd be surprised. Especially the religious brand of muslim feminist thinkers consider the hijab essential to their kind of feminism. 

That is something many western feminist fail to understand -  in most muslim women's eyes the hijab is a symbol of liberation, not oppression. 

The religious revival of islam since the 1970s and the more widespread wearing of hijab has liberated a lot women that used to be confined to their houses in areas where the saying went that a good woman only left her house twice - on the day of her wedding as a bride and on the day of her death in coffin. Wearing hijab these women were allowed to leave the houses they used to be confined to. With hijab they can go to school, university and have a job. They can even work in mixed sexes environments. 

It is a slow revolutionary change in countries around the Mediterranean and the Middle East that has been going on almost unnoticed by western feminists. Western feminists focus on the outward symbol of hijab while muslim women focus on the rights that matter - divorce, keeping your children, being allowed to work, having access to safe birth control and abortion, inheritance rights, ... 

It is a simple question of knowing how to pick your battles and weapons. As far as many muslim women in predominantly muslim countries are concerned, hijab is their weapon and their ally. 

This is why banning hijab is so potentially destructive. If you are deeply religious muslim you consider the hijab a commandment, being forcefully forbidden to wear one would limit these women to indoor stay.

Well, you got to start somewhere and right now the hijab is not the priority western feminist make it out to be. 

In addition hijab is about far more. The right to practise your religion openly, the right to go to a mosque, the right to go to a school attached to a mosque and learn how to read and write. 

I know several women who in their late 50s started learning how to read and write just so that they could read the quran. You have no idea how much confidence and self-assuredness this achievement gave them. It was far more liberating for them than not wearing hijab could have achieved.

>And what is the reasoning for this commandment? So as not to cause men impure thoughts and harass them, correct? 

In all religions there are commandments where no explanation for their reason is given. The closest thing the quran gives for an explanation on why women should cover up is as a symbol of faith and piousness so that they can be recognised as muslim women that follow the laws.  

Not to cause men impure thoughts is a more modern interpretation. 

>The responsibility for changing behaviour lies with the men harassing them.

Yes, which is why men are also supposed to cover up (from navel to knee at minimum) and told to ""lower their gaze"". 

You'd be surprised how many muslim women's right activists argue with the quran and the ahadith in their hand, demanding more respect from the men on the basis of some tenets of the faith or stories from the early years of islam.

Actually, the Koran does state reasons, and one of them is so that women not be harassed. See 33:58–59. This is reasoning that is at odds with feminist ideals.

But to take one random example: on the more conservative side of Orthodox Judaism, most women will not wear pants other than in very specific situations where it's really necessary, and women will not wear shirts that are low-cut, short sleeved, or sleeveless. Most men won't wear shorts or t-shirts in public. Married women will always wear a head covering of some sort when outside of their home, and men will wear one all the time other than when bathing, sleeping, etc. Those two dress codes are pretty much exactly the same in terms of strictness.

He lost his job because he would not stop wearing headphones listening to religious music and underlining Bible passages at work instead of working. My mom couldn't support the whole family alone on a teacher's salary and cleaned houses and mowed lawns on weekends to try to make ends meet. (My father did nothing, because he needed time to go to church and read his Bible. When he did find employment, he would promptly quit because he discovered there was a gay person in the office or because his supervisor was a woman, and God said that men should not be submissive to women, etc.) We were on food stamps and he was giving money away to tent revival preachers who told him he was destined to be a prophet. When my mother tried to get him to stop, to get a job, to realize that they had two growing kids who were wearing kind neighbors' hand-me-downs because they couldn't afford shoes, he would shut down all argument by saying ""God told him"" to do what he was doing.

I don't have any constructive advice, really, but I wish your friend the best. My parents' marriage ended in divorce after my father gave away increasing amounts of money against my mother's wishes, failed to offer any support during the illness and death of her father because he needed his alone time with Jesus, and became verbally and physically abusive because he was not being treated as the ""head of the household"" as the Bible said he deserved. Our lives improved as soon as he was gone, and he is now in his fifties and alone, still going from job to job, still not a prophet.

I know this outcome is more extreme than what your friend's going through right now, but one of the most damaging and trouble-prolonging things that happened to my mother is that all the religious folks in our red state were telling her that divorce is terrible for the children and that you shouldn't give up on your marriage and that she had a responsibility as his wife to support him, and minimizing his behavior because he was doing GOOD things by devoting himself to the church and giving money to the church.

I would never send an already beleaguered family member right into the heart of a cult-like religion.  

I do know one woman who joined a *different* (very liberal) church so that she could get her husband to quit hounding her (that worked short term, in the end she gave in and let the kids go to church with him, and that was the beginning of her own slide into the cult-like church; she had every intention of only pretending to be so involved, but in fact, she drew away from all her friends and no one I know now knows what has happened to her or her family).

I teach a course on religion (and have, for 30 years) and have interviewed a lot of zealous converts to one of the two main cult-like churches in the area near school.  Alcoholism is a common denominator for many converts, but, alarmingly, so is pedophilia (and a host of other sexually related problems).  

I have learned that for many of these converts, the alternative (from their way of thinking) is much worse:  they'll become abusive, they'll be pedophiles, etc., etc.  It has made me think twice about trying to dislodge their belief systems (always precarious, always extreme) and when I send students out to observe religious behaviors, I have them avoid these two churches as much as I ask them to avoid Scientology.  These religions may have their uses/purposes, but too many people end up in trouble after getting involved.

In the case of several women (who came to class specifically to deal with issues like this), they found out that their over-involved spouse was still a pedophile, which was devastating.  At any rate, poking around in the minds of the hyper-religious, cult-prone person often turns up some pretty ugly stuff.

20140522142413,Abrium41,"There is nothing you can do.  Trust me, I ""swear to god"" there is nothing that can be done or at least not in my situation.  I am LITERALLY 2 hours home from my final divorce hearing because my wife of 15 years, who was moderately religious when we met, continued to lean on god through our hardships instead of formulating plans and making a future for our family in the reality on this planet.  I don't hate religious people - quite the opposite, I'm glad you have found something to hang onto just so you can make it through this life but I'm hear to tell you money is only the beginning.

My wife would tithe more than we could afford and together we were a 150K household.  She would go through gas, which is becoming so expensive it's a bill, just to fuel her vehicle to be at the church more than we needed to.  I was not allowed to question any of this behavior because she was answering to a higher power ""that I didn't understand"".  I thought I saw the apex when we found out we were pregnant with our 4th child (4th fucking child - kids are expensive, I paid 1100 in daycare alone at one time) and based off of our time, resources, stress levels, and money I told her we didn't need to have our last one.  Her words, not mine and verbatim were ""This was God's decision and its not your place to change that.  I am having this child for God and me whether you want it or not.""  I was nothing, I wasn't worth her time because I was a nonbeliever but Octavia9, this is going to be the straw that breaks it all or at least it was for me...  The children:

I have 4 daughters and my oldest is 11 and she started talking to me when we were alone about God.  It took everything I had not to be snarky, mean, or discrediting to any religion when she started questioning me.  She would ask me if I believed in God and I would reply that I didn't and I would rub her shoulder and look her in the eye and say ""learn baby, learn everything you can.  Take in all the resources available to you and make your decision about what you believe and follow.  Don't let what Mommy or Daddy wants control your life, you control it.""  And that my friends was it...  As soon as my wife saw me as a threat to her perfect family of believers I was an enemy.  She called me everything from a devil in her bed to deviate and ultimately moved out and just finalized a divorce THIS MORNING so she could make all of my daughters sit on a bed at night with her for hours and read bible verses.  

I don't know if this will happen for your friend and I hope it doesn't but my ex-wife allowed religion to destroy what we had built up for 15 years.  I wasn't worth her time because I wouldn't be here for eternity.  I do truly believe that the level of tolerance between a believer and non-believer can not be sustained throughout a long term relationship.

And here's the ""real advice"": Secondly, from an outsider's perspective, anything that causes one partner to increasingly disregard the feelings and well-being (financial, physical, or otherwise) of the family is a cause for a serious re-evaluation of the future of the relationship.  It's really hard to recommend that to a close friend who doesn't *want* to lose her committed relationship, but how long can she go on like this?

In order to stop embezzling, for example, one family member responded well to threats of hell fire (including retreats in which men of the church held his feet to a literal fire to remind him what torture awaited him if he continued to sin).

Everyone agrees that the embezzling was a bad thing, and after becoming increasingly religious (read:  hanging out only with other church members, becoming more and more reclusive, losing his job, etc), this family member never embezzled again.

After stopping them, it was seriously as if a haze was lifted from in front of my eyes. The mood swings stopped, I was sleeping better, my workouts were much more efficient, my memory improved, not to mention the cognitive fog that I often experienced seemed to vanish. I HIGHLY recommend going off the pill, and the best birth control choice  in my opinion is an IUD. Mirena releases a much lower dose of hormones than the pill, and ParaGard does not release any hormones at all (which is what I now have and love it), plus they're extremely effective! Good luck with your decision :)",19,t3_267kjd
20140522100455,CanDelightUs,"I was considering an IUD for a while and I asked my doctor about it and he said he generally won't implant one in a woman under 30 who hasn't had a child yet. He didn't really explain why though. ",3,t3_267kjd
20140522104637,CompletelyAverage,"The issue with childfree gals getting IUDs is that the cervix and uterus are really small. Possibly too small to fit the IUD in. It took me about 2 years to convince my doc that I really really wanted one and before the insertion he did an ultrasound to see if my uterus was big enough (it was *just* barely). He also, mid-insertion, told me that he didn't think it was going to work (i.e. my cervix was too small). I, while I was in immense pain, demanded through gritted teeth, ""just do it."" And he did. And I'm so glad I made the switch.

I believe that getting off BC pills and switching to an IUD made a huge difference in my quality of life. I'm happier, more motivated, I lost weight. Also, for some strange reason, my hair got waaay curlier. I really believe stopping BC changed my life. However, as a caveat, this is all completely anecdotal. 

I have had both the ParaGard and Mirena IUD. First off, the insertion procedure was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. I think it's worth it though. I started with the ParaGard because I wanted to be hormone free. A side effect of the ParaGard is that you can have heavier periods. I had extremely heavy, long (like 10+ days), and painful periods. Plus random cramping even when I wasn't on my period. After 2 years I decided to switch and try the Mirena. I have no period on Mirena and no cramping. The only issue with Mirena is that I'm kinda paranoid about the hormones. My doc claims that it shouldn't affect me as the ""hormones don't leave your uterus"" but I've been struggling with depression lately and in the back of my mind I'm always concerned that it's the Mirena.

So, I encourage you not to take no as an answer from your doc. It's your body. You get to make the choices. Also, feel free to ask me any questions.

I know this. I've read research about misconceptions providers have and I've never read about this being a misconception providers had or a reason they denied patients IUDs. If providers are telling nulliparous women they can't get an IUD because it will fall out I would love to here about it. 

>That link is a hand out which in the end is a form for getting Implanon. It says a lot of things as facts with no sources.

It's workshop hosted by the American College of Physicians training providers on the use of IUDs, I couldn't remember the study and googled the statistics because I was having difficulty finding the actual study without remembering any other information. If it means that much to you I'll be happy to track it down. 

>That final quote is from a study I can't actually find except in news articles, and when I see it quoted, it talks about PID + IUD's, which is not what I argued. I was talking about STD+IUD= increased risk for PID, so if you admit to this increased risk WHY ARE YOU ARGUING WITH ME?

Because I'm not agreeing with you. STI's in and of themselves are not a problem and there is no increased risk of them with IUDs. The old line thought, based on faulty IUDs, was that an STIs would travel into the uterus and lead to PID, infertility, septic abortions and generally bad things. We have no evidence that there is any increase of infection,disease, or infertility with an IUD as long as the IUD is not inserted while there is an ongoing infection.  Even if you're young, nulliparous, and in a nonmonogamous relationship, IUDs are not contraindicated. Current data suggests you aren't assuming additional STI risk when you choose to get an IUD and LARC methods are offer superior protection for young women. If a doctor tells you otherwise, they're not up to date with the research or guidelines. In fact, IUDs have protective benefits when it comes to HPV.

20140522134951,Paisley1190,"Just to tell a different side of the IUD story, I'm 23 and had Mirena placed when I was 22, last July. I have no children but my FNP had no problem with me getting it. Placement wasn't too difficult and the doctor who performed the procedure was very experienced. I was ok the day of, but pretty much 24 hours later I was in intense pain, from cramping, and bleeding....a lot. Obviously I called and checked with my PCP and she said that was normal, especially because I've never been pregnant. Fast forward 2 months later, and it's still happening. The bleeding was a little more spotty but the cramps were insane. They checked the placement and everything was fine, it was just how my body reacted to it. 

By Christmas, so 5 months later, the cramps had more or less stopped and I was only bleeding for a few days every 2 weeks. The benefits in a serious relationship (I'm married) were way better than the bleeding and cramping so I dealt with it. By the way, my face also looked like a pizza. I've never had great skin but Mirena caused insane painful clusters of cysts on my cheeks, somewhere I've never had acne. 

So now it's April, everything is pretty much ok. I was used to the symptoms so they didn't really bother me. The hubby and I had a rough night in bed...in the good way...and everything was awesome. A few days later I was washing myself and could feel the strings...at the entrance of my vagina...that is not normal. Obviously I made an emergency appointment with my OB/GYN. As soon as I came in she performed an ultrasound, the IUD had partially fallen out, probably due to the rough night in bed, but also because all of those times I had been cramping my body was trying to push it out of me. It could have easily ruptured my uterus, which would have caused infertility.

I tried a few types during that time at varying levels, but I think most were a combination of Ethinyl Estradiol/Levonorgestrel, aside from when I briefly tried Yaz (Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol). Most of the time I was on Aviane.

Some side effects were worse than others...for instance, I cried constantly on Yaz and was very irritable...I just felt crazy hormonal. Aviane started out great, especially in comparison. However, a while in I had tons of problems. However, I didn't realize they were due to my BC because when I talked to my doctors about it, they always dismissed the BC as a possible culprit. Finally I found a doctor who recognized what was going on and insisted I go off of it and onto hormone replacement therapy. Thankfully she turned everything around for me.

**Some issues I had on BC (Aviane):**  
-vulvodynia (usually caused by natural hormone depletion/vaginal dryness) and then vaginismus as a result  
-migraines and other neurological pain  
-emotional difficulties-- crying easily and jealousy

One thing that thankfully I did not have to deal with, which some woman complain of, was weight gain. I also remember much lower libido on one type of pills, but I think on Aviane it was only lowered *slightly*, so this wasn't my biggest issue.

**Some positives to being on the pill:**  
-Regular and lighter periods, less cramping  
-Not having to fear pregnancy  
-Better skin and hair

I've been off it for four years now. 

**Pros to being off it:**  
-My boobs got bigger (most people experience the opposite)   
-Extremely high sex drive  
-More natural lubrication  
-Vulvodynia and migraines have gone away  
-I feel more like ""myself"". I almost never cry now. I feel like I can think more rationally  

**Cons:**  
-Having to use condoms and more worried about pregnancy  
-Heavy, irregular periods and cramps  
-Bloating when I go awhile without getting my period   
-Skin is more sensitive and prone to breaking out

Personally, I prefer to be off of it because vulvodynia was not worth it and the migraines put me at a health risk for stroke.

My partner is getting a vasectomy (after we move and put out fiances in check) but this pill has been so horrible, I decided I couldn't wait any longer. It's been a month as of today.

Like little weights had been taken off my legs.

The mood thing is hard to gauge.

That made my cramps worse but my periods lighter). Last summer, I wasn't sexually involved with anyone, so I took the summer off OCP, to see what happened with my body.

I've also not experienced any negatives yet, although I'm yet to have my period, but it's a relief to have not experienced any weird spotting or the like!

So yeah, definitely an interesting idea to try going off it to see whether the hormones are messing with you or not.

Also my sex drive increased, or rather it went back to normal after being weirdly subdued on the pill. 

I got a Paragard IUD a couple of months ago. I strongly recommend going to someone who is experienced in placing them if you do decide to get one. My NP said she does a lot of them every week, many for young nulliparous women like me, and the process went very smoothly. I just took some Advil before (no cervical opener or anything) and went in near the end of my period. It hurt but not unbearably, and it was over quickly. So far I love it!

20140522091435,DrBoomson,"First off let me say I’m a guy who got my now ex wife pregnant at 17 and I am now 28 and successful. Additionally I in no way, shape, or form regret having my daughter but I was blind to the real world and failed to understand what it would take. The first thing you do is you need to face the facts, which are as follows: Your life is now not on track it is the furthest from the track, all your nursing plans are shot (for at least a few years and by few I mean 3-4), you’re probably going to lose your job before you have the baby and from the sound of it you’re going raise the kid alone and live with your parents (for a while). You need to understand that you will not be able to go to school, raise a child and support yourself completely alone, at least for the first few years. Believing you can do this is 100% impractical and your age and more importantly your income, You WILL need support from either the baby’s father or your parents. You should also think about the amount of stress you're about to put on your parents. I’m willing to bet they haven’t had a baby in the house for quite some time and probably didn’t plan on it anytime soon. Your parents have lives of their own and the support you are requesting, while it may be given freely at first, watching the baby for you every single day will become a nuisance to them at some point.
Now if you were able to swallow that and you still want to have a baby at your age this is how my ex-wife and I made it through. Remember she though she did have it 100% easier than you because she had me there actually supporting her. Now like I said we were 17, it was a week before Halloween in our senior year when she told me. We were both working, but I immediately took a full time night job so I could go to school at the same time. We saved all of our money until the baby was born, we had to live with my mother for 1 month after she was born which was one month after high-school. Luckily she was still covered under her guardians insurance or that would have been a 20-30k hospital bill as well(we had to spend extended time because of severe Jaundice). By this time I was working 2 jobs 7 days a week while my wife was at home with my child. I slept maybe 5hrs a night if I was lucky. My wife was having issues growing up and still wanted to party with her friends<----This right here cannot happen to you, you must focus and realize you’re going to miss out on 2-3yrs of having fun with friends. I soon realized my life was going nowhere I wanted to go ….soooo I did my research and decided to join the military. I had to wait 7-8 months to get in while still working 2 jobs, I don’t know how much longer I could of worked 2 jobs like I was, I had only been doing it about a year but it was hell. I got a great job in the military that could easily translate to the outside world, and while I missed a lot of bdays/xmas/holidays my daughter now has a better life than I ever did growing up. I only hope when she gets older she forgives me for not being around as much because I did whatever I had to do to ensure she would have more opportunity’s than I ever had. You must be willing to sacrifice everything you ever wanted in the name of your child or you shouldn’t have one IMO. You may not need to sacrifice everything but the possibility will always exist. I really hope your On/Off again BF isn’t a moron, for your baby’s’ sake.

Your body is yours, and you can love it pre-baby, pregnancy, and post-baby.  If you love your child already, then anything's possible. You have 9 months to sort everything out. most schools have a maternity leave sort of thing, and you can work on figuring out budgeting, what you'll need for the baby and talking to your parents about it. 

Talk to him about it too. If he's not supportive, then well, fuck him. Just make it clear to him that you have no intention of getting an abortion. After that, it's up to him to decide what he wants to do. You can go after him for child support, and if you're planning to get government assistance, you will probably HAVE to. 

Last, see if there are some mommy-to-be support groups in your area and visit /r/parenting and some of the related subs in the sidebar, like /r/babybumps. They can give you much more advice than I can for this situation.

20140522082154,lolkittah,"I have not been in your sitatution, but there are lots of women over on /r/BabyBumps who have. There's everyone from young first time mums over there (I have seen posts from some 19 year olds) to older women, one of whom I saw say that she had her first 19 years ago and was pregnant again in her late 30s. Lots of different perspectives to help out, and lots of people who can offer advice on labour, body changes, hormones, etc. Several ladies who are no longer with their baby's dad, people who are going through school at the same time... lots of diversity.

I say this on the ""assumption"" you will have the baby; clearly disregard if you change your mind!

I am six months pregnant, but it's my first and I'm 30 so a lot of the stress is mitigated. I can tell you that up until the end of the first trimester (12, 13, 14 week area), you probably will feel a bit shitty. You probably know that. I never threw up, but I felt sickly from about 4 - 7pm most evenings (not in the morning). After that, I started to feel much better, and until I got significantly bigger around the middle at about week 22 or 23, I could easily ""forget"" was pregnant, physically. Some women suffer sickness all the way through unfortunately, but they are in the minority.

I was insanely fatigued in the first trimester. I would describe every second or third day as feeling like I had flown from LA to London overnight and drunk wine the whole way. Jet lag plus a hangover. Sleep, good food that you can manage and HYDRATION in the form of water worked well for me.

Symptoms come and go early on. Don't freak out if you feel 100% normal one day - it doesn't mean something had has happened. Embrace those days! I'd work out, clean the house or do something that I couldn't on my ""I just flew in from California and I'm drunk"" days.

My body has only changed in that my breasts and tummy are bigger. If it weren't for the bump, I'd be wearing all my usual clothes (i.e. I have not ""gained weight"" on other parts of my body). Keeping up a sensible exercise regime and eating well were responsible for that, as well as being fit beforehand. You are young, so if you go through with this, your body should bounce back very, very well. Hell, I'm doing fine so far with 11 years of age on you :D

You will not be in the shape of your life at 9 months or immediately after birth. However, as with anything revolving around bodily fitness and shape, a lot of the bounce-back is manageable. You may have stretch marks (I've got none yet, but I have three months to go and they're the BIG months); you may not. You will find that the older you get, the more men and women around you have these and people care about them far less. My ex boyfriend had a bunch from losing a lot of weight as a 19 year old, even :) I must admit that my body confidence has actually gone up since I got pregnant. It's hard to explain, but it's true and I was a real gym rat beforehand.

I am very sorry that you are in a stressful situation. I can't recommend /r/BabyBumps enough. They are very VERY supportive and diverse, and since 2X became default, I have been reading a lot more there than here - they're like my new 2X without the ""we hate women"" trolls. Pretty much everyone's experiences and opinions are treated with respect - check them out. I comment over there often, but on a different account (one I'm receiving abuse on right now from commenting on 2X threads, hence me logging into an old account, but you might see me around :) )

20140522112025,willsmithstaint,"Hi! I also got pregnant at 19. My boyfriend, who I had only been with for a short time, wanted me to get an abortion but I made it clear that I did not feel like it was the right decision for me. 

I just wanted to share with you some of the things people in the thread may not talk about: The ridiculous shame of being a teenager while pregnant (even though you are already 19 and already going into college and will probably be 20 when you are actually a mom, like I was) and the equally ridiculous shame of being unwed while pregnant and then a single mother. Logically you know that it doesn't really mean anything about your character or how you live your life, but I can say that I still felt judging eyes on me daily. It absolutely was rough and I wasn't able to enjoy my pregnancy the way I felt, and still feel, everyone deserves. 

I went to school full time and worked as a cashier 20-40 hours a week during my pregnancy. I even took summer classes and only quit my job when I was 7 months pregnant and couldn't stand for 8 hours a day anymore. Actually in one of my classes I was the only female out of 24 students on top of being pregnant, haha. Heartburn, morning sickness, and weight-gain aside I had a very easy pregnancy as well as a complication-free birth. I read many pregnancy books and was pretty prepared for the different stages, so when my water broke but my contractions were still far apart I took the time to shower and relax before having my mother drive me to the hospital. I was out of school for only a week when I gave birth and had to carry a [donut pillow](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415AEjEUIaL._SX425_.jpg) to sit on in class. 

My boyfriend and I did wind up staying together throughout the pregnancy, but he lived three hours away so we only spent the weekends together. We spent the pregnancy planning on giving our child up for adoption. I had to go to many of the meetings with the organization alone because they did not have weekend hours (same with the doctor appointments, I usually went alone). So I spent most of the pregnancy thinking the baby would be given to a family I had picked out. A few days after my daughter was born I had a meeting with the adoption organization and found that the family was no longer interested having contact with me after the papers were signed. I canceled the adoption and kept my baby. 

My parents and other relatives helped a great deal and I stayed in school full time. My boyfriend remained three hours away, but we stayed together for several years until it was clear we were not right for each other. Now at 27 I have an AAS in Game Design, a BS in Computer Science, a decent job with decent pay, a great (new) boyfriend, and an intelligent, well-behaved, loving 6-year-old daughter. I can say from my perspective now that the emotional roller-coaster of the pregnancy and the year or so afterwards was well worth it. If I had to do it all again I think I would have expected less from my child's father, *not* planned on adoption, and had a much better outlook on the pregnancy in general. I would have gone to more personable doctors and invited my mother and/or friends to the ultrasounds. I would have spent time picking out furniture and baby clothes and actually looking forward to being a mom, since now I enjoy being one very much. I look forward to the day when I have a child that I planned for and can do all of these things the *right way*. 

As a disclaimer: I do come from a place of privilege - I am white and able-bodied with very supportive parents and friends. I live in a very diverse region with many different religions, cultures, and lifestyles. We were not wealthy, but were middle class so the financial strain of having both myself and my sister in college while having an infant was a struggle, but not impossible. If any of these things had been different I know it would have affected the outcome of my decisions.",6,t3_267epl

1. Take a breath!

1. Take a breath!
1. Talk to your boyfriend. Even if you guys decide that the right thing for you two to do is to separate, that should still be clearly communicated.

20140522131032,SpaceTongue,"It sounds like you really know what you want, so I'd suggest accepting it and immediately planning for the future with that in mind.  For instance, since it sounds like you know you want to keep it, there's no reason to worry about what it'll do to your body - what's going to happen will happen and the sooner you can update your ideas of what your life will look like, the sooner you can outline a path for what you need to do to support yourself (and the baby, if adoption isn't an option).

Acceptance of decisions has helped get me through some really tough times.  It clears your mind to think of the more important things, without getting distracted by regrets or what-ifs.  There's time for that later - right now you need to focus on taking action to get things in order before the baby is born.

You should tell the father.  Knowing what you want should make telling him easier - it doesn't matter if he wants you to have an abortion if that's not what you want.  Keep in mind that the baby is entitled to the resources/support of both of you (this shouldn't be something you decide on its behalf), meaning that you should definitely pursue child support, and give the father the opportunity to be in his child's life.

On the other hand, if you're more ambivalent about keeping it than your post implies, I'd suggest giving yourself a day or two to focus solely on this.  Meditate, mourn the fact that you have to either give up the baby or the image of the life you thought you'd be having.  Ask yourself what you want from life in a week, a month, a year, 5 years, 10 years.  Make a budget, calculate the amount of money you'll need for a baby and apartment.  Ask yourself if you really want a baby - if abortion is still out of the question, is adoption on the table?  But once you've made a decision, own it, be proud of it, and be confident that you're making the choice that's right for you right now.

I am pro-choice, but abortion wasn't an option for me.  I stayed in school (in a very Mormon area, as a pregnant 19 year old this was just awful) and had my baby.

20140522160930,daddyforchristmas,"I'm going to give you advice from a perspective you didn't ask for and one which 2X probable will disagree with...

I'm a new dad of a 5 month old and I have an established career. I was lucky enough to be at a company that has let me work from home and shift hours allowing me to be a stay at home dad for 12 weeks. I'll tell you, it's REALLY FREAKING HARD. It's a lot like being a single parent, taking care of the kid during the day while working full time (often over time) at night. The stress level is extremely high, making sure to keep your job while worrying about every sneeze sniffle and cough. I got lucky and have the most supportive spouse and her extended family. But I will tell, I work in an extremely stressful job and this situation has been magnitudes higher in stress. I can't imagine doing it at 19 AND going to school.

Secondly, you know what your SO is going to be like already. It sounds like you've been with him or known him for a while, so you already know if he's responsible, his morals, and his priorities. A bunch of people told me ""having baby will change you,"" but I disagree. It brings out more of who you are. I've seen others around me have kids (again mostly from the male perspective), but you can tell the ones which are going to be good (active, involved, supportive) parents pretty early on. I even remember being in labor and delivery and you could tell the guys who were just there and the ones who were looking forward to being a dad. You could see the fear and excitement in some while the ambivalence and resentment in others. You know him already and you know the choices he makes. People change, but it's rare.

It also sounds like you feel like you have no choices. I remember reading an article a while back about Christians who were against abortion but had one anyways. They always regretted it, not because it was they were against abortion, but because they felt forced to choose to end the pregnancy. They did a lot of self justification of ""this doesn't apply in this situation"" or ""this wasn't how it was supposed to be"" or ""others think I should, so I guess that's right."" You always have options. It sounds like you are against an abortion for you but  you're not sure you can / should keep her. Think it through and make sure what ever you do it is YOUR choice and not your parents or your boyfriends.

Lastly, you didn't mention adoption. That is an option and a good one. I've had several friends and family members which have been adopted and it is a great choice. You don't need to put her in an orphanage, you can do direct adoptions or work through agencies / lawyers. And you can have open adoptions in which the adopting family stays in touch and can provide pictures, etc or closed where all contact is cut off.

Personally speaking, we tried to go through the adoption process and had it fall through several times for various reasons. We had our little one after YEARS of being told it would never happen and failed infertility treatments; and he is the biggest blessing in my life. But we would love to have more and realize short of adoption it's probably never going to happen; so we're looking at starting the process again even though we know it's a long shot. But I can tell you from experience, if you want the best for your baby and don't feel like you can or will be able to give it to her, adoption is an option to consider. I would even contend that of all the of options, the hardest choice to make. 

If adoption is something you do end up considering, PM me and I can give you our perspective, what we went through, and why it was and still is important to us to adopt from a different perspective.",2,t3_267epl

I was young (so are you) and my body went almost back to normal in a couple of years without much effort on my part. I'm sure with a good diet and some exercise you will feel normal again in time.

My baby drove me to be what I wanted to be and I wanted a better life than a mom who works at a dead end job. I commend you for doing what you can do with what you have and remember (I feel this to be true when I didnt have a whole lot of money coming in when I was on leave due to me not fulfilling STD correctly.)

DON'T stress about labor and delivery. No matter what, that is endgame. All you can do is prepare yourself as much as possible, so EDUCATE YO SELF. I'm guessing that you aren't that far along, so you have a while to mentally prepare yourself for it. Also, your body is going to change. I had an eating disorder when I became pregnant, so for the first few months it was very hard. I was put on all sorts of supplements  to gain weight and be healthy. Eventually, something just clicked and I started taking care of myself. I got stretch marks, I gained weight, I felt unattractive. Something that made me feel better was that whatever happened to my body, I was doing it for my baby. I started feel better about my weight and stretch marks because that made me feel like I was doing it right and my baby was growing the way she was supposed to. You just have to take care of yourself, and in turn you will be taking care of her. 

As for school, you're only 19! I'm 26 now and I'm finishing up my BA. I have a full time job and can support my daughter. We're not rich by any means, but I'm getting there. You'll need your family's support if you're doing this alone.

20140522103158,Samipearl19,"The first thing you need to do is make an appointment with an ob/gyn. At that appointment, ask for them to refer you to a pregnancy counselor. Some places have them in-house, sometimes you'll need to go to a pregnancy clinic/planned parenthood/crisis center type of place. A counselor will be able to tell you all about all these things that are concerning you. You need real advice; not opinions from people on reddit. 

It is do-able, but you *have* to take steps now to protect yourself and your child. You need to get on the right medicines, and you *have* to contact a lawyer immediately in order to protect your rights. Getting a lawyer involved doesn't mean things will be combative with the father, but it means things will be legal, and you'll be protected from him changing his mind, from his parents having different ideas, etc.

You can absolutely finish school, but you need to know what your support system, custody arrangements, and financial situation are going to be in order to come up with a realistic plan. Again, this is exactly where a pregnancy counselor can help you. As a single mother, your financial aid will be different, there may be income-based daycare options open to you, and the school you attend may have daycare. You need someone experienced to help you navigate it all.

I also got pregnant when on birth control, and there was a lot of shame there even though we tried to be safe about it. I ended up getting an abortion because of the shame and the pressure put on me by my parents (thank god yours will be supportive?) but I wish I stuck to what I believed.

That being said, you'll need a lot of help! Instead of just thinking your parents will be supportive, you have to make sure. This means working out baby care, possible nightschooling, taking a year or two off, getting loans, a temporary part time job...whatever the case may be that works for you and the fam, you will have to work all of that out well in advance of your delivery date. If your parents can't watch the baby, and you feel you can't do it on your own and SO is out of the picture, then always remember that adoption is an option! It may not be what you've envisioned for yourself, but if you're against abortion and feel you cannot care for this baby well, then I think you should definitely consider this.

I've since had a beautiful son, so let me tell you that while this may be the most difficult time in your life, it will also be one of the most fulfilling!

I suggest you look into the time-outs on your pre reqs. My school, for example, will not accept anatomy that has not been taken w/in 2 years of application to the program. Find that out and take what you can to lighten your load.

Talk to your family, they sound like they are supportive and would help. My co-worker managed to get through an accelerated BSN program as a single mom, but not without the support of her family.

You should get plenty of financial aid if you file taxes separately from your parents that will help pay for school. Many places, especially community colleges, churches, community centers have programs that would help with childcare for nominal to no cost. Check out the resources of your town, talk to your parents, talk to your financial advisers. Information is your friend, you can't have too much.

So if you're a woman in places where abortion is illegal, you shouldn't have sex because you ""know your risk level"".

Also, since OP seems to know what her sexual partner will say, then they must have talked about this in the past.  Most couples talk about a worst case scenario.  Me and my boyfriend(I'm a girl) agree we want an abortion if I get pregnant.  If I got pregnant and had a child, I'd have the legal right to force him to pay, but I feel doing that is morally wrong since he expressed he does not wish to do that and I'm using violence(by proxy of government) to coerce him into something against his will.  This type of ""financial rape"" has terrible monetary and emotional consequences for many people who go through it.

> Why should she get 100% of the consequences? 

I don't understand the ""consequences"" you speak of?  I'm assuming her partner will help her with an abortion.  If she chooses to have a child, that seems to me like SHE'S the one choosing an outcome for herself, not that she's ""left with consequences"".

Now, that's a totally valid way to feel, but how can she justify forcing someone else to support her knowing that they don't want the child?  Also, this can be emotionally very hard on a man too, because someone they didn't want to start a family with is mothering their child.  This isn't 1952, it's 2014.

When I first met my boyfriend, romance wasn't even a thought for a while. We established a friendship that was sincere, and the comfort that I felt with him in the process actually allowed me to be the one to propose a more romantic relationship.

One time I was walking downtown Seattle with my boyfriend. We were walking up a giant hill. In my peripheral vision I saw two men sitting on a stoop to my right. I was dressed up a bit (dress, knee-high boots and tights) and I expected some comment on my clothes/body as we passed even though I was with my boyfriend. I just got the sense that there were going to say something to me. 

They did. One guy said hey. My boyfriend told me I looked frozen in that moment. Internally, I braced myself for a comment. But you know what he said? They were a gay couple enjoying the weather just like me and my boyfriend and they asked me to take a photo of them. I realized my spirit had been crushed by catcalls and to this day I am working on brushing them off. Now when people cat call me, I smile and look them in the eye. I don't say anything. If they are drunk or look homeless/beaten down, I don't make eye contact but I don't let it bother me. When guys flirt with me in public I smile, laugh, flirt back. But I never take their number or give out my own. ",4,t3_2680hz

So I texted him to ensure him that it wasn't anything that *he* did, but rather my unavailability.

I commend you for being able to treat those situations with a light heart. I am really trying to work on that myself.

There's no real way to invite someone of the opposite gender(assuming hetero) to be friends without having it be expressed as romantic interest.

But asking someone out on a date is the closest thing to that idea I can think of. I asked out a grocery store cashier(came back when it wasn't busy) because she was physically appealing to me, and pleasant to chat with the few times I'd been through her line. I asked her out so I could figure if she was emotionally appealing and intellectually appealing, as well as to gauge her interest in me physically(since that's all she had to go on as well). On that date we learned that we wouldn't be a good match romantically due to fundamentally different ideals, despite having a good time together. We decided to not date, but be friends instead, and we texted pretty regularly until I left for college.

I'm going to go off the assumption that all of these guys are not only after sex(they could be, but bear with me).

I'm a 31 year old married guy who has been out of the dating game for over 10 years.  However, maybe this makes me a jerk too, but this is what I would do also were I looking to start dating a girl.  Let's say I see an attractive woman, who I did not already know, the first thing I would do would be to ask her out for coffee or dinner or something.  Yes, it was based completely on her looks, it's important that I'm attracted to her.  Maybe I'm just out of touch, but I thought that's what dating was for, getting to know a girl and find out if we mesh or not, if there is any connection or not.

I think of it like online dating.  You don't look at a persons profile if you're not attracted to their profile picture.  If you are, then you go and learn more about them.  But in the online world you can do this anonymously, there is no worry about mistaken intentions of ""I thought you just wanted to be friends.""  Out in the real world, if a guy walks up and asks you out, there is no chance of you mistaking his intentions.

Again, it's been a long while, but to me: 1st Date = do I find you attractive, 2nd Date = do I find you interesting / do we share common interests etc.  As for guys not getting the point when you say you're already in a relationship, sorry, some people can't take a hint / have no respect for an ongoing relationship.

This isn't a uniquely male trait. Some women are bitches with exactly the same logic. 

What's important to distinguish is to separate the guys who are clearly assholes (like the one who sexted you) from they guys who probably thought ""Hey, she seems nice. And she's pretty. Maybe I can get to know her better?""

* Androgens have permanent effects on the developing brain, not just transient effects on the adult brain.48 Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia overproduce androstenedione, the androgen hormone made famous by the baseball slugger Mark McGwire. Though their hormone levels are brought to normal soon after birth, the girls grow into tomboys, with more rough-and-tumble play, a greater interest in trucks than dolls, better spatial abilities, and, when they get older, more sexual fantasies and attractions involving other girls. Those who are treated with hormones only later in childhood show male patterns of sexuality when they become young adults, including quick arousal by pornographic images, an autonomous sex drive centered on genital stimulation, and the equivalent of wet dreams.49

* The ultimate fantasy experiment to separate biology from socialization would be to take a baby boy, give him a sex-change operation, and have his parents raise him as a girl and other people treat him as one. If gender is socially constructed, the child should have the mind of a normal girl; if it  {349}  depends on prenatal hormones, the child should feel like a boy trapped in a girl's body. Remarkably, the experiment has been done in real life — not out of scientific curiosity, of course, but as a result of disease and accidents. One study looked at twenty-five boys who were born without a penis (a birth defect known as cloacal exstrophy) and who were then castrated and raised as girls. All of them showed male patterns of rough-and-tumble play and had typically male attitudes and interests. More than half of them spontaneously declared they were boys, one when he was just five years old.50

In a famous case study, an eight-month-old boy lost his penis in a botched circumcision (not by a mohel, I was relieved to learn, but by a bungling doctor). His parents consulted the famous sex researcher John Money, who had maintained that “Nature is a political strategy of those committed to maintaining the status quo of sex differences.” He advised them to let the doctors castrate the baby and build him an artificial vagina, and they raised him as a girl without telling him what had happened.51 I learned about the case as an undergraduate in the 1970s, when it was offered as proof that babies are born neuter and acquire a gender from the way they are raised. A New York Times article from the era reported that Brenda (nee Bruce) “has been sailing contentedly through childhood as a genuine girl.”52 The facts were suppressed until 1997, when it was revealed that from a young age Brenda felt she was a boy trapped in a girl's body and gender role.53 She ripped off frilly dresses, rejected dolls in favor of guns, preferred to play with boys, and even insisted on urinating standing up. At fourteen she was so miserable that she decided either to live her life as a male or to end it, and her father finally told her the truth. She underwent a new set of operations, assumed a male identity, and today is happily married to a woman.

Children with Turner's syndrome are genetically neuter. They have a single X chromosome, inherited from either their mother or their father, instead of the usual two X chromosomes of a girl (one from her mother, the other from her father) or the X and Y of a boy (the X from his mother, the Y from his father). Since a female body plan is the default among mammals, they look and act like girls. Geneticists have discovered that parents’ bodies can molecularly imprint genes on the X chromosome so they become more or less active in the developing bodies and brains of their children. A Turner's syndrome girl who gets her X chromosome from her father may have genes that are evolutionarily optimized for girls (since a paternal X always ends up in a daughter). A Turner's girl who gets her X from her mother may have genes that are evolutionarily optimized for boys (since a maternal X, though it can end up in either sex, will act unopposed only in a son, who has no counterpart to the X genes on his puny  {350}  Y chromosome). And in fact Turner's girls do differ psychologically depending on which parent gave them their X. The ones with an X from their father (which is destined for a girl) were better at interpreting body language, reading emotions, recognizing faces, handling words, and getting along with other people compared to the ones with an X from their mother (which is fully active only in a boy).54

* Contrary to popular belief, parents in contemporary America do not treat their sons and daughters very differently.55 A recent assessment of 172 studies involving 28,000 children found that boys and girls are given similar amounts of encouragement, warmth, nurturance, restrictiveness, discipline, and clarity of communication. The only substantial difference was that about two-thirds of the boys were discouraged from playing with dolls, especially by their fathers, out of a fear that they would become gay. (Boys who prefer girls’ toys often do turn out gay, but forbidding them the toys does not change the outcome.) Nor do differences between boys and girls depend on their observing masculine behavior in their fathers and feminine behavior in their mothers. When Hunter has two mommies, he acts just as much like a boy as if he had a mommy and a daddy.

Things are not looking good for the theory that boys and girls are born identical except for their genitalia, with all other differences coming from the way society treats them. If that were true, it would be an amazing coincidence that in every society the coin flip that assigns each sex to one set of roles would land the same way (or that one fateful flip at the dawn of the species should have been maintained without interruption across all the upheavals of the past hundred thousand years). It would be just as amazing that, time and again, society's arbitrary assignments matched the predictions that a Martian biologist would make for our species based on our anatomy and the distribution of our genes. It would seem odd that the hormones that make us male and female in the first place also modulate the characteristically male and female mental traits, both decisively in early brain development and in smaller degrees throughout our lives. It would be all the more odd that a second genetic mechanism differentiating the sexes (genomic imprinting) also installs characteristic male and female talents. Finally, two key predictions of the social construction theory — that boys treated as girls will grow up with girls’ minds, and that differences between boys and girls can be traced to differences in how their parents treat them — have gone down in flames.

Of course, just because many sex differences are rooted in biology does not mean that one sex is superior, that the differences will emerge for all  {351}  people in all circumstances, that discrimination against a person based on sex is justified, or that people should be coerced into doing things typical of their sex. But neither are the differences without consequences.

My daughter has always been more interested in ""liberal arts"" stuff. Writing, music, language, art. She's still pretty good at math and enjoys science, particularly chemistry. She had fun learning to program, but it didn't really excite her. Then in middle school she was looking for science fair ideas. I suggested she do something programming-related. So she began exploring AI. Her first project was an attempt at a chat bot. He second project was a tic-tac-toe player. And this year in 8th grade, she teamed up with a friend to try and write an AI for a turn-based strategy game. She helped her friend install and learn the basics of python, and together they designed and built a simple 2D strategy game, and tried to come up with an AI. I think working together on this project was a strong motivator for her, and I saw some real enthusiasm for programming for the first time. 

Now, well after the science fair, she is still programming, and refining her game. She's talked about maybe majoring in CS in college, and pursuing writing on the side.

This trend also shows up in psychological traits completely separate from career choice, such as verbal fluency and empathy (women) and mental rotation (men).

> the environment around these subjects that make them incredibly hostile for women who are interested which in turn, along with other factors, decreases the numbers of women.

This is speculation. We cannot, if we care about evidence, use the (real) phenomenon of hostility towards women in science as proof of a ""decrease in the numbers of women"". First of all, all we know is that it's just much lower than 50% but we don't know if it would be higher otherwise (unless we're making assumptions). In general, the numbers for women in science have all been increasing over the decades because of less and less discrimination.

But as I said, the devil is in the details. The proportion of women in science varies *wildly* depending on the field. We can therefore conclude that hostility towards women *does not cause* much fewer women in science because that would require the level of hostility *between* science fields to vary by a factor of almost 5. No, physics departments (a male dominated field) are not 4 times more hostile than psychology departments (a female dominated field).

> There was a post the other day showing that in communities with a large number of women in engineering/tech/science careers, girls are just as likely as boys to pursue these subjects in their own studies. 

If you could find data that women are *just as likely to pursue every science field as men* then it would falsify what I am saying here. But I am quite certain that the data doesn't show that because it would falsify much of the field of sex differences in psychology. What I would expect is that in some areas, women have inched a bit closer in each science field but that the same discrepancy *between* science fields exists. Find me a place where females have achieved 50/50 parity in physics and I'll change my mind.

This is only if you assume that men and women are identical in all ways that could be relevant to any field, which isn't true.

At the risk of stating the obvious - assuming that there are inherent differences between male and female style thought, this doesn't preclude women from programming, since programming is an individual activity and not a collective one.  Furthermore, since programming requires different skills, it's possible that on average each group would excel at something different.  For example, it's possible that men would excel at algorithm design while women would excel at managing complicated class connections.

This is on top of the theoretical prediction from evolutionary psychology that women (who have superior verbal ability and empathy)  would be drawn to the more *social* sciences (sociology, anthropology, psychology) and men (who have superior mental rotation) would be drawn to the more *analytical* sciences (physics, computer science).

Basically, only a small fraction of people exposed to programming in the first place would actually want to become programmers because every individual is different and a majority of people are not *that* interested in programming. But on top of this, *both* a greater proportion of males exposed to programming and a greater proportion of males *not* exposed to programming would end up as programmers. It would be very difficult to expose *only* females to programming and not have it be exposed indirectly to males which would have a greater effect on them than on females. You could increase female interest in programming but realistically only if you increased male interest in programming even more, in which case the proportion of people interested in programming who are female would decline (but the absolute number of females and proportion of *females* who are interested in programming would increase).

So basically what I am saying is that campaigns to expose females (or anyone) to programming are great because they will either increase or tap into some interest in programming, but we should not expect the gender gap in programming to disappear or change much at all really. It might narrow by a few percentage points but that's about it.

Why did I bring up genetic differences in the first place? Only to point out the fact that deviations from a 50/50 gender split are not *inherently* sexist or discriminatory (and they're usually not in the West) given that there are statistical differences between the genders to begin with, and further that one does not need to deny these differences to support feminism. Feminism is a good principle regardless of these facts.

When people handcuff feminism to a false dogma that men and women are identical then they hurt feminism by making it seem flawed in comparison to an informed understanding of human psychology. On the other hand, if feminism is supported in its own right because it's only fair to treat people without regard to their gender, then no gender differences real or imagined can undermine that.

We can have a culture that ensures equal opportunity for women and science when:

* Both men and women, but especially women, know how to spot unequal opportunity in science and expose it. When people *assume* that genetic differences between men and women (and even between individuals) do not matter for interest or ability in science and within science, they will inevitably not be able to recognize true unequal opportunities because they will conflate unequal outcome with unequal opportunity. (This can lead them to dismiss equal outcomes that actually derive from unequal opportunity.)

* Both men and women, but especially women, recognize that there are genetic differences between the genders that contribute to differences in psychological traits but also that every individual is shaped *in part* by their own genes giving them a unique set of traits. Hence, no man or woman should feel ashamed about ""giving in"" to purely cultural pressures that determine their traits if in fact those traits are in part shaped by their biology (i.e. no woman should feel guilty for not liking science as if they ""gave in"" to a stereotype as opposed to ""defying"" or ""overcoming"" the stereotype). Alternatively, no man or woman should feel ashamed uncomfortable about being atypical for someone of their gender given that their unique set of genes probably played a part in their uniqueness as opposed to some environmental error (i.e. no woman should feel like she doesn't belong in any role just because she's a woman).",2,t3_267eox

I'm trying to show you that I fundamentally agree with you, but that you have additional beliefs that are counter-productive to your deeper beliefs (with which I agree), but you don't seem to be having any of it. So let me just take your advice.

But first, let me rephrase my point in terms of the context of this discussion thread. Here's a recap:

1. The article from OP asks ""where are all the female developers?"" It then goes onto suggest that forces of social conditioning shape different people and heavily influence their career choices.

2. /u/robot_lady then comments implying/arguing that females would make up a greater proportion of programmers if they were essentially better socially conditioned to become programmers (maybe in a comparable way to men) She also attributes her own interest in programming to social conditioning (and pretty much echos the sentiment of the article).

3. I comment with arguments that there will always be a gender gap in programming (however large) because men and women have statistically different interests in science and computer science specifically. I linked to a video that gives an overview of this phenomenon, and I didn't say it directly but the evidence shows that this difference is *caused* mostly by biological factors (hormones deriving from genes).

> There are real and tangible problems that can be fixed

Here's where we agree. First of all I agree that there are real and tangible problems. Many women are discouraged from, or at least not encouraged or expected to pursue programming because it's seen as unsuitable for females. *This is a problem.* I agree that opportunities should be made for women to get an easy track into programming, if they want to. *This is a way to help fix the problem.* What I don't agree with is that ""where are all the female developers?"" is a smart question; I think it is fairly uninformed. I don't agree with the idea that, since much less than 50% of developers are female, that it constitutes a ""real and tangible problem"", and I wouldn't agree with that *unless* I had reason to believe that the female proportion would be near 50% without any gender difference in social conditioning or discrimination. I don't think that is the case because of various displays of evidence I have seen. *It is therefore not a problem.* There are many other problems, but this isn't one of them. Nor is it a problem that women earn roughly ~70% of psychology, anthropology, and sociology degrees and a smaller majority of biology degrees.

> While people focus on completely unsubstantiated biological differences

They are far from unsubstantiated. Ironically, sex differences in psychology are substantiated primarily by females because psychology and biology are fields that are dominated by females. I wouldn't expect that you would be willing to research or study this topic yourself, but just in case you are, here is some material to start with:

> instead of the far larger shared human characteristics we will continue to have unequal opportunities for women.

Talking about what we have in common does nothing to contribute to our understanding of why we are different (and it is important to understand why we are different, not just presume ahead of time that we know the answer). Men and women both have two legs and two arms, but the NFL is 100% male. Why? Well, it can't have anything to do with having two arms and two legs because that's true for both men and women. 

What we should be focusing on, instead of what we have in common, is *how fairly we are treated*. And we can only know how fairly we are treated if we know roughly how different we are (otherwise we will misunderstand how fairly we are treated). I care about the fact that some women face obstacles to entering programming and I wish it would stop. I don't think that 50% of programmers would be women if it did stop though.

> Create a society with equal opportunists. And then we'll talk.

Here is the problem: comments like these. We can only find solutions to problems when we *understand* our problems and especially only when we correctly identify something as a problem in the first place. If we do not understand our problems, and if we think something is a problem when it isn't, **that detracts from the real problems and the real solutions to those problems**. That is what I am accusing of you of doing here. You and many others here don't understand the problems but you have solutions anyway, which won't really work because you don't understand the problems.

In this case, one of our problems is a society with unequal opportunity. The major solution advocated in the article and by other people here is that we should socialize the genders each in the opposite direction of their current outcomes. This is a solution that is destined to mostly fail because it doesn't take into account real biological differences between the genders. Thirty years from now females will still get most psychology degrees and males will still get most physics and computer science degrees and the solution will be considered a failure (because it was uninformed to begin with). 

The bigger problem is that, all the while, the failed solution will have detracted from a real solution: namely to foster an acceptance of any individual's career choices regardless of gender. (The failed solution would probably work against this by making women feel bad if they drop out of programming tracks after having been pressured into them.) The minor solution of programming programs for girls which is advocated in the article overlaps with the real solution I am mentioning here, but again an with that is that this minor solution would be counterproductive if it pressured girls into programming against their true nature (falsely assuming that an interest in programming can be socially conditioned).",1,t3_267eox

I'm pretty sure that I understood you, especially because I agree with you in part, and rather it's that you didn't understand me, particularly on the part we disagree. I think that you didn't understand the difference between poor treatment of women and discrimination (real problem) and the large gender gap in programming (not a problem)

> As a programmer who happens to also be a woman that has actually experienced all of this how presumptuous and downright patronizing.

I've been saying all along in each comment that women are not being treated fairly as many women like yourself are clear about, and that this is problematic, so I'm in agreement with you here. (I'm assuming that by ""experienced all of this"" you mean poor and unfair treatment because you're a woman in programming).

When I say that you don't understand the problems, but you have solutions anyway, I am referencing the fact that you think ""creating a society with equal opportunity"" happens separately from understanding biological differences between the sexes. I've explained why understanding biological differences between the sexes is practically *necessary* for creating an equal society -- namely because it allows you to correct identify sectors of society with very unequal treatment.

OP's article and /u/robot_lady incorrectly suggested or argued that the unfair treatment of women and the gender gap in programming are essentially one in the same. I responded by arguing, essentially, that they are almost completely separate. The unfair treatment of women is bad in and of itself so it should be highlighted and stamped out, but that has little to no bearing on the large gender gap in programming. This is the whole reason why I brought up biological differences in the first place, to explain why these two are actually separate and not one in the same (the large gender gap in programming exists for biological reasons). Then you came along and suggested to me that I shouldn't be bringing up biology. 

Well why wouldn't I bring it up when /u/robot_lady and OP were confused about the real phenomenon of the unfair treatment of women? They didn't understand the problem so I tried to help clarify it for them. To borrow a phrase from you, OP and /u/robot_lady ""dismiss and distract from the actual issues"" by assuming that the large gender gap in programming is primarily due to socialization, which would be a form of discrimination. *Since that is false it dismisses and distracts from the actual issue of real discrimination in this same field.

Seriously?  You think that the hostile environment has no effect on how many women go into and stay in programming?  You think that socialization has nothing to do with it?  This is the the kind of reasoning from people who have never experienced it and refuse to listen to those of us that does.

Your field is programming so I wouldn't expect you to be knowledgeable about the evidence from psychology, but it makes sense to me that you would have misconceptions about psychology based on your own experiences because most people do. I probably have misconceptions about how programming works because I'm not a programmer, but I don't pretend to understanding programming.

If you don't like the evidence or don't care about evidence in the first place then fine, just say that. There's no use in pretending it doesn't exist as if you've studied the subject yourself. I've already linked to a blog post that *went over some evidence* but you didn't like that, so I'll go over some more evidence myself and than leave you with some reading material with even more evidence, just in case you care about evidence.

> *you can not separate culture from a subject in order to test accurately*

To the contrary, this has been done. Not as part of an experiment of course but as a result of disease and accidents. The evidence is clear:

* Biological boys socialized as if they were girls still develop male attitudes and interests. (Boys with a birth defect called cloacal exstrophy (born without a penis) are often castrated and then raised as girls. They still develop typical male attitudes and interests, and most of them spontaneously declare that they're boys.)

* Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (overproduction of male hormone in utero; hormone levels brought down to normal after birth) ""grow into tomboys, with more rough-and-tumble play, a greater interest in trucks than dolls, better spatial abilities, and, when they get older, more sexual fantasies and attractions involving other girls.""

> The source of discrimination women face is based on believed upon biological differences. And that is not OK. It is not OK every single time someone acts shocked that I code, am good it it and really enjoy it. Just because I am a woman and gosh, women don't like that sort of thing.

I would strongly disagree that this discrimination is based on believed biological differences. Rather it's because these people *don't understand* biological differences and have many misconceptions about them (as do you, which is why you would conflate them). In fact, if they did understand the biology, it would give them all the more reason to *expect you* to be good at coding. If they understood that you are probably good at coding *because* of your *individual* biological nature then the fact that you're a woman would be irrelevant to them. These discriminators you're talking about are very uninformed about the *variation* in traits among both men and women, such that some women should be expected to be innately good at coding. If only they had a lesson about the biological factors in shaping our individual minds they would be less likely to discriminate. (Our minds are also shaped significantly by random chance as well, so recognition of that too would make discrimination less likely because you can't have expectations of an individual result of randomness.)

Here is some reading for you. Please remember that you're a programmer, not a psychologist or biologist, so you shouldn't expect yourself to be knowledgeable in these issues *from the get-go*. Take some time to learn the subject matter if you care about having an informed view on these topics. I'm going to recommend that you read two book chapters. The first is about the relationship between gender, feminism, biology, and socialization. The second is about parenting, socialization, genes, personality, intelligence, and other things (basically nature/nurture). Hopefully these will teach you about how socialization actually works and clear up some misconceptions.

> But I strongly believe that those statistics are representative of the social conditioning inherent in our cultural upbringing, and not necessarily reflective of women's lack of interest in computing.

Here's the problem. The evidence strongly suggests otherwise. It's not that social pressures and expectations don't exist, it's just that they have very little if any effect on the outcomes we're talking about. (And in general, ""social conditioning"" is extremely overrated in explaining differences *within* a culture; they turn out to be more or less negligible in explaining differences within a culture.) If we looked at another obvious example that we all agree with we would see how silly it sounds:

> I strongly believe that *the NFL gender gap* is representative of the social conditioning inherent in our cultural upbringing, and not necessarily reflective of women's lack of interest in *football*.

Of course, we all know that boys are encouraged to play football more than girls, but we do not then say that it is *therefore* the reason the NFL is 100% male. It's precisely the other way around. Males are better at (and more interested in) football and that's why our culture encourages football more with men.

In the case of career choice, the gender differences in *interests* far outweighs the gender differences in *ability* in most cases. (Superior abilities are in roughly the same number for men and women.) That is why women outnumber men for biology degrees but men outnumber women about 4:1 for physics degrees. It's not that physics departments are four times more sexist than biology departments, it's that when you ask bright young high school students what they want to do the answers are simple: the women are as interested in biology but a lot less interested in physics than men are, *and that's okay*. Here are statistics on the sex ratio among graduate students. The order here is by level of analysis (with computer science thrown in somewhat arbitrarily next to physics). The first number is men; the second number is women.

If, at any point, you think that it is easy then you aren't pushing yourself.  Learn another language, or do something new until it's hard again.  Whenever it's easy, you aren't learning something new.  Whenever it's hard, you're getting better.  Learn to enjoy that process and to constantly challenge yourself.",2,t3_267eox

Is a lot of the males in the industry just cant seem to behave appropriately around females. There are a lot of guys I've come across that fit the neckbeard stereotype to a T. Or guys who come off just as super creepy. So making a comfortable workplace would be a good step in the right direction, some sort of cultural awareness training or the like.

When i think back to any females i've had classes with. I can't help but remember how bad they were at programming. There were a lot of really bad guys too, but there were also good ones. 

My first programming class/language ever was QBASIC. I was definitely the best in the class, It's where I really found my calling. There was a girl in there who had *no* idea what was going on. I ended up helping her on every assignment. This was high school, so she just took it as an elective so it wasn't something she wanted to be good at. 

This trend continued into college, You would always see guys giving limitless help to the few females that were around. At this point it probably was a passion for them, but they didn't get to learn.

I know you probably didn't mean it that way, but when we talk about the difficulties women face in tech and someone insists 'the only thing that matters is what you can do', it's frustrating because it implies that all of the things we encounter are due to not being good enough when that is often far from true.",2,t3_267eox

This happens a lot to me, although its male vs. male so not a sexism issue. It may be that its not your X chromosome but that the other guy just explained it better, or that hearing it a second time allowed the listeners to process what was being said. I'm not super eloquent and often when I try to explain things it goes right by the audience. Sometimes my boss will understand what I am saying, rephrase it and then suddenly everyone agrees. You could look at it as your idea was so brilliant that few people could grasp it until was explained to them in different ways.

When I hire those are important but I also try to find someone that will fit in with the group and who has a track record of staying with a company for more than a year or two. At the end of the day though they have to be competent.

I have found that there are two paths to success in the world. By success I mean promotions and money. The first is technical competence. If you are like Dr. House, you can be a complete ass and still be successful. The second is to be well liked. You can be quite incompetent and still successful if everyone likes you.

You can try cutting out different common irritants like lactose for a few weeks and seeing if it goes away, or you can try to pinpoint it by documenting what you eat every day and when you have bad bloating and looking for any patterns, then trying to cut out whatever you think might be causing it. I'd also recommend documenting your menstrual cycle and the bloating together to see if it's associated with that.

20140522132808,boobswhoo,"Hey there, it doesn't sound like a pooch, but like you have gas or bloating or something. Like, can you grab fat where you feel it is? If it's just skin, then it's your distended abdomen. Does it also feel mildly painful or uncomfortable? Like physically uncomfortable?

I have a similar thing happen. I'm 5'9"", so a similar height, and around 133 now. When I'm not pooched out for whatever reason I'm pretty much flat stomached. I do sit at a desk for work, but overall my posture is decent. I don't really slouch. Sometimes it happens over the course of a day, but I have it today and it's been this way since like 3 a.m. when I briefly woke up during the night.

I've been 148 for powerlifting reasons and at that weight I did have some fat I could grab. At 133 that's gone but there's still the weird distention that happens. My lowest weight was 115, so underweight, and I still had the same pooch thing then.

I find it actually seem to correspond to my period. I start getting like this 1-2 weeks before my period, and then I'm flat again when my period starts and for 2 weeks ish after (a wonderful time). 

I'm mildly lactose intolerant and honestly could probably do a better job not eating things that don't jive well with my digestive system. It might be worth a look to see if leaving out certain food helps. I put myself through an elimination diet, but the type where you cut out *all* potentially problematic food and then reintroduce them eventually one by one. It was hard to get enough calories and all I really came up with is dairy and legumes also seemed kind of iffy. (At the time I was in some nasty pain due to gas though and that went away, so that was cool.) I don't know if I'd necessarily recommend it, particularly because the getting enough calories issue, but if you get really desperate, it is a thing that you could do.

I would go with keeping a food diary and seeing if anything looks like it corresponds. If you can't figure it out, and particularly if it's also painful, it can't hurt to consult with a doctor. ",2,t3_267so9

I'm doing exercises that target that area, but I feel I won't see the difference with the bloating there so often. I'm continuing regardless.

I probably won't cut things out just yet, but I'll start taking note of everything I'm eating. I'm going to try myself on probiotics and higher fibre cereal for a couple weeks, that way if that doesn't work then I know it's not a fibre or bacterial/digestive issue. If it isn't that, then I'll start by cutting dairy and see if that helps too. I eat yogurts quite a bit, usually have milk at least once with cereal and sometimes have cheese, butter, cream, etc. so it is what I will have some of on most days so it seems more likely if it turns out to be a food thing.

One night she took it and couldn't fall asleep so she took more, but I didn't know it. She continued to stay awake - physically - and wanted to have sex so we did. She was a little weird, but we had just had a complete conversation in the last ten minutes and I just thought that it wasn't working on her and we'd have to find another sleeping medicine. Afterwards, she fell asleep and slept like a log. In the morning when I talked to her about the previous night, she had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. The look of shock on her face was more than enough to make me never again do anything with her when Ambien was involved.

20140522210510,mousegrl1,"I will give you my perspective here.  Ambien definitely makes people behave strangely.  Hallucinations and sleepwalking and so much more.  Sleep-driving even.  The guy had no reason to think that you were not consenting to sex.  It's okay that you were freaked out about it and I'm so sorry to hear that you developed vaginismus that kept you from enjoying sex with your partner.  Losing control of your body to people or medication can make anyone lose their center.   
You want to come to ""terms"" with that sex act.  It was a drug side effect like a rash or nausea.  Your history made that loss of control more traumatic than it might some other people.  I had a similar event occur after I started a medication.  I woke up in the morning all, ""Hey babe, did we have sex last night?""  My husband smiled and said ""yes, you seemed to enjoy it"".  I'm sure I did because I trust him and I trust him to take care of my body.  
Did he hurt you physically?  Did you wake up and feel like he took advantage of your altered state to push some boundaries?  If this sort of thing happened I say feed him to the dogs.  That's shitty behavior.
But if he thought that his partner was playful and wanting him even when she was a little hazy I feel that it's a different story.  If you want to explain why things fell apart that's great.  I don't think it's appropriate to bring it up to punish him a year and a half later (I think that's the timeline).  I'm so sorry that this has been on your mind so long and has upset you so.  I'm big on keeping the things/thoughts that are useful and getting rid of as much unhelpful stuff as possible.  
My two cents is that while you may have not consented to sex, he did not consent to rape either.  If it was me, I would chalk it up to drug side effect and never speak of it unless expressly asked.  ",8,t3_268eve

I was behaving quite far from what is normal for me.  He is also well-educated regarding consent, and understands that someone's capacity to consent can be impaired by substance use, although it's not very black and white.

When he talked about touching me, it was quite clear that he was doing so because it was making me say crazier and crazier things, and he got amusement out of that.  I feel that in itself crossed the line.

I don't think there was malicious intent on his part, but I definitely feel like he took advantage of my altered state of mind.  I think it was most likely a misjudgement more than anything.  The last thing I want to do is make him feel punished.  I'd like to be able to put this to rest and have it stop bothering me.

At first I thought, what if he thought you were awake? But he mentioned that you were talking oddly, there's no way he could have not known that you weren't in a coherent enough state to consent to sex, even if you weren't *completely* passed out. However naive he might have been about how wrong it was, he has done something awful. That's a fact.

Whether or not you should talk to him about it should be up to you and how comfortable you are with it, but I can think of some reasons why you might want to. Talking through it with him might help you to get it off your chest, to help answer some unanswered questions, like why he thought that could ever be ok. 

You mentioned you didn't want him to feel bad... even if you think he was naive and is generally well-intentioned, sometimes good people need to feel bad about the awful things that they've done, otherwise they'll never have the opportunity to make it right. Not that this is really about his redemption, it's not, it's about you needing to heal.

I 100% believe this was a mistake or error in judgement.

I was given more sleeping pills while still on antidepressants a few months ago, while with a new SO.  Before taking the pills this time, I informed my SO that the pills may make me behave strangely, and I asked him not to have sex with me that night even if I later asked him to/tried to initiate it.

20140522165418,iatemysocks,"> I feel like it wasn't consensual sex, and I know that if I told him this he would feel so awful about himself, which I don't want to happen.

You're *supposed* to feel bad when you do something bad, so you know not to do that thing again. Good people can do bad things, and being a good person doesn't absolve them of responsibility when they do bad things. It also doesn't necessarily make them a bad person.... even if they have done a very bad thing. But the bad things are still bad. Okay? All of those things are true. 

I belabor that point, because I had a similar sort of situation happen to me, and a lot of what made it so terrible was that the dude really, honestly, *truly* is not a bad person! He's actually a very good person, he felt *extremely* guilty when he realized that what he'd done was not okay, and he'd never done another thing like it before or since. Plus, you know, best friend. He wasn't and isn't my best friend because he's an asshole, I'm not friends with assholes. 

But that didn't make what he did not bad. It was totally bad. It's hard to reconcile those two thoughts, which was a problem for me, but it's totally true. And then it was easier for me to talk to him about it, because the idea that he'd done something terrible wasn't conflicting with the fact that I still thought he was a really good person and I wanted his support and stuff. 

So, I dunno, my two cents. If I were you, I'd talk to him, because that would be most helpful to me. I'm not saying what you should do, though, because I'm not you! You can do whatever. But I *don't* think you should worry so much about hurting him. He's the one who did something wrong, not you. If he's hurt by this information, it's really by his own hand. If he hadn't had sex with you when you were clearly incoherent, he wouldn't have anything to feel bad about. Essentially, if he becomes upset about this, he brought it upon himself, you don't have any responsibility for that. ",1,t3_268eve

Him feeling awful about himself should not be your concern, as he was the one who took advantage of you being in an unusual state where it was plausible that you wouldn't remember anything that happened. 
I understand if you don't feel like the word ""rape"" is appropriate to describe what happened (as most people view it as something that has to be violent), but what he did is unethical and proof enough that his respect for your control over what happens to your own body is lacking. 
Just because you trust someone doesn't mean they are incapable of hurting you, or that they shouldn't be held accountable if they do. Taking advantage of someone's trust/illness like that is not okay, and I'm really sorry this happened. Touching you in a sexual way when you're on heavy medication is a huge no-go. :( 
Maybe talk to a counselor in your area to help sort out your thoughts (if that's something you have access to)? It can really help to have someone who's not involved to listen and give you advice.

No. It just means I can't remember. It's quite possible you had sex and enjoyed it and that, in the moment, it was something you were fully consenting to. The trouble is now, you only have his word for it. So, it comes down to trust. If he proved himself trustworthy up until that night, why assume that he suddenly betrayed that trust.

She was physically strong, and that was great, but she used her strength against jerks, which was better. She beat up demons and vampires that were at times obvious representations of creepy sexual predators and classroom bullies. She had friends who were allowed to be strong and interesting in their own right, and a family that meant something to her. She came out of her ditzy shell and seemed not to get smarter, but to stop acting dumb. A lot of us were told that smart girls don't get love, and it was cool to see her grow as a person until she was comfortable enough with who she was to let the outside reflect the inside. She dressed cool but I don't remember thinking, ""Wow, that's unnecessary!"" because she was constantly flashing skin. I know she wore some things I wouldn't wear, but I don't think it was overly played for T&A. 

The way she handled (some spoillery, so I'll be vague) personal challenges on the show meant a lot to me when I watched it as a teen. She struggled but she wasn't broken. Again, it was a long-running TV show that was preceeded by a movie and continued in a comic, so she's not this shining unblemished vision of female power - she had very horrible things happen to her. She just always seemed to get through it in a real way. 

For my futuredaughter, I'll probably suggest Buffy, though I bet by the time she's old enough for the tougher things in it she'll probably not want to see something so old fashioned looking.

This is a fair consideration, but I gotta say, if shitty families were a dealbreaker, my husband never should have married me.  Thankfully, we see my family very rarely, which is my choice as much as his.  

To me the keys are: 

* your spouse has fully separated from his/her dysfunctional relatives and does not feel compelled to placate them over you
* your spouse doesn't leave you to fend for yourself if they start in on you
* your spouse makes it clear to everyone that you are a united front and they cannot come between the two of you

I definitely don't think there's anything wrong with not seeing people frequently who you don't really like that much.

I wouldn't have married me in my 20s when I wasn't as good at being a completely separate individual from my folks either.  I'm in my 30s, they're still effed up, but I'm a much better marriage prospect now.  :)  ",2,t3_26863d
20140522145202,VandyGirl,"I wouldn't say I hate my husband's family, but we've had some disagreements and rough spots over the past few years. His parents are wealthy, so they tend to think that throwing money at things will automatically get them what they want. My husband's younger brother also sounds similar to your fiancé's sister - he's 22, making attempt #7 I think at college right now (mental health issues and lying/not going to class issues), and has never had to work for anything in his life. When it was decided that he would come back to school near us (his parents live in FL), the inlaws just called my husband and announced that the brother would be living with us for the summer and we would be responsible for making sure he was successful in his summer classes.  

Husband and I ended up in counseling over that, because husband couldn't understand why that was such a huge and egregious boundary violation.  

So that's my advice to you - before you take that final step and get married, make sure you and your husband are in agreement on boundaries. Getting married means you're starting your own new nuclear family, and that should come with some distance from each of your families of origin. You just need to be on the same page about how much and what kind of distance. ",4,t3_26863d
20140522132500,mlingkh,"We lived with my husband's brother for a year, a couple years ago. I hated it. He was spoiled, insensitive, and had the tendency to lash out when he didn't get his way It was mostly a lot of little things that added up to a person I couldn't stand to be around. It made going home a dreaded experience.  

Husband's sister was diagnosed OCD about 6 years ago. She's now 28, living off her parents, working around 2-3 hours a week, but going on shopping sprees with money she doesn't have, and complaining about having to give her parents a fraction of her meager pay to help out with rent. She will literally have a crying tantrum because she wants pizza NOW. (To be honest, I have difficulty navigating around what I should accept because of her illness, and what I should not accept because of her general unpleasantness.)

My in-laws are super sweet people, and I feel bad that aside from my husband (who is a very devoted son), they have another son who doesn't really give them the time of day, and a daughter they will probably have to take care of until they are physically unable to do so. That being said, they are homophobic and culturally insensitive. They give me Jesus books for Christmas and tells mt husband they think it's ""disgusting"" that I worked on a drag fashion show as a designer. Never to me though, which makes it worse. 

What works for me now is that they are all very far away. Husband's parents and sister are in Hong Kong (where husband and I are from but we moved to the US in 2008), and the brother is close-ish but husband and him aren't really hang-out friends. (Although they do work together.)

I can relate to the frustration you're feeling - sometimes I wish husband would just speak his mind and give these people a good what-for. Especially since if all this crap was going on in MY family, that is exactly how it would down: nobody takes anybody else's shit. 

Though this isn't exactly an answer, I would just grin and bear it until you can move away (hopefully very far), especially if you don't want to feel left out. You can try starting a joint account (that's separate from your own account!) so you can save together and hopefully speed up the move-out process. Talk about timelines and set goals, and make sure this is a priority for the both of you.

No. This is not healthy work behavior. The occasional long week is one thing, but a routine thing is totally devaluing you and your worth. Looks at it this way. Assume you make $100 a week for an expected 40 hour work-week. You work 40 hours and you get your full $100. You work 50 hours, and your hourly rate just took a hit. Work 65 hours and you end up making considerably less. You still get that $100, but your time salary took a massive hit.

As for women getting naked in their own videos...it seems like that's often not an issue.  But it depends on the person.  People say it's objectifying much more when Miley Cyrus does it than when Lady Gaga or Beyonce do it.

It's less ""I'm doing all this stuff, and oh yeah BTW my outfit happens to be revealing"", it's more like ""LOOK AT HOW REVEALING MY OUTFIT IS ISN'T IT SO EDGY?"".

20140522114031,mbise,"A basic but significant difference that has an effect on how we perceive the videos: in their own videos, these women are typically the only woman stripping down, and always the focus of attention. In men's videos, the men are typically the focus of attention (the artist is typically the focus of attention in their own music video, makes sense), and the stripped down women are in the background, part of the setting. The difference is what we're paying attention to in the video.


Also, I don't think it's bad to objectify yourself, as long as you also find worth in yourself as a person.",2,t3_267wa6
20140522123315,chelsperry,"Yeah but, why is it any better for a woman to be used as an accessory in a music video as opposed to being the center of it?

ANd I agree, I don't think objectifying yourself is necessarily a negative thing if that's how you want to express yourself. But only if it's doing it for YOU and not other people.",1,t3_267wa6
20140522130223,mbise,"That's not what I meant. As an ""accessory"" in a music video, they are essentially at the level of background dancer or so, just not the same as the artist/musician/performer. It's not that it's better for a woman to be an accessory than the center of it, just that it's not at all unreasonable for there to be music videos that women are in, but not the center of. 

And also, as background characters, we don't think about them as much as people. In a movie, you don't usually wonder about the extras' motivation. But in a music video where the scantily clad lady is front and center, the whole time, you're thinking about her. Even moreso when you know who she is, you know about her like we do with celebrities. It's thinking about people you ""know,"" and what they're doing, versus thinking about strangers.

Also, helluva lotta confirmation bias in that article. I've seen plenty of scantily clad fellas in music videos (chris brown, usher, specifically) and them not being in speedos really just speaks to the personas they're putting on (a lot of which a speedo wouldn't match up with. They tend to explicitly and verbally express their sexual prowess rather than doing it with clothes). And a lot of the expressed sexuality comes through dancing, which a lot of male artists (especially those who put nakey ladies in their videos) don't dance. And for one more thing, people absolutely call out men's videos. Absolutely. Robin Thicke has said that his goal with the Blurred Lines video was to be as absurdly sexual as possible and so it looked like a joke, so I can't speak to that. But yea, people call them out. Especially the explicit videos that they can't put on television. ",1,t3_267wa6
20140522144720,chelsperry,"Well it just seems that women are called out WAY more than men for these things. I've (personally) never heard anything negative about Usher/Chris Brown as far as their music videos go. I've never heard anyone say, ""Usher is totally degrading himself! He needs to put on a shirt, what a manwhore!"" He's praised for it. Yet, people are so quick to call women whores/sluts/what have you if they get a little sexual in music videos.",1,t3_267wa6
20140522123104,chelsperry,"Yep, it's insane! This is probably a major reason why men ""think with their dicks,"" because they're conditioned to do so with everything they see in the media. Of course, some of that is biological I guess, but I definitely think the media exacerbates their desires. Probably why they're so horny so often and view women as objects way more than we view men that way.",2,t3_267wa6

Also, can anyone give a ballpark of what it usually costs to get one of these? I'd assumed that with my insurance it would be pretty cheap, but googling it brings up some estimates in the hundreds? I know that pays for itself over time, but it's a lot to drop all at once!

I still get cramps, but they last a few hours (instead of the prior day and a half). I still get periods, but they are much lighter and I have one ""heavy""-ish day (in that I actually need to use pads or tampons, or menstrual cup) and then I spot for a week, and spotting is such a non-event that I have forgotten that I am technically still bleeding and should use a liner so I don't stain my underwear. My cycle and period length haven't changed.

I did get a cyst, it was painful while it formed and when it ""popped"". But it was gone within a month. But I did need to cut back and not do acrobatics for a little while when the cyst was large enough that I was risking ovarian torsion. 

I think it is totally worth it. I use to have really heavy, long, crampy periods and spend two days curled up with a heating pad, taking lots of advil and then still bleed for 10 days. I wasn't going to risk having a longer or heavier period.

The cyst was the only negative side effect I have experienced since insertion. ",1,t3_268gzl
20140522155146,standard_candles,"I just had this conversation with my doctor, and I'm sure she has opinions that differ from others. She told me that by and large the copper IUD is being phased out because it is not as effective and there is increased risk for ectopal pregnancy, fusion to the uterine wall and other complications. The side effects of Mirena long-term, per the pamphlet I was given, would be less extreme than BC pills, because they are progesterone-only. So, if you've been on birth control before, it should act the same way or less so, with heaviest periods right after the insertion. Extreme pain or bleeding is not normal and should be dealt with by a doctor right away. The scariest side effect I saw was the possibility of one of the Mirena ""arms"" piercing the uterine wall, requiring surgical removal.

Honestly, if your goal is just to lighten your periods, I would try the lowest-level hormone BC pill you can find and do that. Both have risk of complications.",1,t3_268gzl

I had devastatingly heavy cycles for 15 years, so my doctor recommended a hormonal IUD to lighten things up. After 6 months of progressively lighter cycles, I stopped getting my period altogether. To go from changing a super plus every 45 minutes to nothing in a span of 6 months was completely life changing. Not to mention, no more PMDD controlling my shit and turning me into a fiery ball of sadness, rage, and exhaustion for 2-3 weeks out of every month. The levonorgestrel in the Mirena is in an extremely low dose absorbed directly into the uterus (only very small amounts are in your actual bloodstream), so I wouldn't let the hormonal aspect of it scare you away.

It was way too much blood for witnesses!  I was very nauseated during my cycle and the cramps were close to debilitating.  Crawl up with a heating pad and roll around style.

20140522112625,chelsperry,"I'm not on it, but I've been thinking about going on it and just went to the gyno on Friday to discuss it. She told me that every woman has a different experience with the implant as far as their periods go. 2 out of 10 will have constant spotting/breakthrough bleeding, and the other 8 really vary. She said some will be regular, some will stop getting their period altogether, and some will get it sporadically every few months. By gifts, do you mean full on period 3 times a month? Or spotting?

I'm not 100% decided yet on getting it because I was on a progesterone-only birth control (Erinn) and it gave me really terrible hormonal acne (as progest-only BC's can do). I went on Gianvi and Microgestin before to clear up my skin, and they did do that but after 4 months on each of them I began to get really bad hives. That's why I've been considering the implant. I have a friend who is on it and she said she doesn't get her period at all, so I figured that would probably help with my acne problem because I only break out the week before/after my period.",2,t3_267vw6

I am thinking of changing to a different birth control but I am not sure which one yet. You should try it, hopefully your body responds to it better than mine did. If you don't mind me asking, how was your skin before you were on Progesterone-only birth control? I am looking into it.",2,t3_267vw6
20140522114733,chelsperry,"Yeah I would definitely wait a couple more months and give your body some more time to adjust. That could definitely be the main problem. 3 periods a month would suck though, so I would switch too if the problem persisted.

Regarding my skin, I had flawless skin all throughout high school and a little bit into college, I NEVER had pimples, even on my period. Then when I turned 19 I started breaking out a lot on my chin and along my jawline, sometimes my cheeks. I attributed it to my newfound use of liquid foundation, which I do think contributed partly to it, but even after switching to powder foundation (which I always used in high school and never had problems), the acne on my chin didn't go away. It cleared up a on my cheeks, but that's it. Before I went on Erinn, my skin definitely wasn't clear, but it's given me constant painful cysts on my chin, one of them in the same spot that literally never goes away. It'll come to a head (sorry, TMI) and then go away for a day and then flare up again. So I definitely can't blame Erinn 100% for my acne, but it made my hormonal acne worse for sure. Luckily, my dermatologist prescribed me Aczone, so my skin from the chin up is flawless again, but my chin is still pretty bad. My gyno switched me to a different combo pill called Sprintec (the generic of Ortho Cyclen?) to hopefully help though. I just hope it doesn't give me hives lol. 

Other than that though, I liked Erinn. It didn't make me moody at all, I felt completely fine on it, and really had no bad side effects. The only complaint I had was it made my periods less regular. Off BC my periods have always been perfectly regular, to the point where I could predict exactly what days it would begin and end. Erinn made it to where my cycle would be 25 days some months, 29 days other months and then 20 days other times. ",1,t3_267vw6

20140522122431,OneTimeUser123,"I'm male but I had a very similar thing happen to me. That was a (long) while ago, when Facebook wasn't a thing and staying in contact with people wasn't as easy as it is today.

Anyway, here's the gist of it: Met a wonderful girl, had a wonderful relationship (and I mean wonderful like you couldn't imagine it to be any better) for around a year, then she had to move half-way across the country because of work/uni. Travelling back at forth a lot (or even just a little) wasn't really an option because of money, so for the first couple of weeks we basically only had phone calls / emails to stay in touch and that worked, everything was fine (as much as it could be in that situation anyway), she told me she loved me, we talked about how we could meet up again - until from one day to the next she was gone.

Couldn't reach her on the phone anymore, she didn't respond to my emails anymore and I had no idea what was going on. At first I thought it was just life getting in the way (naive, yes, but I was in love and I knew she had a lot of stress) and I tried to stay calm, but eventually I started to really worry. I thought she might have fallen ill or that she got in an accident or god knows what. From ""I love you"" to completely vanishing overnight conjured up many, many horrible scenarios in my imagination.

Anyway, I don't want to hijack this with my own story, but to wrap it up: after three months of panic and worries and feeling completely helpless, I finally managed to find her (not in person, but at least I found out that she was still alive and well which was a huge relief even if it left me more confused and sad than ever).

Like you I wanted to know what had happened and constantly thought about ""what if"" and how things could've been different and so on. In the end the explanation came down to ""I met somebody else, that confused me and I didn't know how to deal with it, it wasn't your fault"".

Well, it didn't work out with ""somebody else"" and half a year later she tried to get back in touch with me and at first I was elated at the thought of having  her back - even today when I think about her I still see her as the ""ideal"" woman - but the truth is... there really was no ""what if"" left to answer. If somebody treats you like that, no matter what reasons  he has for it, it's not somebody you want to have a relationship with. You'll never be able to get that memory out of the back of your mind and you'll constantly worry that it might happen again. It's just no basis for a healthy relationship and frankly, if somebody is willing to leave you behind and not even has the courtesy to tell you it's over but instead just ignores you - that person will never make you truly happy.

I can relate to you wanting to know the reasons and thinking about the big ""what if"" all the time but trust me, it really doesn't matter either way. You're better off without him, even if it doesn't feel like it. There are few things worse than abandoning a person that loves you and he did that to you. Just keep that in mind when you wonder about the ""what if"" again: No good relationship can come from a person like that.

It's like it's not even the same person. When he was here in the US, things were fantastic. Of course he still had the same ADHD and anxieties, but being with him in person I fully accepted him and didn't want to change anything about him. I only wanted him to know that I love him either way, and I would do whatever I could to make it work long distance. 

I'll be in the Netherlands indefinitely. Without being too specific, I got hired by a European institution (I have dual US/Italian citizenship) and this has been my dream job--literally, my end goal--since I was 14. I am SO PROUD that I achieved this.

I'm pretty sure if I ring him, we can go out together and I'm sure he will be able to rekindle things with me... but I might not be able to forget all of this. How can I forget this? It's probably not a good idea.",8,t3_267zyg

Second, you know your relationship better than I, so all I can say is people change and he might have changed, so prepare yourself.  Maybe you two will get back together, but unless you talk about what happened, I doubt you'll be able to move on from it.  You don't want to rekindle the relationship if you have this big ugly shadow from the past hanging over you all the time.

It took a long time to get over him the first time. When I had gone a few years without hearing from him, he came back out of the blue and picked up right where we left off. Big mistake. 

History repeated itself basically. I'm sorry that you put in most of the effort only to see it crumble in your hands. I know it hurts so damn much, but the best you can do honestly is forget him entirely (as if you could right? But you have to...), and make the most of the situation as best you can. The Netherlands is where you're going? That's amazing. I wish I could go over there. 

I guarantee when you find love again he'll come back to try to haunt you, but I hope you have the strength to deny him. I didn't deny my ex when it happened to me and I regret it. I was foolish.

It is normal that in your first couple of cycles (and up to a year) to have heavier bleeding/longer periods. Most women report that it normalizes though and become more in line with your original period. I had a copper IUD inserted almost a month ago now, I had spotting and cramping for the first two weeks, but after that it's been smooth sailing. I'll have to see what my first actual period is like though, but I'm hopefully it will turn out as well as the post-insertion process went.

20140522122625,chillynanas,"First of all one thing that needs clearing up is the way in which the different forms of birth control tend to affect the body. The mirena contains a progestogen which can cause the nasty acne/weight gain/irregular periods/moodiness etc side effects. However the mirena has a very localised effect, when you take a mini-pill/depot or have an implant the progestogens are absorbed systemically which is why you can get so many problems with them. The mirena should have very minimal systemic effects because the hormone just doesn't get into your system in the same way. Hair thinning is unbelievably common and as you are probably thinking often due to stress. It's easy to say but you need to just stop worrying about it, there's basically nothing you can do, unless it's something like a thyroid problem or some other illness which is only something you can check with your doctor and blood tests anyway. You are more likely to develop cysts with the mirena, and they could well be causing you some of the pain. Your gynae should also have made sure it was in correctly, because it can (rarely) go into the wall of the uterus. You should have also had checks for sti's before having it put in because it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. 
Essentially what I am very poorly trying to say is that all of the complications that can come from a mirena should have been checked for by your doctor. If the cysts are a real problem then for sure get it removed. There should be very minimal body-wide side effects from it, so have some bloods/other tests done, if they come back ok then you need to have a serious talk with your doctor about other things that could be causing your pain (i.e. stress, depression, fibromyalgia maybe for the joint pain if you don't have arthritis).",1,t3_267r02
20140522123304,loveyourground,"""Essentially what I am very poorly trying to say is that all of the complications that can come from a mirena should have been checked for by your doctor.""

And they have been. I was not sexually active before I had the Mirena inserted so the chance of STI's was pretty nil, but my previous gyno did check me anyway.

I've had several CT scans and pelvic ultrasounds over the past year (3 month follow up after insertion, follow ups for the ruptured cysts) and every report has stated that the Mirena is perfectly in place. 

In a way, I am hoping my pain has somehow been amped up by stress/depression. I've been achey on and off since I got the Mirena but never to the extent as I have been over the past two months. I've also been (admittedly) inordinately stressed over the past two months as well.

Thyroid bloodwork has been clean for a while (and I get it tested pretty routinely as I have a nodule that's been monitored for the past two years.) As I mentioned, I'm getting bloodwork done for potential arthritis soon...so I'm interested to see if anything shows up with that.",1,t3_267r02
20140522124745,chillynanas,"Well that's good then, I would probably try and stick with the mirena because it is reliable and doesn't risk all the issues hormonal contraception can have.
In a way, it will be a much harder ride if it does come down to stress related things. There isn't anything that you have that couldn't be explained by something like that, but you still need to rule everything else out. The chances are there isn't anything 'wrong' that you need to really worry about, but at least if there is something you'll find out soon. 
I hope you start to feel better! Definitely try all the stress relieving things like exercise/yoga/whatever hobbies you may have, it will help you feel better whatever the cause is.

I'm at a reasonable weight for my height/frame and plenty of people have told me otherwise.  ""God, I'm such an idiot.""  Why is that?  Because that report I submitted had a couple mistakes on it?  I've been working in a high pressure industry for years and have always come out on top, so I must be doing something right.

The other thing I'd say is to try not to focus on seeing yourself ""as everyone else sees you.""  Self confidence is something that ideally comes from within, not necessarily from outside validation (though it's really, really, really nice to have outside validation... I mean, c'mon).  The problem is that people's opinions of you will change over time, and there are plenty of people out there that will hate you for no good reason.  Focusing inward on what you like about yourself will help you deal with both of those situations and come out on top :)

I became pregnant due to a birth control failure. I was high risk, the fetus was not developing as it should, and I was truly not even close to being ready (nor my SO) to take care of a child, financially, or emotionally. If abortion was illegal today, I would have never graduated university, landed a decent job, be getting married this year. I would not be financially stable. My relationship with my SO would not be where it is today.
On top of that, because I didn't find out until three months along (I had no symptoms whatsoever, and only figured it out in a sort of 'Bella Swan, Twilight' scenerio), and was taking birth control and prescription medication to control severe allergies and chronic sinitus, there was no guarantee the child would be born healthy due to the medications I was on, nor was there a guarantee that I would be able to handle the pregnancy and delivery due to my (other) health issues.

An 'abortion' doctor saved my life. It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make, and the doctor, nurse and the rest of the staff were supportive, and never made me feel like I was doing something wrong or made me a bad person which is more than I can say for how I was treated by people I actually knew, and the pro-life strangers who shamed me while picketing near the clinic.

In certain cases of online harassment, where the U.S. has jurisdiction over its own citizens, why should a court/jury not be allowed to determine whether such speech is protected, after a specific law is properly written and passed to that effect? This is why laws are created, no?

I seriously doubt that most online harassment would be punishable, and it certainly wouldn't be worth the defendants time in any borderline case.

The goal of a given law is not 100% elimination of a given behavior, which we agree is not possible. Some laws are passed to present social norms, others to reduce problems/discourage behavior,
others to give individuals a platform to pursue justice where no such platform existed before. but a law isn't a bad law just because it can't prevent all the legitimate harassers each and every time or bring back suicidal daughters who were harassed online. 

Here are the experiences of one woman who filed a cyber harassment suit: 

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/12/busting-a-cyberstalker-how-carla-franklin-fought-back.html
Paragraphs suggesting why the laws may not in and of themselves be sufficient include:

""During all of this time, I had lawyers telling me they didn’t know anything about Internet harassment and judges telling me I 
was wasting their time."" 

So, the problem is not entirely in the lack of law, but in their really crappy enforcement, which wouldn't eliminate any bullying at all. Wonder again why a harassed individual might not bother going to law enforcement in the first place?

20140525054229,mlc885,"I'm not arguing against laws banning continual harassment or stalking by an individual, so none of what you just posted has any relevance.

I'm saying that you can't ban online bullying without restricting legitimate and non-harmful speech, largely because the ""bullying"" would likely be a group effort by many unrelated individuals, many with no real world connection to the victim.  I fully believe that legitimate harassment and stalking can be treated just as it is in the real world, but that doesn't mean that unintentionally coordinated actions by a bunch of mean people online can be legislated against without banning anything ""mean."" (i.e. if you espouse some terrible political view and I call you a fascist, should the legal system silence me because I was mean to you? even far more ugly cases with the possibility of a civil lawsuit shouldn't mean that some private party could benefit from an organized system of censorship for unverifiable insults)",1,t3_269k0n
20140525165932,miaret,"you say these exist: laws banning continual () harassment"" and yet next sentence you say ""you can't ban online bullying""
They are the same thing, so yeah, online bullying has been to some effect banned. 

But the limitation to all these laws is the 1st Amendment, which I already stated PROTECTS CERTAIN KINDS OF SPEECH (like the terrible political view scenario you've brought up). It's not going anywhere, and you're seriously underestimating its ability to restrict laws that restrict legitimate free speech. 

And once again, you're speculating without giving the evidence I requested. You're entitled to an argument based on your personal belief and made up scenarios (calling someone a fascist is protected political speech), but without evidence of this as an actual problem in the face of current laws, your argument is weaker and this conversation very clearly has nowhere further to go. ",1,t3_269k0n
20140525223356,mlc885,"I'm probably being unclear, because I haven't ever really put enough effort into my posts to adequately explain myself =( Sorry about that

I'm saying that you can't ban online bullying because, by the nature of internet communication and mob mentality, many of the participants will harass the victim all of once.  Philosophically and morally, I don't see a way to restrict critical speech which could emotionally harm someone without risking the restriction of speech which should ideally be allowed.

Your examples did indeed show that existing harassment laws can often be of little use to victims of certain people with problems, and that does indicate that the law needs to be changed or properly enforced.  I don't in any way believe that people should be able to get away with what is essentially stalking and harassment simply because it is through an electronic medium.  

But I still don't see how bullying can be banned without restricting legitimate criticism and otherwise normal behavior.   If I say some mean thing about you, should that be censored or disallowed?  Keep in mind that some of the most hurtful things can be said without (socially) ""inappropriate"" words.  If I can indeed say something that might hurt you emotionally, or impugn your character beyond some meaningless insult like ""jackass,"" how many people should be allowed to say such things before the action becomes maliciously harmful?

Bullying can't easily be legislated because it is a human failing.  It's difficult to write a law that distinguishes one annoying act from another.  If some group of people organized a ""witch hunt"" to harm some poor individual, that could fall under conspiracy laws, just as individual harassment falls under harassment.  But how do you ban thousands of people saying that you're a jerk or jackass or murderer or sinner or bastard or cunt, only once, and with no prior knowledge or motive against you?  Those individuals could ""bully"" you from afar, without their behavior clearly rising to the level of actionable harassment.

I used the term ""free speech"" in a general and philosophical sense.  In the sense of an ideal, though clearly most people aren't nearly so principled or detached.  I'm not mistaken, however, and I don't need your comic to correct me about government.

But, yes, private parties can maliciously harm me because I suggest things they don't like! Soooo moral

Tell me, what about legitimate criticism that is shut down by your bullying laws?  Acceptable sacrifice?  ""Mean things people say need to be shut down! !!"" It's a pretty embarrassing position to take.

I've been depressed as much as many people, and presumably I've been bullied, though not harshly.  ""Massive scale internet bullying"" deserves action against whatever sort of conspiracy exists, not against the idea that people can speak online freely.  Call me when you start to take action against all the other facts about society that ""can contribute to suicide.""

20140523003349,AppleSpicer,"What bullying laws? I didn't advocate for any of that in my comment. I said bullying needs to be shut down. More specifically it needs to be shut down by the private website providers, online games, and internet communities. A great example is this community. If someone starts calling you a bad name and cussing you out, they get banned. It's no affront to their freedom of speech. They are told clearly in the sidebar that it's unacceptable to attack other members. We do not need to put up with their bullshit because of their right to free speech. Private companies and communities have no obligation to give them a platform to spout whatever they want and they can discriminate as they see fit. 

This is the core of that XKCD comic. It does a good job of arguing that same point in fewer words. 

Also you have no idea what action I take outside of this internet community towards reducing suicide. I actually have dedicated my life's work to helping those in crisis. But that's besides the point. Number one focus of this discussion isn't what I do to stop suicide, it's about whether companies are obligated to host bullying to protect the freedom of speech of the bullies. Hint: they're not. 

Reddit shuts bullying down. Their number 1 rule is no doxxing, no exceptions. They aren't trampling over someone's free speech rights to use their private service to call a witch hunt against someone. They're a private company and can refuse service to someone who they believe is abusing their platform and hurting the rights of privacy and freedom from harassment of their members. This is just one of many examples of companies shutting down bullying. ",12,t3_269k0n

I don't think ""calling someone bad names"" is the worse sort of bullying that can occur, and, barring coordinated efforts, I don't think it's easy or helpful to moderate all bullying.  Also I believe companies will err on the side of censoring all critical speech of any person, rather than judging what is too harmful.  I would see that as a serious danger.

""*to call a witch hunt against someone*"" would be the important issue here, not being rude to someone online.

As an example, let's say I call some racist or fascist a ""monster,"" who is supporting the murder and exploitation of many innocent people.  That could very well hurt that person, and they'd certainly think it was uncalled for since they see their own beliefs as reasonable.  Depending upon what they are advocating, does that make my insulting language necessarily abusive or incorrect, or deserving of censorship?

EDIT:  Oh, and, sorry, you're right.  I assumed you would support legislation to prevent online bullying, but that was unsupported by your statement.  (perhaps I went that direction because of the discussion of freedom of speech?)  I guessed you'd want a formalized system to prevent bullying, which is tantamount to legislation.  If you'd expect a formalized system without legislation, though voluntary agreement between organizations, I really don't see how that would be much better than legislation.  In many ways it could be worse.  Regardless, I don't believe that even private censorship of things that could be considered ""mean"" is a good idea, and I don't think it would be easy to censor only that which is likely to be harmful.

Also, for simple meals you can buy vegetables and tofu (I am vegan) or meat and just stir fry them.

Meditation might help you too, you can find simple instructions online or even guided meditations. On youtube or other places, e.g. Tara Brach has a website with lots of meditations.

Good luck and take care. This can be a very good thing for you, this is a chance for you to learn how to be good to yourself, to do all these things that soothe you and nourish you and that in itself can be very powerful and liberating, in my opinion.

You start with your mental health. You can take all the steps in the world to be physically healthy, and it won't make a dent if you're under this much psychological stress.

If you irreversibly damage your liver, you dramatically reduce your options as far as real medication to treat the PTSD and high blood pressure and any other problems you have or develop. 

Your self-medicating is also only making this worse. Alcohol is a depressant so it helps you sleep and relax, but when it's overused or abused, your body corrects for it and it makes everything so much worse when you aren't drunk that you need more. Your problem is bigger than alcohol and you need more than AA, something more intensive. It could be inpatient rehab or an inpatient stay at a psychiatric hospital, but you need to be in somewhere. It won't be pleasant or fun and you'll be detoxing and facing PTSD, but you're strong and you can do it and when you get done you'll be better than you are now mentally and physically. 

The physical issues are things you can work on with proper guidance. A dietitian will help you learn what a truly healthy diet looks like, and there are cooking classes you can take different places so you can learn how to cook things that aren't fries and corn dogs. Cooking is a hard skill to master but it's very satisfying when you make a really good meal. Exercise is excellent for your mental health and your physical health. There are classes you can join and activities you can do that aren't straight up running and it releases endorphins that calm you and it helps people sleep better. Finding something you enjoy will help you keep with it and feel good about it.",3,t3_269awi

>I don't know how to search for or vouch for a doctor - I just picked a name out of a book and saw if they accepted my insurance. 

That's a perfectly fine way of doing it. Also remember that you hired the doctor - if you find that they are not the right fit for you, you can always fire them and try a different one. 

Other things you do are Google that doctor's name and see if there are any bad reviews, or ask around and see if anyone has recommendations. If you were comfortable sharing your general location (city) here, there might even be someone local to you reading who can make a suggestion. 

>I need a gyno, but I don't even know how to find one of those, and if I do they have to be someone who can deal with a certain level of crazy I get because I was sexually abused. I have terrible PTSD and can't be touched.

Your doctor should be able to refer you to a gyno, and you can also interview them well before anybody starts touching you. The sexual assault helplines and websites linked elsewhere may also be able to help you find understanding and caring professionals for all of your health needs.  ",3,t3_269awi

If she didn't say, I'd make it for as soon as possible, to get going on a plan of care that she will help create for you.  She can give you referrals of names of the other doctors/healthcare providers that you need.  It sounds like there are a lot of treatment avenues that can help your quality of life.  It will take multiple visits to your primary care doctor/specialists at the beginning, and then the intervals will get longer as treatment is established and going well.  But your primary care doctor is the one to start off with seeing again to help direct you.  (feel free to switch to a new one if you are uncomfortable with the one you saw, you can ask to speak with the nurse for recommendations, or, you can just pick another name from the list of available docs.  This is how I found my gyne whom I love) Best of luck!

*Basic* imagine your plate. Fill 1/2 with veggies. Fill 1/4 with meat. Fill 1/4 with carbs. For dessert, have fresh fruit--an orange, a banana, or something else around that size. 

*Advanced*: eat as many natural colors as you can in one day, avoid white foods. 

**Body Health** 
*Basic* walk for 30 minutes daily. 

*Advanced* join a fitness class where they expect you there every time. Yoga or pool aerobics--doesn't matter, so long as it's interesting to you.

**Mental health** 

First, get specifically treated for PTSD with a counselor or psychologist or psychiatrist who specializes in this. After that, then do the basic/advanced, which are meant as general life advice, not treatment for PTSD. 

*Basic* do mindful meditation every day for at least 10 minutes. These are available free online. 

*Advanced* volunteer. Meet people or work with animals. Give back to the community and make friends.

It sucks, but I'm just here to tell you that lots of people have these same feelings. 

I don't like looking at myself in the mirror either, but then I feel even worse knowing that I am a perfectly able bodied person who hates how their body looks even though I have all of my limbs and they work. Like, what should I feel bad about, a misshapen nose? So over all, it's a lose-lose situation to feel bad about myself.

I guess my advice to you is to not dwell on how ugly you may or may not be and not to let your appearance rule your life. Take care of yourself so that you feel good and live your life for yourself and those you care about, not looking for someone who you don't think exists. Don't ever feel that you can't go out because you are too ugly. No one is too ugly to go out and enjoy the world. Have you been to Walmart? Also, don't stop hanging out with your friends because they are prettier than you. If everyone did that, no one would have any friends. Also, I am willing to bet that some of your friends feel the same way and lump you into the group of friends that are prettier than them. If they like you for you, why would you stop enjoying your time with them? Being by yourself, for many people, just compounds your self doubt, but when you are out and having fun, you forget about all the little non-existent worries that you would be thinking about alone. 

You are young. So don't waste your youth staying inside when you could be going out, meeting boys, and doing stupid things like you say. No one promises that you will meet anyone, but you will meet way more people out and about than sitting inside moping. Trust me, I learned the hard way.

Of course, finding confidence that stems from other things than self-image is important too, but I understand it's hard to not value your own appearance because a lot of the times it feels that all society values women for is their physical appearance. In that regard, perhaps you can look for starting new hobbies, or remind yourself of other accomplishments you've already made in life. 

On an aside, somehow watching drag queens performed helped me because those queens are fierce and beautiful and confident and a lot of them are definitely unconventionally attractive.

20140522232339,mildlyfunnycommenter,"Hi. I've successfully and unsuccessfully performed in that department and I think I can help! 

There are a number of ways you can enjoy oral with your partner.

1. Communication: You should tell him what you like and don't like. Let him know how you climax on your own. 
2. The build up: Make sure he takes it slow. Even for women who are sure-fire-jizzers - it's more pleasurable to slowly build up to direct clit play. Have him kiss your chest and move slowly down to your thighs for a few minutes. Tell him to move slowly towards the goal. This intensifies sensation, puts your mind to rest, and feels fucking awesome. I think a few minutes on the labia is a good way to tease a girl. 

Also! A little penetration and pressure from a stable and still finger on the opening of your vagina, well under your clit but not inside the canal - can go a LONG way to intensifying the sensation you feel. He doesn't need to move it around, but a little movement in tandem with his tongue is super-effective. 
 
3. Relax. In my experience, I've come to the conclusion that a woman's orgasm is often about relaxation, and not excitement. If you're stuck in your head trying to pull the trigger - you won't. Just sit back and relax. Rub your pelvis into his jaw a little when he does something you like but let it ride apart from that. 

I hope I helped!

Between being more comfortable about my vagina and having guy go crazy on it because he wanted to and clearly loved it changed my perspective entirely.

And even after all that, it's still not a 100 percent thing. What women like varies so much that the perfect technique for one of you will leave another anxious to just move on.

What you have to do is communicate. Now you can go the straight-foward route, like you're guiding a carrier approach for a fighter plane (*a little to the left, up some, faster, too fast, no too slow now, there is it... whooops need to switch it up now*), you can do the horse-riding method (use your thighs and your hand on top of his head and basically just push him around), and/or you can use the ""pre-game warmup and post-game breakdown"" where you talk him into position, then tell him afterwards what was nice and what wasn't. Personally I preferred all three, but this was something I really wanted to learn.

Now some guys will get upset by this. It's possible they'll get so frustrated they just won't want to do it. Be patient.

[TRIGGER WARNING]




In real life, I don't tell people my whole story because it is so horrific that I came to the conclusion that most people can't really handle it, so I lie (or simply don't volunteer information - there's a word for that but English being my second language I can't recall it now) most of the time.  This is not something I advise. It's far from ideal and it's not that I'm shy or anything, I'm just reserved when it comes to my private life and I can't handle people thinking I'm seeking attention or  lying about what happened.  Ironically, in order to not be labeled a liar, I lie.  I have made peace with that, sort of, cause you know what? My story is mine and til I'm ready to share it *I don't have to share it* at all, and I really don't want to handle the questions and the judgement, and I don't have to.

After years of therapy, I was able to accept and understand everything that happened to me as an adult.  I was also able to recover the memories about two instances of abuse that I suffered as a child, like who my attackers were, and the general idea of what happened. But the third instance is blurry at best.  I'm sure it happened, the place, my general age at the time, that the boys were my age or maybe a bit older, but I don't know who they were or even how many they were, and what took place is again, blurry at best. I have made peace with the fact that I'll probably never remember, and that's ok.  Obsessing with remembering everything made me (I think) create false memories, so I finally let it rest.

By all means, OP, do your homework and research about it if it helps you, but if you're under the care of a professional, and if you ever feel too overwhelmed with the research, and information that you can't process, remember that's also OK to let the research go.  I did.  2X is a wonderful place, but Reddit and the online world in general, can prove to be a very hostile environment, specially during the roughest patches.  I take breaks from Reddit when I need it because I find it to be extremely toxic. My last long break was 8 or 9 months.  I deal with guilt, shame, lack of trust, flashbacks, depression, and panic attacks. Overall, I'm able to control the flashbacks by avoiding triggering situations if I'm not feeling too strong, and by telling myself that it is over, that I'm safe, and by focusing on the present, whatever the present is: Homework, writing a paper, learning Spanish and French, which are my passions, taking pictures, taking care of my pets, etc.  I have bouts of depression, but they aren't as severe anymore and I'm finally able to control them without medication, usually with meditation and relaxation techniques.  Exercising and dancing help me a lot.

I am safe today and life is for the most part good.  I'm a straight A student in my second language (and I'm learning two more!), and I have some friends, but very few close ones and just one that really knows everything about me.   I study and party hard and I want to go to law school.  I studied a semester abroad (Spain) last year and I'm going on another study abroad program (France) next year.  Don't get discouraged, things do get better, and the fact that you're ready to reach out for help in and of itself is immense progress, you should be really proud of yourself.",0,t3_269g5b

Right now it sucks though and hearing your success story helps me to see the light at the end of this journey that I am just beginning.  So thank you again.",1,t3_269g5b
20140523010951,foreignergrl,">  I think just finally admitting to myself that this is a real thing that happened to me is hitting me hard

I know what you're saying.  For years, I lived in complete oblivion of what had happened to me as a child.  It was only after I was raped (already as an adult) that it all came back to me in forms of flashbacks (literary like in repeated scenes of different movies in which I was one of the characters, but  just extremely real, and as if it were all happening at that moment), and in a series of absolutely inexplicable panic attacks.  


Even years after the flashbacks started I either didn't understand what was happening (thought I was losing my mind) or was not able to admit to myself what they were about.  Then, after I could not deny what was happening anymore, I convinced myself that I must have deserved or provoked it.  So, I just want to tell you this, because that's what I wish someone had told me when my journey started:  Be kind to yourself, go easy on yourself, don't be afraid to ask and seek help, and the most important thing to keep in mind at all times is that none of what happened was your fault.  It didn't happen because of anything you did, or didn't do, and there was nothing you could have done to stop it from happening.  Also, like I said before, it does get better.",0,t3_269g5b
20140522172249,Ohess,"Hi, I used to get really bad anxiety before going out on dates and I was very insecure with myself/my body. It got better over time and I guess as I had more experienced with dates. I think you should do what feels comfortable to you. If this guy is truly nice, you could even tell him that sometimes you get anxiety and that you might need some time to take things slowly. The more people I get to know, the more it seems like a lot of them have dealt with personal anxiety in some capacity. 

Maybe if you aren't comfortable with that, you could try to just take the lead in setting up plans/dates etc with him. If you see him during the day time hours, it can be a lot more relaxed, i.e. coffee or a walk. It also has a lot less sexy connotations than having a late evening together.

I understand that sexism sucks and I'm no outsider to being marginalized, but getting angry about it and lashing out in an effort to revalidate yourself by invalidating someone else just makes you no better than him in the eyes of everyone else, at least it does if you go about it like that. Obviously the asshole in question doesn't know a damn thing about vaginas. This is the point I would stress. Get creative and turn him into the butt of a joke about that. A quick ""I guess you'll understand one day when you actually see one,"" said with a smile, would be more than effective. The problem with just getting angry at a dude, with a group of dudes, is that if you react poorly you will be seen as a bitch. I'll be the first to admit this is a fucked up line of thought, but in practice this is what happens. Guys (myself included) don't like being around bitchy girls and we tend to ostracize them so we don't have to deal with their stupid shit. I'm not saying getting angry like this and saying something that will make everyone feel awkward is bitchy behavior, but it is certainly a red flag. Combat this by veiling your disgust with real humor. Sure that dude might feel a little lame when you let into him, but he won't feel too lame when he uses it as a reason to try to not include you in further meetups or is in general just more of a dick to you out of spite. Rather, he's going to feel like a huge tool if you make a joke about his being shitty to women and not getting laid when all the other guys laugh at it.

Yeah, and that's my point ... anal sex is putting ones dick into an orifice intended for vacating waste from the body. I have no issue with it -- I enjoy anal, personally -- but I'm just pointing out that *as a woman who does enjoy anal*, I know for a *fact* that there are guys who won't think twice about sticking dick in the poop shoot without hesitation or even a moment to ask, ""Is it clean?"", but are horrified/ grossed out/ squicked by the everyday workings of the vag. They enjoy vaginal intercourse as well as anal, don't get me wrong -- they're just oddly squicked out by the vag in a way that they aren't by the anus. 

So all I'm saying is that if most guys aren't thinking about the potential of being shat on when they approach anal sex, then why does frank discussion of the vagina suddenly impede their ability to be attracted to the vagina? It doesn't compute.

To an extent you are correct.  Drunk sex is not rape if neither participant says it is rape.  If you go out drinking with your husband, come home, and have sex like any other Friday night, it is highly unlikely that either party will feel that they have been raped.

But the part that isn't a straw man is that any drunk sex *could be* rape.  That's where the problem lies.  Any drunk person who has sex can make a claim that they were raped when they were drunk and unaware of what was happening.  The default position - especially amongst subscribers to this subreddit - is to simply take that statement at face value and provide comfort for the alleged victim.

In fact, even *questioning* whether the event was actually a rape or not is taboo and gets labeled as ""victim blaming""  Nevermind that there is no blaming going on, but rather just an attempt to gather information.

I think that this often doesn't reflect what policies are actually in place.  Take [Harvard](http://osapr.harvard.edu/faq and [Yale](http://smr.yale.edu/definitions-sexual-misconduct-consent-and-harassment).  Harvard says, in response to ""When is too drunk to consent?"":

> According to Massachusetts law, drunk is too drunk to consent

Thanks.  And for Yale:

> Consent cannot be obtained from someone who is asleep or otherwise mentally or physically incapacitated, whether due to alcohol, drugs, or some other condition. A person is mentally or physically incapacitated when that person lacks the ability to make or act on considered decisions to engage in sexual activity.

OK it's if the person its ""mentally incapacitated"" due to being drunk, which is when they can't make ""considered decisions"".  What's a ""considered decision"" anyway?  How considered is considered?

The thing is, these definitions are all vague as hell.  And speaking of MA law, IIRC the Massachusetts courts have explicitly said that ""too drunk to consent"" does *not* mean unconscious or semi-conscious.  And you hear people say ""blackout drunk"" is too drunk\*, when a person can be blackout and still fully conscious and everything, not ""so drunk they can't stand up"".

I think this vagueness is part of the point, actually - look at this from Harvard:

> At OSAPR, though, we want to respect someone’s experience of what happened to him/her. If your friends aren’t upset about what happened then that’s great for them. One person might not feel affected by an experience that would, to another person, be devastating.

I think what this is really about is making it vague enough that if someone feels like they've been raped, they don't have to deal with these technical definitions.  Their attitude is ""if this person is upset enough to be reporting this, then what the person did was probably wrong, and the person was probably too drunk.""  So it's basically a way to call all drunk sex potentially rape, and then rely on the idea that if it wasn't rape the person wouldn't report it.

\* The Harvard page suggests this:

> The person who initiates the sexual act is at fault. After all, *if you’re both blackout* and you sit next to each other all night, nothing bad has happened. But if a sexual assault occurs, someone initiated it and that person is at fault.

But this ""initiated"" answer bothers me.  Sex isn't something 1 person does to another.  And often it's an escalating thing, with different steps initiated by different people (and what counts as initiation anyway?  If one person tells the other person to do something, and that person does it, who initiated?).  Especially given things happening quickly, and people having bad memories due to alcohol, and not to mention the social pressure for the man to initiate even when both people want to do it.  It really seems like a way of saying ""if they're both drunk it's the man's fault.""",5,t3_26a8ab

20140523123547,codeverity,"Yeah, there are a lot of problems with this idea of 'drunk sex = rape'. 

The ideas behind this are good in theory, but poor in execution. First of all, it implies that two drunk people are raping each other, since neither of them would be able to consent to have sex with the other. Second of all, there are varying 'degrees' of drunkenness and there is a difference between being happily drunk and enthusiastically consenting to sex and being blacked out drunk and not even knowing what's going on. 

Since the likelihood of people just stopping the practice of having sex while drunk is not going to go away, I think we are better off educating people so that consent is always highly on their minds and also bringing awareness to the need to keep an eye on your drunken friends when they are about to sneak off to have sex. If the person they're going with looks too out of it to really realise what's going on, then step in and stop them much the same way you'd stop a person from driving drunk. The lack of the latter is the real problem, in my opinion - people tend to assume consent or willingness to have sex instead of being of the opinion 'better safe than sorry'. 

What we really need to work on is building acceptance and support for rape and assault victims, AND try to stop the stigma surrounding regretting sex while drunk (guys feel pressure to feel that any sex is good sex, women worry about being viewed as whores who couldn't keep their legs shut, etc). We also need to work to combat the idea that it's okay to ply someone with a few drinks with the intent of getting them to have sex with you if they wouldn't while sober. No. This is not okay.

The people saying that ""drunk sex is rape"" get this notion for poorly explained and distributed notions of sexual assault, and the logical conclusion of ""you can't consent while drunk.""  I think the author's tone is overly judgmental and totally dismissive of the idea that people think this way (it's isn't a ""lie"" being perpetrated, it's a humongous cultural game of telephone).

I was suspended for a week (so was she) but was damn proud of myself, my parents were supportive, and she never said or did shit to me again. I learned the hard way that just ignoring bullies often does not help because they'll view the victim as easy prey and just keep on doing shit. 

As for talking to the teachers, I agree with your mother, that could make things worse unless she's moved out of all the classes her bullies are in, which can be impossible to do. ",10,t3_26a01t

I chose to confront it more often than not with physical violence, snarky comebacks, combined with actively avoiding extra contact with my peers, (I would sit outside or in the detention room to eat lunch) and being a narc. there being nothing too lose by narcing when you have noone but the authorities on your side.

I started getting tall in about 9th grade, which helped, and a couple of other weird kids took pity on me and I made some friends. it's been all uphill ever since. 

but being 13 sucked. the only thing that made it marginally better was my three book a day habit and that was partly because it meant I always had a weapon at hand. the best thing about how awful it was, is that as an adult my life will never be that uniquely bad ever again. 

what I would say to mini-me is to put your head down and endure. don't talk to these people unless they are going to be nice. just give them the cut direct (which includes blocking them all on social media) and pretend they don't even exist, because you're better than that. being 13 will pass and you will rise above it.

In my opinion, there's only one, nuclear option to effectively deal with the your sister's being bullied - parents should move her to another school (or class). That's right, it's not possible to stop teens from bullying their victim, these little vicious creatures pick a person that is somewhat different and turn their life into hell. If you can force your parents to consider switching schools in one days' time - good, if no - I suppose sister just have to deal with the status of outcast. Or maybe her tormentors will get bored and find another victim, but there's nothing an outsider or even teacher can do.

""yeah, you think your cool when you bully someone who's done *nothing* to you? you're so messed up""

Honestly I have no idea if that would help. But I believe you need to note two things when dealing with this. 

1. All kids think they are, or should act older than they are. 
  They do not see how messed up it is to say, call a 13 year old a girl a slut for wearing shorts. No one has any concept of how young they are, because they are always the oldest they have ever been. 
2. Most bullys have little understanding of the fact they are bullying.
  They think they are vigilantes. they think they are defending themselves, they think they are scaring others away from mistreating them. They might think your sister is deliberately making them look bad. they might legitimately think they have to 'put people in their place' if they deem them to dress 'inappropriately'. Most bullys think they are part of some bizarre natural order, and when something bothers them they have to intervene.  
   This is why I'd recommend to her really spelling it out how messed up what these people are doing is. ""What did I ever do to you?!"" A lot of people try to respond to bullys with other insults, but I really feel this helps the bully to justify their own behaviour, make them see it as more of an even fight.

Sisters are always cute and the obsession of care is pretty obvious for brothers and fathers. I luckily have both daughter and sister. So can understand your concern. 

However your culture is very different from mine as children of so young ages are not promoted (sort of not allowed) to use internet, social networking sites etc. which have other benefits (discussion on this is beyond scope). 

I would like to ask you do a harmless experiment with your sister. 
Find out that from what things (good things or habits) she is frightened of. 
Like going near to animals such as dog, cows, deer etc. or fear with water or fear with big machines, fear of going out alone, fear of interacting new people.

After findings, ask her to confront that fear (obviously in your full supervision and sometimes hidden supervision). If she overcomes the fear 10-12 times. She'll gain much confidence. Ask her to use this confidence against her bullies (in constructive manner).
Like ask her to be confident in whatever she wears. Because whatever she wear makes new fashion. Tell her fashion models every time wear new things. If they think same then new fashion trends would never come. So for gym shorts ...hello Ms. Atheletic. Try to tell her to love herself as much as possible.

Your problem very much seems of having less confidence in herself which need to be nourished as you can never be with her everywhere and in every aspect or time of life. So need is to make her confident enough to face odds of the world.

When I say don't engage, I mean don't talk to them, avoid them and just let them be assholes. If they harass you, you get *someone else* to engage them. I have managed to get a bully to back off by doing this correctly. I believe they ended up crying. The point is that you engage everyone else and let them see how awesome you are. That's how I got my bullies to back off, the rest of the group saw that I was pretty cool and they criticized the bullies for picking on someone who never starts anything.

20140530091439,Kirrivath,"I like how this thread has attracted a lot of downvotes without any effort to enter the discussion. :/

School came easily to me too. That does cause a bit of resentment sometimes even when you're not trying to flaunt it. I was basically Hermione. Even if I wasn't flaunting it unconsciously, I was called on by the teachers as an example, on the honour roll, etc. And I was DIFFERENT, because my life experiences were (and are) different.

Due to my health problems, I couldn't be around drinking, smoking, or drugs. So in high school, everyone thought I was going around JUDGING people for those things, when I was simply UNABLE to join in. I'd have loved to be normal! But my abstinence made them feel their guilt about the choices they weren't comfortable with in themselves. So they took it out on me. It wasn't that they felt bad about it, it was that I was a stuck-up bitch who MADE them feel bad. I was vegetarian at the time too, but not one of those militant ones. I never went around trying to convert anyone - but by the rumours you'd have thought I went around grabbing meat off people's plates and throwing it on the floor so they had no lunch, lol. I just didn't eat meat. (I do now but grateful for the ability to make vegetables taste good.) People made a lot of assumptions about what I was thinking about THEM, and attacked me over that.

When you're smart but the bully calls you dumb; you're pretty but the bully calls you ugly; you're not fat but the bully calls you fat; that can be jealousy, but it can also be the ""proving ground"" teasing of being new at school.

If it's ""proving ground"" then you have to find ways to disengage. If you get upset and show they got to you they'll just get worse. Which is especially difficult if you don't have friends yet and suddenly people are saying nasty rumours about you all the time. It's natural to be upset.

It can also, and this is the tricky part - be because the bully simply wants your attention and they don't have developed enough social skills to do it in any more appropriate way. Like the boy who was pulling my hair in Grade 3.

The only things that really help are to get better verbal deflection/diffusion skills (which can help get other people to help you) and for other people to get trained in bystander skills so that when bullying happens people will understand that it's unacceptable, have empathy even for ""different"" people, and know how to intervene safely.",2,t3_26a01t

Tell the school that they need to monitor the situation, that they need to catch the bullying and aggression in the act, and they need to emphatically end it.   A 13 year old with a permanent record of bullying in their school record will have extra challenges, but will also hopefully overcome the sociopathic behavior with that incentive.


The parents of the bullies need to know that they will not be able to hide behind ignorance.   They need to monitor and restrict their children, and get them the help they need to be useful members of their peer group, or else they (the parents) will suffer the consequences.


This can be handled with tact, and hopefully will eradicate the problem.   However, in all likelihood (as I put on my pessimist cap) this will only speed up the inevitable ugly confrontation with school officials, parents, and police.

I just responded with humor because after knowing she was a bully I didn't care for her opinion. I had no idea almost the entire school hated me. By a few grades in, my response to her had earned respect from some of the most popular people and they started standing up for me sometimes. She got WORSE because of that.

She called me a slut once and I just wondered what rumour it was now... then a very popular boy asked her why, and when she said it was because I was wearing leggings, he got really annoyed with her over it. I was laughing because it's impossible to be a slut when you're still a virgin! So then after that it was all over the school that I was a virgin and this girl was just being a hater for no reason. (Though it shouldn't be anyone's business who is or isn't a slut and if people are sluts just be ethical with it.)

For her specifically... it's tough when you're out of step with everyone around you, but that's what gives you value outside of high school. Think about Lorde - 17, being called ugly and hated on, but a hit record just out of high school? Making how much bank?

Sometimes, as much as it sucks, being hated on lets you focus on what's really important and not lose sight of that in the fluff of life.

People may have hated me, but when I left that school, there were 11 French Horn players in Grade 9, all brothers and sisters of people I'd gone to school with. They saw me playing it and decided it was the coolest instrument ever. That was unbelievable to me, the power of standing up and saying ""yes I'm weird, so what?"" while just doing my music thing.

20140523081025,washingtonjacksons,"Ok first off, as a former 13 year old girl, you can tell her that being bullied is a good thing.  If she's not 200 pounds, or has acne, or is poor and wears clothes from Goodwill, then the most likely source of bullying is the fact that girls are jealous of her.  Three points:

1.  As girls go through puberty their bodies change.  Their interests change along with their bodies.  Her two ""best friends"" could be more into boys, or doing 'grown up' things, while your sister hasn't changed.  I remember in 6th grade my two best friends 'broke up' with me, because they wanted to talk to boys, and I was just hanging out reading Little House on the Prarie.  There was a disconnect. 

2. Girls making fun of you is a good thing!  Girls in high school used to make fun of me because I had a really light period.  Yes, my period lasted about 4 hours and then it was over.  They'd call me 'lesbian' and 'dyke' and say that I was faking it.  You know what? Forget those bitches, guess who didn't have PMS, cramps, bloating-- this girl! It still made me sad, but once I got older I realized how ridiculous the bullying was.

3.  My husband's cousin started getting made fun of when she was 14 for having red hair.  They called her Ginger.  This girl had beautiful hair, she looked like Sophie Turner.  Anyway, when they bullied her, she dyed her hair black, transferred schools, ended up with zero self esteem, and was pregnant at 15.  When you succumb to bullying like she did, your life gets messed up.  

Anyway, I'm sorry this is so long.  But tell your sister that it's ok to lose these two girls she thinks of as friends, and also that it's normal for girls to do this especially around her age.  And that she needs to ignore those girls at school.  But the most important thing is that she needs to not let the bullying bother her, because it probably is a good thing she's being bullied.

20140523104109,clairebones,"I'm sorry, but this is an absolutely awful thing to say. First of all being bullied can absolutely ruin your life, as it does to many people. Feeling hurt by what bullies say to you does not make you weak, it does not mean you will go off the rails and get pregnant at 15, nothing like that. It is an entirely healthy response to feel upset when people intentionally hurt you.

Secondly, not all bullying is due to jealousy, especially not at 13. Bullies bully because they can. Because nobody tells them not to, because they enjoy the reactions they get, because nobody has ever properly taught them the concept of empathy. Telling a little girl ""They're just jealous"" isn't helpful at all - you risk making her hate herself even more, and think it's her fault that she is bullied, and wish that she wasn't who she was. This can completely destroy someone.

I know you probably mean well, but a) bullying is not 'normal' and we should not allow it to be considered 'normal', it is awful, and b) it is never ever a good thing to be bullied no matter what the circumstance.",2,t3_26a01t

I never said bullying is normal.  I said it's normal for girls to break up with friends at around 12 and 13, as part of their transition from childhood to adulthood.  

Also I think acknowledging that bullying comes from jealousy helps girls to frame events in a more positive light.  When someone thinks ""I have red hair and I am hideously ugly and people hate me and that's why I'm getting bullied"" it's going to affect their mental outlook/self esteem more than when someone thinks ""Whatever, these girls are just jealous.""

I thought it was my fault for having something to be jealous of, I thought 'they could have whatever they want if they just left me alone'. 

I think if we explain that bullies are genuinely horrible people who have never been taught to be nice it may work better - then we learn that bullying is not related in any way to us personally, it's just a horrible person saying whatever they can to be horrible.

I was feeling disrespected and as though I was more invested in the relationship than he was. I would go out of my way to visit him, accommodate his preferences, and work around HIS schedule with HIS friends. And he would not provide me with the same considerations. 

I became withdrawn and bitter, but eventually a straw broke the camel's back and I told him what was bothering me by reading it from a letter (I knew I would stutter and lose my words if I didn't have it on paper in front of me). 

He was completely clueless. Had no idea he was doing those things and had no idea how it made me feel. In the next few months he made changes - seeing me more often, not rescheduling our dates around times his buddies spontaneously wanted to hang out, bringing me ""just because"" flowers. And I started being more open about what I wanted from him - communicating more often to him how I felt and reacting VERY positively when he did something that made me happy. (...Blow jobs. I gave him blow jobs.)

It's been two years since then and even though I sometimes find myself being more complacent than I should be (and he sometimes finds himself being more inconsiderate than he should be), we both are still together and still make the effort to correct these things in ourselves on a consistent basis.

You don't GAIN respect, you should demand respect in a relationship.

It sounds like you have been a passive participant in this relationship and it is time for you to stand up for yourself.

Everything is fine in the relationship because he doesn't have to do anything to keep it going, you are the one who is being ""the Pleaser"" and he is very happy to be the ""Receiver""

A common dynamic seen within couples is that one partner tends to please while the other tends to receive (the giver and the taker). 

These opposites attract each other, because they are complementary and each partner needs to develop some of the qualities of the other side. If each partner becomes more one-sided and excessive in giving or taking, the relationship becomes more and more oppressive and unsatisfying. Ideally, both partners give and receive whole-heartedly for the right reasons without any strings attached.

Pleasers need to learn to ask for and receive what they desire from others. There really can be no true giving unless givers take care of themselves and are able to receive as well. They also need to develop the ability to let others take care of themselves on occasion, and to make sure their giving has no sense of reciprocal obligation or neediness attached.

People who are people pleasers do so because they want to be liked – and usually they want to be respected along with this. However the reality is often unfortunately that they in fact lose respect from being so giving. People see people pleasers as pushovers, as doormats and as people with no backbone. Thus they will tend not to think highly of them, or to respect them",-4,t3_26absq

20140523125732,Velvetrose,"Oh of course...

If someone simply takes and takes, without an ability or desire to give back, then there is a devouring quality in the receiving rather than joy and appreciation. 

The person who only receives and doesn't give to others has a sense of entitlement based on deficiency rather than self-worth. They can seem selfish or greedy, and incurs resentment in those who continue to give.

Receivers seem to fear that they will become empty or lose part of themselves if they give too much. So instead, they tend to hoard what is brought their way.

Often this includes a blanket or a jacket that smells like the original sender of the package. That one is probably my favorite; I love cuddling up with one of his jackets when I go to sleep.
>  We also watch a tv series together just so we are connected with the same things.  Every week when GOT comes out we watch it at the same time and then talk about if afterwards.  Along with our skype dates we will have a ""specialty date"" which includes a fancy dessert/dinner.  We dress up (from the waist up. The rest doesn't matter anyways) and then buy a fancy dessert or dinner and just act like we're on a regular date :) Super fun. 
>  You are very lucky that you get to see him so often.  I only see my boyfriend twice a semester.  I have one more year to go and then I finally get to move back home!
> Feel free to ask me any other questions or PM me if you need :) I wish you all the luck in the world!

20140523115351,Whispers_Gratata,"My boyfriend (now husband) have lived as close as 2,700 miles and as far apart as 5,500. 

We would have our ""skype dates"" usually once every other week. On a Friday or a Sunday. We would call each other once a week for a ""run down"" of each other's weeks (more if we were planning to visit each other.). And we would text all the time. 

We were long distance for three years and yeah it totally sucked, but it really made every time we saw each other more meaningful. 

There was one time we were going through a rough patch and I decided ""fuck it"" he doesn't have any plans for the next couple weeks (besides work) and I have a six week break between classes so I bought a one way plane ticket and had his roommate pick me up at the airport and when he came home the next day. There I was. I spent 5 out of the six weeks I had off there. It was awesome and really strengthened our relationship. 

When he moved further away was when things got really stressful. I was trying to plan our wedding with a 17 hour time difference and him being busy with a brand new job. We skyped every other week. When things would get extremely difficult I would re read our texts and look at our pictures. There were a lot of tears. Knowing the next time he had leave would be 12 months away. And I wasn't making enough money to fly to him. 
Communication. That's really the only thing. We didn't get jealous when the other went out and had a fun night (ok I got a little jealous but when he calls at 3am his time drunk and missing me it's kinda cute). We didn't pick stupid fights because we knew the time we had to talk was limited. We talked through text a lot. I think what really helped him was planning things we would do when I got to him.

20140523082904,spsprd,"I've had a certain amount of training and experience in family systems. A major element is dynamics: how do the members of the system interact, how do they stir up emotions in each other, how do they react to change, etc. Anything that affects one member of the system affects the entire system - the first hospital unit I was actually employed in had a mobile hanging in every room as a reminder of that.

See if you can explain to your boyfriend that this is not about ""mental health issues,"" but rather about the dynamics between you. And between you and your family, and between him and his family, and how all those dynamics affect the two of you. When you're a member of a couple, it's hard to see how all these elements play out - that's what the systems therapist is for.

One example: an argument that a couple returns to over and over with no solution in sight. The dryer lint, the toilet seat, the checkbook, the chronic lateness - whatever. A systems therapist will try to help the couple stay curious and figure out where their conversation turns into an argument, and why.

Another example: one member of a family breaks out of a crazy family pattern such as drug/alcohol/food addiction. Untreated, unconsciously, the family will try to return to homeostasis, the familiar ways of interacting - including dysfunction. 

Final example, one I have seen many times: it's time for the youngest kid to graduate high school and leave the nest. No one has thought about it consciously or mentioned it before, but this means mom and dad will be alone together for the first time in years. If the mom and dad have a history of dysfunctional relationship, they will (unconsciously) do whatever they can to keep that youngest kid at home. The youngest kid will oblige by screwing up, failing senior year, getting arrested, falling into drugs, become depressed and unable to work... All because of the power of systems dynamics.

Oh, the other thing you might expect is the feeling that your therapist is no longer exclusively on YOUR side. Which can be very annoying, but it's worth talking about as the focus shifts from you to the dynamics between you and your SO.

Best of luck! Hope you both get some helpful insight.",1,t3_26ae5u

There is also the idea in mens' circles that getting mental help is emasculating. Only the weak ask for help, or have issues. 

I myself came from a family where seeking mental help was taboo, and had it in my head that it would make me less of a man to seek help. I got over it though with coaxing and reasoning. He probably would too. If he's in the relationship for the long haul, he should have that instinct to dive in and 'take one for the team' if it would make you feel better. I'm also pretty sure he too would find it liberating, even if he keeps it to himself. ",1,t3_26ae5u

I'm proud of you for taking the steps you konw you need to take.

I'm a 50 yr old happily married woman. Yes, I have taken SO to therapy with me, and I have accompanied my SO into therapy.

It has nothing to do with him.   You are asking him to support YOU.  You are asking him to get the tools he needs to have a better relationship with YOU.  

Your counselor should be able to help you open the conversation with him.  Your counselor probably has a handout that you can give your boyfriend that details the type of counseling, the point of the counseling, the types of things that will be discussed.  Ask your counselor.

One session with a particular SO was enough to convince me that it was time to end it (I waited 1 week which was too long -  should have ended it on the way home from the session).   Different types of issues need different types of support.  And knowing what type of support to give helps a lot.

Obviously both are important when speaking for jobs like firefighter and lifeguard, but I don't understand a minimum requirement difference for strength in passing a test. There should be a set weight you need to be able to lift in your job (expected weight of a drowning child for a lifeguard or average weight of a senior citizen for a firefighter as random examples).

Physically fit people can do the jobs that require these kinds of tests, and the situations in which they would need to use their fitness on the job aren't easily replicable.

Someone might not agree with me, but I think views like ""women aren't physically capable of doing this, let's lower their standard"" is really problematic and doesn't do anything to help women's equality.

OK, but let's not forget that many of those men going the extra mile are doing so with the support of their wives who are putting in the hours to look after their home, looking after sick kids, moving across country to support their husband's career advances, etc.

For many families this is in fact a good distribution of labour. It makes sense for one parent to sacrifice career advancement in order to support their partner's. But we have a problem when it's assumed that women will take that role, because employers see women as less reliable, unlikely to put in the hours, etc. It's harder to make it as a stay-at-home-dad/career-woman combo because of the prejudices employers have against female employees.",4,t3_26ac4g

20140524011726,HouseReddit,"""Toning"" your arms isn't really a goal. It's a generic word that describes how you'd like your arms to look eventually. There's no such thing as toning though; you can lose body fat, you can gain muscle, or you can try to do both at the same time which is known as ""recomposition"" (which is an ineffective and slow way to achieve any fitness goal). 

If you want to build arm muscles, you should do bicep and tricep exercises and eat more calories, protein in particular, to build more muscle. 

If you don't want bigger arms, but want them to be smaller but more defined, you should lose body fat by eating less and, again, doing arm workouts to maintain muscle mass.

Trying to ""tone"" tends to waste people's time; you can workout as much as you want, but if you aren't eating for your goals and doing proper exercises, you won't see any changes whatsoever in your body.

I always want to think I'd stand up for myself, and I know I should because I have the same rights and deserve respect like everyone else, but it's hard! I'm reading The Gift of Fear by Gavin deBecker (I like it, but I have some critiques) and he talks about how some violent men (it's very heterocentric) will target women who are hesitant and won't say no. I think it's problematic to state it in a way that puts the onus to avoid violence on the potential victim, but I always think about that now when I feel like I may need to stand up for myself.

We were not in traffic and the roads were pretty clear as this was the middle of the afternoon. An elderly woman was in the crosswalk and still had ""the walk"" sign. For a woman of her age, she was walking pretty quickly, albeit hunched over. Suddenly, the cabbie slammed on his horn and shouted ""COME ON!"" out his window at her, scaring her. She walked a little quicker and the cab turned when she was clear. I immediately said to him, ""why did you do that?"" and he said ""she was walking so slow and blocking the road!"". I explained that she had the walk, and that she was elderly. I told him there was no need and I wasn't (for once) in a hurry to get to my destination. He started complaining about her, calling her stupid. Almost as if he was talking about a piece of property. It was most definitely because she was female. So I said, ""I wouldn't treat anybody like that, much less someone of her age. I HOPE to be in that good of health when I'm her age, walking around NYC. She's probably someone's mother, someone's sister, someone's grandmother. Would you say those things to your grandmother?"" He was quiet for the rest of the trip. I did not tip him. ",55,t3_26atum

20140523160750,Xscepi,"Damn, I read that last night and I was impressed. I thought the way you handled the situation was perfect, with respect to the Bride and Groom and a full explanation to them about why you wouldn't attend. I think that took a lot of courage on your part, ESPECIALLY given that you were now exposing a very sensitive part of your life in great detail. I was then very pleased to read how the Groom went about handling the situation. From my personal perspective that was the best part of all of it, that he had enough respect for you and the situation to immediately turn around and call this guy to un-invite him from the wedding.   
I'm really sorry you got some terrible PM's. I for one was glad to see the sub hit default as I have learned quite a bit while being here. One of the best posts I saw was the post where a 19 year old man asked what feminism was. He was clearly misinformed (I'll admit, I had some inaccurate preconceived notions as well) and the women that responded to him had some absolutely FANTASTIC responses. It was really a great thread, and I am really glad I read it.  
That all being said, I understand that the change to a default subreddit also comes with the influx of default trolls and hatemongers. It's really unfortunate, and I wish I had stumbled across this sub a long time ago. Like I said, I really have learned a lot and I feel like I understand the women in my life a bit better than I did before.

I feel like subreddits like subredditdrama inevitably become the focus of trolls,  given that they point out places where users are coming together with very different opinions,  which are easy targets for people who feel the need to get a rise out of someone.  It's very unfortunate,  because I enjoy reading discussions from multiple perspectives.  I feel like it allows me to see topics from different view points,  which is something my mother tried to stress for me to do from a very young age. As a by product of the increase of trolls however,  I see posts like the one we are in now,  where users no longer feel comfortable in the places they once turned to for support and to gain a sense of community.  This makes me very sad,  both for the people that no longer feel comfortable,  as well as for the lack of perspective and knowledge that so many could have gained. ",7,t3_26b8fz
20140523174739,Deimorz,"Hi, 2XC. Since this thread's getting a fair amount of attention, I'd just like to take this opportunity to explain a few things around the situation from an admin perspective that I think it's useful for people to keep in mind as this topic continues to come up.

I mostly just want to urge people to not take everything at face value. There are a lot of people that seem quite invested in trying to get the mods to remove this subreddit from the defaults, and unfortunately that means that they're willing to try to cheat, lie, and do various other unsavory things to influence this decision.

For example, the OP of this thread was using at least 5 alternate accounts to attempt to tilt things in here, including upvoting their own submission and supportive comments (and they've now been banned from the site for that). There's generally just a great deal of attempted manipulation going on around the topic of 2XC being a default, between people attempting to manipulate votes, using multiple accounts to post comments supportive of their side, organized groups brigading relevant posts, etc. Some people have even been performing what's often referred to as a ""false flag"", where even though they're actually normally a contributing member of the subreddit, they've been creating alt accounts to make or upvote harassing comments/messages in order to make that issue seem more prevalent than it actually is.

And on the topic of harassing PMs, one of the most frustrating aspects of the situation from our perspective is that there's been a significant amount of lying on this end. We've received quite a few reports about users who have claimed to have received a large amount of harassment, but when we investigate we find that they've often never received any PMs at all, or only one message when they claim to have received many. Some people have even gone so far as creating alts to PM themselves with, so that they can take screenshots for ""proof"".

I'm certainly not trying to say that there hasn't been any harassment, because some definitely has actually occurred (and please report it to us by [sending a modmail to /r/reddit.com if it happens to you](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com)). But between the various outside groups trying quite hard to push 2XC out, the false flags, and the lying, please take all claims about it with a large grain of salt.

Just to be clear though, we'll be perfectly happy with whatever decision the subreddit eventually makes about whether to remain a default or not. We definitely like having it as a default (which is why we asked the mods if we could include it), but if they decide they've changed their mind, that's great as well. I'd just really like to see that the decision is made honestly, instead of as a result of all the manipulation going on around it.",450,t3_26b8fz

I would be interested to know the ratio of ""false flag"" harassment reports to ""legitimate"" harassment reports. 

I might be guilty of reading too much into your statement, but phrases like ""quite a few"" accounting for a ""large amount""  of harassment, and ""not trying to say that there hasn't been **any** harassment"" sort of make it sound like a considerably large percentage of these reports are fabricated. Are you talking about a sizable minority, a majority? 

I understand you pretty much said you were not trying to be dismissive, but your overall tone does seem vaguely dismissive.

So what are the numbers of false reports vs. legitimate reports, to the best you know? I imagine this information would be fine to post, since you called out OP (appropriately so). 

I think that the administration attempting to give a quantifiable breakdown of these items would be extremely beneficial to future discussion.

20140523191254,redtaboo,"Thank you and cupcake for posting here about this, we've been doing our best to weed the legitimate criticisms and complaints from our community and we've had our suspicions about some of the posts we've seen. 

It's heartening to know that some of our suspicions were correct, though the fact that some from our community may have participated in false flagging by sending shitty PM's to some of the women here or upvoting harassing comments instead of reporting them is very disappointing to me. It doesn't make sense to me since the largest argument against us being a default is that it makes this space less safe, so you participate in making it less safe by threatening people? 

To address any concerns I'm seeing in response to you that this means there are no legitimate complaints, that's not what Deimorz said at all, just that we should question both where it's coming from and which groups are doing it and why. 

We do still know there are legitimate concerns (as deimorz reiterated at the end of his comment) and that the number of shitty PM's may have gone up.. though it's important to note here that those are not a new thing here. We've always been known to the dedicated trolls (and wider reddit) and been a target of theirs. At different times different groups have targeted us ever since the day we were created, trolls and shitty PM's are not a new thing here.

We still are reading the complaints and taking them to heart as much as we can but we, like everyone should, will continue to have that grain of salt in mind going forward. ",37,t3_26b8fz
20140523183419,Crolleen,"Thank you for posting this. As a woman and a reddit user and not a 2X subscriber I can see both sides. I understand how the women in this sub viewed it as a safe haven and that most other casual users of reddit are sarcastic and argumentative and enjoy playing devils advocate which isn't what this subreddit is for. I do agree that it should be removed as a default, both for personal reasons (I REALLY don't enjoy seeing posts about period poo and gross baby stuff etc on my leisurely reddit browse. If I wanted that I could search for it) and for the reasons of well intentioned subscribers to this sub. They should have a place for support from other women without fear of ridicule.  

But let me add this because as a woman I've been compelled to comment on a few posts I have seen. The women in this thread that I have encountered seem to me to be cliquish and unwilling to accept any opinion that may differ from their own. I have gotten some pretty rude and heated responses for simply stating a different and polite viewpoint or trying to look at things from another perspective to help the OP without being mean or sarcastic.   

So, I think the women in this sub are their own worst enemies. The ones doing the things you've mentioned deserve each other and are better left to their private girls club where they can complain and shoo away pests with their mob mentality.

Selecting only out of what is received in reports may be one of the reasons why you're seeing that sort of rate.

They also may not report them if they feel that it wouldn't be taken care of, which I can totally understand if an admin uses nebulous language to describe how many people are lying about harassment, especially if the motivation for the people lying/exaggerating isn't known.

TLDR; if you want to put a female in a suit, do it right, or you are just furthering sexist clothing type problems. 

It's great that they have a strong young lady in a great looking PANT suit. This is huge. SO many people still think that skirt suits and hosiery are the only appropriate professional attire for women. As someone going into the ""white collar + suit is a must"" industry, it is still hard to find any kind of suit for a woman, including a skirt suit. By suit I mean that the fabric that the jacket is made from is the same fabric that the bottoms are made from. otherwise it a coat and bottoms, not a suit. 

HOWEVER, here is the pessimistic part, this is not a functional suit, and this is not a appropriate suit. It is not functional as it has no pockets. UGH. Woman have to carry things too, like wallets and phones, and papers. It is NOT always ok to carry a purse. Why do our suits have no pockets, when men have 4 pockets on their pants and 2 outer coat pockets, and 2 inner coat pockets? Also, our suits are always cut to be less that functional, pencil skirts are not good for lifting and moving and walking. This suit does not have crisp pants, and is made out of a satin like fabric, therefore this suit cannot be taken seriously as a real suit. This furthers the idea that women do not have real jobs that require real suits.  ""Oh, but if you want a good suit, you should have it tailored."" Yeah, sure, but why should I have to have every suit hand designed and made for me when men do not have to, to have a functional suit. 

It's pictures like this that make me cringe, and keep shitty suits on the racks of every department store. VIVA LA SUIT REVOLUTION!",-38,t3_26b1yo

20140523103838,zazzlekdazzle,"This is a very good and insightful question.  I think you have hit the issue right on the nose: people can say they want to help (and mean it) but can do so without understanding what it is to they are committing to do.  However, I am actually not all that sure that talking to him about it (beyond a certain point) is really the answer.  I actually recommend a more practical and less theoretical approach:

(1) Let your husband do things as much his way as possible.  Hey may not know his way around the house and tasks as well as you do (or think you do), but he'll learn the same as you did.  Don't think of your husband as an employee of the domestic sphere where you are the boss.  One of the rules I have noticed about being both an employer and a romantic partner is that things can get done your way by you or done someone else's way by someone else, but you cannot expect things to be done your way by someone else.  Let him learn his own ways of doing things.  

This is not always easy, I actually have to leave the kitchen when my partner loads the dishwasher because I feel like he doesn't do it the special Tetris-like way I perfer.  But he's doing it, and learning his own way to do it better.  Yeah, when he makes dinner he always makes salmon in foil in the oven, but even he is getting tired of that and he is looking into how to make other things or at least get something else on the dinner table -- e.g. he just discovered pre-made food at the supermarket.  And yes, I like all my food home cooked from scratch, and don't love eating take out so much, but you know what?  I don't have to deal with dinner, and that's worth it.

Things aren't getting done exactly on your schedule?  Let it go.  

(2) You don't need to split the labor of every individual task evenly, sometimes it's good to specialize, just make sure it shakes out in the end as even.  Maybe only you do the laundry and only he takes care of paying the bills, I think that's fine.  If you guys both feel like those tasks take the same time and effort, call it even.

(3) It's OK to remind people to do things, as long as you're nice about it.  Reminding is not nagging.  Both of us in our partnership are sort of absent-minded professor types and easily get sucked into doing a bit more work or reading newspaper article online on the way to doing some onerous housework.  It's actually nice to have someone wake you up to remind you, and definitely preferable to having them seethe about it.  And don't get stuck in the trap of it being the ""principle"" that he should remember. Don't make these things a test of his love and devotion to you. The ultimate goal is a domestic sphere that functions well, not a political victory for feminism. Keep your eye on the prize.

(4) You can also just cut the Gordian Knot and get some part-time help.  My partner and I can make it day to day with the shopping, cooking, washing the dishes, etc.  However, if we had to clean our own toilets or mop the kitchen floor on a regular basis, our partnership would be war. We both hate doing these things and put them off, not to mention the fact that we can't do these things -- or really anything like them -- as well as a professional can.  We save our money and spend the equivalent of about $30 a week (just having coffee at home rather than Starbucks pays for this) on domestic help to come every 2-4 weeks and really clean the house top to bottom.  This also helps with the inevitable domestic stress of having any sort of guest, because I will always feel more tense about how the house looks if people are coming over.  We just make sure to schedule the big clean-ups before the guests come.

As an additional piece of advice, I would look at the way your fiancé's parents do/did things, as this is likely his default template.  Things his mother did are likely the things that will be invisible to him and may need some more reminding.

EDIT: I would just like to add that I didn't figure this all out by myself, I am actually the child of a marriage between two people with very demanding careers and I was able to see how it was done.  My parents did have an additional, but possibly extreme, innovation that might be worth noting.  In the event that you can never agree with your partner on what it means to have the place be properly clean, you each get your own room to keep however you want and the other person can't say anything about it.  My dad's study looks like Don Coleone's from *The Godfather,* while my mother's looks like a home after a tornado. The rest of the house is maintained to the point reached by consensus and isn't perfect for either of them.  We had to put the dining room table in a hallway and give-up on any sort of extra room for guests or a den or anything like that, but I think it was worth it.  My partner and I are more aligned in how we think about maintaining the house, but as we get more into work and more set in our ways in middle-age I fully expect we may enact this system.  It's also great for keeping that sense of self and privacy that can be a bit lacking in even the best marriage.

> This ""problem"" is hardly gender specific,

This is very true (particularly in my partnership and that of my parents), but the question was one that addressed the issue specifically when a woman feels more competent in the domestic sphere, I think, than her male partner. 

I do thing there is an issue with ""invisible"" work, domestic work, that tends to get done by women and not acknowledged.  It is by no means universal, but I do think it is an issue that many men -- particularly or even exclusively those brought up with mothers who did most of the domestic work -- don't completely understand the work that needs to get done to run a house.  No one taught them, and they may never had seen a man doing it, and thus never pictured themselves doing it or needing to understand it.  As a result, many of these men enter into partnerships with women fully meaning to share the domestic labor, but without understanding what needs to get done much less how.  Often, but not always, women have a better understanding of this for the same reason that men may not: they saw their female relatives doing it and may have even been explicitly taught how to do certain things.

And there is a flip-side to this, sometimes these same women just assume they always know the best times and ways to do things when they don't. They assume the man is less competent when in fact he may just be less experiences, or doing things just as well just differently.  T

My post was written to address both of these issues.  Whether a man doesn't know how to do things or just does things differently, don't treat him like he is your employee and you are the boss.  For one things, if equality is what you want, then you certainly aren't modeling it by taking the superior role.  And secondly, let someone who might not have as much experience catch-up and in his/her own way.  

It's hard to address an issue that may be systemic, meaning it is not necessarily localized to a single relationship, without over generalizing.  But I know exactly the phenomenon that OP is talking about and it is a big topic among my female friends -- how to avoid doing the bulk of the domestic work with our male partners, all of whom, I am sure, thinking of themselves as the model of political enlightenment and completely equal-minded.",1,t3_26as0z

The OP worried me, because it seemed she is setting up her partner to fail by insisting there is a ""right way"" to perform housework (read: her way) and she expects her partner to do his share of that housework. Sadly, part of sharing a life with someone is learning that if you want a task done a certain way, you're either going to have to do it yourself or remind your partner, probably repeatedly, of the way you want it done. 

For example, our hardwood floors: my partner is a swiffer-the-high-traffic-areas-once-a-day person, I'm a hand-wash-every-square-inch-once-a-week person. Luckily, our different approaches complement one another so we end up with fairly clean floors. But there are a lot of other different tasks that we each do differently, and the more of those that we each can let go, the better our domestic life is.

20140523103826,barbaq24,"I have been on your side of this issue in the past. The answer comes in two sides of the same coin.

First, these tasks are invisible to him because, like myself, you internally monitor and take care of them. He may do this with certain things in his life but perhaps he never had to take on these particular tasks so he has no opinion about them. In essence he is color blind to filling the pantry. He needs to learn, with your help to see the colors of how those tasks in the house function. So he must learn to identify things that need upkeep, and then must learn how to rectify them.

Next, this is all you. Part of the issue you have is that you aren't color blind. You ""know to much"", you can see the matrix code of living in a home. You must begin to willingly and actively commit to vocalizing your internal process to your SO. If you keep communicating that you need certain things in the house he will become familiar with them and begin to learn the process. Be sure to do this as if it's for your sake as well. Don't talk at him, talk with him. Teach it, don't demand it. Also certain items may need to be rationalized. Since he may not know their purpose. ""It's important to have eggs, because in addition to breakfast, they also are the foundation of baking, breading, and other meals.

20140523122130,shoresofcalifornia,"I just wanted to add a different perspective to all this 'traditional' gender roles convo cause I've seen a little too many answers about men knowing about maintenance which obviously women don't know about. I'm sure that's true of many people but it feels like a bit of an assumption when this is a much bigger problem that every woman I've ever talked to about it is willing to rant about

I grew up with a single mother and so did many of my friends growing up, many of them men. Maybe I was blessed in a different way but we didn't have gendered expectations so much, housework was seen as a way to thank your mother and lighten her load. A lot of us did laundry and mowed, and when I got my first car I knew about maintenance or learned to google more and not be ignorant.

I got in the habit of, don't know how to do it? Internet! When my SO and I but heads I really struggle with understanding how he could have never done laundry before or done car maintenance or fixed broken electronics, cleaned a toilet, etc. I understand the frustration he has but I find it so hard to hear the I don't know how to do it, when if didn't always know either...I know to google it. just like my friends and I would ask each other on how to know what was most likely wrong with the car or how to get grass stains out while our parents worked long hard hours and couldn't answer us.

I look forward to seeing the responses you get cause I'm sure we could all learn a lot I just hope this doesn't end up with the assumption that so many of us are comng from these gender roles and don't understand how to live outside them",17,t3_26as0z

That's pretty much how he's going to be.

Now, you might ask that he at least rinse his dishes instead of letting them get crusty and write down the things he specifically wants on an on-going list you keep on the fridge to make shopping easier.

It might be that car maintenance is important to him so he's in charge of making sure all that is squared away. Or that the trash is taken out nightly, so if you at least pull it out of the can when it's full and put a new bag in, he'll take it outside.

It might be that you need to take on the invisible tasks anyhow because he's just not going to see everything you do or want done, so you just give him easy chores to remember and that he can't be afraid of doing wrong (and if he doesn't do it your way, that's too bad, you cannot say anything unless he's shrinking your clothes or shredding the carpet somehow).

That was 10 months ago.

We went from being perfectly independent adults to sharing a bank account (due to is both being poor, not because we were truly ready), chores, a living space, and being -literally, for several months- each other's single real person to spend time with 24/7 basically overnight.

Note: I don't recommend this, it wasn't easy, and we have gone through at LOT of adjustment (personally and together) during this time, but it has been worth every second. 

What we have learned:
He has no idea what is in the fridge, even if he boxes it up and put it there himself.
He needs 8 hours of sleep or he's an ass for the first 30 minutes of the day.
I have to put away my own laundry because the way I keep my dresser drawer (chaos) gives him anxiety.
He has to do laundry because it's too heavy for me to carry 3 flights of stairs, plus he needs it done more often than me.
Despite hating mornings and getting out of bed, if we want to get out the door on time, I have to shower first.
My car is my space to treat the way I want, and his car is his space to treat the way he wants.
I have to remind him to clip his toenails.
He has to remind me to clean the cat box.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that the living with someone is absolutely wonderful, but not without adjusting your own lifestyle a bit. If you are any bit as stubborn as we are, it takes a lot of communication and loving to figure out what pieces of your routine or daily life are important to who you are as a person, and which pieces you need to adjust to make your place home to the both of you.

It's great you are being proactive about this. Be sure to give him time to voice his concerns, too.

20140523115249,martin_grosse,"I think the issue here is that you're starting with a few assumptions about what the words ""capable"" and ""need"" mean. 

The qualifying question to ask is ""What happens if this doesn't get done?""

You have a good statement when you say ""We both have about the same standards for what ""clean"" means"". I think what you're seeing here is that you've been trained with one cultural standard, and they've been trained with another. This was the case for me when I got married. My wife had one standard for what cleaning meant. What doing the dishes meant. What kinds of foods she liked to eat. How much juice was in the fridge. I was more of a scrounger. I grew up poor when I was young, so I just basically got by.

If the carpets don't get steam cleaned...they get slightly dirtier. I have never gotten my carpets steam cleaned except when I was moving out. Nothing bad happened to me as a result. This is not so much a need, as something that's important to you. Eating the same meal over and over...it's called not being an American. Know why they call it Mexican food? Chinese food? Italian food? For a long time, that's all they ate. Day in, day out. Like 5 meals. It's actually good for you to do that. You tend to eat less. My SO and I do that all the time. Guess what happens if you don't wash your jeans for a year. Almost nothing.

These are not needs. These are things you do because it's how you were raised. Cultural things. So it's no surprising that they don't do them. 

When she sat me down and explained what stuff made her happy, I was glad to know. I did the things not as chores, but as tiny love letters for her. We eventually got divorced, but not because of that. In later LTR's, I did the same thing pro-actively. I tried to find out what made my SO happy. Some of them liked candy and flowers on a regular basis. Others enjoy certain romantic gestures and at least 2 lbs of butter in the fridge at all times (she liked baking). I have a fairly comprehensive list of things I do for my current SO to make her environment comfortable. She does the same for me.

If you approach it not as ""You're incompetent because you don't do these things"" but rather as ""I know these things are idiosyncratic, but it would make me feel really loved if you would go out of your way to do them for me. Also, I want to know what I can to do make you feel loved."", suddenly you go from problem solving, to loving support.

So my advice would be:

1. Sit down and have a talk. Write it all out. Have a record where you both can see it.  
2. Find out what HIS things are. He might not even feel comfortable saying them. But make sure your lists are equitable. If he's doing things to make your environment better, do things to make his environment better.  
3. Make it a game if you're into that kind of thing. Keep it light. Nobody likes to be guilt-ed.

We came up with a compromise for meal planning (since that's where it bugs me the most). Generally speaking, I cook and he does dishes. Since I'm the one cooking, I maintain the pantry inventory for ingredients (canned tomatoes, chicken stock, etc.); we both keep an eye on basic foods (milk, eggs, etc). Every Sunday, we go out for dinner (it's the one day a week we eat out) and do our meal planning/grocery list for the week over dinner. Then, we go grocery shopping. 

Big conversations don't work well for us; we tend to agree in theory, but without specific actions to take we just fall back into the same pattern. We've had a series of small conversations about specific subjects (ie meal planning) as they've come up.

Some months I do a lot more of the work around the house, other months she does a lot more of the work and I do very little. Neither of us keep track because love isn't about that.

Ex: We each take care of our own breakfast and lunches. I make dinners she cleans the dishes. She gets the food at the store and I make whatever I can with it.

For cleaning she takes care of most of the inside of the house and I take care of the outside. I take out the trash, mow the lawn, wash the deck, etc. She cleans the windows, toilets, floors, etc.

The most important thing is that we don't judge each others work or timelines. I have neglected cleaning the garage for a month now but she doesn't bug me about it. I noticed that she has forgotten to clean one of the toilets for awhile now and I don't bug her about it.

If I feel there is something that needs to be done inside the house before she gets to it I will do it myself because it is MY problem, not hers.

This one's pretty easy. Explain to him what you said here: he wants to help but doesn't always know/notice what needs doing, and you don't want him to feel like you're trying to be his mom, so you want to come up with a chore schedule to make it easier for everyone. Then it's obvious what needs to be done and nobody has to nag anybody. Discuss together the chores that need doing - indoor AND outdoor, big and small, weekly/monthly/yearly, and no expecting him to help with inside chores but leaving all the car fixing and lawn maintenance and repair work to him! - and come up with a schedule together. A weekly schedule to cover the basics can be stuck on the fridge; you can write bigger jobs on your calendar and figure out how to tackle them as they come up. 

>They will make dinner, if you tell them what to cook. If you tell them to ""think it up"" they will usually default to one recipe they know well. 

This is typical for people who do not know how to cook. Hell, I've been cooking for many years and I still have days where I don't know what to make and just revert to old tried-and-true meals. That's one of the things about being married - sometimes you have boring/stressful/terrible days that end with boring meals. It won't always be exciting and the food won't always be inspired.

Watch some cooking shows together, and cook some meals together so he can learn the basics. You could try having a ""theme night"" for a while to see if that helps. Mondays can be casserole night, Tuesdays are soup, Wednesdays are Mexican, you get the picture. That might help him know what direction to go - if he knows it's Italian day that limits the choices. I've started doing that myself for the summer (we homeschool; our kids are done their work until the fall, and we no longer have a routine...I've been floundering a bit!) and so far it's been seriously helpful.

>They will swing by the grocery store, but they have no idea what's in the pantry and what we might need.

Keep a grocery list on the fridge or counter that you add to as you run out of things. I'd be freaking lost without my grocery list - I wouldn't know half of what I needed to buy, and yet I'm the one who does all the cooking. Then if he needs to run to the store he's got a list to take. 

>My big question is this: how do we start our relationships right, and communicate this problem to them, without sounding like we aren't grateful that they are willing to help? I want to be a wife, and I want to keep my career, and I don't want to be his mother. I think he wants that too. Help, please.

I think you should talk to him about it like you talked to us here - it's obvious that you want to help him and that you don't think less of him because he has not been as well prepared as you have. It's obvious that you respect him and don't want to have to nag him to do stuff. Make sure he knows all of that. It's really important for you both to make your expectations clear where these things are concerned before you get married. Make sure you ask him how he feels and what he expects too. And make sure you let him do stuff his way - if he feels like he's always doing things wrong, or like you are always finding fault with the way he does it, he's not going to be eager to help. This will be even more important if you guys ever have children someday.

20140523135428,ChaosTranslator,"I have been with my wife for 14 years now and I can say that she does more family level tasks than I do. Income wise, we make roughly the same amount. Her and I have fallen into primarily the ""traditional"" american gender roles in some ways....e.g. it is far more likely that she sews a new hem or decorates a room. Conversely, it is more likely that I would fix the air conditioning or program the irrigation system, but regardless of role:task relationship these concepts should apply to all.

I often think of it as familial specialization. I have dedicated time and energy to becoming good at re-soldering bad connections on broken kids toys, creating and managing a photo backup system for our precious photos, handling budgets and bills, etc. If I were to ask my wife to do any of these tasks I have full confidence that she could accomplish them. In the long run after she has dedicated time to it as well she could be just as proficient with the tasks too, but as for right now it makes more sense for me to do them because of what I have specialized in so far in life. When we have teams, specialization allows us to focus on what we suck the least at in comparison with our team mates...not who is best at what.

(Comparative Advantage: Tasks should not be assigned by who is best at them or kids would never get chores and parents would do everything.  Kids are put in charge of cleaning the carpet because they suck less at vacuuming than they do at making sure all of the household accounts and bills are taken care of. )

Point 1: Family members specialize and this is more effective, however this should never prevent one non specialized member from assisting others in times of need.

All this being said some tasks between husband and wife are suitably commoditized that they require little specialization (this goes back to the things you can assign to kids when they are old enough). Most people (not all but most) are more or less equally capable of loading or unloading the dishwasher or laundry machine. There is very little art or skill required to vacuum the carpet, clean the windows, dust, or whatever.

So for commodities the main issue becomes habit or concern instead of capability. 

When I say habit I mean that some people were raised in environments where some things were never even a concern.  Maybe they grew up in a city apartment where lawn care just did not come up...ever. Maybe they had a fastidious parent who handled all of the cleaning while they were not in the house and the environment just seemed to always be dust free with no one exerting energy to keep it that away as far as they could tell. Ridiculous as it may seem this absolutely would result in kids who don't realize they have to clean. Not necessarily bad depending on how they spent the time they would have otherwise spent cleaning...but I digress.

Concern is probably most ""traditional"" male's main hangup. Or maybe it is just mine... I do not generally care about shelf dust or any dust that is not in an area I frequent.  Similarly no one will ever convince me that making my bed daily is anything other than a regular expense of time and energy to have my sheet or blanket flatter than usual. In short some of the things a spouse cares about will not automatically be important to the other spouse. This is the ""I want you to want to do dishes"" vs ""I want you to do the dishes"" discussion.  It is a largely fruitless effort to change the underlying motivations for behavior. When a partner gets upset, screams, or whatever negative method they prefer they are trying to create incentive to prevent this sadness or anger from occurring again in the future. (Hey remember how angry she was last time I didn't clean the dishes...I did not enjoy the yelling.  I should make it so the yelling wont come back.) I would recommend aiming for task completion not motivation modification. 

Point 2: For tasks that require no real skill, Families should distribute evenly, but it is likely going to be distributed naturally to those who are aware AND care about the task in question until a system that reminds the derelict spouse of both the task itself and its importance to the other spouse. (i.e. the dishes are dirty AND my wife will feel happier when the dishes are clean)

When these issues are not addressed and understood it is very likely that emotions will develop that will prevent logical discussion of the underlying problems. Resentment will build in either partner when there is a perception of imbalance.

Sooo... Talk about the things each of you do for the family. Understand that there are some things that your partner sucks at less than you and make sure the task ownership is taking those comparative advantages into account. Share the workload. Remember that your partner can forget and probably just needs to be reminded that you care about this task.",2,t3_26as0z

I keep the areas I regularly occupy (family room, office, bedroom) clear of clutter and vacuum the downstairs regularly. I clean up after our daughter and do most of the laundry work. I cook dinner two or three nights a week.

But I don't shop for groceries, because my wife doesn't make lists and has a lot of health brands/items that only she eats and I wouldn't know to replace. I tell her if we need milk or butter or whatever but I'm not going to stop and pick these things up because I'll probably get the wrong one, or will have ruined my wife's plan to save $.50 on the next gallon of milk because she had a coupon for it that I didn't know about.

I don't put away any of our plastic containers or glassware containers because I don't stack them the same way my wife does. If I do attempt to put them away, she will be in there an hour later re-stacking them her preferred way.

The best thing you can do is refrain from criticizing him for doing a chore but not doing it the way you want it done. And don't redo it for him. For example, if he cleans the kitchen but puts a mixing bowl back in the ""wrong place"", just move on. Don't do what my wife does and drag him into the kitchen and say ""I'm not trying to criticize or say you did anything wrong, but this mixing bowl goes under the sink to the left, not the right."" I'm thinking (not saying), ""Who says it goes there? You? Did we have a house meeting about where the mixing bowl goes that I don't remember? Why can't I be the one who decides where the mixing bowl goes and I want it to go here? Isn't it enough that I thought to put it away?""

If you decide to share in the management of certain household chores, expect that you will do them in different ways and accept the effort put in by your SO. Don't criticize, don't redo. Offer suggestions if you must, but keep in mind that they will often come across as criticism even if you don't intend them to.

Let me repeat that: This is a big deal.

I'm a special education teacher with experience working with students on the Autism Spectrum and with developmentally delayed students. I am currently working with some students on the spectrum. 

This sexual assault (it was sexual assault) needs to be taken seriously for both your well being and the man who assaulted you. What would have happened if you had (as you were well within your rights to do) used a self defense technique against the man? What would have happened if he had triggered you? You acted as a mature, compassionate, adult, but everybody this man interacts with will not do the same. Next time he might either go further or be seriously injured by someone defending themselves. 

When people who are not mentally culpable for their actions commit crimes those crimes still exist, it's just that punishment is deferred. Your institution is responsible for your your safety on campus and failing that someone is responsible for this man. I hope that your institution takes this with the seriousness it deserves; either limiting his exposure to other students by assigning him an (what we would call) Educational Assistant or removing him from campus completely. *His presence makes the campus unsafe for other students.* This is not acceptable. 

I think that if the school doesn't take action you would be well within your rights to file charges against the man or seek a restraining order. Your (as well as other students) safety comes before his right to an education. 

Edit: Something I forgot to mention. The staff at your institution need better training. That the supervisor even thought to try and brush this off is a sign that things are not in a good state.   ",335,t3_26ammf
20140523110320,rankchimp,"I am starting by saying that I have no experience with people with learning disabilities and that I agree with almost 100% of your comment. But I do have experience with criminal law and disagree with the definitive assertion of ""(it was sexual assault)"". I think that there is more to whether this was a crime or not. (Of course this is coming from U.S.'s legal systems and not the U.K.'s) 

Technically, it is very likely that a crime was committed, but the man could be legally excused for his act. Self-defense is a well-known defense to conviction for a crime; it is justification for assault. People are also normally aware that there is an insanity defense-a mental capacity defense- which excuses the conduct.

There are two ways that a person can be found to legally lack mental capacity in my jurisdiction. One is mental capacity to stand trial, which is not a defense but rather more of a procedural issue. In that situation, the trial is delayed until the person has the ability to understand that they are being tried for a crime and to participate in their defense. This appears to be what you are speaking about. This is a very difficult standard to meet. The other is lacking the capacity to understand that what they are doing is a crime. Just because the act- the physical groping- occurred, it does not mean that it is not legally excused. 

As back ground to the ""second-type"" of mental capacity defense, most U.S. jurisdictions the crimes require that the person both complete the physical act and have some sort of mental state in completing the act. If someone was falling and accidentally grabbed or hit you, this would not satisfy the elements of the crime for assault. The crime requires that the act is intentional.

The act of grabbing OP definitely seems intentional, but the mental incapacity of the person may vitiate this intent, if it makes the person unable to conform his behavior to the law at the time of the act. If this is the case, the crime would be legally excused.

Would OP have been justified in using self-defense in this case? Almost certainly. But one thing that is important in labeling an act a crime is the person's mental capacity. A lot of jurisdictions might legally excuse his behavior. That being said, this is serious and hopefully the guy can correct his behavior to avoid future potential danger and avoid hurting others.

Firstly, OP, you're obviously entitled to feel shaken up/upset/whatever feelings you have. That's not even up for debate. You're also entitled to react in the way you would if anyone else had done the same thing. If you were to speak to the police and university action would (or should!) be taken. the police would possibly take a different course of action to what would happen to a person who didn't have LD's, but safe guards would need to be put in place to ensure the man didn't do it again.

It's not about placing blame on the man, assuming he didn't understand the full weight of his actions, it's about ensuring it doesn't happen again and attempting to help him realise why it is unacceptable (if his LD's allow that).

Liberal-Democrats: ideologically similar to the Democrats, often just as useless, but the British Parliament requires a party hold a majority or be part of a majority coalition to create a government. Because the UK has about eighty million political parties it often comes down to Labour and the Tory's having a large share of the seats, but not enough to make a government.

In your case he may not actually know what he's doing wrong because people were laughing. Someone needs to tell him what he did wrong and why it was wrong. Or he may know that it's wrong to touch someone like that but he still does it because he knows he can get away with it.

Ok, so you say he isn't 100% responsible for his actions.  I think that is bullshit.   Let me ask you this.  If this same man actually went as far as raping you, would you feel he was responsible then?  Or, even if no matter what people tell you, you still feel he isn't actually 100% responsible does that make it ok?  Is it ok for him to go around killing people if he isn't 100% responsible? No.  It is not, just like it is not ok for him to assault you sexually or otherwise. 

If it were me, I would go make a formal complaint right now.  This sounds like it need to be dealt with on a more serious level or things may get worse.  I have a feeling that if you hear a couple of weeks from now that this guy raped a younger girl or anyone at all you are going to feel more guilt than you will know what to do with.  

Someone who is willing to rub themselves in public and then fondle the genitals of someone they don't even know is dangerous.  It may be something that can be taught and it won't be an issue again or it may be something that the caregiver needs to be aware of so they can control the actions and supervision of this individual.

I am a male nurse and have worked with many mentally handicapped persons.  I have experienced this personally and have helped many of my coworkers with these types of situations.  

First and foremost, safety is number 1.  If you feel as though the situation may escalate beyond your control.  Exit the situation and get help.

Second, set clear expectations for the right behavior.  ""It is not OK for you to touch me.  You must keep your hands to yourself.""  Be very firm in your tone and body launguage.  Sometimes it may take repeating it, but it establishes what is OK and what is not.

In addition, I have also found it beneficial to have someone of the same gender help communicate it.  I have often found men with these types of impulse control issues respond better to men and likewise women may respond better to other women.

What is happened is not ok.  It should not be ignored.  I can tell from your post that it truly troubled you.  Please know that the mentally handicapped that do this aren't necessarily bad people, they have bad behaviors that need to be addressed.

If a person with LDs committed another crime like murder, punching someone or robbery then it would be taken seriously and people would perceive them as a danger to society. This should be treated in the same way.

I'm dismayed that the librarian treated you that way. I would take her name and let someone know about her reaction. You can tell them that she rectified it immediately but you should make it clear that initially her reaction was unacceptable. If it had happened to another person and they hadn't prompted the librarian to do more, the way you did, then that could have been it for them. It's obvious she and possibly other librarians/people who work at the college need more training about how to handle this sort of situation.

Of course you're not meant to laugh this off. It's in no way ""sweet"". It's clear he was trying to push the boundaries and see how far he could get without being told off. He obviously knew what he was doing was wrong because he immediately apologised for what he did. This is someone who needs to learn ""This is wrong. This is why it's wrong"". Often this is the case for people without LDs too to fully understand the effect that they have on someone when they do this kind of thing. 

If the college doesn't respond quickly to this then I suggest you go to the police sooner rather than later. It's not about getting people in to trouble but about getting him to realise the consequences of his actions.",4,t3_26ammf

i used to work in a library at a college that had some special needs students as well as some that were, for lack of a better phrase, just a bit slow.  one of the slow guys in particular was a creep (asking for more help than he really needed and then standing way too close to me), but i kept giving him the benefit of the doubt because, like you, i felt sorry for him and wondered to what extent he was responsible for himself.  but he never did anything specifically Wrong per se until about a month or so later.

when i eventually busted him being a creep as i'd suspected, he was Publicly looking at foot fetish weener stomping porn.  there were several girls seated around him looking uncomfortable; when i stormed over and told him to get out, he apologized just like in your story -- immediately and repeatedly.  i told him that if he was going to apologize, he needed to do it to All the people in the lab that he was making uncomfortable by being a dirtbag, but he just cried and slunk out.

the unhappy ending of this story is twofold: firstly, it didn't occur to me until later that by shaming him i might have played into his fetish, and secondly, the school totally stuck up for and enabled him.  i'd reported him to the appropriate office, but they just said he was a ""sweet, confused guy"" and actually Had Him Call Me (at work, but still) to apologize and Thank Me For Letting Him Know The Rules (i let him leave a voicemail and didn't reply).

Something that even normal, healthy people sometimes do, albeit more discreetly.  I don't think they would appreciate being loudly shamed and ordered to apologize to everyone in the room.  You could have tapped him on the shoulder, pulled him aside and had a quiet word with him.  If he refused to comply then you take it further.


Unless I'm missing something, it sounds like you really took it personal and refuse to communicate with the guy afterwards..  did he make a move on you or say anything inappropriate to offend you?

to further clarify why i felt he was a creep before getting confirmation, i'd seen him acting shifty (looking over his shoulder a lot et cetera) when using the computers on multiple occasions before i actually caught him in the act.  as far as the personal space violations, all i can do is to tell you that he was putting off a seriously creepy vibe when he was doing so, and would move closer to me when i stepped away.  i tried limiting my interactions with him to simply helping him from behind the front desk, but he kept asking me to come out and help him with things like getting onto the internet and finding books on the shelves -- simple library tasks that he had repeatedly done for himself and by himself on past occasions. i  don't know how else i can clarify it for you.

Kind of badly! All of my friends obviously already knew, and a lot of my Facebook friends are like... people from old internet forums I moderated and people from the Pride center at college, and I had no reason to think any of them would be anything but supportive.

But most of my family... they knew, too. But it's kind of like how they know that I'm a bisexual -- I bring it up and they get really mad, and then if it's not actually proof shoved in their faces they pretend I never said it. A few weeks ago my mom actually said ""I'm so glad you're not gay anymore"" ... ... ... and even with my responses like ""I might propose to the next woman who lets me touch her boobs"" she just kept kind of brushing me off and trying to end the conversation on the point that it was a phase that I'm over.

I was uninvited from family Christmas, and got in some very unpleasant fights with various family members including my mom.

More notably, my boyfriend was substantially bullied by his family, ranging from ""enjoy the herpes"" kinds of comments to ""how does another man's dick taste on her pussy?"". His mother sent out an emergency family email to like his great aunts.

Therefore, I wouldn't support it to protect my own interest and desires. I would want as many mates to choose from as possible that share the same views as me. However, I can accept a polyamorous relationship within my community, I can see the ""pros"" to it, and it really has little to no effect on my life what others do. In reality, those potential mates are fundamentally different than me in what they value and how they perceive the world around them.

I can only speculate, but perhaps my speculation can provide a little perspective. I imagine I would feel inadequate and jealous at times. As well, I could see another person in the relationship being a burden or inconvenience at times. It would be very difficult for me to share someone, or devote myself to two people as well. 

I imagine there is a hierarchy that is established-whether it be on a first come, first serve basis or capitalistic where the better, harder working partner gets the priority. And yes, there has to be priorities, for the case when both partners are drowning at the same time and you can only save one. Hmmm.... but you could always help the one you thought needed it more. Although, if the other one survived, they would be all like ""Dude, WTF!""

Seriously though, this would be something that would have to be worked out. Everyone would have to be happy with their position for it to work-or not work as many relationships, regardless of their composition, are exploitative as opposed to mutually beneficial. It would be difficult to maintain this relationship for me, as naturally humans are self-centered. As I see it,

YOU live in YOUR world, concerned with the things that affect YOU. Even if you're a nice person making donations or helping others out you are doing so because that is what YOU want to do-there are a million reasons why you may want to be generous, some sinister, some noble, but the fact remains the same that, in some way, they offer value to the YOU.

The reason I believe relationships work in the first place the balance of give and take. You put effort in and get back things you otherwise wouldn't have. It's easier to balance a scale when there are two platforms to equalize as opposed to three or four. I'm not trying to say that polyamorous relationships are bad, I imagine they're just difficult. 

Plus, there is the social and cultural stigma... Oh those stigmas. All propagandists and what not, yeesh. Think if some of the opponents of your relationship were the pariah in a more accepting and open environment. Take pride knowing they couldn't handle it.

IMO, the effort outweighs the benefits, although for me even one person can be a bit difficult to maintain. 


I imagine the reason your family disapproves is a combination of them being ill-informed, wanting the best for you, and being self-centered in that they don't want the social stigma of being associated with your relationship. Hope this helps :)

I wore it last Saturday at the ball and was complimented on it. I'm really not the type to wear skirts and dresses, but one of my classmates said that it really felt like me and not odd at all. So I'm excited to wear it again tomorrow :)",2,t3_26basf

20140523144409,jvnn,"edit - Fixed some pronouns and terms since I compiled these comments from my past posts (around the time of my breakup two years ago, with someone I thought was ""the one"") for you, and added advice on your living situation. Oh, and please remember to eat. If you can't, buy a pack of Ensure to get some nutrients in ya. Partners may come and go, but your body is yours and the only one you have to work with, so take care of it!

The first few days are going to be hard, but it gets better. Your heart doesn't feel like it's being carved out slowly much anymore, and you'll look forward to taking back control of your life. Think of how to make yourself you again (we all give a bit of ourselves away when we're with someone), how to improve yourself, and what things you've always wanted to do. You will feel good again! Stay strong, friend!

Firstly, reach out to your network. Your friends and your family will be there for you! They'll be happy to go out and do something with you, or even take you out somewhere. Talk to them online or ring up a close friend every time you get the urge to talk to your ex-boyfriend when it's ""unnecessary"" or if you're feeling the hurts. You are not alone, and you are loved. Remember that.

When you're alone: Watch some funny videos on Youtube. Browse through Reddit pictures. Listen to good (not sad!) breakup music (I have a playlist if you want it); music fills an empty mind and is very therapeutic. Pick up a book that looks interesting and read it. Go running. Write - write all the feelings and things you want to say out, it really helps! Search in TwoX about breakups and keep on reading this kind of advice – it's the only way I got myself through my own breakup two years ago.

If you're truly stuck with the apartment, go through it with a friend this weekend to clean it up and separate the spaces. Make your space yours. You should find someone or several people to do this with you. Don't do this by yourself. Buy new bedsheets, buy a body pillow, rearrange furniture in your room or common spaces, put possible trigger items away. Make the space yours again, not ""ours."" It will hopefully be fun and therapeutic, and help with the mental separation with he relationship and within the apartment.

If you can figure out the lease and can stay somewhere else for a few days, do it. Give yourself some breathing room away from him. Stay with a trusted friend, or spend a couple nights with your parents. Move out as soon as you can. Separate yourself from the mess. Start over.

You will come out a better and more amazing woman. Believe in that and believe in yourself. You will find someone who deserves you, treats you the right way, respects you, and loves you just as much as you love him. You will find someone who respects you and the relationship enough to work on the relationship and stay committed to it. Believe in that. I know it's hard to fathom right now, but remind yourself that you are deserving of that special person who wants to be with you. You might even be able to look back and be thankful that this relationship ended, so the changes and people that come after had the chance to be. I look back and see that the best thing my ex did for me was leave me. 

Push forward, stay strong, and keep your head up. This too shall pass.

It won't be easy but it won't be too hard to handle. It will take a while until it doesn't hurt anymore and become just another story in your life. Everything around you will remind you of the fresh memory but it will pass. 
When you are ready to stop crying get up, go out spend time with friends, work hard (or study) keep yourself busy. Not only it will keep you from thinking about it but it might make you feel good to see the result of work or grade.

I don't know your situation, but I too had experienced break up that I hide in my office bathroom and cry. I locked myself in my room for few days, cried my eyes out. Then it hit me, when I focus my energy on crying and suffering it didn't only hurt me, it also hurt people who loves me when they saw me throwing my life away. When you love someone you wouldn't want to see them suffer, and will never want to hurt you intentionally, and why should I cry and waste my time moaning of the person I love but hurt me how does that call love.

I think it is absolutely never okay for a partner to ""forbid"" you from getting any particular body modification.

For example, my fiance just really does not like the look of calf or ankle tattoos. This preference simply came up in passing, but my feeling is that if it bothers him, I'll probably just stick to other tattoo locations. 

Has your husband said whether it is the location, size, or subject matter of the tattoo that bothers him? If it's just one of those, perhaps there is some room for compromise.

As for the job issue, that depends completely on the type of job. The only people I personally know who've had trouble with arm tattoos at work are people in low wage customer service jobs involving a short sleeved uniform.

Yes, a million times yes.  

Reddit is hyper-liberal and ""non-judgmental"" and doesn't really represent how most of society feels.  Most people, especially in the business/corporate world, look down on tattoos.  Tattoos, at least in our culture, have come to represent non-conformity, a ""free spirit,"" rebelliousness, and ""subcultures.""  These are all things businesses aren't interested in.  They want somebody who will put their head down and do their work, and people with tattoos have gained a reputation for not being that. 

And whether or not they see tattoos as unprofessional, they will definitely judge you for them.  You can't control or predict people's quiet judgment, and if times get tough, you may get axed and never know why.

When I worked in an office without face-to-face customer service, I did occasionally have my tattoos visible without any problems, however I would recommend covering them during interviews and until you have a good feel for the office environment.

The fact that your doctor asked you to come back in a year and not in a few months is a great sign that your cervix only showed very low-grade dysplasia - meaning if it did ever evolve into cervical cancer, which it most likely will not if you continue to receive care and go to your appointments - it will take a long time (up to 10 years!) from this point.

I know it can be stressful but rest assured that there's nothing you could have done to prevent it aside from remaining a virgin, it would take a long time to become anything remotely close to cervical cancer, and your doctor will monitor it enough to ensure it most likely won't get to that point. 

I've had abnormal cervical cells show up on my paps the last few years and I've actually found that taking folic acid supplements and B vitamins have increasingly improved my results. You may want to look into it. Generally, if you take good care of your health and don't smoke, your body should be able to suppress the virus within a year or two.

Are you on the pill by any chance? Studies have shown that oral BCP can interfere with the body's ability to absorb folate (natural form of folic acid) which is vital to cervical health and can contribute to your body's ability to more quickly suppress HPV. 

You don't have to make any really drastic changes, just a few small adjustments can do wonders! Good luck, you'll be just fine! 

EDIT: Should add that BCP users just need to increase their folic acid supplementation to at least 800 mcg per day to help your body absorb the necessary amount. Sorry for all the details... I've done so much research on this due to being in exactly your position!",1,t3_26avwj

20140523114601,Bri-3PO,"You're going to be fine. You are doing the right thing by keeping up on your health and going to the gynecologist. That's awesome!   

The unfortunate thing about HPV is there are literally HUNDREDS of strains. It lives on the skin, meaning you can get it from just rubbing genitals, which is why condoms aren't super effective against it, like other STIs. This is also why it's more prevalent.   

But luckily it's not that scary, because most young people in their early 20s have kickass immune systems that will clear the virus without any treatment. Yay!   

There are different ""levels"" of HPV, if you will. You can have atypical cells, low-risk HPV, and high-risk HPV. High risk DOES NOT mean you have cancer, or even pre-cancerous cells *at this time* - it just means that you have an increased likelihood of developing precancerous cells. Cervical cancer is a veeerrrryyyyy slow-growing cancer if you did have it, which you don't.   

I had an abnormal pap when I was 21 and had to get a follow-up pap every 6 months until I was 23. During that time I had a couple of colposcopies, which are a biopsy on your cervix. They set you up like a pap and then use this special device that extracts a bit of your cervix so they can get a closer look at the cells. It hurts a bit, and you have weird cramping and goo they apply afterwards, but nothing you can't handle!

When I was 23 my HPV changed from low-risk to high-risk, which meant time for a LEEP. In this procedure they remove any atypical cells to try and clear the virus. In most cases this procedure is enough to eliminate any risk of developing precancerous cells. I got knocked out for it, so I don't remember the procedure, but most women can handle it with local anaesthesia (I'm just a wimp).

Since the LEEP my paps have been normal! You are going to be OKAY and may not even need any further procedures done! Since my ordeal, the recommended frequency has changed due to over-treatment of young women (see comment from /u/gabbythefck ). If you have HPV, they recommend a re-pap every year until it's normal. If you have normal paps and are in a monogamous relationship, then you get a pap every three years. If you're super worried you can get another one in 6 months, but chances are you will still have an abnormal pap. This worrying IS NOT worth it! Give your body time to try and fight it on its own.   

That sucks your doctor is not communicative with you. Shame on him. You and your boyfriend are going to be fine. You can't reinfect each other or give it back and forth. You both have the same strain, most likely, and that's that. It sucks but it's not dirty or something to be ashamed of. In fact, HPV can lay dormant for years, so who knows when you originally contracted it - it's not worth worrying over.   

I hope you find some peace of mind! My sister, myself and a lot of my friends have gone through the HPV scare. Relax and keep up on your re-paps and you'll do just fine! ",4,t3_26avwj

Of course this is all dependent on the grade of your displasia, which is determined after the biopsy. Even with high grade displasia the LEEP procedure can remove all the abnormal cells and there's a good chance they won't return. Of course regularly getting a PAP will keep an eye on that. Ask all the questions you can when you see the doctor but remember, just because you have HPV doesn't mean you will get cancer, it's a precursor and with the screening processes now it's very easy to catch early enough that it isn't a problem. Also remember that HPV isn't necessarily sexually transmitted, it can be transferred as easily as someone not washing their hands after touching themselves then touching you. There's a very high rate of HPV and there's even a chance your boyfriend (or anyone else) gave it to you, men don't generally get any symptoms.",4,t3_26avwj

The doc then took a biopsy from the surface of my cervix (owie) and then a swab from the cervical canal (owie owie owie) and it was all over.

Just after I turned 18 my pap came up positive for high risk HPV - cancer causing type.  I went back in for a colposcopy / biopsy.  I then went in for a pap every 3 months after that to check on the progress (this was the FDA recommended treatment plan at the time).  Boy, did that suck.  At my next annual pap, it showed I had essentially gone into remission, so I didn't have to come by for another year.  At that next annual pap, it had sort of started to come back, so they did another colposcopy, and more 3 month follow up appointments.  Next annual, remission again.  That when I was...20?  I think?  I'm about to turn 25 now, and have only had annual paps since, and they've all been a-okay.

Since my experience, the FDA has changed their guidelines to say you only need an annual pap once diagnosed because most cases go away on their own (especially in young women) and thus women were being put through a LOT of unnecessary stress and appointments and procedures over something that generally resolves itself - which is why I think your doctor told you just to come back in a year.

Seriously, don't worry about it too much.  Mine has been gone for almost five years now and it's likely it will never return, but I will continue to always get my annual paps to ensure that is the case.  The problem with cancer causing HPV comes when (specifically older, from my understanding) women do not get annual paps and do not catch it if it chooses to spread.  Once it spreads, it is much much much harder to resolve.

When I did the colposcopy, they basically sprayed my insides with vinegar, which turned all the pre-cancerous cells white, then they used this long metal rod thing to cut all those cells out of me...thus it didn't spread.  After they did this twice, it hasn't since come back.

If you want any more assurance, have any more questions, etc. please feel free to PM me.  Most of my friends went through this very same thing as we were the pre-gardasil generation right when HPV was becoming very wide spread and we're all 100% fine.

My understanding is that it is a condition a lot of young women have, and it is something you have to keep a careful eye on, because it can turn into cancer. 

I was confused as to why I got it, because I got that HPV vaccine when I was a teenager. I have a lot of questions, just like you, but my gyno has never been able to answer them. I should make an appointment at Planned Parenthood like you did, and ask them my questions.

Take green tea extract supplements or drink a lot of green tea. Go get the gardasil vaccine. Yes, you already have HPV but the shots can protect against other strains and boost your immune system. I was too old for the shot by the time it was readily available, but my sister went through this as well and did these things and never had another abnormal pap (so far, its been 3 clear paps). 
You also cannot re-infect each other. Once you have it, you have it because it is a virus. He will not have symptoms or anything, likely neither will you.

I had high risk HPV ( found at 19) that progressed to Stage 1 cervical cancer, which I've managed to fight off a couple times and it's never gotten worse than Stage 1. I'm 27 and been dealing with this for a long time. My doctor has already planned a hysterectomy for when I turn 30( wants to give me the chance to have kids), as long as I can keep fighting the cancer off. 


This is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about. I don't know the recent statistics, but A LOT of girls have it and have had abnormal paps. Not to belittle your feelings, just letting you know that there are probably plenty of girls around you who have gone through the same thing. 

Side note: You need to address your cervical pain. A pap shouldn't cause much pain or discomfort, especially not after a few days. You may have something else going on. HPV can cause pain, but typically that is when it is progressing into dysplasia. If your doctor doesn't even need to do a colposcopy, you likely have no dysplasia.

I was diagnosed with high risk HPV when I was 25.  I immediately had a biopsy and then had the LEEP procedure (as described by /u/m1ghtymouse).  I was SUPER scared at the time and wasn't sure what to ask, especially since my dr wasn't telling me a lot and she was acting like it was no big deal.

The one thing my doctor said to me that made me feel a lot better was ""If you get regular pap smears, we'll catch any new problems in plenty of time to treat.  We won't let you get cancer.""

Don't stress too much over the HPV.  I'm not saying it's nothing, but it's not usually a big deal.  I've been through about the worst of it that you happen, and it was a pain but not a serious health concern.

Years ago I tested positive for HPV.  I also had an abnormal PAP.  Because of the PAP they did a biopsy and found per-cancerous cells on my cervix.   I had a out-patient surgical procedure to have them removed.  I took one day off work.  It was inconvenient and no fun, but I didn't have any complications.  The worst part was that I had to have a PAP every 3 months during the following year.  :(

After that I tested negative for HPV for 5 years.  Recently I tested positive again, but my PAP was normal.  The doc had me come back after 6 months and it had all resolved (normal PAP and negative for HPV).  

I didn't have any complications from the surgery and I didn't have cervical pain (other than during the biopsy).  I've had a few friends go through this and none of them have talked about cervical pain either.  Obviously this is anecdotal, but I think it's likely there is something else going on.  I suggest looking at all possible causes, and just following your doctors suggestions regarding the HPV.

Edit: missing a word",1,t3_26avwj
20140523135520,littlelibertine,"How much information do you have about HPV and high-risk HPV?  If you haven't, it's probably time to do some serious reading.

Because your doctor asked you to come back in a year (and not, say, within a few months) is a very good sign that there hasn't been much change in your cervical cells--just enough to be noticed.  Cervical cancer from HPV takes a very, very long time to develop (like years long) so just keep seeing your doctor regularly and you should be fine.",1,t3_26avwj
20140523140704,Elephant_Kid,"Medical student here. Maybe I can help clear up some confusion...

First of all, HPV is an EXTREMELY common sexually transmitted infection, which comes in many different strains. The infection rate is around 30-40% (depending on your age). In particular, strains 16 and 18 are known to be necessary, but not sufficient, in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. In other words, if you do not have the virus, you cannot develop cervical cancer. If you do have the virus, then your risk is still quite low that you will go on to develop cervical cancer. It's only ""high risk"" because it IS associated with cancer.

Guardasil is a vaccination against HPV strains 16, 18 and a couple others. If you have already tested positive for 16 or 18, then you were most likely infected before you received the vaccine.

So if your cytology (i.e. PAP smear) was normal, it makes sense to get annual screening. If you are HPV positive, the current guidelines are to either get annual HPV DNA testing (to check to see if you still have an active viral infection) or to get cytology and HPV DNA testing done annually.

If ""dysplasia"" is noticed in the PAP smear, then you will need to get a colposcopy, which is basically to get a good look at the transformation zone of your cervix. Depending on the results of the colposcopy, at that time you may need a biopsy.",1,t3_26avwj
20140523144847,AlwaysDisposable,"HPV is so incredibly common. Basically it is a virus that upwards of 80% of people WILL HAVE at some point in their lives. But most people clear the infection with no problem, and some never even know they had it because they have no symptoms.

Do you know what grade of dysplasia your pap showed? A low grade dysplasia has a fairly high chance of clearing up. It's when it gets to moderate/high grade that it becomes more serious. The step after that is carcinoma in situ, which is an early form of cancer that hasn't tried to spread yet. Then there is full blown cervical cancer.

The fact that your doctor wants you to wait a year makes me think yours is just mild dysplasia. Your doctor isn't going to progress with treatment unless it gets worse. You can help your body have a better chance of clearing it by eating right and exercising. Basically, just try to be healthy. But if it progresses, it isn't the end of the world. 

Last year I had high grade dysplasia. I was terrified. I had never had any thought that something might be wrong. Three months later I had a surgery called a cervical conization to remove a portion of my cervix and found out that in those three months it had progressed to carcinoma in situ. I couldn't believe it. I'd almost had cervical cancer. Recovery took about 8 weeks but I am totally fine now.

The surgery I had was sort of a worst case scenario. Many times they catch this early enough that a procedure called a LEEP is sufficient. It is done in-office (whereas my cervical conization had to be done in a hospital under anesthesia) in under an hour. Basically they take an electrified wire loop and slice off the affected areas of the cervix. It's way less scary than it sounds. The recovery time is minimal. 

So it is very good that you know about this early. Even if it advances you can still take advantage of the less-invasive procedure.

The pain you are experiencing is probably not related. I had no idea I had advanced dysplasia or carcinoma in situ because there are no symptoms.  Cervical cancer can cause pain, but your doctor would know and tell you if your case had progressed to this point. Like I mentioned, their wanting you to not come back for a year sounds like low grade dysplasia. So you need to see a gyno to figure out what that is.

Unfortunately you will never know if your boyfriend has or had HPV. Luckily the strains that affect the cervix very rarely do anything bad to men. (Of course, he could pass the virus onto someone else down the road who could have the same cervical changes you're having, if he stays HPV positive. That is a chance you take with sex, unfortunately.) I spoke with three different doctors and they all said that HPV is incredibly common and that I didn't even need to tell my future partners unless I wanted to, because chances are they've already got it or have had it and cleared it. They just said to be safe with sex. I haven't started dating yet though so I haven't decided how to handle that conversation, or lack thereof. Luckily you have a supportive boyfriend who already knows. :)

Basically, just learn all you can. And if you decide to talk about it with more people, you'll realize that you know several other women who have gone through this. The more I talked, the less scared I was, and the more empowered I felt about taking control of my body. It really gave me a kickstart to get back in shape and to stay healthy and positive. Try to see the positives in the situation. I mean, it could be way worse. You could have not found out and gotten cancer, right? This doesn't have to change your life in any negative way. :)

Also, my gyno recommended folic acid to help keep my body strong to lower my chances of the cell changes coming back (though the surgery has a 95% success rate). ",1,t3_26avwj

So they end up coming across pushy/bossy instead of simply coming across like people who should be listened to.

-----------------------------------------------------

As with so many ideas in social science, the centrality of language is taken to extremes in deconstructionism, postmodernism, and other relativist doctrines. The writings of oracles like Jacques Derrida are studded with such aphorisms as “No escape from language is possible,” “Text is self-referential,” “Language is power,” and “There is nothing outside the text.” Similarly, J. Hillis Miller wrote that “language is not an instrument or tool in man's hands, a submissive means of thinking. Language rather thinks man and his ‘world'... if he will allow it to do so.”26 The prize for the most extreme statement must go to Roland Barthes, who declared, “Man does not exist prior to language, either as a species or as an individual.”27

The ancestry of these ideas is said to be from linguistics, though most linguists believe that deconstructionists have gone off the deep end. The original observation was that many words are defined in part by their relationship to other words. For example, he is defined by its contrast with I, you, they, and she, and big makes sense only as the opposite of little. And if you look up words in a dictionary, they are defined by other words, which are defined by still other words, until the circle is completed when you get back to a definition containing the original word. Therefore, say the deconstructionists, language is a self-contained system in which words have no necessary connection to reality. And since language is an arbitrary instrument, not a medium for communicating thoughts or describing reality, the powerful can use it to manipulate and oppress others. This leads in turn to an agitation for linguistic reforms: neologisms like co or na that would serve as gender-neutral pronouns, a succession of new terms for racial minorities, and a rejection of standards of clarity in criticism and scholarship (for if language is no longer a window onto thought but the very stuff of thought, the metaphor of “clarity” no longer applies).

Like all conspiracy theories, the idea that language is a prisonhouse denigrates its subject by overestimating its power. Language is the magnificent faculty that we use to get thoughts from one head to another, and we can co-opt it in many ways to help our thoughts along. But it is not the same as thought, not the only thing that separates humans from other animals, not the basis of all culture, and not an inescapable prisonhouse, an obligatory agreement, the limits of our world, or the determiner of what is imaginable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do virtually all cognitive scientists and linguists believe that language is not a prisonhouse of thought?34 First, many experiments have plumbed the minds of creatures without language, such as infants and nonhuman primates, and have found the fundamental categories of thought working away: objects, space, cause and effect, number, probability, agency (the initiation of behavior by a person or animal), and the functions of tools.35

Second, our vast storehouse of knowledge is certainly not couched in the words and sentences in which we learned the individual facts. What did you read in the page before this one? I would like to think that you can give a reasonably accurate answer to the question. Now try to write down the exact words you read in those pages. Chances are you cannot recall a single sentence verbatim, probably not even a single phrase. What you remembered is the gist of those passages — their content, meaning, or sense — not the language itself. Many experiments on human memory have confirmed that what we remember over the long term is the content, not the wording, of stories and conversations. Cognitive scientists model this “semantic memory” as a web of logical propositions, images, motor programs, strings of sounds, and other data structures connected to one another in the brain.36

A third way to put language in its place is to think about how we use it. Writing and speaking do not consist of transcribing an interior monologue onto paper or playing it into a microphone. Rather, we engage in a constant give-and-take between the thoughts we try to convey and the means our language offers to convey them. We often grope for words, are dissatisfied with what we write because it does not express what we wanted to say, or discover when every combination of words seems wrong that we do not really know what we want to say. And when we get frustrated by a mismatch between our language and our thoughts, we don't give up, defeated and mum, but change the language. We concoct neologisms (quark, meme, clone, deep structure), invent slang (to spam, to diss, to flame, to surf the web, a spin doctor), borrow useful words from other languages (joie de vivre, schlemiel, angst, machismo), or coin new metaphors (waste time, vote with your feet, push the outside of the envelope). That is why every language, far from being an immutable penitentiary, is constantly under renovation. Despite the lamentations of language lovers and the coercion of tongue troopers, languages change unstoppably as people need to talk about new things or convey new attitudes.37

Finally, language itself could not function if it did not sit atop a vast infrastructure of tacit knowledge about the world and about the intentions of other people. When we understand language, we have to listen between the lines to winnow out the unintended readings of an ambiguous sentence, piece  {211}  together fractured utterances, glide over slips of the tongue, and fill in the countless unsaid steps in a complete train of thought. When the shampoo bottle says “Lather, rinse, repeat,” we don't spend the rest of our lives in the shower; we infer that it means “repeat once.” And we know how to interpret ambiguous headlines such as “Kids Make Nutritious Snacks,” “Prostitutes Appeal to Pope,” and “British Left Waffles on Falkland Islands,” because we effortlessly apply our background knowledge about the kinds of things that people are likely to convey in newspapers. Indeed, the very existence of ambiguous sentences, in which one string of words expresses two thoughts, proves that thoughts are not the same thing as strings of words.

My (male) boss likes to talk to the guy in the next cubicle over, and lately he's been raving about this new furniture company that he found. He's especially surprised that the company is run by (gasp) a woman. All day long, I get to hear stuff like, ""can you believe it? A woman runs the company!"" As if a woman is incapable of doing this and this is a major achievement for her. 
I'm in a writers group. I write a lot of horror and the macabre. Every time we're talking about one of my stories, without fail, a guy will tell me that he's surprised that someone ""so cute"" or ""so sweet"" writes horror. In fact, a guy once introduced me to a friend and said, ""and would you believe that this little cutie writes horror?"" As if my physical appearance dictates what I should and should not write. There are a handful of guys in my group who write horror as well, but no one ever tells them how cute they are or how it's so weird that someone so cute would write horror.
Though it wasn't aimed directly at me, I was pretty ticked off when comic book writer Tony Harris ranted about female cosplayers on Facebook  a while back. He wrote a long rant that basically stated that attractive female cosplayers aren't real comics fans and that they're only doing it for attention. A lot of fanboys already share this bullshit view, but when an established member of the comics industry starts spouting it, he gives them validation and winds up enabling them to bully female cosplayers and fans.

Or if you look at the way sex scenes are filmed in mainstream movies; they're all filmed through a straight man's perspective. It's perfectly acceptable for a teenage boy to have sex with a pastry (""American Pie""), but the MPAA balks at a teenage girl masturbating through her nightgown (""But I'm A Cheerleader""). There's a great documentary about the Hollywood rating system called ""This Film is Not Yet Rated.""

Or you could look at the way women are photoshopped in magazines. They're altered to fit an impossible standard of beauty. ",1,t3_26bf6c

20140524083053,TashalovesSharks,"I mean I understand your point but it's not like we don't have movies with female leads (you just listed 3 that have done well recently).    

 I don't really understand your sex scene point, as it's usually from a 3rd person point of view (if you could elaborate that would help me understand).    

There was a female masturbation scene in American pie, and other movies. And honestly I don't even see that much male masturbation in most movies....the only one that even comes to mind right now is American Beauty. But it's not something I see in most movies female or male.     

There is a lot more wrong with the rating system, granted sexism might be a problem, though I think your next example does not illustrate that.    

Everyone in magazines is photoshopped to look like a particular standard of beauty, so even though I agree that it's wrong I don't see it as particularly sexist.    

I guess it's just difficult for me too see these as primarily sexist issues because they are complicated issues. Do they have traits of sexism, sure. Should these issues be fixed, sure. Do I think sexism is very prevalent for me...not really. I guess it's just the way I was raised. I've never been told I couldn't do something because I'm female. I was never pushed away from science because I was a girl. So it's just not a focus for me because it's never hindered me in anyway (that I've been able to see).

Yeah, so this is some serious business right here. I think your friend needs to learn that he's not sexually entitled to drunk girls. Especially if he's pretending to be the good guy by giving them a place to stay, because that shit makes it look seriously premeditated. The fact that he's done it twice is going to look even worse if someone makes a complaint about him.

Except you were assaulted. Not only did you explain that you were not interested earlier that night, but you also built a physical wall between the two of you when he joined you. It doesn't matter if the wall was made of pillows or stone. The message was clear. Even if none of that had happened, who thinks it is acceptable to fondle a sleeping person/passed out person!? Nobody sane because it is not! Waking up and freezing is completely understandable. It is hard to comprehend the fact that someone you thought was your friend is doing this. He knew he was doing something wrong and he even tried to cover for it the next day when he said you ""agreed to it."" No, you didn't. How could you have? Obviously we don't know the exact details of what happened with the girl from the bar, but it sounds like she really wasn't in much of a condition to make rational decisions.

Don't worry about disappointing your new boss. You didn't start working for her in order to make a BFFL, nor are you working to appease anyone else.

Maintain a presence, talk to the waitstaff, etc. it is their job to be friendly. 

If/when a guy starts to talk to you, capitalize on the fact that you like video games! Guys that are into video games (most of them are) will think you are 30% more attractive automatically! More generally, be interested in what they find interesting. If that happens to be League of Legends, then bonus. If not, try to find out what they like and talk about that.

Also note that some guys that are also introverts may be too intimidated by the prospect of talking to someone they don't know to actually break the ice. You may need to start up a conversation with the guy who sits a few seats down. If you start with ""Hey, did you play the [insert recent Zelda title]?"" Some guys (perhaps up to 50%) might not know what your are talking about, and that might get weird. The rest will instantly think you are super awesome. This is either a strike or home run, it will either be terrible or fantastic, no middle ground. Be emotionally prepared when things work out wrong (or right).

Also note that guys may not admit it, but they rank the ""attractiveness level"" of the girl they are talking to relative to their own. A very nerdy supermodel might think Zelda is super interesting and talk to you for 4 hours about it, but it wont get you very far. Don't take that personally. Play in your league and you will have success. Alternately, there are few substitutes for simply improving your league. If no one talks to you, or things persistently don't work out, you may want to consider a lifestyle change. 

edit: ""Hey do you like Zelda"" might be a little bit too forward. A better plan would sound something like: ""I've been playing [insert game title] recently. It is a pretty interesting game because [insert various reasons]."" If he has any brains at all, he will either engage directly with the game you are talking about or he will slightly shift the conversation by saying something like ""Oh, I gather you are an Xbox fan.""

Closer moderation on the support  labeled threads helps, though it won't stop the PMs.  Ideally, we should have two inboxes - or a way to differentiate comment replies and PMs so that those having a hard time with the PMs could ignore them, if they want to do so.   Even that would be a shitty solution, but at least would be an attempt.  Sure, we already deal with our own shit and there will be more trolls, more threads hijacked, but, in the event that the sub doesn't get taken off default, I think the community should devote time and energy trying to help this type of posts and telling trolls to back the fuck off.

Just presenting a snapshot of this week's existing discussion on it.  

From my point of view, I continue to think that the sub being a default is a positive.  It is driving traffic to the whole network of woman-related subs listed in our sidebar, and significantly increasing the visibility of women on reddit.  

Every time there's a post from someone saying that women's issues are ""niche"" or ""special interest"" I want to explode, since we're 50% of the population and at least 35% of reddit.  I appreciate that the admins decided that adding women's perspectives to the front page was a good step for the site.",3,t3_26b8ro
20140523124642,seeashbashrun,"I understand there has been a lot of discussion, and I appreciate you showing me a couple of positive reactions. I honestly had not seen any personally yet. 

What I am trying to introduce is a way to poll the response and quantify the consequences. I definitely agree it's not niche, but man reddit is pretty male dominated, not just in numbers but in attitude. Some of the men on this site are downright hostile towards women as a whole, and it's largely accepted. Now people are experiencing it 'in their safe haven'. I already know how I feel about it--I'd really like to get a better grasp on how others feel. Largely because the mods did not consult any of the user base with their decision. 

It would also provide a way for people to put in their opinion as a 1 count, rather than something to be voted on and valued. I think it would provide a better way of getting an idea about how people feel about it. ",2,t3_26b8ro

The sub has jumped from 150K to 280+K subscribers. Lots of them are great people, but we're not getting back the 2X that exited before. And it would take a lot more than going off the default list for me to have any trust in the mods here, after the way this was handled and they way they (failed to) address the concerns of folks here after the switch.",4,t3_26b8ro

One thing that really concerns me is that this seems purely a numbers game, and they're not concerned that their big content providers are going to likely leave. This may still be a forum for women's issues, but I don't think it will be the same quality and type of content. Obviously whether that is good or bad is subjective, but I am worried this will become a sounding board for the women's issues that *men* think are important, rather than women or even an even mix of men and women.

That's kinda the point. Not that people aren't welcome at 2X, but making it a default very much takes it from being a meeting space, to a space about educating or engaging the whole of Reddit. I see it as a fundamental change to what 2X is about.

Not that there shouldn't be a default about/for women. But taking over an existing women's sub to serve Reddit as a whole (rather than, for example making anew sub and heavily advertising to 2X, trollX, AskWomen, etc) was, to my mind, not a good choice and not a choice that supports women participating in Reddit.

20140523133657,dreamingofjellyfish,"Oh. You were lucky enough to miss the drama of the first few days as a default. What happened (cobbled together from various mod statements):

The admins went to mods of various subs and gave them about 1-2 days to decide about being defaults, with the explicit instruction not to make the info public. So 2X's mods made the sub a default, then explained the decision in a very piecemeal fashion by responding to individuals threads/comments/mod mails. The mods have the option to un-default at any time with the click of a button.

So a big reason I'm pissed about the change, is that the mods have never really sought community feedback in any organized way, and have dismissed polls about the change (for legit reasons - but still, first day of default status there was a poll 10000 against, 1500 for, 5000 don't care).",4,t3_26b8ro

Calorie counting is a proven way to lose weight just by reducing what you're eating. You don't need to cut things out, but you do have a cap on how much you're allowed to eat per day. If you choose to have a 200 calorie chocolate bar, that's fine, you just can't eat as much ""real"" food for the rest of the day. Later on once you've shed some pounds you could think about eating healthier. One step at a time. I think losing actual pounds would make you feel more successful, rather than eating healthy but still eating the same number of calories as you do now.

I've never been overweight, but I did gain 15 unwanted pounds and this did it for me. Now three years later I'm eating healthier and less, since I trained myself to eat less three years ago (I did not necessarily eat healthy, just less at the time). It really works.

I can give you some ortho tri-cyclen specific advice and anecdotes about my experience! I spotted with breakthrough bleeding the whole second month I took it, but once that went away, it was great. I like that is is tri phasic, so the hormones are less at the beginning. Also, skipping periods is harder in a tri phasic regimen.

3. (3) it sounds like a lot of factors were at play in your relationship with your ex. the story you relayed was *one example* of a time that you felt uncomfortable, so IF you feel the issue is unresolved, or it comes up again, remind your boyfriend of this. the relationship itself was problematic, but it is in the past and that's where you'd prefer to leave its issues. you trust and love your boyfriend, or whatever reassurance you feel and wish to convey.  
  
1. (1) ogling is inappropriate and disrespectful, and an unfortunate reality for many people. but don't let yourself feel victimized by it; enjoy your life! there's just no reason to pay the idiots who engage in that behavior any attention. help them learn that they don't deserve the time of day from anyone they elect to objectify. the next time anything like that happens, discretely move. if it's a ticketed seating situation, and the behavior escalates from looking, find a customer service rep and speak up.  
  
2. (2) you are likely able to admit now that you little vigilantes didn't pursue justice in its most noble form by attacking a defenseless person. you were and are entitled to take issue with what that boy did to you. but you went from taking issue with the physical boundary he crossed... directly to crossing a physical boundary. if you know now that you would handle the same situation better, acknowledge as much.  
  
it sounds like in all of these scenarios, you are fighting with feelings while your boyfriend fights with logic. you may disagree in principle, but my takeaway is that he has not paused to truly imagine what those scenarios must feel like for you, and your feelings rise to the surface and leave you too raw to step back and address the issues from a purely objective standpoint, as he seems to be doing. there may not be any real fight at all, you're just speaking mandarin and he's speaking portuguese.

It's not sexual harassment, but it is incredibly rude.  And it can escalate to harassment in some situations.  The only way I can think to explain it to him is, would he be comfortable if some burly dude kept blatantly staring at his ass and licking his lips?

2) I think the punishment the boy who assaulted you received was disproportionate to what happened.  On the other hand, the boy did cross boundaries and you called him out on it, which is a good thing.  BF needs to look at the full context.

3) It might help to provide overall context for what your ex did.  Not specifying other incidents, but explaining that it was one piece in the overall picture that caused you discomfort.  Also maybe clarify that if what your current BF is doing made you uncomfortable, you would now know better to say so.

I think the OP's real issue is that coupled with the other incidents described, BF has a tendency to derail or invalidate her feeling of discomfort in these situations.

Still though, this is so far much more journalistic than what you would find on most professional articles.",1,t3_26ben0

He will probably do it again.  He's probably done it since his early teens.

Here is the wording used in one of the studies.

See [page 5](http://www.davidlisak.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/RepeatRapeinUndetectedRapists.pdf) of the Lisak study.


>For a participant to be classified among the group of rapists and attempted rapists in
this study, he would have to have responded ""yes"" to one of the following questions

>1. Have you ever been in a situation where you tried, but for various reasons did not succeed, in having sexual intercourse with an adult by using or threatening to use physical force (twisting their arm, holding them down, etc.) if they did not cooperate?
2. Have you ever had sexual intercourse with someone, even though they did not want
to, because they were too intoxicated (on alcohol or drugs) to resist your sexual
advances (e.g., removing their clothes)?
3. Have you ever had sexual intercourse with an adult when they didn't want to
Because you used or threatened to use physical force (twisting their arm; holding
Them down, etc.) if they didn't cooperate?
4. Have you ever had oral sex with an adult when they didn't want to because you
Used or threatened to use physical force (twisting their arm; holding them down,
etc.) if they didn't cooperate?

>Any participant who responded ""yes"" to one of these questions was asked a series of follow-up questions regarding their age, the victim's age, the number of times it happened,
Whether it happened with another person , and if so, the frequency of other instances or the
Number of other victims (this last question varied depending on the version of the API used).

You just described 2.  It was a rape.  If you asked past partners would you find similar behavior?  The scientific literature suggests he may be dangerous to many others in the future.

> Within the universe of 3,698 violent acts that the
1,882 men in this sample were responsible for, the 76 repeat rapists by themselves accounted for 1,045 of that total. That is, representing only 4% of the sample,the repeat
rapists accounted for 28% of the violence. Their level of violence was nearly ten times that
of non-rapists, and nearly three and a half times that of single-act rapists.

We eventually started our own company together and got into full scale reno's (installing floors, tiling, some plumbing, etc). I branched out and worked in the construction of modular buildings for a while, did some basic framing and stuff. Then I did some welding for a while (my boyfriend is an apprentice welder and he let me tinker around a bit). Then I did some Heavy Equipment Operating (got the job through a family friend). Annnd theeen I got my Rope Access Certification, which has opened up the doors for me to work on high rises! 

Basically I used my painting skills to get my foot in the door with a few companies... Then gained experience and knowledge from people around me who knew how to do other stuff. Used that experience to get more work and gain more skills, and on it goes! Suddenly I'm a Jane of all trades. :)",3,t3_26ci6j

Arent posting pictures like this just enforcing the false stereotype of 'weak' women in the workforce?

Like, ""Hey, look at me, I can do anything a man can do!"". 
Of course you can, but making an example of it could be misunderstood as ""I am not a normal woman, here is a rare example of us doing the same work that men do""

I understand its more about just showing signs of equality, but on the other hand it could be taken as an ""exception to the rule"", when in reality, there shouldnt be that rule at all. Doesnt just the point of acknowledging that rule, give it more power than it deserves? (the 'rule' being that men should work the tough, hands on, dirty jobs while women shouldnt)

20140524140041,nolimbs,"I'm not a normal woman... and what I do is a rare example of a woman doing the same work as a man. I am the only girl on a crew of 30, and in my almost 10 years of working in construction I've always been a minority. 

I posted this picture to inspire other women who maybe have considered doing what I do, but don't believe they can do it physically or mentally. Not only is it totally possible to achieve success working in construction as a female, but it's very fulfilling... But people have to know that there are women out there who are blazing the trail for all the others to follow, because otherwise it will always be seen as an unachievable career choice. 

Bottom line, its unfortunate, but it is the way it is in this industry and I am an exception to the rule. If I weren't, it would be more like 50/50 men to women rather than 90/10. 

I believe this is why we should be posting MORE pictures like this, and showing the young ladies entering the workforce that you don't have to work in an office, or retail, or any of the other bullshit industries that are targeted towards women. It's showing women that they can do whatever the hell they put their mind to.

If I hadn't have had my mom show me from a young age that working in trades is awesome, lucrative, and completely achievable, I not have ever believed I was capable of doing what I do. If I hadn't have got into the workforce and been inspired by the odd female doing something more technical than me, I wouldn't have been driven to push myself into new areas of construction. If I hadn't have connected with other women in trades through social media or researched other success stories, I would have NEVER thought there were women out there doing kick ass things like driving heavy machinery, managing construction sites, or being in the field at large mining operations or oil fields. I'm working on high rises now, but my goal is to become a journeywoman electrician and work on offshore oil rigs with my rope access certification. Or maybe to get my heavy equipment operators license and drive machines so big that you need a fucking elevator to get into the cab. I wouldn't consider any of this if I hadn't been inspired by my peers enough to realize I'm capable of anything, female or not. It's not about giving stereotypes power or whatever you are trying to imply, its about inspiring others, because without that we would all be left thinking we are destined for the cubicle.

Cat calling is a form of bullying. Men never do it when I'm with other men. They are bullies who only do it to women, because they know full well that women are smaller and not as physically strong as them. What makes it worse is that it's not just an act of aggression meant to intimidate, it's an act of sexual aggression. 

If I was a man and I lived somewhere that was full of gang members who always physically threatened me, I would move. But I'm not a man, I'm a woman, and no matter where I choose to live men will harass me on the street. I can't move away from my vagina. I can't leave my vagina at home like I can leave expensive jewelry.

One time, I was in a shop and an older man grabbed my butt. I turned around, and he reacted oddly and winked at me. I shrugged it off, continued shopping, and went home. ALL afternoon, I was really pissy and couldn't figure out why. Finally my husband asks me what's up, and I just started sobbing about what happened, and I was pissed at myself for not reporting him to...SOMEONE! Police, the store, anywhere. It was gross and I just felt the need to cry it out for a bit. My husband was shocked because I told him about it and laughed it off, but clearly it bothered me.

I know it's a silly thought because with time I've grown to realize that catcalling is not about what I'm wearing or how cute I am. But I still always wonder when I put shorts on in the morning - am I going to get catcalled in these? Should I avoid quieter streets today or make sure I only go out with somebody else?

Your experience sounds awful. I can completely understand why you would feel so vulnerable to the point of sobbing.

And any time of day, no matter where I went, I used to get it from every angle. Even when I moved to NoHo, when I walked my daughter in a stroller, covered up in layers with no makeup, I couldn't walk anywhere without the honking, cat calls, kissing noises. If I needed something at 7-11 at night, I would dress up like a dude and walk like a dude with my weapon in my pocket and chunky rings on all my fingers - still got honked at during the two block walk.

2) ""Berate someone""?? There was no berating. You seem to be feeling some anger, but I wasn't feeling anger. That may be your assumption but as the #1 authority on what I was feeling, I can tell you I wasn't feeling anger at the time. With the current influx of trolls this sub has had, I specifically did NOT want to tear into him because I DID understand what he was trying to say, but wanted to take the opportunity to point out something that could help current and future discussions.

Now this is a generallysation made by a bystander who lives across the world and understands American culture by what comes across in media and places like reddit.  But what I do not understand- where does that male entitelment come from? Why do men seem to think that I have some sort of obligation to ""give my digits"" to a random stranger, who thinks my ass looks good? 

There was a phrase in another story ""I see you seeing me"", and the guy saying it actually seemed to think that the fact that the OP had looked in his general direction gave him some sort of ""right"" to interaction with her. 

Women very politely telling a man that they are not interested, getting threatened to be ""put in their place"". What does that even mean? What sort of monsters is society creating? And why do you put up with it???

I actually typed up a lot more, but it turned very ranty and I kinda 'Merica bashing- like and I do not actually have any right to critisize a society I have not experienced firsthand or when my own home country isn't perfect either.  

But what I employ as a very effective way to keep any unwanted attention to a minimum- always keep you posture confident and stay polite. A ladylike ""Sorry, I am not interested"" works better than ""The fuck you lookin at"" behaviour.  (I have been known to let a ""Guys with faces like yours, don't talks to girls with asses like mine"" fly, though that usually means I have been thorougly pissed off.)

All in all. This is 2014. There are no more arranged marriages, we can vote and go to uni, become a doctor, a soldier, whoever. Yet we still can't raise men who don't think they are superior? Because all these assholes are someones son or brother.

It was broad daylight, there were plenty of people out and about, cars driving by--there's no way they could have actually raped or hurt me without the entire neighborhood seeing.

It's not always about fear, it's about violation. It's about having a right to my own body and about how upsetting verbal and physical harassment can be. It makes you feel insecure, embarrassed, useless and vulnerable... but I'm not a timid person, and I'm not afraid to go back into that neighborhood again.

I don't like having to explain basic stuff over and over again to people who really don't seem interested in understanding women's perspectives, despite that being the focus of the sub. I don't like that every new thread I enter with more than 5 posts, I scroll to the bottom to see what I should report, if anything. I never used to do that. I don't like how so many are opposed to the idea that some threads here should be free of criticism/antagonism/debate. They call it an echo chamber to want helpful, supportive comments. All across reddit, male-offered hyperbole is understood for what it is, but women use the tiniest bit of hyperbole and the ""Not ALL men"" chorus hits at deafening levels. There are so many new people here who I suspect have no ability to empathize, and that's terribly frustrating.

I'm not about to just give up on twox. I just have a feeling that, much like my role on many other subs I frequent, I'll have to take on the role of an educator here too instead of just having a place to relax and shoot the shit. And that's disappointing, because while this place was never a ""safe space"", it was never so hostile.

Because you know what? There *should* be a default sub dedicated to women's issues.

Grandparents, however, simply chose to love us. They make us feel special. Ive learned so much from mine by listening to their stories of ""back during the depression..."", by seeing how they respond to situations with dignity and grace.

Quick story time, someone I know was molested, abused and raped by one of their parents for years when growing up.  As soon as they were able, they move out and started a new life, leaving their parents and siblings behind.  Within a year, one sibling got married and was expecting their first child.  My friend immediately reported it to prevent the same thing from happening.  Their parent didn't serve jail time due to a plea bargain, instead had 10 years probation, put on the sex offenders registry and wasn't allowed to be alone with anyone under the age of 18.  While the sentence is nothing compared to the severity of the crime, family now all knew about it (and it wasn't just one person making a claim) and others of the public knew as well.

20140523223335,bloonail,"There is sexism in physics. You're probably looking more for something useful to do about it rather than just a ""yes- it happens"".

Maybe worthwhile looking at the causes. 

Much is just that people aren't used to women in the field. There is a difference, to some degree, to how women and men prepare and organize their thinking on these matters, so breaking into the field with somewhat different expectations and methods can be a trial.

Next,.. well much of the problem isn't sexism as much as nerdism and rarity. If a decent guy shows up in an all female office he'll be hunted like a white antelope. Women are rare in most physics areas.  The hours are long and lots of scientific installations are isolated. Why is it a mystery that men might hit on the few even remotely possible women?

How to deal with the situation?? Well find what your strengths are. Work with them. There are advantages to being a women in that field. Groups are under pressure to balance their numbers in many ways, so a competent women won't find it difficult to get offers for jobs or positions. As for resolving getting hit on all the time,...I dunno.  Try not to allow it to disturb your goals. Be safe and avoid trouble but think ahead about situations that will naturally lead towards difficulty. Keep your head up so nasty situations don't have an opportunity to foment and create career problems for a bunch of people. Don't accept favors or rides if those wouldn't be offered to a guy in the same situation. Be conscious about subtle offers to be involved in a non-work situation. 

Try not to be a pain with the ""sexism"" biz. Guys will tolerate almost any type of oddball or derogatory statements presented to them, simply to be part of a conversation with a women. Managers and people trying to get things done don't always put up with low level abuse along those lines. If you don't think its abuse because you're just educating someone,..well that's abuse.

Edit: What might help is just to ask to create a more welcoming place, or find one within your target workplace or institution. Sometimes feeling welcome requires building a bit of a spot yourself. Ask for a room for women to study in, or collaborate. Organize girls nights out with people on similar career track. Get parking spots set-out near the building so you can get into the place at night easily. Simple accommodation makes people feel they belong. It doesn't have to be a big deal, but even something minor, like moving big trash barrels away from the entrances to the women's washroom,.. well that can matter.",4,t3_26bvh4

A good start (at least, for tech in general) is via Ashe Dryden (see: http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/dissent-unheard-of and her twitter: https://twitter.com/ashedryden)  My advice would be to find as many men as you can to speak with you on this subject.  You mention young men doubting your aptitude, and the article talks about  Bernice Sandler counting how many times men interrupt women versus men interrupting other men.  Talk and advocate, but get men out there advocating, too, because unfortunately they will be more likely to get time to speak, and other men are more likely to listen.  There are lots of men who don't realize what they are doing, and won't realize it until another man points it out, but then can come around to a point where they are reasonable co-workers.

20140524035546,apumpkinpi,"Gosh, I hated being a woman in a physics program.

It was never the faculty that was a problem. No, they were always helpful and respectful, and most of them didn't point out my gender or comment on it. If they did, it was along the lines of ""It's nice to see more women studying physics than there used to be.""

The other students though? Fuck my life. I'll be honest here and say that most of them were not a problem, but the ones that were were really diligent in trying to make me absolutely miserable.

I was studious and learned really quickly. I had perfect homework scores, my test scores were always on top. I also worked much faster than the other students and spent a lot of time studying. I frequently tutored and helped other students complete their homework after I was done with mine. Studying in large groups usually meant that I was walking some of the others through homework problems.

None of that mattered though and I was still harassed for being stupid. One student would frequently harass me about my homework being incorrect while I was helping others, and I say harass because he was always wrong about insisting that I was incorrect about something. I'd frequently get comments about how I couldn't compare to the male students of the class when only one of them ever managed to get a higher test score than me. I would be working on a program in lab, and one guy would sit behind me and tell me that nothing I was doing made any sense and my program must be terrible, and I told him maybe four or five times to mind his own business. He would do this almost every class (fun fact, I completed that lab two days ahead of schedule and my program ran perfectly the first time I ran it). When I was hostile in return, and told him that I'll take his corrections seriously if he ever manages to actually make one, I was berated by our friends for being a bitch.

When I was secretary of the club, the president asked me out and I declined. He was in a relationship with someone else about two days later, but that didn't stop him from going out of his way to bully me for the rest of the school year. He would reschedule officer meetings when I was unavailable because I had class and said that I should resign for being so irresponsible, he would ""cancel"" club events to stop me from attending them and later harass me in front of others saying that I was a flake, he would refuse to forward me the paperwork that he asked me to complete and would scold me and say that I was incompetent during club meetings in front of everyone, and when I found alternative means to get said paperwork he would scold me for going behind his back and making him look bad, he would make fun of every idea that I had and then would take credit for it later, and finally he said that no one in the club was actually friends with me because they all thought that I was too difficult to get along with because I was such a bitch. I stopped being friends with him, and was harassed for being cold-hearted and unforgiving by our friends who tried to encourage me to ""just get over it"". Most of them didn't take that stance, and I stopped talking to the ones that did.

I eventually stopped talking to everyone though. I ended up becoming super depressed and took some time off because I couldn't cope.

I honestly don't know what can be done about that. For some of it I only believe that thicker skin could have helped.

Perhaps seminars about how not to be a total shit to your peers would be a start. More on point, seminars on how to have tact and what is not appropriate in a work or school environment. There should be a mention in there about how not to talk to women, ever, and why. I'm sure some of them, especially in college, are just inexperienced and have no idea how their actions affect others.

Some advice on good ways to respond would be great, too, because honestly it's sometimes hard to think straight when you're feeling anxious and uncomfortable. How to offer support or diffuse a tense situation without taking the offense would be great, too. I feel like if someone had just said ""Hey, leave her alone already"" that I would have felt much more comfortable in the lab.",2,t3_26bvh4
20140523172551,Megaphyte,"XY here.  Yeah, I agree, often the male attitude is still entrenched in the past.  I studied mech. engineering.  In my grad class there were 80 of us in total; 77 of them men.  Even if all 77  were perfect modern respectful men (which they were not), I bet it would have felt pretty awkward to be that one girl in the class.

There were a variety of other complications too.  For example, the university understandably wanted to get more girls enrolled in the program, so they implemented a double standard for GPA admission requirements in the mech. program, making it easier for women.  Fair enough, but you can see how it might have brewed some resentment.

On the upside, in my career I work with a lot more female engineers than I encountered during my education. The profession is still overwhelmingly dominated by men - but there are a lot *old* men making up a huge portion that will be retiring soon.  I really do think things are improving.  I feel like it's an issue that might just take a generation or two to resolve as gender-specific expectations for younger generations continue to fall away.  ",3,t3_26bvh4
20140524040808,ParanthropusBoisei,"My view is that the dominance of males and the rarity of females in physics is not the problem here, the major problem is that you and other females are not being treated as individuals but instead as stereotypical members of the female sex. In fact, anyone who doesn't understand that individuals vary and that some females will inevitably be scientific geniuses is themselves guilty of scientific ineptitude -- namely in psychology.

That being said, because you posted that NDT video I feel compelled to link you to this:

Honestly, most of my peers are really chill when it comes to being in the classroom/not questioning my brains. Sometimes, they say shitty things in casual, non-physics conversation that make me snap at them. Sometimes, I get really pissed. There's one dude in particular that I cannot fucking stand (""Feynman is my favorite physicist because he wad so smart, and also good with the ladies!"" Meanwhile, Feynman was a complete womanizer who often took advantage of women over whom he had some amount of authority/power...) I'm lucky, though, because there are 2-3 dudes who will actually support me when I call out sexist crap. They're good people! :)

My worst experience was actually with a professor. She's an experimentalist from China, and she's good at what she does, but she's got done crazy ingrained sexist beliefs, man! I used to sit in her shitty lab class and just fume about it every time she'd say anything related to gender. We had to give presentations at the end of the course, and she asked us to dress like we were presenting at APS. She was like, ""ladies, no heels - they're ridiculous and make you found goofy when you walk - if you don't wear sensible shoes, no one will take you seriously."" I don't particularly like wearing high heels, but I dislike being told I can't wear something if I want to be taken seriously even more. Especially when that something is stereotypically feminine. It took me forever to get dressed for that stupid fucking presentation, because I was worried that she'd think I was too girly (and thus not to be taken seriously!). Ugh.",1,t3_26bvh4
20140523210925,greycloud24,"you have the chance to be a pioneer here. you will face adversity, you will face a culture that is not your own. the culture will not change unless you change it. nobody is just going to change it for you. so drive on, be strong, and continue doing what you do. understand that you can't do this without changing. to change is to adapt. humans (actually all living creatures) have two strategies for survival in a changing environment. they can adapt to the environment or they can change the environment to adapt to them. until there are more women working together to change the environment, the only option left is to adapt to it. throw out the idea that you can succeed without changing. you are there to learn, and when you learn you change. you couldn't even pass the classes without changing, and neither can anyone else. if you were static then the course would have to adapt to what you already know, and that couldn't even be called a class while staying true to its name. 

you are there to learn, you have extra hurdles because you have to learn the white male environment at the same time that you learn physics. you will have to try harder to succeed than many of your peers. but when you do succeed people will know that you earned it twice to get it once. not all people will know that, but the right people will know that. 

you may want to find out the hobbies and interests of your classmates. you may want to look into those interests and see which ones you are interested in as well. you may want to become ""one of the guys"" as this will give you the social status you will need to succeed, and this will inherently earn the respect of the people you are learning with. 

in the world of science only one thing really matters. are you right? is your answer right? your proposal will be torn to pieces, analyzed from every angle, it will be tested and retested and put to the light to be shred. it isn't you they are attacking, it is your proposal. don't be afraid to fail. don't be afraid that your argument will be destroyed. it is good that your argument is destroyed, it means that a wrong answer wasn't accepted. but please always understand it is your hypothesis and not your person that is being attacked. don't take it personally, because that is exactly why you will be held back. 

i love science. and i have often made the argument that women don't do well in the sciences. the number 1 reason they don't do well is because they take it personal when their hypothesis is thrown in the garbage. a respectable scientist would thank the person who just shredded their hypothesis. because a respectable scientist understands that the argument stands and falls on its own, and has nothing to do with the person who just voiced it. its not you, its your argument. and as a student your arguments will fall. you will get things wrong, and it is important that you get things wrong so that you learn where your failures are, and how you ended up with those failures. it is more important to get things wrong than it is to get them right. embrace that, hold it to your heart. 

if you can rise above yourself to see that it isn't about you, its about the data. it isn't about you, its about the method. it isn't about you, its about the measurements. it isn't about you, its about the results. than you will have the mentality needed to succeed. and when you do succeed you will gain the power to change the environment, and make it an easier path for your future daughter, or perhaps someone else's daughter. 

btw i have a crush on lisa randall. normally i am only attracted to young and beautiful girls, but she is just so smart it is hot. don't know if that is really appropriate in this message, but when i see the women who do succeed in these fields, i am thoroughly impressed by them. i think i would be star struck if i met her face to face though.

20140523221725,AnotherAnonymousAcct,"My grandpa was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.  It was a long process watching his body slowly deteriorate and betray him.  The large symptoms came quickly, seeming like he was losing all functioning.  It wasn't until more time passed that we realized just how much more there was to lose.  This is the man who raised me and my siblings and took care of his wife (who had sever dementia) for years.

When it was getting obvious that things were nearing the end, I went to sit and talk with him before going to bed (everyone else had been called and were working out traveling arrangements, most would be getting into town within the following days).  I was yammering on and crying and even I have no idea what I was saying, just trying to have the right thing get said in there somewhere.  He motioned for me to stop, then said (He had lost all reasonable ability to speak shortly after being put on a ventilator, it caused great pain, was nearly impossible to work the muscles to form syllables, impossibly difficult thing for him to speak at this point) ""I know, I love you, do good.""

That night, the only miracle I've ever witnessed happened.  House was empty, just me and my grandpa.  I was asleep in bed when I hear all the monitoring equipment start going crazy, everything was alerting, no pulse, ventilator had no resistance, I mean it sounded like the ER on shows when they wheel someone in from the ambulance.  I jump up and bolt to his room.  What do I see?  He's laying on his side.  Heart monitor contacts have come off, ventilator tube is pulled out (he had the one surgically set up in the neck, so the tube leading to the ventilator could easily be removed).  He was just laying there, eyes closed with a smile on his face.  I thought he had chosen his way out and made the decision to end it there.  What the medical examiner's report showed (long story about the police thinking it was an assisted suicide in a state where it would not have been legal at all) was that he had actually rolled over in his sleep, the ventilator tube had gotten caught up in the sheets and the heart monitors came off as he shuffled around more.  For those that know what Lou Gehrig's disease is (ALS), or those who research it, this is basically an impossibility at the stage he was at.  I don't know if they thought they were covering for me, or if they really think that happened, or if they were protecting us from knowing he ended it.

We aren't talking about little kids discovering that they have different genitals and touching each others' while they try to figure out the world around them. Having sex with 6 year olds is not a part of normal teenage development in any way. If this had gone to court, he would have been tried as a minor because he didn't have the same understanding as an adult. That doesn't mean that he didn't know he was doing anything wrong. 

There's also a difference between a child following directions given to them by someone they see as an authority figure and a child giving directions. Most children want to please the adults around them, so when they're told to keep quiet they do. It's not at all uncommon with children who are being abused sexually. But to give the instruction that you can't tell anyone is a completely different issue for a child of any age. When a four year old tells you not to tell their parents that they did something, it's a safe bet that they know it's not ok to do it. When a thirteen year old tells a 6 year old not to tell anyone that he's putting his penis in her vagina, you know damn well that he knows it's not ok.

20140524092948,greycloud24,"ok i agree with this. but lets also keep in mind that at that age boys are developmentally 2-3 years behind girls. so if you are going to hold the correct context you should think of it like a 6 year old girl and a 10-11 year old girl. 

this is the reason that parents have to worry about teenage boys doing dumb things. at the magical age of 13-15 boys are bigger and stronger and a whole lot dumber than girls their own age. that is why young girls go for boys a few years older then them, and that is also why the parents don't trust the boys and try to protect the girls. its not that the boys are evil, its that the are both dumb and strong. 

edit: boys don't catch up to girls completely until around age 23. but at age 16 for boys, 14 for girls, they can be expected to have a strong enough sense of empathy to make adult decisions, because of some important brain and cognitive development. ",-2,t3_26cso3

20140524103733,greycloud24,"i both agree and disagree. they are experiencing budding sexuality, but its not like it is completely foreign to them. both girls and boys often start masturbating at very young ages (not all, but many) they just don't call it masturbation. go ask any daycare worker or just look for early childhood masturbation on the internet. 
i wouldn't expect a 13 year old to understand the nuances of the differences in pre puberty masturbation and post puberty masturbation. i wouldn't expect them to know the difference of post puberty sexual actions and pre puberty playing doctor. 
you and i can understand the difference, but we are much older and have a lot more life experience. to expect a 13 year old to have an adult perspective is kind of dumb in my book. especially when so many parents shame their children for early childhood masturbation and tell them that it is wrong. it may be hard for a 13 year old to know the difference between this being wrong, and sexual playing with a younger person being wrong, and sex being wrong. all they really know is that sexual things have to be hidden from their parents, because their parents say that touching yourself is wrong. 

i would blame the parents more than the children in a case like this. these things happen because adults can't be mature enough to teach their children the differences of these things before they occur. and the way many adults approach childhood sexuality doesn't help children understand, instead it teaches them that sexuality is something to hide from adults.

You can present her with the information of what the food's she's eating are doing to her very cells, and what the outcome will be down the track.

As a nurse who's seen dozens of diabetics display non-compliance to their diet/insulin/non-weight-bearing of their foot ulcers, and consequently lose their foot, I can see how hard it is for a person to make that kind of lifestyle change.

She's lost weight and she thinks she's eating healthy, while in my eyes she's still eating like shit. She's eating unhealthy high sugar/high carb things (for example her breakfast today was toast with nutella and yogurt) she's just eating a bit of a smaller portion size.

Your mom's doctor might be able to recommend a group for people with diabetic parents, or for adult children who are primary caregivers. And depending on the size of the city you live in, and what they offer, you might be able to find some affordable therapy/counseling. The city I live in offers counseling that's based on your income.

Second, it's totally okay to be/feel mad or angry at your mom. Those are your feelings. But, her decisions do not define your happiness. I was angry at my dad for giving himself cancer from smoking, but ultimately, I learned that my happiness was my responsibility and I couldn't let his decision to keep puffing ruin my day. Forgiving yourself for feeling these feelings will go a long way, because like I said before, it's totally okay to feel feelings, even those of anger towards your mother.

If you are looking for healthier meals, /r/eatcheapandhealthy and /r/plantbaseddiet are great subs. I like to use the [Harvard Healthy Plate](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/) for meal planning. Frozen vegetables are easy and pretty affordable, and don't be afraid to try new things. If there's one near you, go to a farmer's market and buy one, new fruit or vegetable. Ask the farmer how they prefer it cooked, and go home and try it. 

Lastly, it seems like you like to work out, which is good, so you might want to think about joining a club team. It will be a good way for you to meet people your age and socialize, blow off some steam in a healthy way, and do something fun that's also good for you. Some clubs/teams are really  and others are more laid back, so hopefully you can find something you like.

Hope this helps. You can PM me with any questions about making meal plans, recommended food blogs, etc. Eating and cooking should be fun and tasty and not give you health problems. And remember - the feelings you feel are legitimate, and it's okay that you feel them.",3,t3_26c81z

And yes, as far as I understand, a financial abortion is the ridiculous idea that if a dude lets a lady know he doesn't wanna be a dad, and she gets pregnant anyways by accident or whatever and decides to keep it, he can petition to not pay child support. So basically the child gets to suffer for the parents' mistakes, which is exactly what current laws try to prevent.",1,t3_26cp5y
20140526114811,tishtok,"It's ridiculous because as I said, it's punishing the child for the parents' actions. Parents are required pay child support to the person who cares for the child because it is in the best interest of the child for the caring parent to have adequate funding to raise the child. 

>There are millions of households in the US that are single parent who have no financial support from the other parent.

Please bring me a statistic that backs this up, and also states the *reasons* these single parents receive no support. A statement like this is absolutely meaningless. It could very well be true...but if those households are a product of, for example, a deceased parent, an imprisoned parent, or a parent who has refused to pay child support at all, it becomes pretty clear that these situations are far from ideal for the child. Just because this is a thing that occurs doesn't mean it can't negatively impact the children involved. It doesn't necessarily need to be an obvious impact. Let's take a decent scenario: Maybe the single parent can generally afford to feed and clothe their child, but child support would allow the child to take part in enriching experiences such as a team sport or music lessons or an after school program. Maybe that child support would allow the caring parent to purchase ""extras"" for the child, such as a laptop, or school supplies, or even board games. These are all extremely important things, but luxuries for many needy families. And they all develop important connections in the brain. For example, [a study recently showed that impoverished elementary schoolers in Oakland gained 13 IQ POINTS after 20 hours of playing specific board games](http://www.nurtureshock.com/IQLeaps.pdf)

>These children are not suffering based on having a single parent and to say so would be quite offensive to those single parents that do fabulous jobs raising the child.

Please point out where I said this. I did not. However, years of research has indeed demonstrated that children of low socioeconomic status are at heightened risk for health problems, internalizing disorders (e.g., depression), and externalizing disorders (e.g., conduct disorder). And that's the tip of the iceberg. So while I said nothing at all about children of single parents suffering, it is indeed true that children of lower SES are at a heightened risk for adverse outcomes...which could possibly be prevented due to the monetary contribution of both parents. So basically, by taking money away from the caring parent, you're actually taking it away from the child, and thus hurting the child for your decisions.

Also, just fyi, your point about adoption is untrue. [As I understand it, in the US, the father must also consent if a woman wants to put her child up for adoption](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/adoption-facts-understanding-the-birthfathers-righ.html). In fact, in almost all states, even if the pregnancy came about as the product of rape, the rapist can still assert these rights, and prevent the woman from putting her child up for adoption. In fact in many states, rapists can even assert parental visitation rights! ",2,t3_26cp5y

- You had unprotected sex with your SO of 4 years, and he didn't put on a condom. How is it 100% his responsibility to put on a condom? Right, he should have suggested it, or paid more attention, but YOU consented to it. Your SO may not be the brightest guy, or maybe was in the heat of the moment, or maybe he just doesn't care about the consequences of his actions. That doesn't matter.

Arguably, if keeping the hypothetical pregnancy is 100% your choice, then you are 100% responsible for enforcing the use of contraceptives. No excuses.

- You are posting publicly about a situation that you're not even sure you're in yet. Pregnancy tests cost as low as $1. *Get one.* Get several and keep them handy. They are highly accurate after being ~3 days late. In the future, I would recommend actually taking a damn test before getting into this fight with your SO. Take some time to breathe, and mull over your options in your head.

- Pregnant or not, you need talk to your significant other. About a *LOT.* Are you financially stable enough for a child? He may be coming off as insensitive, but his reasons for not wanting a child could be valid. Are you willing to raise a child alone? Are you willing to try other forms of birth control? Is he willing to be more attentive regarding the consequences of his actions? Are you willing to take responsibility for yours?

You need to discuss this with him regardless of what the test reveals.

Maybe he IS okay with having a child - just not right now.

Since he neglected to cover his bases and put a condom on, she's stuck holding the bag. It seems like she's already made her choice and that's good.

My parents just act as if I'm a disappointment to them. Even though I have 3 siblings and I'm the only one to go to university.

The first guy ended up nearly sexually assaulting me and couldn't promise he wouldn't do the same again and sounded like a psycho when he said he doesn't know what he's doing sometimes. 

The most recent guy dumped me and one of the reasons he gave was because i'm curvy, not skinny. Having lost 2 stone and now being a healthy weight, I feel really crappy. He said he didn't have a type, but then it turned out that he likes skinny women. So pretty much dumped me to find someone skinnier and taller.

As for the two guys, they're really just assholes. Who you are is not the problem; if anything, you settled for them because you needed to feel someone else's interest. We accept the love we think we deserve. It's not your fault they're idiots. The way they treated you is **not** your fault. Nothing would justify treating you like they did.

And you should consider reporting that assault.

But what do your parents *do*? For years I felt like my mom was disappointed in me until I realized that we didn't understand one another, that she couldn't see where I was going. She has the kind of best friend relationship with my sister, and I felt like I was nothing compared to it, until I realized that they're just more compatible, personality-wise.

It's rather dodgey as to whether what happened was illegal or not. It was still traumatising and has made me scared of similar things happening in the future.

You're being vague at best. Chances are, you're projecting your disappointment on them. The first and worst person to put you down is yourself, because no matter what other people say, what you keep from them is repeated in your head over and over again. They all probably care a lot less about it all than you do and than you think. Whatever you decide to do, if you do it for other people's eyes and approbation, you'll always end up disappointed. Not because you won't get it, but because it'll never be good enough.

No one is going to help you stand up if you're trying to drag yourself back down.

maybe you should tell him that although you aren't very angry at the sex, that you don't agree with how he initiated it. tell him that you feel like he took advantage of you, and that he shouldn't do that. 

as for the sex. there is no good reason you should feel ashamed of liking sex while drinking. that is pretty normal. be aware that this happens a lot more than people like to admit, and that you also don't have to admit it if you feel like it might harm your social reputation or have negative impacts. it is what it is. you know what happened, you know that you are not a bad person. but there isn't a good reason that anyone else should have the right to know about your personal life.

I think you would have a lot of trouble making a case against him, and I've personally seen the justice system fail because the whole ""thing"" is he said she said. BUT. If that's what you need to heal then do it!

I am also a survivor who let my assaulter get away. So maybe hearing my experience with guilt will help you. I have always struggled with guilt, but it's much more complex than just ""Who else has he hurt?"" It's, ""How could I be so stupid for trusting him? Now I've ruined the friendship between my family and this man. Why didn't I tell my family so they could protect themselves? ...so his family could protect themselves? Why did I have to talk that way? Why did I have to walk that way? Why did I dress that way?"" Even now I'll find myself feeling guilty or shameful when something bad happens. ""It must have been how I was acting. If I wasn't so (characteristic) that person wouldn't have done that thing to me."" I wish that I could tell you that tomorrow you'll wake up and won't feel guilty, but it's highly unlikely that will be true for you. You'll probably feel guilty forever.

 My guilt will start to fade away into the elevator music of my mind. I'll think to myself, ""I am beautiful and strong and proud!"" Then someone will be an ass (man or woman or child or animal or rock) and I blame myself. I blame myself for giving them a reason to act. I feel guilty and ashamed. I shouldn't have worn that skirt, I shouldn't have been so nice, I should have been more aware. I should have worn the ugliest outfit, stopped bathing, acted like an emotionless robot, and sat in a corner all day. In my head I created a tempting treat by being me (dangling a carrot in front of the horse), and I feel guilty for catching that asshole in my trap. 

What the hell is that, right? WTF BRAIN!? Are you with me or against me? Anyways, I have to talk myself down when I start blaming myself or feeling guilty. I say ""talk myself down"" because I always picture Guilty Sg1324 on the ledge of a very high building getting ready to nose dive into a sidewalk of detachment and binge ice cream. The process involves 1. reminding myself that I can only control myself and not others 2. living in guilt and shame prevents me from living in the present moment where I can experience happiness and love 3. continuous nose dives will increase levels of guilt and shame due to lower levels of relationship maintenance and 4. mindless ice cream binge eating isn't good for me. Talking myself down really helps to snap myself back to the present where I can experience all the good things, and there are a lot of good things to experience.

However, you totally shouldn't have to put up with missing 2 days of school every time you're on (and when you're older, that could be a big issue if you're missing work regularly).

That pretty much fixed everything. This was when I was 17, I think. Like, talk to your doctor to see if that would be okay for you, because that's honestly what I'd recommend.

20140524020712,2XC_hymen_throwaway,"I don't really think there's anything wrong with it per se. It's not imperforate or cribriform or anything. All hymens stretch out eventually, and I just think mine needs a little extra help.",1,t3_26cxzo
20140524094201,bitchyoumustbejoking,"Ok - so a lot of people have written about the fact that the hymen stretches. I'd like to both re-iterate this and point out that this doesn't have to be done in one go!

I'd also like to say you have the right end of the stick here - there's some weird myth that for some reason sex with a man is the best thing to do to get rid of that pesky hymen! Seems a woman has no right to be all up in her junk before a man! I don't really know why it's massively expected for a possibly painful experience to be one that a woman is expected to share - let's face it, first times are rarely all they're cracked up to be and an intact and/or difficult hymen won't help the matter (I should know).

So let's start with your choice of toy - most rabbit vibrators tend to be modelled (although not realistically) on the male member. If g-spot stimulation is what you want there are a brilliant range of g-spot vibrators that will help in that area and tend to have much less girth to them. You might want to think about starting small and slowly working up to something larger (I'm talking about weeks in the middle here - not hours). Once you feel like you are used to a certain size of toy - treat yourself to a new one! Don't feel like you have to push past the pain or make yourself bleed in order for your hymen to stop troubling you. You essentially have 'all the time in the world'.

Lastly I would recommend above all this to get your hands involved. These things are free to you and tend to have about five useful masturbation tools on the end of them. You are already expecting some trouble from your hymen so it could be that in your first session it might be enough to go from nothing to one to possibly two fingers. Again if g-spot stimulation is your aim you are going to find it much easier with your fingers as the g-spot tends to have a rough, ridged texture to it. You might not have much luck 'going in blind' with a toy. 

Lot's of women seem to be slightly afraid of touching themselves and I feel like we've been led to see our bits as a slightly icky thing. Don't hold back and get to know your body!",6,t3_26cxzo
20140524161757,EasyBriesyCheesiful,"This is probably the best advice here so far.  As bitchyoumustbejoking said, you really don't have to rush anything.  Take the time to explore and do what feels good.  It may take a little time to really get into g-spot stuff (but there are other fun places).  There are also vaginal toys made for dilation that may help (especially in combo).  They often come in sets with a range of sizes.  You don't really have to power through anything, it could/should stretch with time, instead of tearing. 

If there are more major issues, you may want to see a doctor :  if it's not that serious they may just advise patient, self-exploration.  If it is more major, you may want to hold off for surgery or you may risk more substantial injury than some tearing.

I went the route that you're (OP) going over time (probably a few years, actually - but I didn't actually know about the g-spot or anything until I was already experimenting there).  I played around with a small peanut vibe and my fingers for a long time before getting other fun stuff to move onto.

I also agree with another of BYMBJ's points - a lot of people do seem to think that sex with a man is the first sexual act a woman should do.  Female masturbation is a weirdly touchy subject.  Whatever I had of a hymen was long gone before my first experience with a guy - and he even said I was lying about being a virgin (no pain, no blood, I wanted/needed clitoral stimulation and knew what I liked) when I'd really only said that I'd never been with anyone.  He was one of those guy's hoping to take advantage of my inexperience.",2,t3_26cxzo

I have never been able to be penetrated or use tampons either and I tried to insert a small vibrator while I was drunk thinking that I would be more ""relaxed"" and for me it just sucked.  

You may also want to consider looking into medical dilators that trans* women use after they have bottom surgery or intended for vaginismus.  If you go see a gyno and talk to them about it, you may even be able to get a prescription for them.  That would probably be a more comfortable way to stretch things because they start with much small sizes and increase in size gradually.",3,t3_26cxzo

20140814181314,11strangecharm,"I have a microperforate hymen. Normal menstruation. Mine can barely stretch to accommodate a Qtip as guided by my gynecologist, and it hurt.

I mean, I have been masturbating basically daily since I was young, and raised to be unashamed of exploring my body as long as I do it alone, and never was able to get a finger in as a teenager.

Hymenal opening variation isn't quantized (at the macroscopic level anyway), so two people with relatively small hymenal openings compared to the average could have any of many incrementally different sizes from each other - one may have an overly difficult or impossible time stretching it out with dilators, while the other may have success.

In addition to the size of the opening, different hymens are of different thicknesses and elasticity. So yours may be elastic enough for success in gradually stretching, or it might not. Don't push through it if it hurts, though, because if you develop an association between vaginal insertion and pain, it can lead to vaginismus.",1,t3_26cxzo

My suggestion would be to definitely talk the issue because communication is a necessary in any relationship, but to offer the experience of having him give you a set time he will be back such as 2am and see if knowing when he is due to return allows you to fall asleep.

The idea is that a timeframe for expected noise and entrance might help to calm your subconscious and instincts for survival.

""The ultimate evil behind sexuality is the human female. They are the main instigators of sex. Theycontrol which men get it and which men don’t.

 Women are flawed creatures, and my mistreatment at their hands has made me realize this sad truth. There is something very twisted and wrong with the way their brains are wired. They think like beasts, and in truth, they are beasts. Women are incapable of having morals or thinking rationally. They are completely controlled by their depraved emotions and vile sexual impulses. Because of this, the men who do get to experience the pleasures of sex and the privilege of breeding are the men who women are sexually attracted to… the stupid, degenerate, obnoxious men. I have observed this all my life. The most beautiful of women choose to mate with the most brutal of men, instead of magnificent gentlemen like myself. Women should not have the right to choose who to mate and breed with. That decision should be made for them by rational men of intelligence. If women continue to have rights, they will only hinder the advancement of the human race by breeding with degenerate men and creating stupid, degenerate offspring. This will cause humanity to become even more depraved with each generation. Women have more power in human society than they deserve, all because of sex. There is no creature more evil and depraved than the human female.

Women are like a plague. They don’t deserve to have any rights. Their wickedness must be contained in order prevent future generations from falling to degeneracy. Women are vicious, evil, barbaric animals, and they need to be treated as such.""

20140525140308,you_rang,"I think I disagree with your terminology.  So I'm going to propose some more specific ones.

we shall define TRP as being a *philosophy* based on acceptance of a specific *interpretation* of an *underpinning* of various conglomerations of popular science.

Similarly, we will chop the manifesto into similar pieces.  We will attempt to use this common mapping of pieces to assess where they are similar, where they are different, and why they give everyone the heeby jeebies.

The *philosophy* is normative - it attempts to tell you how you should react to the *interpretation.*

The *interpretation* is a subjective reading of the the *underpinning*, which is generally regarded as descriptive and expository - it seeks to describe observed behavior and proposes explanations for why this occurs.

The earliest phrase from the quoted passage from the manifesto that seems to resonate with key text from ""core theory"" pieces is the bit about ""instigators"" or women having the ability to ""control which men"" get sex, etc.  It would appear that this is a vague reference to the idea of ""sexual selection,"" as espoused in various evolutionary psychology circles.  I will point to something popular science stuff like ""The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature"" as an example of the concept.  It's pretty easy to trace a progression from there.

component | TRP | creepy manifesto 
-|-|-
underpinning | pop sci evopsych stuff about sexual selection, usually cherrypicking of the ""humans [read: feeemales lulz] are biologically predisposed to like X"" variety | looks pretty similar.
interpretation | something about how these biologically predisposed preferences are immutable and that modern social norms mask this. Exploitation of these preferences = success, adherence to social norms = failure. | views these perceived preferences as a moral ill (word choices: ""beasts,"" ""vile impulses""). 
normative prescription | Change yourself to better exploit perceived evopsych profile of women | Eugenics


I think we're looking at a very embittered philosophy which can best be described as post-TRPism, or something. To me, it's very interesting that he had a lot of traffic on puahate.com.  Site is down, but google appears to think that it is primarily composed of people who are against PUA/Game/TRP-like stuff, largely from trying it and it ""not working"" or something. I would imagine that a lot of these people are going to reject the normative bits of their PUA/Game/TRP-like exposure, but that the vocabulary from the underpinnings espoused by PUA/Game/TRP-likes are probably going to leak into a lot of their post-PUA/Game/TRP thinking.

edits: frantic table editing attempts

edit2: just realized that I did not deliver on the promise to examine why both give varying levels of heeby jeebies.  Manifesto is pretty obvious - it's pretty much Hitler but towards women.

20140525151558,nocommentyet,"I completely agree that the divergence was in the prescription of how to deal with the world once you've swallowed the Pill. 

RP still rely on PUA tactics as a way to manage the hostile world of relationships and the natural battle of the sexes that they perceive. Rodgers found that Game didn't work for him so he rejected that solution, in fact, found it dangerously vulnerable. He spent a lot of time around incels who had a similar pessimistic and catastrophic outlook. I saw the same eugenics/rape camps idea on the Wizardchan forum for incels. 

But even though he argued for a different solution than Red Pillers do, I don't think they're that far apart. For one thing, he's a perfect embodiment of the [Dark Triad](http://illimitablemen.com/2013/11/17/understanding-the-dark-triad/) personality. RPers believe that getting as close to this personality as possible is the key to success, but the psychopathic triad element cannot be trained and may lead to extremes in those for whom it comes naturally. Like Rodgers who was a psychopath.

Both RPers and Rodgers believed that women are incapable of rational thinking and engage in constant attempts to wrest power from men. They both believe the key to this struggle lies in sexual dominance; women attempt to exert sexual dominance over men by rejecting the rightful status of the alpha who is owed sex on demand but because women are emotionally immature and think in a hamster wheel, men can naturally win this power struggle by being the alphas they evolved to be. RPers teach that women will fall in line and if every man swallowed the red pill the world would be as it should be. 

No there would be no rape camps or femicides - but not because RP philosophy has a problem with rape or the deaths of women. They don't care what happens to women and from what I've seen many of them use violence in their relationships and promote its usage. In their ideal world, women couldn't be raped because they would naturally submit, and there'd be no need to kill off the undesirable women because without feminism to give these women unwarranted power, they'd die off without breeding and take their faulty genes with them. In the meantime, there is no need for drastic measures to usher this new world along, because individual men can continue to run Game and spread the Red Pill. Evangelism and gaining control in their personal lives would be enough to change the world. A lot of fundamentalist religions operate this way.

But a psychopath with autism might struggle with the socially manipulative aspect of Game. He would miss all the cues needed to manipulate women into the casual sexual encounters that would prove his dominance to other men. Radical, more destructive approaches would appeal, and since he could not bring himself to follow anyone else's lead nor could he maintain emotional stability long enough to be a serial killer like a normal woman-hating psychopath he did this horrible thing.

As the Red Pill gains influence and spreads these ideas, women will suffer violence. It won't have to be mass shootings; rape and domestic violence are other ways to make a Red Pill world. ",9,t3_26e2tg

(Also see my comment below). In the past (and still today), people have emphasised women's roles in typically male-dominated industries as a way of correcting past wrongs/prejudice against women - e.g. check out [womeninmusic.com](http://www.womeninmusic.org/) (Women in Music is a dynamic group of individuals in music working together to support, cultivate and recognize the talents of women in our field). 

This is often a good way to make sure that minority groups (in this case, women), feel supported and validated in their chosen field or industry.

However, modern views of feminism seem to be that often it is better to NOT mention women explicitly because that it makes it seem 'not normal', and just highlights the difference between women and men in that industry.

For example, is it offensive to say that Rosa Parks was a black woman fighting for her rights during the Civil Rights movement? It identifies her as a member of a discriminated group fighting that discrimination. I don't think there is anything wrong there from a descriptive journalistic standpoint.   

EDIT: I also think it's important to note that describing Neko Case as a ""musician breaking the mold"" would be inaccurate.

now where was i going with this, we still view the male as a default 'human', even in science, and women as a variation on the default. so i don't know if 'men in music' just not carry as much baggage as 'women in music', or if we are just not used to hear it. ",10,t3_26dirq

20140524153834,Ribbing,"I agree and I think it's fairly obvious that men and women have different lived experiences.  There are myriad factors that create that difference and phrases like this can be one of them.  

Having said that, I question the benefit of becoming offended at a phrase like this.  It seems to me that if you want to be treated as equal then demanding that people alter their (already harmless) choice of words whenever there's an possibility for you to twist them into something negative is not really in line with equality.  

There are ""women in music""  and there are ""men in music"".  These are simple facts.  I think that if you raise a stink about something like this you're doing more to further the division between genders than you are to unifying them in equality since you're basically ensuring that ""men as default"" never dies by unnecessarily policing the language of others. ",9,t3_26dirq

Upon receiving the Mark Twain award for comedy, she said it would be nice to reach the place where being a woman was not noteworthy (the media was quick to point out that she was only the 3rd or 4th woman to have won the award). White male is the default and it would be nice if it wasn't but we're clearly not there yet. ",7,t3_26dirq

20140524165431,dalikin,"My understanding is that in the past (and still today), people have emphasised women's roles in typically male-dominated industries as a way of correcting past wrongs/prejudice against women - e.g. check out [womeninmusic.com](http://www.womeninmusic.org/) (Women in Music is a dynamic group of individuals in music working together to support, cultivate and recognize the talents of women in our field). This is often a good way to make sure that minority groups (in this case, women), feel supported and validated in their chosen field or industry.

However, modern views of feminism seem to be that often it is better to NOT mention women explicitly because that it makes it seem 'not normal', and just highlights the difference between women and men in that industry. So I think Playboy took the view that women in music should be celebrated by highlighting women in music (fair enough), while Neko Case took the view that women in music should be 'normalised' by not mentioning sex/gender (fair enough).",14,t3_26dirq
20140524171305,Ribbing,"That is my understanding as well,  but if we ran with Neko's position,  what would this mean?   Are we to never discuss men and women as being distinct?  That doesn't seem helpful and has the potential to just brush discrimination faced by both genders under the rug by giving us no way to discuss these issues.  

I don't think you can just pretend that men and women are exactly the same, especially when they aren't treated as such by society.  So being able to say ""women in x"" or ""men in x"" is frankly just really useful and,  at times,  necessary. 

You mentioned highlighting differences.   Don't you think that is what happens when you're allowed to say the phrase when men are the subject,  but are then ridiculed for doing so when the subject is women? ",0,t3_26dirq

""Women in X"" and ""men in X"" are both really useful terms, I agree. I think the question is: (when you have a minority group e.g. women) is this distinction the best way to correct/alleviate past issues such as lack of respect/representation for women in the industry? Maybe it is, but I think Neko's position is valid too - maybe with some industries/issues we are at the point where continuing to highlight women as a distinct sub-group in need of special attention, read: assistance (which I guess is the inference here) we are actually hindering their progress of being seen as just a normal part of that larger group.

So I agree with you. It's just interesting to think about the best way to promote equal representation/views of men and women (and everyone else) in particular industries, while also accepting and celebrating difference.",1,t3_26dirq

or

""you are the best in the field and a woman"" = you are good but you also happen to be a woman/left-handed/blue-eyed/asian/black/gay/etc

Oh, well, yeah, obviously. That's true for all clothes. You can return them though, in most places at least.

My point is that you have something to wear for now, but really, it's a good idea to try and make it better, because steel toes too loose is unsafe, no matter how you put it.

I often have a similar issue with clothes - I am a dude, but with disproportionately wide hips, and so often stores won't have something for my specific set of sizes. So I often have to order online, try, and return. It takes longer, and it sure as hell doesn't support local vendors... but it results in clothes that fit. Professional gear, of course, is that much more of an important issue.

As far as vendor size though... well, if the vendor doesn't think about you (and they don't, if the steel toes they sell are for men only), why should you think about them?",4,t3_26dxds

And, well, 3 years without accident doesn't mean the equipment is safe. Equipment functioning correctly *in* an accident is what means it's safe. But if you are saying yours is safe, then there is no issue, again.

My suggestion (it was only a suggestion) was more for future orders, or if you wanted to replace the ones you already got (because you are right, it could take a bit of time, if the first pair doesn't fit, or shipping is lengthy). If you don't think that's necessary, then obviously it's irrelevant.

> And the online returns process is lengthy...

Eh... not really? I mean, the return itself is basically ""fill out form, get a mailing label, package, send."" The refund can take a bit longer, because they have to receive and process it first.

* (She is a woman), she doesn't know how (steel toed) boots work

* (She is a woman), she doesn't know how to shop online

* (She is a woman), she doesn't know how to choose equipment or judge how safe or fit for her it is

or anything like that, then either I miscommunicated, or you misread my words. I did not say, mean or imply, any of the above, or anything similar, and I think you thought that I did.

The purpose of everything I was saying was simply to:

* Suggest another avenue for acquiring clothes and equipment: no matter how you put it, even now, in 2014, people buy clothes online a lot less than I think is warranted, and settle for worse choices that are in store. And I do not know why this is; part of the issue, though, I think is that people think that it's a huge pain to return something, or replace it, etc. - and I thought this as well before trying this - but this was simply not the case. So I guess I was trying to raise awareness.

* (Prior to your qualification that with thicker sox they fit snugly): Pointing out the fact that a loosely-fitting shoe can be very dangerous in an industrial setting. And it's not nearly a simple a concept as the notion of a steel toe protecting the toe: it's actually the *twist* of the loosely fitting shoe about the crus of the leg that can be really damaging. I was peripherally involved in the finite element analysis of exactly that thing happening, for a court case - and there is a reason that the court case went to a jury trial. And it's not a question of understanding or not understanding something you work with every day - hell, I've worn steel toes for over a decade in the shops - prior to encountering this court case and recognizing the vectors of force application on the leg that I did not ever think about when choosing boots (or other equipment).

I was in a hurry, but also needy, so I figured I'd try the pad side quick. I put in another quarter and turned the knob. A pad tried to come out, but it was so big I had to reach my hand up in the machine and help it the rest of the way out.

What I had been dispensed was the largest pad I'd ever seen at the time. (Now that I've had a baby, I would say it was just about as large as a maternity pad.) Only when I opened this pad, there was no adhesive lining; it came with a packet of bobby pins. (And possibly the faint sound of banjos playing on the wind.)

I'm pretty sure I was the first person to use that machine in more than two decades. I hate those machines.",57,t3_26e63f

I asked about those machines in our building once, since I wondered if restocking them was on my list of things to do when I cleaned the bathroom, and was told the following, more or less:

""Those were a bad idea that are stuck around in just about every damn building like this in the country. They were broken into so much, the company who originally sold them went out of business. But it costs too much to rip them out and rebuild the wall. So, they just sit there. I don't think one of them's been restocked in decades, I can't imagine anyone taking it upon themselves.""

It's a weighted mechanism that is supposed to dispense the tampons but unless it's fully stocked doesn't typically have enough weight to operate correctly. When a machine has had a few removed (either from purchase or not fully stocked) it tends to jam because the bottom comes up slightly. Then a frustrated and desperate girl inserts a coin and tries to twist and can jam it worse or break the tiny pieces holding it together. It's horrible technology. 

Source: worked at a gym and had to fill the machines. It was always broken so I ended up putting a sign on it and stuck a large basket of tampons at the front desks to give away for free. Ended up removing the machine completely and did a lot of research into finding ones that actually work. Found one but it operates more like a pepsi machine and was crazy expensive. Also it was almost no cost to offer free tampons. You can buy a huge box of tampex brand (although cardboard) filled with around 2000 for about $100. 

Edit: ahh gee thanks :)

Edit 2: If you are in very desperate need you have better luck with the pad side. Pads weigh more thus the machine tends to work better (though still not good) for them. So if you can scrounge up 2 coins stick one in the tampon side first and then the other in the pad. ",8,t3_26e63f

If he truly wants to make it work, he will give you time to decide what you want to do.

It's okay to forgive him if you believe he is sorry he did it and is ready to start making amends. If you do decide to forgive him, remember that it has become a part of the past and should never be used as ammo in arguments.

20140524165810,Tesabella,"I'm going to make a harsh suggestion to you. I realize that you must love your mother an awful lot to have put yourself through this just to get what little love and attention she will give. Cancel your mother's visit. She's toxic for you. She's planted the seeds to a very serious health condition that you need to get professional treatment for. You need some time away from her, away from her grasp, away from the idea that you have to be perfect for her. And please, love, get help. You know this isn't normal and you probably know that you need it. 
Health isn't being thin. Health isn't being the girls in the magazines. Health is not losing as much weight as possible in order to please your mother who's driven you to illness. Health is being able to wake up every day with a body that doesn't ache, that isn't frail and worn, a body that can support itself with the sustenance you give it with no complaints. Health is being able to smile because you're happy with your body in its natural, homeostatic state. 

Recovery will not be easy, not without support, but we're here for you. Recovery will be long. You may relapse. It will go against everything your ED has convinced you to believe. It may cast you out of the favour of your mother forever. But it will be worth it. It will be worth the long, happy life you so deserve. And you have done nothing to deserve the shame of the woman who brought you into this world. You do not have to conform to her ideals. Maybe you know this, maybe your ED tells you that simply isn't true. And maybe you don't know that. But those things are okay. In time, with help, you will learn.

I hope that you choose to begin the long, arduous road to recovery. Your body begs it of you, and you will feel much better in time. You may want to consider even going beyond counselling and just start by going to rehab for ED sufferers. 

Best wishes and best of luck to you, whatever you decide to do. You can do whatever you set your mind to, but only if your body can support you too. ",17,t3_26e9qz

20140524191740,Rawrz3dg,"I can relate to this on a few levels. First, I suggest seeking help. Find a therapist, or even a new doctor. Eating disorders are dangerous at ALL sizes. Especially dangerous if they include purging. I have met many people in treatment that were on every side of the weight spectrum.
My mother used to make jarring comments about my weight (she had an ED). But once she learned what I was doing, they stopped. She denies ever making them, but at least they stopped. So if you're willing - tell your mother how you're struggling. 
ED's are hell to fight on your own. I've found I can't do it. Seeking help is a big step, but for many a necessary one.

I took SSRIs and drugs before and they never worked, and now I feel like a new woman. It's taken a LONG time to get here, but there is hope! PM me if you ever want to talk!",3,t3_26e9qz
20140524222731,era626,"I can totally understand where you're coming from, because I've faced some of the same issues though nowhere near as severe.  My advice?  Find a sport you love and play it.  You'll find yourself wanting to take care of your body--eating right so you have more energy, exercising so you improve, and making friends and having fun.  Now that I don't make a focus of weight loss, I find myself to be at my goal weight (~22 BMI and I have a lot more muscle than your average girl).

You might also want to consider getting help for your ED.  As someone else already said, disordered eating doesn't depend on weight.  I think anorexia does, but bulimia and EDNOS don't.  Find a different doctor/mental health professional.  Especially a doctor, because a lot of what you're going through doesn't sound normal regardless of how overweight you are!

One thing I did was just completely stop counting calories and listening to my body.  It took a bit to learn how to listen to when I was hungry/full, but my weight has stayed mostly the same for over 2.5 years now.  It's scary at first, but after a time you get used to it.  Focus on fresh, whole foods which taste better and are much more filling

Another thing is love yourself.  Accept yourself as more than just a number on the scale.  I personally don't care what a friend weighs, though if they're interested in getting more fit or losing weight, I'm happy to give them advice.  Focus on being a better person and measuring your self-worth in lots of categories.  

Also, don't compare yourself to others.  I, for example, love to run.  I prefer the track over the treadmill, but when I'm running, I'm doing it because I love it.  It's not to have a ""perfect body"" or anything like that.  Some of the girls you see might be athletes who need to do a workout, girls who are training for a marathon, or other goals.  Find out from a doctor what you can do (if your injuries are still bothering you) and start *slow*.  Honestly, when I work out, I'm paying attention to others only to save myself from bumping into them or getting in the way.  I don't care if you're walking on the treadmill or lifting small weights--I won't even notice.  Anyone who gives you grief is a jerk, anyways.  You'd be welcome to ask me to show you the ropes, which I'd probably be happy to do unless I had a limited amount of time and had to get my workout in quickly.",3,t3_26e9qz
20140524223403,la_gran_puta,"This is horrendously sad to me. I also have a family affected by eating disorders and have suffered from one myself in the past. I have been underweight several times because of it, and my family, friends and strangers have always commended me for it because underweight is the ideal and I look more conventionally ""attractive"" that way.
The mother daughter thing hits me especially hard because I have two little sisters (one of which also has an ED and is currently in a binge/purge cycle and has been anorexic in the past). Meanwhile, I am the heaviest I have ever been, close to giving birth to my own daughter. I know the guilt and unbearable emotions that come with eating disordered family relationships. It appears that your mother is inseparable from your ED in your life. She probably has an eating disorder as well. She did what she could to protect you (like my mother did) but her efforts were misguided and they harmed you. The disease that we suffer from is referred to by some as 'culture bound' meaning that it is caused by the society we live in. Something that has worked well for me in my recovery (no binging, no purging or denying myself sustenance for over 3 years now) is understanding what I went through in a politically conscious way, understanding the role of gender, race, class, and other manifestations of oppression in the development of this problem. I now see these behaviors and thoughts of ways to distract me from my real goals, and my real enemies. I don't know if that helps but I hope there's something you can get out of my comment.

Let them see what you've just said to us. No mother should bring their child up counting calories, the mothers themselves in that situation probably have mental issues with food. You bring your child up on what's healthy, reasonable portions and some sport for exercise a few times a week with friends. You want them to be healthy, not brought up as obsessed with eating disorders, with a drastically reduced life span. Take what you've written to a doctor now and as much as you love your mum I would just tell her you're not well and can't cope with seeing her right now.

That was a great read and I can relate to so much of what she went through, from being induced at 2 weeks past my due date and being forced to wither in pain for 29 hours to  how I felt about breast feeding in public.

20140524163002,not_just_amwac,"Same. I got induced for high blood pressure at 39 weeks. Got swelling on my cervix plus a dropping heart rate for my son, and I agreed to a C-section.  
  
Up to then, the staff at the hospital were great.  
  
After his birth, I could not, for love nor money, get him to feed. Stating that I was having issues resulted in ""just keep trying"". With the exception of a night nurse who was simply wonderful.  
  
Asking for formula at the hospital, though... well, you'd think I was trying to feed him poison. I was told that whatever I could express would be enough (yep... 0.1ml is *totally* enough!), and then had to sign a form to state that I knew it increased the chances of obesity, diabetes etc etc etc. I felt like shit.  
  
It was only my last night there that the night nurse I mentioned suggested he could have a tongue tie (he did. A severe one). She also asked if I'd like a breast pump. Suddenly I could get a whole lot more milk for my boy that just didn't happen when expressing by hand.  
  
We bought a pump on the way home from the hospital. For 3 or 4 weeks (which includes about a week after his tongue tie was cut), I would try to feed him on the breast, fail (usually in tears and with increasing frequency, screaming on my part), feed him a bottle, then sit attached to the pump for half an hour.  
   
I stopped to save my sanity. I wasn't getting a break, it was just a constant cycle that revolved around feeding. Once I stopped both trying to breastfeed and pump, I started to get back to being myself and actually enjoying spending time with my son.

20140524224116,ThePolemicist,"I couldn't empathize with the person who wrote the essay very much. First, she talks about her pregnancy and how she personally rewrote all of the restrictions and recommendations for pregnant women. I don't think everyone follows *every* restriction. There are too many! But to rewrite everything as if you're an expert seems a little weird. She went on to talk about how the doctors were wrong about delivery and the nurses were wrong about lactation. 

Second, she goes off on the concept of ""breast is best"" because it wasn't best for her. I support her decision, but she negated to mention or perhaps comprehend the fact that the breast is best for the baby, and that's where the phrase comes from. Promoting breastfeeding and trying to normalize it is *because* it's better for babies. I'm not saying every woman has to do it. In fact, someone as miserable as her probably shouldn't. But I would think she can at least try to understand that it's a best practice for babies.

As for the size of her breasts, I don't think that should matter. Whether a woman has small breasts or enormous breasts, breastfeeding in public can be awkward. When I was breastfeeding, my breasts were squeezed tight in my 28H bra. So, I know what it's like to feel like you have pornstar-sized breasts when you're breastfeeding. I also know what it's like to not want to breastfeed in public. I'm just confused as to why that was such an issue. Was she dining out at a lot of sit-down, fancy restaurants with her hungry newborn? I'm not saying new parents *can't* eat at a nice restaurant, but I can say from experience that new parents don't tend to get out very much! I wasn't in a situation where I had to breastfeed either of my kids in public except for a few, fairly rare occasions (like at an airport, for example, when I was traveling for an extended time).

It is not possible to encourage breastfeeding (which is a public health issue, regardless of what this blogger says) and simultaneously make women who choose not to breastfeed despite having a good milk supply feel good about their decisions. The doctors and nurses aren't insensitive jerks; they're going where the science points them.

So I'm just gonna go head and ask .she goes on about how her big tits make it hard for her to nurse in a comfortable way and she goes on about how it's really difficult for her to cover so much boob in public and that it makes her uncomfortable for strangers to see her exposed .
So my question is , did she ever mention anything about using a breast pump? I always pumped before going out.  Although there were times when I had fed my son recently that I couldn't pump much out. So at times like those I'd pack some formula. Yet otjet times my boobies just hirt so id whip up spme formula. With that being said my son didn't have formula daily and sometimes week's would go by before he would have anything other than my breastmilk. Btw that fact that my son wasn't unfamiliar to formula it helped tremendously 9 months later when it became time to ween him. 
I guess what I'm suggesting is that for any women who have the problem she does or just simple don't want to nurse in public.  Then I suggest a pump or allow that to be the time your child has formula. That's how i did it and my son is perfect.  We both received the benefits for breastfeeding and i never had to feel exposed in public. Btw the occasional formula had no side effects.

It's probably a difficult question to answer, but it's what you're going to have to answer to move forward. You did nothing wrong, so put your guilt aside and figure out whether or not you can really keep X as a friend after this.

If you don't, then that's easy. Stop talking to him and cut him out of your life. He may want an explanation, but you don't owe him one. If you want to talk to him and tell him how betraying your trust hurt you, that's on you to decide. Letting him know what you're feeling does not mean you have to forgive him.

If you do want to keep him as a friend, you need to make him understand why you're as hurt as you are. Not everyone sees a kiss as a violation of trust or personal space, but if you do, then he should respect that. Talk to him, bring along a neutral friend if you can't be alone with him, and try to be calm. Let him know his actions seriously hurt you, and that he needs to avoid doing that in the future.

Stop assuming the worse of everything. You are making your own facts about an evening you were not present at. I may have avoided the situation, sure. But I did not expect limits to be crossed. Should I always be accompagnied now, in case any random male decides now is the moment to confess his love? That's absurd.

I should have been more guarded, okay, I can handle that. But he should have shown respect and restraint.

Pros: 
*You know if it failed - Twice they have gotten lost in me. The first time I didn't realize until the next day when it fell in the toilet, clearly I had some really wasted sex the night before. The other time my partner just went in there and pulled it out. I used Plan B right away. Three times I've had condoms break, and again, took plan B. Considering how many times I've had sex - hundreds of times - I don't think that's too bad.
* They are are easy to use and obtain.
* Your partner can probably go a lot longer wearing one.
 
Cons:
* You have to remember them or buy more.
* They can be more expensive than the pill, depending on your condom preference and health insurance plan. Personally, I think you should be able to write off the cost of condoms on your taxes.
* You'll probably want to have some lube on hand. I don't find them particularly drying, but sometimes I do.
* I replace them after 15 minutes of fucking.

My partner and I get down on some good foreplay before penetration, so the actual fucking doesn't take a super long time. I like condoms. They're easy to use, obtain, and get rid of. They're easy to transport and unlike the pill, if you forget them you can just go into the nearest gas station and get some more.

Which is dumb and, as a society, should be talked about more. Sex doesn't make you an adult (God help us get away from calling games with blood and boobs ""mature"") any more than a car does or smoking or drinking or having a gun.",5,t3_26el4o
20140525113309,Tenens,"I'll offer my take on your comment instead of merely downvoting you.

>People who want to turn a conversation sexual in no time flat with a woman and haven't yet tried the approach of dating or being friends first are not the mentally healthy people who will be cured by a quick lay.

You're right to describe these people as ""not... people who will be cured by a quick lay,"" because *the only thing a quick lay cures is the desire for a quick lay.* I have multiple objections to the rest of this statement. 

I would assert that ""people who want to turn a conversation sexual in no time flat"" are merely broadcasting their intentions in an honest way. There are a variety of ways of doing this and they range pretty broadly in terms of tact, respectfulness, and explicitness. Of course, if the person in question is of sound mind and ethics, they will take whatever acceptance or rejection they receive at face value. Unfortunately this isn't always the case, and while I don't believe that is the majority, it's irrelevant to this discussion.

Secondly, ""the approach of dating or being friends first"" is one that works for some people, but not for others. Some people are too busy to date, or have no interest in it. Should they be forced to accept masturbation, abstinence, prostitution, or rape as their only means of sexual gratification? Of course not. The latter two of those options are far more damaging to individuals and society than ""promiscuity"". Regardless of your personal level of comfort with it, casual sex is something that some men and some women *are* interested in. For someone interested in casual sex to find a like-minded partner for the short or long-term, and have no interest in getting to know that partner on a less superficial level, the most honest and efficient way to do this is by broadcasting their sexuality. 

I doubt they will find much success, as even casual sexual relationships typically involve at least some sort of ""screening"" for certain personality traits, but the outcome is irrelevant to the fact that actions should be congruent to intentions. 

For people who *are* interested in dating or being friends first, it would be very stupid for them to sexualize conversations too early in the interaction, as that behavior is not congruent with their underlying intent. 

This leads me to the whole ""friend"" thing.

>All my boyfriends started out as friends, more or less. Maybe some made a move after being friends for only a few days, but they still waited. And people who tried to have sex with me during the first convo? They got nothing.

That is your personal experience. You are one person. The people who tried to have sex with you almost immediately were clearly looking for something different from what you were looking for. Better for both parties that they ""get nothing"", as you so tactfully put it. 

Which brings me to my next notion. If you're saying you personally prefer more ""get to know you"" before entering a sexual relationship, bravo. That's your preference and it's what works for you, but that isn't what works for everybody. Wouldn't it be incredibly disingenuous for someone who desires you sexually to approach you and attempt to *actually become your ""friend""*, all along concealing their ultimate intent? 

It seems to me that you're endorsing the behavior that leads to that ridiculous, dreadful, avoidable, and outdated phenomenon men call ""friend-zoning"" and women call ""exercising my right not to have sex with a creep who pretended to be my friend."" The *best possible* outcome of this behavior you're encouraging is that this man's sexual desire for you diminishes, he *actually becomes your friend*, and then you begin a mature and healthy romantic relationship based on mutual sexual interest, having evolved from that friendship. I would argue that this is rare.

Please note that I do not reject the notion of ""being friends first"" categorically, only when it does not reflect the *actual*, mutual interests of both parties. I want my friends to be my friends because they want to be my friend, not because they desire me as a sex object. I believe that when healthy romantic relationships evolve from friendship, they evolve from *actual friendship.* Not the sad, chilling interactions we see where one party is sexually or romantically interested in another party that doesn't reciprocate that interest. This is an unhealthy and undesirable situation for both parties.

>My point is that this fear of never having sex if you are friends with a girl is so ridiculous.

Here again, I am troubled by this assertion. I would argue that ""fear of never having sex"" is *always* ridiculous when it's directed at a single individual, because it is a result of the very entitlement we see and hate in the case of Eliot Rodger and, unfortunately, so many other men (and women to a lesser extent).

If I as a man am *afraid* of never having sex with a particular woman, I'm removing her sexual agency, if only in my own headspace. It implies that I feel threatened or harmed by the idea that she might decide she doesn't want to partake in a sexual relationship with me. This is entitlement, and it is not to be encouraged.

Worse yet is the specific case of this ""fear"" occurring ""if you are friends with a girl."" Perhaps I am misreading your point, but it seems to me that you are suggesting that being friends with a girl does not preclude a sexual relationship. If sexual interest comes about as a result of an established friendship, so be it. It should either be i) forgotten, ignored, or suppressed, so as to preserve the friendship, or ii) acted upon honestly and without entitlement, with openness to and respect for the other party's reciprocation or lack thereof. 

Once again, if you mean *not* to discourage people from disguising their sexual intentions with the ultimate goal of acting on them, you are implicitly *encouraging* deception and the formation of mutually dissatisfactory interpersonal relationships.

Of course, this all occurs on a continuum, and that continuum is the reason society has established channels (some more patriarchical than others) of finding the line between sexual and non-sexual relationships. I would argue that *when your ultimate cause is a sexual relationship, you should only attempt to ""get to know"" someone insofar as you are actually interested in getting to know them.* For some people, that standard is met upon a cursory glance and is acted upon as ""hi, I find you attractive, would you like to enter a sexual relationship"", and for others it isn't met until after several months or years of courtship. The majority of positive sexuality occurs somewhere in between the former, which at best establishes a relationship of mutual sexual objectification, and the latter, which is largely unrealistic by the standards of the past two or three generations.

tl;dr People shouldn't hide their intentions when entering interpersonal relationships, especially when these intentions are teleologically sexual.

20140525131911,Tenens,">What I meant with the guy in the OP is that he had a lot of problems that wouldn't be solved by sex. A lack of confidence that clearly wasn't just because of his lack of experience but because he was constantly comparing himself to other men, a lack of empathy, a lack of social skills, mental health problems it seems unlikely he admitted to (I didn't read everything about him, a lot of it was too cringey for me to finish. And clearly mentally ill. I wonder what he was diangosed as.), ect. There is another guy in this thread who thought that this situation wouldn't have happened if the guy had been laid. To me this clearly isn't true.

Check check check check check. While I believe a pityfuck would probably have delayed his act of violence, we can really never know. Hell, he may have ended up strangling any woman who got that intimate with him - it's very hard to tell either way, and certainly presumptive to say ""if he'd lost his virginity he wouldn't have done this."" It definitely wouldn't have fixed his underlying issues with self-esteem and external values. There's a lot of literature I would have recommended him if I'd known him.

For the record, my understanding is that he was diagnosed with Asperger's, which doesn't at all preclude someone from a normal life in our culture, but which can come with issues w/r/t empathy and social skills. IANAP, but I'd speculate that he'd have scored pretty high on whatever measures we use to diagnose narcissistic personality disorder.

>My other point is that I personally (yes my personal opinion, though I stated it like fact in my post, which is why I deleted it), feel like someone who is constantly rejected by women (which the guy in the OP wasn't. According to users in this sub he never approached women, though it wasn't mentioned in the article) should at least try the friend approach. I mean really try it. I am not saying ""suppress your desires"" or ""lie and pretend to want to be friends than drop her after you get poontang."" I mean actually try to give it a go at a relationship and see if you like it. Yes, this isn't possible for everyone. Not everyone is in a position in life where they can be in a relationship.

I'm not opposed to the friend approach, if the man is capable of divorcing that pursuit from his sexual desire for the woman. In my post, I tried to allude to this using the words ""ultimate"" and ""teleological"". There are many women I consider platonic friends, but who I would probably be attracted to if I happened to encounter as them as a stranger in a bar or park or what have you. These women are physically attractive, but they're my friends. I don't see them that way, at least not for myself.

I honestly think everyone should at least experiment with interactions with their preferred sex on each level: platonic, purely sexual, and highly romantic. I would argue, though, that someone who is ""constantly rejected by women"" probably has enough evidence to conclude that some self-evaluation and self-improvement is needed before pursuing a relationship. This could be as simple as using different tonality or as complex as spending a year reading new books, exercising, and trying new things.

>For that matter, I don't really believe in the ""friend zoned"" idea of a girl not knowing a guy is attracted to her and putting him in the friend zone and never considering as a date. Or at least, not on women's part. I personally think that, bar rare exceptions, if a girl has friend zoned a guy she considers him a friend. Trying to say ""how dare she, I should always have a chance,"" is entitled and arrogant and diminishes her will, as you pointed out. If you think the girl doesn't know you are interested in her then make a move. If she responds with something like ""we are such great friends!"" then a lot of time she isn't oblivious but is trying to reject you in a nice way. Or she is just incredibly naive and oblivious, which admittedly there are lots of girls like that.

I agree with all of this. With the exception of a few individuals who I'll speculate have some serious empathy or self-worth issues (and maybe some who are just afraid of confrontation) people don't intentionally lead people on or torture them. I agree that most girls, here, would probably try to drop subtle hints like ""you're a great friend"". I believe this is a terrible way to approach this for a couple of reasons. From personal experience, the average guy isn't great with subtlety in social situations. This is especially true of the kinds of guys we're talking about here. Of course, our cohort tends to assume rejection anyway. 

I find that the psychology of the ""friend zone"" situation (just using the phrase gives me a headache) dictates that the highly invested individual will interpret the available ""signals"" in such a way that maintains ambiguity of his ""chances"" - never becoming so discouraged as to give up, but never quite becoming so encouraged as to logically necessitate the sort of ""confession"" we all find cute in movies but cringey in real life. ^This is why I believe men should not watch John Hughes films until full sexual and emotional maturity.

Truly, the only way either party ""wins"" in this situation is to escape it.

>>If I as a man am afraid of never having sex with a particular woman, I'm removing her sexual agency, if only in my own headspace.

>I don't really understand what you mean here. If I like someone I worry/fear they won't find me attractive or won't like me.

Perhaps I misread your post, and I can certainly see the ambiguity in my statement. The worries you've indicated here are nearly universal: people fear rejection because it provides evidence (superficially) that there is something wrong with them. That's a normal, perhaps even healthy fear, rooted in the desire to be desired or appreciated. The fear I was talking about is not the fear of rejection, but a more specific, sinister one, rooted in the desire to possess: the fear that if I'm that girl's friend, she won't let me fuck her. For the purpose of this discussion, I treat this as a separate fear, independent of the desire to be desired or appreciated. I believe the entitlement behind it is (now) evident. Of course, these motivations are harder to separate in real life, because they're almost universally co-incident to some extent. I think everyone knows what it's like to feel isolated, and everyone knows what it's like to crave power or sexual satisfaction. Both feelings are fundamentally human, but only one of them is at play in rape culture.",1,t3_26el4o

And that's what closet-feminists (is that an appropriate term?) are repelled by and view the (straw) feminist as.

Personally, as a man, I find unshaven armpits fine. I don't know anyone who really has a problem with unshaven armpits. If they do have some kind of problem, its just that shaven armpits make for a smoother body (for both men and women) which is obviously easier during intercourse, from which the ""beauty standard"" arose in the past, against which radfems are ""liberating themselves from"". But in attraction to personality, the armpit is almost universally ignored in my experience and that of my acquaintances/friends/family.

In extremes you need to groom your chest hair and back (because women want the right amount of hair) and then of course, if you're shorter than the woman you're just doomed. 



I'd also say that there's a lot of pressure to constantly check one's self and their behavior, as a man.

You attributed the view on violence only to the fact that women are seen as the weaker sex and associated it to the patriarchy (rightly so IMO).

I think in modern parlance I would be considered a ""hippy-dippy feminist"" or a ""Kumbaya feminist"".  I still consider that I'm a feminist but I now find myself wary of identifying as such in some circles as it has become such a loaded term and that saddens me. In some circles it seems I have to prove that I at least tolerate the hatred of men before I can be considered a feminist.  And that's assuming that men are allowed to be feminists as some quarters forbid that too (I think a silent ally is allowed).  

As I write this I'm already wincing imaging responses to the above paragraph that could include, ""Oh the irony of a man complaining about being silenced"", ""typical entitled man thinking feminism is about men"", ""you don't get a cookie for being a human being"", ""tone policing"", and so on.

On the positive side, at least the rad-fems are pushing the agenda I guess. Maybe you sometimes need extremist/fringe views to move the conversation on.  There are plenty of examples of more moderate feminism getting press too (in the UK at least).

Abortion is becoming *more* difficult, not less, to obtain in an alarming portion of the US; political support for social nets and affordable medical care for families has declined; throughout many parts of the developing world women are still held back and often not even allowed an education, much less the opportunity to earn a living.

Anyone who thinks feminism has done it's job vis-a-vis gender equality and is no longer relevant is only looking in their own neighborhood, and not at the wider world we all live in.

Edit: I didn't really finish my thought. Part of gender equality is simply respect for other individuals. There are always going to be those who are 'creepers'; but making it less socially acceptable is the only way to get it toned down. 

There's a certain amount of 'group think' in play when men think it's ok to leer at women in public as if those women were objects and not other human beings. The same social force that is working to make childhood bullying unacceptable should also make public disrespect by adults equally unacceptable.

You do what you want with your armpits, I'll do what I want with mine, and we'll all have a good time! 

That's feminism: the freedom to choose what you want.

Universal. Everyone is taught this from the 1st grade on. There is nothing necessarily wrong with this, though.


Everything you wrote is weird to me, but I guess it is because you are so young. I'm a feminist, but in an opposite way. I think women shouldn't ""get"" but that they should ""step up to the plate."" For example, I think it is good that women are now more in the front lines in war, and I think they should die horrible grizzly, painful,  lonely, death, just like men do. Why shouldn't they? That is something women have a duty to do. I think a shit-ton more women (50%) should quit whining and ask men out and pay. The bullshit line is that whoever asks, pays. That is bullshit because women shirk their duty to ask men out. I think 50% of women should ask men to get married. I think 50% of women should be the primary breadwinners with stay-at-home dads who, if there is a divorce, the woman moves out and pays child support and alimony and sees the kid once or twice per week. Currently, most women who make good money will only date and marry men who make the same or more. This must stop. Women need to take STEM and graduate into it and not say how difficult it is. Look to Madam Curie as a role-model on how to do it, and she did it over 100 years ago with much more entrenched sexism. And she won TWO Nobel Prizes. TWO. She, I admire to the ends of the earth.

My sister, jesus fucking christ, has done exactly what she wants in life and gives not two fucking fucks about what other's think. She doesn't think about what others think. I admire my sister. She does what most women, and men, never do.

In terms of manipulating people, hostility is a very useful tool.

Some of the research I'm currently working in psychology centers around how people can start at one side of a spectrum of views and be pulled to the other side by the sheer abundance and ridiculousness of it.

Example:

Say you have some politically debatable point. On one side are some moderate liberals and the other some extremist conservatives. The liberals trying to be reasonable don't make as extreme statements as the conservatives. What ends up happening is someone who started in the middle, or even left of the middle will end up shifting their views to the right, without even knowing it's happening. In terms of analogy, it would be like averaging the distance between the two points on the spectrum, which would cause the new point of view to fall more right of center due to the ""weight"" of the extreme conservative view.",6,t3_26eixk

That part of it is truly science by any definition. This isn't Freud sitting on his couch snorting cocaine telling you how all your problems are because of your sexual attraction to your mother/father.

In experimental psychology, you are testing independent (manipulated) and dependent (measured) variables. Basically, I change variable X and a resulting change in variable Y is noted. Where it gets sticky is determining causality versus correlation. Correlative results just mean X happens at a related frequency to Y. Whereas, casual results mean that X causes Y to happen.

In the research I was discussing, they were causal results because they made measurements in pre- and post-tests and determine a temporal order to the results. Basically, the participants views were tested, then manipulated, then tested again to show a difference between the two. What's more is these studies were replicated by multiple experimenters showing the same results. This lowers the possibility of a [Type I error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors), essentially the chance you falsely concluded there was an effect when there actually wasn't. Put another way, the mistake a jury makes when they send an innocent man to jail. All empirical research calculates the probability of making this type of error with the margins usually being 1-5%, meaning you are at least 95% positive of the result you found. Some even exceed that margin to only 0.1% or lower of being incorrect.

I think the whole idea of being okay with being single, still puts most of the emphasis of your happiness on relationship status. Which feels more like a salve than a fix.

When I was single, I desperately wanted to make myself feel okay with it. But the truth for me was, focusing on being single made me feel worse, like I was masking my feelings. So I stopped thinking about relationships and focused on me. I decided to turn myself into the person I would want to date.

As a part of that, I set goals for myself. I went to the gym, I went back to school, I hung out with friends more. None of this was to make me feel better about being single, but to make me feel better about being me. It took some time, and in that time, I went from chronically single to a serial monogamist. I went into relationships with no expectations, because I was still working on myself and the success of that relationship had no bearing on my life. On the downside, I tended to ignore early red flags and let relationships continue further than they should have, but every relationship was a learning experience.

Now, I'm dating someone I love more than anyone I've ever been with. It's an exciting feeling that I have never felt before. But getting here took years. Sometimes it sucked, but it was worth the journey. I went from looking in the mirror and thinking ""Who would want to date me?"" to thinking ""Good god who WOULDN'T want to date this?!""

Without a band size it doesn't mean much in terms of the actual volume of the breasts, but for reference [these are all properly-fitted DD cups](http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search/cup/DD/) on various band sizes (bust measurement 5"" larger than underbust). If you look proportionally much bigger than those women then it's very likely there's a better size for you. It's also very common to have different size breasts, and generally the advice is to fit the larger one properly and then use an insert in the cup with the smaller one to balance them out if you prefer.

Of course, if you've measured and are definitely wearing the best size for you, then ignore that part!

The scars are like an anchor shape - a 'smile' underneath the boob, a vertical line from the center bottom up to the areola, and a circle around the areola (they reduced the size of my large areola's, too, to make them proportional with my boobs). Bonus: all the hair follicles from around my areolas were removed, so I never have nipple hairs.

First, people *love* to talk about themselves. Ask them questions if you feel like you're running out of things to say. Chances are, they'll have something at least mildly interesting to contribute to the conversation. Also, make sure your questions warrant more than a yes/no answer. 

Second, actively listen. Keep eye contact, make the appropriate noises (""Oh"" or ""Yeah, I know what you mean"", etc.) at the right time. Listen for things you might have in common or things you have an opinion about. 

Third, take up a hobby. It could be painting, karate, cooking, drawing, model planes, gaming, movies, whatever. The more time you spend doing things for yourself, the more interesting you seem. Plus, hobbies are a great way to meet new people and learn new things.

I've been through depression and was medicated, and because I have grown up with a mentally ill parent, I wasn't afraid to talk about my experience openly; as a result, so many of my friends and relatives ""came out"" to me as having their own experiences with psychiatric medication, even I was surprised.

The fact is that mentally ill people are more *at risk*. That's not a judgment of them, it's a fact. And there are certain behaviors which can be extra triggering or dangerous. It's not a great idea for someone with suicidal ideation to own a lot of firearms. It's not a great idea for a recovering alcoholic to work in a liquor store.

(My psych says that my depression was exacerbated, if not caused, by PTSD I got from growing up with a mentally ill parent.) I think part of the conversation about mental illness needs to center on the fact that it affects everyone, not just the sufferer, and that we all need to face it squarely and try to do something about it together. Another tempting delusion is to believe that since *I* don't have mental illness, someone else's mental illness is not my problem. But mental illness affects everyone.

His entitlement in the manifesto is extreme. He hates both men and females. He chose a small restaurant for his 21st birthday so that he wouldn't have to look at ""all the attractive, happy couples"". 
Damn, he even hated Alexander Ludwig at an event for having a beautiful blonde on his arm. 


He hated men because he envied them. He hated women because he felt entitled to them.



> The ultimate evil behind sexuality is the human female. They are the main instigators of sex. They
control which men get it and which men don’t.
 Women are flawed creatures, and my mistreatment at their hands has made me realize this sad truth. There is something very twisted and wrong with the way their brains are wired. They think like beasts, and in truth, they
are
beasts. Women are incapable of having morals or thinking rationally. They are completely controlled by their depraved emotions and vile sexual impulses. Because of this, the men who do get to experience the pleasures of sex and the privilege of breeding are the men who women are
sexually attracted to… the stupid, degenerate, obnoxious men. I have observed this all my life. The most beautiful of women choose to mate with the most brutal of men, instead of magnificent gentlemen like myself. Women should not have the right to choose who to mate and breed with. That decision should be made for them by rational men of intelligence. If women continue to have rights, they will only hinder the advancement of the human race by breeding with degenerate men and creating stupid, degenerate offspring. This will cause humanity to become even more depraved with each generation. Women have more power in human society than they deserve, all because of sex. There is no creature more evil and depraved than the human female.
Women are like a plague. They don’t deserve to have any right
s. Their wickedness must be contained in order prevent future generations from falling to degeneracy. Women are vicious, evil, barbaric animals, and they need to be treated as such.

Just.. *man*...


> The first strike against women will be to quarantine all of them in concentration camps. At these camps, the vast majority of the female population will be deliberately starved to death. That would be an efficient and fitting way to kill them all off. I would take great pleasure and satisfaction in condemning every single woman on earth to starve to death. I would have an enormous tower built just for myself, where I can oversee the entire concentration camp and gleefully watch them all die.
If I can’t have them, no one will, I’d imagine thinking to myself as I oversee this. Women represent everything
that is unfair with this world, and in order to make the world a fair place, they must all be eradicated. A few women would be spared, however, for the sake of reproduction. These women would be kept and bred in secret labs. There, they will be artificially inseminated with sperm samples in order to produce offspring. Their depraved nature will slowly be bred out of them in time.

20140526001246,SunriseSurprise,"I might have a little bit of meaningful perspective on this. I'm a guy and while not officially diagnosed with Asperger's, am 95% sure I've got it (a vast majority of the symptoms fit me and it pretty well explains my life). Rodger apparently had Asperger's too, and at least from what he said about his life, I do believe that. He has a whole host of other crap though I can assure you, as not having been kissed til 22 is likely due to Asperger's (will explain further) and wanting to ""make them pay"" and actually killing people is completely different.

I've only seen the video and a couple things from his manifesto, but just from his video, a couple possibilities came to me:

- It really doesn't seem like he technically approached many girls or got to know many girls.

- I can imagine given the way he looks that he may have been flirted with and just never recognized it.

- He, like me, may have not had the greatest female role models when younger and may have felt like any sort of advances at all were ""creepy"" and you couldn't really tell a girl you were interested in her without more or less ruining her day. Seriously, I have a hard time giving a woman a compliment, because I feel like I'd be a creep for doing it. I know there's obviously a wrong creepy way of doing it, but could never shrug off the notion that any way is the wrong way. And yea, try going through life never telling a girl how pretty her eyes were or the like and see how far that gets you. He was 22 and never been kissed - I was almost 24 before I was, and it was even somewhat freak circumstances I could have never imagined. I'm 32 now and I'd say there's maybe 20-30% chance by now I may still have never been kissed with the way I was going.

The whole ""pursuing someone"" thing is next to impossible for someone with Asperger's. If someone's not pursuing you, you are probably not going on a date. You CAN work up the courage sometimes but it takes only one or two rejections to not be able to work up the courage for years.",2,t3_26futa

It does a great job of a potential victim of sexual assault and murder turning the table on a would be predator, which I could see the appeal. In creating the character of Hayley, we are given a character that understands sex, consent, sexual appeal, manipulation with the use of sex, and an all around understanding of human relations that often exceeds that of many adults. Statutory rape assumes that because of the age of the people involved in the sexual acts, they are not able to make an informed and reasonable act of consent. In that scenario, Hayley's character is not capable of being statutorily raped, and by proxy down plays the viability of statutory rape. I'm not say statutory is acceptable but saying that Hayley's character creates the image of young girls being capable of the autonomy to consent to sex there by bringing into question the point at which we age should play a role in what we consider rape.

TL;DR
Hardy Candy is an argument against statutory rape given the mentality and behavior of the character Hayley

Edit: If a person can behave and act in the way Hayley acts, we would also conclude that she is fully capable of consent regardless of the age difference between her and her sexual partner. ",-13,t3_26gk80

It adds insult to someone who was already insulted, and it doesn't help her for the future either, just hurts her.

> As soon as I hear swimsuits, I'd nope right out of there because that would hit an alarm I'm my head that something is not right.

So, we don't know the details of this situation well enough to be absolutely sure.  Maybe there was a context in which it made sense to shop for swimsuits.  More likely not, but we're not sure.  It's quite possible that this was a warning sign, and it's possible she missed it or ignored it.  Or maybe not; maybe she did something about it or prepared herself.  We don't have the full story.

If it was indeed the warning sign it looks like from the brief version of the story, and if indeed she either missed it or ignored it, then it would certainly be helpful to, as I said above, use this as a learning opportunity.  She's 14, and certainly still has some skills to develop.  But using this as a learning opportunity is not the same thing as saying ""she has some explaining to do"" or blaming her for acting badly.  She didn't do wrong, she just missed something that could've helped her avoid an unpleasant situation.  Blaming or shaming her for it would just make her life worse.

If you react to risks by beating people into never taking them, you spread paranoia that disadvantage people.  It's not the right approach, *especially* if you have a deep concern about your child's growth and development.  You'd want them to be confident and explore and make connections, and not feel like if they've been burned that means they should've avoided the world altogether because an occasional exploration might put them in contact with someone who'll act badly toward them.

Later, after she was caught and fired, she told me she never thought she'd do anything like that.  

If anything, that experience taught me that thinking you're a moral person with good boundaries isn't nearly enough. You have to mentally put yourself in the situation of being at rock bottom with nobody to help you, feeling as shitty and lonely and fallen apart as you have ever been, multiply that feeling times five, and then mentally simulate turning away explicit, ardent advances from nice looking, legally aged, seemingly emotionally mature people with top-of-the-scale social skills for the sole reason that they are enrolled in your school and you are responsible for creating a safe environment for them.

I have never met anyone who made a conscious decision to be the bad guy. They've all said some variant of, ""it just happened.""

1. He ran out the time he could have spent in custody.

Assuming he does care for you, he probably thought he was (rather bluntly, as evidently is his style) asking about the difficulties you were having, with all the intent in the world of being supportive. However, since you perceive these matters as _failings_, concerns sound just like criticisms.

This is a pretty typical when one is struggling with challenges and failing, particularly if depressed. It's so hard for people who aren't experiencing it to understand that what they think is being supportive is experienced as just the opposite. It makes it tough for everyone.

Definitely entitlement.

20140525192547,xcbsmith,"> He sees there lack of attraction to him as an injustice, and a crime

In general, he describes a view of the world framed by absurd envy, feeling it was an extreme injustice that overwhelmed his thoughts whenever he even _imagined_ people were having a better time than he was.

> He's talking about sex and attraction as if it is owed to him

It's a bit more complicated than that. He's got a perverse sense of how attraction and social interaction even work, and interprets men as being jerks on the basis of whether they are welcoming and kind to _him_, without any reference to how they treat anyone else; his never justifies the ""supreme gentleman"" label, despite plenty of feedback that acknowledgement that his behaviour is precisely the problem.

That's entitlement, definitely, but it does not seem to stem from his gender identity.

> he is owed sex and deserves sex in his life simply because he is a guy

Actually, he seems to think that a lot (most?) guys _aren't_ entitled to sex.  He also very early on -even before really entering adolescence- has become convinced that girls intrinsically hate him, will reject and hurt him on sight. That concept would be a shock to your typical entitled male (who will, _after the fact_, blame girls who reject them, but that stems from an initial assumption that they will do anything but).

His case for deserving sex seems to be primarily because of _The Secret_ (which he latched on too) style thinking: because he wanted it so bad; even this is poorly justified as he doesn't make a case for wanting it more than others...

In fact, given how much of the desire stems from fantastical thinking that if he had a girlfriend it would completely transform his social status, and his absurd efforts to get rich through the lottery in order to obtain a girlfriend, there's a credible case that even the entitlement about having a girlfriend is actually just the mechanics of how a larger entitlement, that has nothing to do with sex or gender, is fulfilled.

His primary target of hate is women because 'they control which men get sex and which men don't' - his whole attitude is about the fact that he is not getting what he deserves and is entitled to - which is relationships and sex from white women.

He does almost contradict his own views at times, writing 141 pages of vitriol will do that to you, I guess.

20140525200920,xcbsmith,"> His disdain for men appears to stem from his sense of entitlement to womans affections and subsequent hatred of them for not giving him what he wants.

There's another link in the chain in the reasoning though. He sees relationships as society's most important status symbol, which is why he feels entitled to them.

His feelings about women don't seem to suggest he deserves all women's affections. In fact he clearly expects women to dislike him and hurt him. He merely expects *a* woman's affections, and frequently speaks of frustration that men he deems far less worthy get affection and he does not.

> his whole attitude is about the fact that he is not getting what he deserves and is entitled to - which is relationships and sex from white women.

Oh, he thinks he's entitled to a lot more than that, and he admits that he focuses on that primarily because he has been universally rejected.

> Rodgers is half-white, but appears to only identify with that race

I can't imagine your basis for asserting that. At several points he describes himself as asian...

> Turns out, it's the majority of these cases.

I guess that depends on what you mean by ""these cases"". If you mean mass murders in the US, it sure isn't surprising that they are mostly young white males (guess who commits the majority of all violent crimes in the US?). As one would expect for such a broadly targeted attack, they do usually intend to be motivate to retaliate for real or perceived slights by a broad group of people, who they generally perceive as an ""other"" of some kind or another. So yeah, they tend to target the same groups that are generally found to be ""the other"" by everyone else in society, which sadly often divides along the lines of visible minorities.

I'm one really ugly guy but even I can find a really sweet girl. and it's because I don't over think it. Society puts too much focus on getting women. It slowly becomes a necessity to get women instead of just knowing and committing to one just because you find her a worthwhile individual.

These two mass murders both stem from having troubles finding a girl, if we ignore any mental problems (since most here are). 

I personally think it's not about them finding a girl but more so about them proving that they can get a girl. Once you want to prove to others that you can get girls it makes things harder for guys. Because they over think things. This might be subtle but it's true, because you become stifled. You can't think straight when talking to girls. There's just no connection because there's an ulterior motive. 

Once a guy learns that he just has to like the girl solely because the girl's a cool human being and not because of any other agenda things become smooth sailing. If things don't work out it's OK because you can always find another girl. no one's going to call you a loser because of it  and even if someone did you wouldn't care because you've got nothing to prove in the first place.

- Don't be angry at women, they aren't to be hated

- Guy's gf cheats on him, regrets it, tries to please him with sex to get back with him. He uses her for sex for a while before cutting her out of his life. I'm not saying this is good but there isn't a hint of turning a no into a yes. She offered sex to him to make up for her cheating, all consensual if a bit fucked up

- A post literally saying what I am: ""Definitely do not equate learning the tools to earn a girl's affection (from TRP or elsewhere) with believing you are inherently entitled to it. These are absolute opposites that are somehow being treated as identical in the media""

- A post discussing how that reddit front page post ""TIL that the happiest marriages are those where the wife is able to calm down quickly after arguments"" has generated no controversy, yet if it was posted on TRP it would be seen as an example of yet another disgusting red pill post

- Tips to maximise your social value

- The title of the next one is ""Manipulating women in the age of social media"". At first glance this seems to support you but reading the post all it says is that to manipulate women to sleep with you you have to dress well, get her friends to like you, and have an interesting image. A poorly chosen title, but if their version of manipulating women is to dress well then that's hardly a problem, no?

But really, it doesn't matter how you feel about it. Feelings are irrelevant. In most species behavior that results in fertile individuals avoiding reproduction is maladaptive in an evolutionary sense. When homosexuality or asexuality increases the spread of an individual's genes, it's adaptive. When it doesn't, it's not. In many species the young of earlier years don't reproduce and help raise the new young, like in wolves and many birds. Certainly ant and bee colonies are made up primarily of asexual individuals. In some species male-male bonds are not uncommon. In black swans a third of all broods exhibit extra-pair paternity. An estimated one-quarter of all pairings are homosexual, mostly between males. They steal nests, or form temporary threesomes with females to obtain eggs, driving away the female after she lays the eggs. More of their cygnets survive to adulthood than those of different-sex pairs, possibly due to their superior ability to defend large portions of land.

> When Penny writes ""The ideology behind these attacks - and there is ideology - is simple""

You missed what she wrote afterwards: 'Women owe men. Women, as a class, as a sex, owe men sex, love, attention, “adoration”, in Rodger’s words.'

Which is a gross oversimplification of his thinking. He clearly felt the *world* owed *him* many things, amongst that was ""adoration"" (and he pointed to his brother as ""one of the few people who treated me with adoration"", so it's not like he thought he was owed it by more than just women). He is more than clear that he feels most males are undeserving of what ""adoration"" they do get. He perceived female attention as a way of establishing a man's social standing (not the other way around), which if anything is anti-misogynist.

""we owe them respect and obedience, and our refusal to give it to them is to blame for their anger, their violence"" --given how he reacts to his parents divorce and various relationships around him, he is shockingly unperturbed by the lack of ""obedience/respect"" women show to other men.

""the conviction that men have been denied a birthright to easy power""... again, he shows no such conviction. It seems any man or woman he perceives as having had an easy time of it is underserving of it, and has hateful feelings about the injustice of the world giving to them and not him.

I think the sick ideas that Rodger had got a hold of, Red Pill-type ideas that we see expressed frequently online, are a perverted version of social conservatism.

Another interpretation of Penny's comments is that she's saying that there are a lot of men out there with views similar to Rodger's. Even if, as individuals, all they believe in is a 'patriarchy of one' then the consequence of many such beliefs existing results in a collective view that 'women owe men'.

We ought not to dismiss Rodger's document and videos as merely insane ramblings. I've not read the whole thing but I'm told by those who have that it is clear and lucid, not at all like the hallucinations of a schizophrenic. I know many people who suffer from a mental illness, depression, and yet they are absolutely as capable of rational thought as anyone else. I would never dream of dismissing anything they say on the basis that they are unwell. Rodger was said to be high functioning, he wasn't confined to an institution. It would be very wrong for us to place the blame for this on his Asperger's, though it may well have been a factor in his difficulties in forming close relationships with those around him. I suspect his appalling arrogance may have been more of a factor however.

What's so shocking about this is that many of his misogynistic statements echo, almost eerily so, statements made online within misogynistic parts of the Men's Rights Movement, 'manosphere' or pickup artist communities. There is a legitimate concern, not that they are all killers like Rodger or Sodini, but that lower level violence, especially sexual violence, is being fostered by the expression of such awful attitudes towards women.

To attribute this insane action to misogyny, to lack of gun control, pornography, capitalism, repressed homosexuality, white privilege, or athlete’s foot, really misses the point. There are elements of these things (and so many more) that describe the individual’s communications, mindset and his actions. To say that these are the cause rather than the symptoms is putting the cart before the horse. It seems to be satisfying to some/many, to whip out their bad person or pet issue template and fit it to the situation de jour, pat themselves on the back for a brilliant insight, clothe themselves in indigent outrage, and retreat into smug satisfaction knowing that they have it all figured out. Not so easy, pandering media speculation only makes it worse. 

One could argue back that “crazy” is a simple one word answer, but crazy is a label for a host of complicated, nuanced, individual specific, and continuous spectrum of behavioral disorders. Like cancer it is not one thing, but a bucket (more accurately a landfill), that includes people from Dahmer to your superstitious auntie who has to turn around three times before she washes her hands. The mind is the most complicated thing we know of, it can go south so quickly in so many ways that to attribute any one, two, or three things is an act of extreme hubris. We have category labels for an assortment of disorders, some easy to identify via measurable chemicals or response to specific stimuli, most lying along a spectrum, sharing attributes and not so easy to quantify. That is why “I know crazy people capable of rational thought” is largely an irrelevant statement (and poor logic). 

For the legal process we have innocent by reason of insanity as a threshold so that the village idiot who is incapable of understating the rules is not punished in the wrong manner (yes it is more complicated than that, but this is the gist). But the predator, the molester, the murderer is still often just fucking crazy. Maybe it is only my own interpretation, but in my book evil is crazy. To head off the nitpicking debaters I am not advocating therapy in lieu of punishment.

In the end (as lay persons) rather than constantly trying to understand and wallow in every detail of these horrific events and point the finger (your choice of which one) at a given section of society, or fit it to your pet peeve is, just let it be crazy; move along, there is really nothing to see. Allow our professionals to review the situation, propose corrective action and let us decide if we as a society want to pay for it or not. Understating your own limitations and biases is the first step to perceiving truth, it also helps to prevent unproductive mental masturbation. This pill will not make you skinny, this book will not make you rich, body wash will not make you irresistible, this prayer will not cure your gout.

It's an argument against the idea that all communication from anyone suffering any kind of a mental disorder can merely be dismissed as giving us no insight into their thought processes. I have had personal experiences that contradict this. That's perfectly logical. Rodger's 140-page document appears to have a consistency and rationality that is very different in character to the occasional random outbursts exhibited by the insane; and surely even those tell us something, though I think in this case you are correct that it does require an expert to determine what that is.

We really don't need a professional to connect Rodger's statements with his actions. A pattern can be clearly perceived. We're not dealing with some kind of Voynich manuscript written in a code we could never hope to decipher, though mental health professionals could certainly provide interesting speculation and greater clarity.

Firstly, you have every right to feel disgusted that this 65 year old man abused his workplace professionalism to make sexual advances towards you. In what other scenario would you have endured sitting through this unwanted profession of love *by a 65 year old man*. He ignored your disinterest and took advantage of your politeness to press his point by insisting on driving you home. Of course you feel violated. He completely took advantage of his position, your niceness and the power difference between you two. He corralled you into an extremely vulnerable position by getting into his car and in different circumstances that could have had potentially frightening consequences. 


Secondly, it taints your professional experiences with this man. You just wanted to do your job and hoped his interest reflected mentorship instead of sexual interest. He complimented your dress and nails? Fuck that. You don't need that those compliments in a workplace. And moreover, he's setting a terrible example to other men in his workplace by behaving this way.

It's completely inappropriate for her supervisor to have revealed himself like that, regardless of whether she was still employed by him or not. The point is that their relationship was professional and it seems very clear to all of us, him included, that she intended on keeping it that way.

Unfortunately, this is a common tactic - about 1/3 of the 452 men surveyed in the study reported using verbal coercion is obtain sex. These verbally coercive men were found to have *more hostile attitudes towards women* and scored *higher on psychopathy-related personality traits*. In other words, men who use verbal coercion are significantly psychologically different from men who do not use any form of sexual aggression.

There's a lot of disagreement over how to classify this sort of thing.  The trouble with sexual coercion is that it's hard to really define in specific and objective terms. Does any pressure at all constitute coercion? Because no decision is ever made completely free of any outside pressure or influence. What if two people are in a long-term relationship and the lack of sex is making one of them unhappy? Are they not allowed to discuss this with their partner? If they do, they're surely putting some amount of pressure on that partner to have sex more often, but what's the alternative? Should they just up and stop returning their partner's calls one day? Just walk out and never say why?

Sexual coercion can be more clear cut. Like someone who badgers their partner relentlessly until they finally give in. But it can also be more morally ambiguous. Like someone who genuinely feels rejected when turned down for sex, and shows it in a way that makes their partner feel guilty.

I do think that coercion can be morally rape, but only if involves some deliberate attempt to create an unreasonable amount of pressure on your partner. Some behaviors can create unintentional pressure (like doing something nice for your partner and having that cause them to feel like they owe you), and other behaviors can create pressure as a by-product of something done for a more legitimate reason (like discussing your unhappiness with the lack of sex in your relationship). Basically, it's hard to draw an objective line, and criminalizing it would be very difficult for that reason.",5,t3_26gbtg

2. Do not get drawn into the ""why"" conversation. Its your decision, you've made it, your reasons are actually not really anybody's business. You do not need to justify yourself to end a relationship. I tried to stick to phrases that sounded like what managers say when they let you go before your probationary period is done: ""Its just not working out.""",4,t3_26ge4y

It sounds like you both care about each other, and you don't have to be jerk. You can be kind and let him know you care, but you don't see it as long term. Wish him the best, and mean it.

That comment is all the reason you need. The fact that you still care about his feelings in all of this means you're not an asshole in the slightest. He will hurt, and it'll hurt you, but it's not fair to either one of you to continue a relationship if it's not going to go anywhere.

I went through this almost 3 years ago now when I split with my ex of 9   years. We started dating in high school and he was all I knew as far as relationships, but in the last year it just wasn't there anymore.

Fact is, you have to take care of yourself. If you're already feeling resentful of the relationship it's time to let him go. You can tell him the reasons why, but you don't owe him answers if he starts pushing for them. Lean on your family and friends for support if you can (my younger sister was amazing for this), and don't be afraid to be selfish when it comes to your own happiness and wellbeing.",2,t3_26ge4y

20140525162228,thundorable,"I think you're being smart and strong and good to yourself by breaking up with him. Your intuition *knows*.  You don't trust him, and you find it hard to communicate with him - yep, time to go.  And here's the thing, you're actually being good to him, too, by breaking up. So he can find someone with whom he's more compatible

Now, here's where my opinion may be unpopular. I say you don't even owe him a deep explanation. You can get out of it with a simple, ""Bob, I'm sorry. You're a good man, but I'm just not feeling it. I'm breaking things off, and I wish you the best in finding someone who treasures you. You're a good man.""  If he pushes it, you can just keep repeating, ""I'm just not feeling a connection."" or ""You're just not the right one for me.""

The reason I suggest this kind of break up is because it gets the job done with a minimum of fuss. Getting into detail *can* become a big drama, and a negotiation. So this is a way to avoid that.

However, you may want to have a full-reveal discussion with him, for various reasons (for example, to give him the chance to change, or because he conveys that knowing the reasons will help him in the future with his next gf), so that is up to you.

However, autistic people are *also* often very rule-oriented, and being reminded several times that he's breaking rules (and maybe told that the rule is for workers' safety) is likely to help correct it.

- Take a makeup brush or pencil or whatever you have. The start of the brow should be the tear duct so hold your utensil in front of your tear duct and against the forehead. Taking a pencil or concealer draw a line. That is wear your brow will begin.

- Now for the arch of your brow! Place your utensil on next to the edge of your nose and threw the middle of the pupil. This is the highest point of your brow. Mark that point.

- Almost there, end of brow! With the utensil still at the edge of your nose move it to the outer corner of your eye. This is where your brow ends. Mark that point.

- You are allowed to adjust the points as you see fit. Instead of going in and tweezing everything in sight use your pencil to connect the dots with two straight lines. Then go in with concealer and conceal the hair. This way you will get a visual of what your brow will look like. Use more concealer to make it thinner looking or less to give a fuller brow. You can have a pointed arch or round it off. I would just play with some cheap, thick concealer and matching brow pencil till you get a shape you like.

Every time I look it mine (a beautiful silver with several purple amethyst in a diamond shape) I remember her and all the time I spent with her. I remember being a child in her lap admiring all of her beautiful jewellery and placing the too big ring on my finger.

I've met many women who don't particularly care about sex when they are not having it, they don't masturbate and don't seem to get horny, but sex itself drives their sex drive. When they have it, they start to want it.

Age is also important. I don't know how old you are, but plenty of women, who turned out to be highly sexual, weren't that into sex at all when they were in their late teens or even early twenties.

The fact that you were raped can *absolutely* influence things. You may block certain feelings or unconsciously avoid or escape certain situations. I agree with others that talking with a professional could be very beneficial.",3,t3_26hefr

I have a libido, and like to masturbate for the physical sensations, and sometimes I picture people I like. But if those people were to ask if I wanted to have sex, the answer is ""no"". Even if I love them, am in a committed relationship to them, etc, I just don't want sex.

It takes months before someone goes from being emotionally attractive to sexually attractive, I think that's sort of reminiscent of demi-sexuality. But my understanding is that demisexuals will enjoy sex once that attraction is formed.

It doesn't matter anyway, You don't need a label. As long as you are happy to just go with the flow and feel the way you feel, it doesn't matter what you are or aren't. If you have a partner who respects your boundaries and your limits, then who cares *why* you have those boundaries.",0,t3_26hefr

I'm really surprised that your doctor didn't say anything about that.  I had 2 ultrasounds, a mammogram, and an MRI to check mine out when I found a ""lump"" (which went away after about a year).

A few years later the lump had grown twice as big and I got it checked out again. This time an ultrasound and a biopsy -  ugh. The lump was right under the nipple too, talk about sensitive area. The result was inconclusive and because it had grown a bit they wanted to remove it. It turned it to be nothing, just a fibroadenoma. I believe women who are using the pill are more susceptible to lumps (don't quote me on that though). 

If you're concerned, ask for a biopsy. They'll take a sample of it and get it tested. If you're young, odds are in your favor. Having experienced this exact same thing, I understand that you're worried. Keep an eye on the lump, talk with your doctor again and seek out the result that eases your mind. ",4,t3_26hwaf

As for the pain you're feeling: usually, cancerous lumps are not accompanied by pain, so your soreness says nothing about the nature of the lump.

They spend their whole life with a vagina, which is the TERF definition of a woman, but they have that dreaded XY chromosome. What about dudes with XXY? They have two X chromosomes, but also a Y, so what on earth does *that* mean, if you're defining gender by chromosomes. 

I don't like using personality traits to define gender either, for obvious, obvious reasons. 

I guess I go the hippie route and just accept it when people tell me what their gender is. If they say they're a woman, cool, good enough for me. If they say they're a man, fantastic. Neither one? Yeah, alrighty, why not. It's not my problem what their junk or DNA says they should be, people have enough problems in life without my cislady ass telling them that they're doing it wrong. ",6,t3_26hn8f
20140525235002,BitchCallMeGoku,"True, the chromosome aspect was the first thing to pop into my head without much thought. My question still lingers, if gender can't be defined by body parts, personality, clothes, or genetics, what is it really? I guess I found it an intriguing topic.",2,t3_26hn8f
20140526000329,iatemysocks,"I think this is something that only, like, trans or otherwise gender-bendy people really *feel*, and people who feel no disconnect between their sex and their gender tend not to feel very strongly. You just kinda... are a gender.

I don't feel super strongly that I'm a woman, because that's never something that's really been challenged for me. I've never had people telling me that I was a man when I felt like I was a woman, or whatever. People call me she and her, I have boobs and a vagina, and none of that has ever been super important to my identity. So it's very hard for me to really feel super attached either way.

But then I think about how weird it would feel for me if everyone suddenly did start calling me he, referring to me as a dude, and if I suddenly had a dude's body. That would be weird! People would be wrong, and my body would be wrong, and that would be super uncomfortable for me. Suddenly, my gender would be very important to me, because suddenly it would be something that I needed to deal with. 

So... yeah. I don't know. I think gender is kept up there in your brain somewhere with the rest of your consciousness, and we certainly know almost nothing about that yet, as a species. I mean, where, precisely, in your brain, is your internal thought process? We don't know that yet. We probably can in the future, science just hasn't caught up to that yet. I figure gender is something similar. And since I am not a neuroscientist, I'm pretty much just waiting for science to figure that shit out.

But until then, gender is pretty much as nebulous as just, you know, *feeelings*. But people seem to know anyway. So I just take people's word for it. If someone says they're a woman, then they'd know better than me, so like... yeah, that's a good enough definition for me. Self-identification. Works for me. ",2,t3_26hn8f
20140526165027,RoxyRocket33r,"I think that a 3rd gender (or even a neutral 4th) should be introduced into mainstream culture. Intersexed indivuals occur naturally; we should naturally recognize gender as a fluid thing.",1,t3_26hn8f

Bio female and adult.  Physical deformities, gender identities, and genetic abnormalities are asides and special instances, not inherent definitions. Know who you are..that's half the battle in life.

",1,t3_26hn8f
20140526072703,KTKitten,"Honestly, I think the question itself is pretty problematic. There really isn't any way to define womanhood without excluding huge numbers of people.

The closest I can think of to determining what makes a woman is determining what *doesn't* make a woman.

* Chromosomes fail, because not even every ""natural"" woman is XX, and it excludes trans women by definition.
* Femininity fails, because there are plenty of butch women who are still women.
* Kindness fails, because women are not intrinsically more kind than men are.
* Genitals fail for the same reason as chromosomes, with the addition of people who were ambiguous at birth and had surgery to ""fix"" them.
* Motherhood and maternal instincts fail, again because they exclude trans women (at least the motherhood part) as well as infertile women, and those of us who just have no maternal drives.
* How you dress fails, because kilts are a thing (and let's face it, that's basically a skirt (unless it's the big wrap around authentic version, in which case it's more of a thick woollen sari) sorry guys) even before we consider transvestitism.
* How you present to the world fails, since plenty of trans people present as their ""natural"" gender for a very long time before they come out.
* Who you're attracted to fails, because then gay men would be women, lesbians would be men, and asexual people would be gender neutral.
* Body shape fails, because plenty of women have masculine builds, while plenty of men have feminine builds.

The only defining factor about gender I can think of that doesn't fall down under scrutiny is how you identify. Bear in mind that ""man"" and ""woman"" are ancient terms built up long ago in the mists of human history when ambiguity between the genders wasn't really recognised by society. They are, at least in my opinion, artificially rigid terms used to describe remarkably fluid aspects of humanity. I think this is why we always fail when we try to define womanhood as a concrete thing. You *can* put the mist in a bottle, and it'll fit to the bottle, but as soon as you open the lid it'll drift away and lose all of its definition, so I don't think there's much point in trying to give it a shape.",1,t3_26hn8f

A dude can *feel* inferior about his sex, say, when people assume he's a child molester for no other reason than him being male and spending time with children, *even if* he otherwise has more social power and privilege than a woman does. If he doesn't notice the privilege (which is totally how privilege *works*), he's just left feeling the inferiority and not the awesomeness. Look at all those MRA dudes, who think that men are an oppressed second class to feminists or whatever.

Meanwhile, what if a woman never feels inferior because of her sex or gender, because she's never noticed sexism? It happens on this very subreddit. The sexism still happens to her, she just never sees it. Is she not a woman, then? I, myself, don't feel *inferior* because of my sex or gender, even if other people think I am.

Am young man, can confirm; sometimes being more open and straighforward is the best thing to do, because a guy with a crush could either don't understand a thing that isn't completely obvious (and by obvious i mean [this obvious](http://i.imgur.com/RdnJMht.jpg)) or overreact and become 300% more awkward than usual, especially if their experience in the matter is small or next to none.  
I agree with cebrek here, a man is definitely going to appreciate a girl that isn't too worried of speaking up for herself (i think that's the english expression i'm looking for), it makes it easier to have a good time together and tones down any tension and/or awkwardness, as long as the girl isn't being unnecessarily bitchy about it or the guy just wants a carpet and not a woman.

I'm a tad confused as why he would invite someone at a Q&A about sexuality and stuff, so i'm not entirely sure what was John thinking.. unless he was already going and thought ""maybe she'd like to go as well?""... probably we'll never know for sure, but it doesn't matter anymore.

Still, OP, there's no need to cringe too hard about this, i'm just 21 and i've already had so much things i regret that sometimes I want to headbutt a wall for my own stupidity, so you're just a normal person in a weird weird world. :)

20140526001831,angrybubble,"Sounds like you might have folliculitis instead of acne. Folliculitis is when bacertia, fungi, yeast, or some other bug gets into a hair follicle and causes inflammation.  It can look a lot like acne but is often treated differently. Friction against clothing can lead to folliculitis which would explain why it's in some unusual areas like your thighs. Tights and jeans rubbing against the hairs on your thighs can irritate hair follicles and introduce bacteria into them and then rewearing the same pants can spread the bacteria and infect new follicles. Usually you want to keep your hands off the inflamed follicle and don't pick at it or try to pop it, use gentle cleansers, don't scrub the spot, always use a clean towel on the area, and it usually goes away on it's own in a couple days. A warm compress can be helpful to ease inflammation and draw pus to the surface.

If it's really bothering you should go see a dermatologist to rule out any other problems and find a good strategy for treating it. A dermatologist can figure out if the cause is bacterial, fungal, or even mites and help you figure out which treatment to use.",2,t3_26hkh6

Go to meetings. Read The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, and if you run into trouble contact a lactation consultant. 

Many women often think they have a low supply because breastfed babies nurse often. Way more often than a formula fed baby. The first 3 months will feel like all you do is breastfeed and that is totally normal.

My personal experience-- I was not able to breastfeed my daughter much beyond 3 months. My mom also was not able to breastfeed me or my brother past a similar timeframe. I suspect a genetic factor in my case. My milk ""letdown"" was always very quick, and once my daughter got to a certain age it just wasn't enough milk for her. I tried to keep going with it, but she began losing weight. 

I finally, after trying for a full week as she lost weight, tearfully began supplementing with formula. A couple months later I switched to formula entirely. 

In retrospect, I am much, much happier with how things are now, and I've realized that breastfeeding is not right for everyone or every situation.

I don't think this sort of exposure is going to build what you want it to. Having a sub dedicated to women's perspective become default isn't moving out of the shadows, you're still in your own semi-private space. Posting in shared spaces that don't cater to either gender (at least not intentionally) is being out in the open. Doing this without saying ""I'm a woman and I like World of Warcraft/Game of Thrones/FPS games/custom cars/rude jokes/science etc"" may be a challenge, but that's how you get out of the shadows. 

Exposing the content from this sub is polarising and in some ways is warping the sub's community and content. There are definite benefits (of which the OP is an example of) but the stated purpose of this sub is contradictory to the role of a default subs. Default subs have a general interest to everyone, this sub specifically targets women's perspectives.

Things which are popping up on the front page from this sub seem to be very sensationalised. Compare the TwoX ""slant"" on the clearly misogynistic (I honestly didn't see anyone argue he wasn't misogynistic, that seemed to be openly admitted and condemned) gunman news from yesterday to the titles and slant of the discussions that came from the world news page. Many people on reddit were interested in the news story yet somehow the story from this sub made it to the front page and was incredibly focused on the misogyny angle. The stories that didn't take that slant in the title nor from the sub they came from (news) recognised the misogyny but also heavily discussed gun control, negative portrayals of autism, racism, the roll the internet played in that story, trolls vs real threats, mental health etc. The discussion was much more diverse and specific to the details of the case whereas the very popular TwoX post that made it to the front page had the magnifying glass on the misogyny angle and any discussion outside of that was aggressively down-voted and dealt with combatively while most of the positive posts recycled general arguments and observations of misogyny, I wouldn't mind betting many posters in that thread didn't know that of the six people he murdered, four are male, three of which he targeted specifically. I personally think the discussions outside of TwoX were best suited to a wider audience but TwoX seemed to take the front page the longest.

I always viewed TwoX as a supportive place for women. A safe place where the internet isn't a battleground, but a valuable source of allies who can empathise with you and share a similar view. I enjoyed reading is a controlled environment that offered an insight into discussions that are less common on the interent. As a default sub, TwoX is still a supportive place for women, but it feels like a battleground and that has caused many sympathetic posters to become defensive or even hostile, it's pushed away many other posters and it's attracted a unwanted audience.

Consider for a moment that his misogyny was not a result of word of mouth or the websites he visited, but of his own isolation and rejection from society.  What I mean is, without integration either with your peers or some sort of teacher or guide, you are on your own to figure things out.  This kid, in my opinion, shows signs of self-entitlement from his wealthy upbringing, and possibly parents who didn't take an disciplined role in helping to shape the adult this young man was becoming (not to mention his clear signs of being insane).  He lacked wisdom, leadership, integrity, self-respect, and seemingly any form of coping mechanism.

For a lot of men, it's really hard to see the truth.  When you really get down to it and observe what the majority of women under 30 are attracted to, versus what many young men have been told their entire life (ie to be themselves, to be gentlemen, to be knights in shining armor, to be kind chivalrous and compassionate, etc), the shocking realization of how far removed you are and why is hard to take.  This ""mi'lady"" fedora tipping neckbeard shit...where do you think it comes from?  These guys are not making it up themselves, but something is attracting them to this behavior.  It's not any form of misogyny that teaches it in my opinion, it's the media and peers that instead of portraying what people are really attracted to, they portray what they think people should be attracted to.  Men and women alike are guilty of this.  Many young men are taught from a very young age to ""do the right thing"", and they grow up believing that is how you successfully socialize with others, so it's a very hard battle to ""do the right thing"" when it comes to women because you don't deserve attraction simply for being a good person obviously, and when they find this out they are very conflicted.  A person that goes through this often does not have a strong role model to give them experienced advice on how to interact and socialize with others, and instead gives them inexperienced ideas of how they *should* interact with others, and who they *should* be and surround themselves with.  Many young men will spend years, sometimes decades, of their life suffering through this illusory dilemma of ""how can I meet a good woman while still doing the right thing?  Everyone I see is having fun, and I've been alone for 30 years.  I've missed some of the best things in life because I have been doing the right thing, and people who seem borderline evil seem to receive a lot of love.""

While of course sex should not be the defining point of ones happiness, look again to media.  A young man without a strong male influence will grow up watching disney movies and tv shows that portray the most watered down versions of love and relationships.  Everyone lives happily ever after, and never does anyone really do any work to deserve how attractive they are.  Love seems like something that just happens in the world, like you are a puzzle piece and you're just waiting for another puzzle piece to float along and fit perfectly with you.  Unfortunately that is not the case though, and most people are much more casual and superficial about who they are attracted to.  While many people sure want a guy, or girl for that matter, who is a good person guys typically want someone who is pretty, and women typically want someone who is wealthy, strong, charismatic, interesting, and successful.  Furthermore, in our society expressing emotion is considered a weakness in men.  Many argue it's the patriarchy that causes it, but never in my life have I been belittled or treated like I was weak by a man.  Women on the other hand used me constantly, having me hold their books for them then treating me like dirt but promising maybe they'd go out with me kind of thing.  Of course I was naive, but like the kid in question I didn't know any better and the only advice I had was from disney movies that pretty much told me to, ""be nice, be yourself, wish upon a star and everything your heart desires will come to you.""  Emotion is often viewed as a weakness in men, they don't often express their emotions to one another, and they don't often express their emotions to women because they want to be seen as attractive.  One of the only socially acceptable ways to express your emotions as a man is through sex, so while it shouldn't be a defining point of ones happiness, you can't deny that a lack of sex and intimacy can cause depression and feelings of doubt in ones own self-worth.  Wars have been started over something as simple as a woman.  As I got older I asked men why I had trouble with women, they told me to be man up, have self-respect, and show some confidence but I didn't really believe them because who better to ask about how to attract women than women?  Right?  I asked countless women for advice, and mostly I got, ""You're fine, just be yourself but I'll never go on a date with you, sorry you're really nice but not my type"" but I also got a lot of, ""Women like experienced guys.  Virgins are not attractive, I want a guy that knows what he wants and what he is doing already, I don't want to have to show him anything.  Why do you think so many women swoon over married guys and guys with girlfriends, because it shows they are good enough.  Expressing you're an inexperienced virgin shows you are not good enough.""  Mostly though, I just heard what women thought they *should* be attracted to because they didn't want to look bad.  It's like a guy trying to say he's not attracted to those ""pretty"" women, he likes women who are nice and who be themselves.  I was like this kid, self-entitled.  I was once that guy saying, ""why do girls like jerks, and not a nice guy like me?""  It took me a long long time to figure out what women were attracted to, why, and be able to work hard on myself to achieve my goals.  I had this mindset that a woman should be attracted to me even if I was homeless and never worked out, because that does not define who I am on the inside....but I realized who you are on the outside matters too.  I started working out, I started taking responsibility for my insecurities.  If I was insecure about anything, absolutely anything even if it seemed mundane or superficial, I worked to improve myself so that insecurity would disappear. 

**TL;DR**: Don't underestimate mental-illness.  Misogyny is real, and destructive, but so is misandry and so are disney movies and mcdonalds.  This guy may have said a lot of misogynistic shit, but it's not a reason to increase the negative stigma surrounding mental illness (which includes misogynistic rants) when there is already a huge lack of guidance and support for young men in our society.  He also talked a lot about his asian roommates, is this also an example of racism towards asian americans?  This may have been an example of misogyny, but he wasn't a product of it.",-2,t3_26i7rc

I posted about it - generally confused as to why the police couldn't do anything.  Rodgers said the police talked to him for  'a couple of minutes outside' after his parents had made reports/complaints to them.  A COUPLE OF MINUTES!?  Is that really long enough to get a hold on the situation?

I think why the misogynistic elements got a lot of traction was because, here, on Reddit, I have absolutely seen, more times that I can count the EXACT sentiments that Rodgers discussed/posted about - posted on reddit, on default subreddits with many many upvotes and replies supporting the OP.

Because... Rodgers sentiments are a sentiment that has prevailed, OUT IN THE OPEN on default areas of Reddit.

Does that mean that every pos that has posted like that is dangerous in real life?  No, but it does show how far that particular line of thinking can go.
And the discussions get pretty violent, or at least, gleefully delight in violent encounters towards women.  Before I unsubbed from a lot of the main areas, I saw plenty of crap about ""Equal Rights, Equal Lefts"" - where they would celebrate tales of 'justice', and post gifs and videos of women getting beaten up by men - these were moments of justice because the woman in question had been yelling and causing a massive scene or struck the man first -so they had 'just cause' to celebrate her being punched and knocked out by someone with a foot of height and 80lbs weight advantage on her.

The sadistic glee with which they talk about getting 'justice boners' and 'equal right equal lefts' chants, and slowing the video down, and posting pictures of just the moment she got hit, shows just how much these guy revel in the idea of violence towards women, and 'getting one back' or 'putting them in their place' as they like to say.

There is a culture on reddit of righteous retaliation.  Women always get a pussypass when they do something wrong, but these bitches who never give me a chance are going to get one back now!  And that's exactly the sentiment Rodgers had, but taken to the extreme.
Actually many of the school/spree-shootings have come down to the same sentiments, of 'retribution against a group that wronged me' and women are more often than not, targets of that, due to a failed relationship, or those popular girls not liking me etc etc.

I'm sure this happens, but also remember what a Reddit administrator recently pointed out:

""I mostly just want to urge people to not take everything at face value. There are a lot of people that seem quite invested in trying to get the mods to remove this subreddit from the defaults, and unfortunately that means that they're willing to try to cheat, lie, and do various other unsavory things to influence this decision.

For example, the OP of this thread was using at least 5 alternate accounts to attempt to tilt things in here, including upvoting their own submission and supportive comments (and they've now been banned from the site for that). There's generally just a great deal of attempted manipulation going on around the topic of 2XC being a default, between people attempting to manipulate votes, using multiple accounts to post comments supportive of their side, organized groups brigading relevant posts, etc. Some people have even been performing what's often referred to as a ""false flag"", where even though they're actually normally a contributing member of the subreddit, they've been creating alt accounts to make or upvote harassing comments/messages in order to make that issue seem more prevalent than it actually is.""

Seriously--what do you expect them to do, cover up for sexual harrassment by 2X regulars against other 2Xers?  Pretend that people aren't sending themselves hate mail when they apparently are?  Some of you seem to think that they're lying.  These admins have tools to figure out if those things are happening (they can look at IP addresses), and you don't.  What basis could you possibly have for dismissing that post, except that it doesn't fit in with your world view?

Secondly, they certainly haven't ignored the issue!  They even gave you an alternate way to report harassment without using the same queue that everyone else does, saying that it allows them to get to your reports faster.  That's preferential treatment, which indicates that they acknowledge the problem and are trying to help!  I wouldn't be surprised if the idiots at theredpill were bitching about ""reverse sexism.""  You guys shouldn't be mad!

Regarding the statement that people won't believe you now if you really do get hate mail: don't shoot the messenger.  Blame the people who actually lied, and definitely blame the people who cyber-bullied 2Xers just so that they look oppressed (and they are cyber bullies, just like any man who sends unwanted sexual PMs).  You're right that people might be a little doubtful now, and that sucks.  On the other hand, the admins should still be on your side!  They can see the IPs, so they have a pretty good idea that you're telling the truth, and will ban people appropriately.

OK.  Rant over.  I'm also disappointed in cupcakes' ""2 to 4"" comment, since there's obvious statistical bias.  It emphasized high-profile cases such as when people make threads about it, and those are probably more likely to be lies.  It ignores reports that aren't tied to 2X (when you report a PM the admins probably don't bother looking at what subs you post to most to see that you're a 2X regular).

20140526181620,JimminyBobbit,"What the fuck was the point of making TwoX a default subreddit anyway?

Most of the users on reddit are male and they heavily dominate a lot of the conversation on any of the 'main' or default areas.
I have unsubsrcibed from a lot of the 'big content' on reddit - AskReddit, IamA etc because of just how much SHIT gets upvoted there.
Constantly there are sexist, misogynistic, vitriolic, prejudice bullshit massively upvoted and tolerated in those spaces.
Whenever rape is mentioned, the conversation gets derailed into FALSE RAPE ACCUSATIONS and it seems every fucking guy on reddit has been accused of rape or has a friend who was accused of rape because ""the girl regretted it the next day"".
Comments that are identified as coming from female users get downvoted into invisibility for no reason. 
Men feel free to right misogynistic vitriol without consequence, but if someone rights a well-crafted response, or a question as to why that comment is acceptable, they get downvoted into invisbility.

Then there is the old favorite ""Equal Rights, Equal Lefts!"" which gets a LOT of traction on reddit, with men gleefully upvoting gifs/videos/stories about women being hit and 'put in their place' because they deserved in.
Instead of condemning violence, they celebrate it - PARTICULARLY when it's a women getting hit and they can justify that she deserved it or 'she started it'.  Righteous retaliation is their game.

But it's more then that.  It's more than hateful or violent comments.  It's also the disregard of female comments or perspectives:
 ""Already checked guys, no gonewild posts""  to a womens comment.

Just yesterday in a HISTORY subreddit - where people post pictures of old cars, or old city scenes, things off historical interest - someone posted a picture of a group of women from a sorority from 1910 - interesting picture - and the thread was full of comments (and at the top voted sections) about how they were ugly, and 'why don't I find these girls attractive?' - all about their looks, people lamenting that they aren't attractive enough, lamenting their lack of fuckability, and rating them based on their preferences, including one person saying ""oh, i don't know... third on the right has monster tits' which someone replied ""also a  monster face though"".  

That's a history sub.

That kind of shit is RIFE across reddit.  AskReddit is a fucking cesspool of sexist shit, and trojan horse bigotry.

And now, twox has been made a default for a website on which it's not a representation of the bulk of the users and has exposed it to the bullshit of trolling, pathetic men.  People whos lives are so desperate and sad, that they get off on writing fucked up comments on a womens subreddit as a way to feel power over women, even though it's a faceless anonymous interaction.  That's how utterly pathetic these gnats are.

Reddit justifies the existence of disgusting, violent subreddits ""cutedeadgirls"" , that old POS 'creepshots' that feature women, or 'pussypass' used to bang on about how women get a pass for things simply for being women - a cesspool of uninformed sexism and the list of sexist, hateful, violent shit could go on.  How would they feel about the existence of threads that objectified men or treated htem in a violent manner?   What if   r/KillMRA existed?     Or  r/RedPillSuicide?     r/UselessMen?

We've been dealing with trolling from those same groups for years, some since the day 2xc was created. It's nothing new to us. They are still trying, btw, trying to sow seeds of drama and discontent where ever they can.

We also knew that some of our own users would be upset, and we expected that some of those would never be okay with it. Two things we didn't expect (or at least I didn't) that random guys that wouldn't normally be pegged in those groups would be upset because ""fairness"" or we're ""too niche"" and that users that have been part of this community would not only lie about the amount of harassment they've received but send others harassing PM with alts as well as upvoting harassing comments here.

That sucks, and maybe you're right about the PMs but maybe you're not. And that doesn't make me wrong. Like I said, I don't really care about that crap. If the postings and comments I've read are typical of this sub then around 15% of the women on it are Scumbag Stacy and posting and commenting as such and they have Scumbag Steve right next to them.

I don't believe that. And I've only been here a couple of weeks. 

Notably rude women are not necessarily trolls. Just sayin'.

There is more than one way to troll and one of the more traditional definitions involves baiting a hook. It doesn't take long to figure out who's doing it where, at least it doesn't for me. You see the tone and you watch the threads degenerate and it doesn't matter who is saying what because they're changing names but there is only so much you can do to camouflage syntax.

I try to be thoughtful and express my opinion with tact or keep it to myself if it might be hurtful, particularly to a victim. I've seen a couple of classics put out there and I'm sure these were guys trolling but I've also seen something else.

Manufactured situations posted by women. I would venture to guess that there's an element of this regardless; people who are going for the karma. But I've also seen enough of it to believe this amount is not usual and some of it is looking for a knee jerk reaction from guys and if they don't get it they make it up.

The point is that I'm in this sub because it's got mostly fantastic women on it and I really do learn quite a bit. But women are people too and they do some of the same things we object strongly to if it's done by a guy. Some of those things are bad by any standard you apply. Since it's a women's sub we do get to censor and I think they're pretty good doing it. But it's a process.

Essentially the comment from the admin confirmed something I suspected about the few women. Those women and what they did damaged the credibility of many. It was categorically fucked up and they didn't even do it well.

20140526115825,whisperingmoon,"I think the issue is that Reddit's admins are in something of a bind as far as attracting women's interest is concerned. 

If they don't do it, and continue to perpetuate a really toxic culture through inaction, then they'll never be able to encourage more women users to feel comfortable on the site and their userbase will have essentially plateaued. No business wants to find themselves without potential for expansion; women are a natural market to expand into.

However.

In order to attract the women users they need, Reddit's administrators will need to put their foot down about harassment and abuse, about rape threats and death threats, and so on... Bearing in mind that the site is essentially founded on an *anything goes* attitude. Remember, Reddit's rules allow for subreddits dedicated to pictures of dead children, to gore, to heroin addiction and crippling alcoholism, to promotion of domestic violence, and many other things that the vast majority of people would find utterly distasteful, if not horrendously offensive. But the nature of the site's construction is that they all have the equal right to exist. It's in the constitution, if you will.

So what does Reddit do? If misogynists are rounded up on principle in order to attract more women users, then so, so much of the website will have to be rounded up on principle in a far more aggressive way. Essentially: if we're going to start taking harassment seriously, then Reddit has to abandon its Wild West approach and begin taking a moral stance of some kind.

I don't claim to believe that either approach is right or wrong; only that it would be a *major* upheaval, and kind of a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation for the administrators. ",9,t3_26i7rc

20140526200033,Efilym,"Yes, it feels as though a lot of people failed me. It has definitely created some trust issues. I spoke with a therapist for about a year after it all took place. My parents often took part in my therapy, which was super supportive and nice of them, but because of this I was never comfortable talking about some of the more serious emotional and psychological issues that I experienced. I briefly spoke to a counselor at my college but the counseling provided is more geared toward short term goals so it was pretty ineffective. ",1,t3_26i9e5

There's no telling what might have happened had your parents not supported you and had you not managed to get out of that office. The situation you were in to me seems utterly terrifying, especially because of the position of power this fucktard was in. 



I know something about unwanted intimacy at school. I was 17 and the janitor (60+ male) was so friendly with me it made me really uncomfortable, but I didn't think much of it. Then suddenly he had my picture in his wallet which seriously freaked me out and I started to avoid him, but wherever I went he was staring at me. I told my best friend and she convinced me to tell my parents. I was so glad when my parents talked to the principal and he wasn't asked to come back for the next year. I was pretty darn scared, I can't even imagine what it must have been like for you... So no, you are not overreacting. 



I can't give advice on how to deal with it though, other than maybe try to find a good therapist. Your experience is so much more severe than mine, you were much younger and the harassment was much, MUCH more severe, also because in a way you were the one punished for his bad behaviour. And then there's the bullying from your classmates too...



TL;DR: No you are not overreacting.

I really hope your bad dreams and flashbacks will go away, being stuck with something like that is horrible...",1,t3_26i9e5
20140526193427,redheadedchick,"I don't think you're overreacting at all. I had a similar-ish thing happen to me, and I still have bad dreams and angry thoughts about it.

When I was a senior in high school a twenty-something teacher from the school district next to us took an interest in me after meeting on a political campaign. He was ultra-awkward and from what I hear his students absolutely loathed him. He added me on Facebook and latched onto me because I talked to him a few times. 

He got super clingy to the point where he was sending me ""I love you, beautiful :)"" texts to me on a daily basis. One night he graphically described to me his masturbation habits--he had absolutely no sense of boundaries between us. I talked to him about his inappropriate behavior and he stopped for a while, but started up again after a few months. I finally cut off contact from him after he got really creepy one night and then laughed at me when I asked him to apologize.

So I guess I know a little bit what you're feeling, even though the dynamics were different because of ages and distances and it not being as sever as your experience. That must have been horrible to go through that during middle school, which is tough enough without all that :( It can really affect you when someone who is supposed to be there for you turns around and manipulates you like that.

20140526194331,HerpADerpThrowaway77,"First, thank you for having the courage to share your story! 

Yes- I can relate to your story. Please allow me the space to share mine. Beginning when I was 6 or 7 I had an uncle that would come to babysit my brother and I that harassed me in a way that seems similar. He said things like ""wow, HerpADerpThrowaway77's breasts are really getting huge already! Pretty soon we're going to start having to manage all her date requests and signing permission forms!"" to my brother and I, all while making and making a big scene and pointing. And it happened constantly. Another time he made a big to-do about printing out porn from the computer and not telling our parents, another time he thought it utterly necessary to tell me all about breast implants and how I should get them ""in a few years."" Sometimes it would be peppered with things like ""wow you are just getting more gorgeous each time I see you, do you have a boyfriend?"" Most of the things said with my parents present were just creepy enough to be ""cute"" while my parents were there, which in retrospect was probably pretty purposeful to make them think my resentment of him was an overreaction. He even mentioned MORE THAN ONCE that he intended to blow up a picture of me as a child to make a poster to hang on his wall with my parents present. 

My parents made the entire situation even more difficult through a total lack of support, and even did things to further my humiliation and discomfort. As I got older I came to really resent my uncle's presence and would pretend to be asleep when he would come over, which led to my parents accusing me of acting rude, demanding that I come out and socialize with him and even apologize to him for avoiding him. My family is big on hugs and when I turned 13 or so I started to avoid giving him hugs, and this came to a point where my mom forced me to hug him at family gatherings and chiding me in front of the family- a very potent message. Sadly they never asked me why I was doing all these things to avoid contact with him and I couldn't find the language to bring it up to them(I was raised very strictly christian and sex-negative and so unmarried sexual encounters were treated with great shame in my family, which now that I'm older probably had a lot to do with not finding communication to tell them about it). Unfortunately, my parents were not supportive when I finally did tell them about it- At 15 or so I confronted my mom about an uncomfortable comment my uncle made while she was there and she brushed it aside by saying she ""could imagine him saying something like that to me too."" I finally confronted my mother about the entire situation a few years ago(I think I was 21 at the time, and I stopped seeing this uncle on a regular basis at 16 or 17 due to other reasons) and she flat out told me that there was nothing wrong with the situation, that rather it was my ""interpretation."" We've pretty much stopped talking about it altogether, as she hasn't budged or made any attempt to acknowledge what I'm saying as legitimate since.   
 
Also most difficult for me was that all this led to me being a very depressed child, I became very overweight and did hurtful things to myself out of this trauma that wasn't being acknowledged as I started hitting puberty. Me being overweight led to me being picked on by peers, which only made my sadness worse. It was all just a downward spiral. Embarrassed and ashamed, I hid in big boyish clothes and shutting myself up in my room to create art which led to my mother CONSTANTLY accusing me of being gay(yes- at 10/11 years old while I also talked about boys constantly) and outlining the consequences for being so(kicking me out, etc.) It was really just all terrible. She eventually came off it after putting me on a dangerous diet that led to a 40 pound weight loss over a summer between 7th and 8th grade that improved my confidence.

Amongst other difficult sexual trauma in my life, this has led to many difficulties in my sex life. I think it is a lot like what you describe. I used to have random flashbacks that would arise suddenly with no seeming trigger that would cause me to freeze. I started dating at 14 and when I would be touched in a consensual way I would sometimes just freeze, and ""block out"" what was happening, which led to unexplained panicking. It would be very frustrating for me because I would fantasize about the sexual encounter occurring in private and then when the opportunity would arise, I just couldn't go through with it due to this unexplained panic, leading to a lot of awkward sexual situations.   

I am 25 and still going through the healing process. What I try to do is to find supportive environments- friends, online communities, etc. Personally, I feel like what makes this kind of situation so traumatizing was the lack of acknowledgment or action to make the situation stop happening- like my uncle(and in your case, your teacher) was entitled to do what he was doing and I had no choice but to put up with it and be shamed and embarrassed by the same people who were doing nothing to stop the situation. 

What I can say is that I'm 25 and still going through the healing process. And that healing process is constant. But what I do is to seek out ways of making myself feel empowered sexually- finding supportive friends, talking about sexual empowerment with others, and seeking out things that make me feel good in my sex life. It's definitely a messy ongoing process, but doing this has slowly helped me to take control of my identity and my satisfaction as a sexual being.   

Sharing your experiences and trying to work through your trauma to grow is AWESOME and no one should make you feel like you are ""overreacting"" by seeking support to work through a traumatic situation like this! Can't say enough how I support posting things like this to start meaningful conversations surrounding these issues.  ",1,t3_26i9e5
20140526203338,Efilym,"Wow, this sounds VERY similar to what I experienced. Props to you for getting your story out there as well! Doesn't it feel great? I am terribly sorry that your family wasn't more supportive:( If it weren't for my parents,  I don't know how I would have survived it.

20140526005621,wowieone,"When in a high crime area be aware of your surroundings. Don't create a pattern, taking the same way home everyday, that makes you predictable and easy to target.

20140527095929,upsidedownbat," I have to disagree with the ""no eye contact."" Eye contact shows that you're aware of your surroundings and of this person's presence, it shows confidence and makes a human connection. All of these things make you look like less of a victim.

20140526000403,eighthgear,"I think its a fine idea. Obviously you'll want to make sure how to handle the thing properly, but a Taser is definitely a powerful neutralizer - there is a reason why police use it.

That aside, are you thinking of an actual Taser, or just a contact stun gun (which are commonly referred to as Tasers)? Either one has its uses.",7,t3_26hzi5
20140526002826,EmTheFemBot,"I haven't decided yet; only recently realized there's a difference! What are the pros/cons for each (if anyone knows? I can always consult Google lol)?",1,t3_26hzi5
20140526074618,CharsCustomerService,"Short version:

-Contact stun guns start at *much* lower prices than Tasers, but they require physical contact (their reach is only as long as your own, which may be shorter than your attacker's). They act by creating pain, and require you to continue to maintain contact with both prongs, ideally for quite some time. As soon as you move away, the other person stops being affected and starts recovering (remember that you are in arms reach at this point).

-A Taser C2 (the cheap, most easily concealable one) costs about $400. Get that out of the way immediately. However, it has a 15ft range, and works by pulsing electricity to stop the targets muscle from functioning properly - even if they can fight through the pain (possible with stun guns), their muscles will not respond to commands. The Taser fires barbed prongs that stick in the skin, and the cartidge continues to deliver electricity, so you can fire, then run away. Be aware, though, that Tasers are not foolproof - at very close range the barbs may not separate far enough to fully disable a person, one or both may not properly penetrate, and simple expedients like heavy clothing may work as functional armor (true with stun guns as well).

As Taser is great, but at low cost I'd definitely recommend pepper spray over a contact stun gun. ""Not being in grabbing/stabbing distance"" is kind of a huge consideration for defense options.",5,t3_26hzi5

Also, feeling confident and safe will give you better body language and honestly is more likely to deter a potential attacker.

20140527031817,cynical_cal,"Echoing what's been said here and adding a few more things. 

* Awareness of your surroundings from the people around you to escape routes is indispensable.
* A Taser can only be fired once; after that, you're left with a stun gun. Though the Taser is intended to disable and neutralize the target long enough to for you to run, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. You miss, the target is too close, etc. With a stun gun, it won't immobilize them as much as it will cause them pain, and probably piss them off that much more. Not to mention you'll have to be in close range to use a stun gun, which isn't optimal at all. 
* Concerning chemical sprays, its somewhat the same deal, depending on the type you've got. You've got to be somewhat close, then factor in wind direction/speed, since you definitely don't want that blowing back on you. 
* Don't put yourself in a situation where you are vulnerable. I'm not saying that it's at all excusable to be raped because of x behavior, but to a predator, it's not an excuse, it's a weakness to be exploited. From walking alone in unfavorable conditions (especially in heels so you can't run as fast, being distracted, etc.)
* That said, be able to defend yourself and run. Don't freeze, don't obey: if you get in that car because he threatens you with a gun, it's that much harder to find you or your dead body. Take classes, stay healthy, fit, and alert.
* Overall, with any self-defense item and or skill, it's useless unless you have it in hand and you're ready to use it and use it right, whether it be to cause pain, maim, or even kill (especially with guns). 

Personally, I know I'd forget some night or another to always carry around x thing, and have it charged and ready to go. So for me, classes and minimizing my risk are the way to go.

20140526001848,obliterayte,"It is never overreaction when it comes to your personal safety. What if you do happen to get mugged or worse and you listened to your friends. Better be safe than sorry. It sounds like you are referring to a contact stun gun rather than taser. You need permits to own and carry a taser, but the stun guns are useful as well. They won't really neutralize an attacker, but they cause more pain than anyone is going to want to mess with.

Also consider concealed carry if it is legal where you are going. It is by far the most effective method of protection, and even if you can't carry publicly, they are great for defending your house hold.",2,t3_26hzi5

I wasn't really sure of the difference between a stun gun and taser though; I've only recently started doing research. Does concealed carry mean guns? If so, I don't think I'd get a gun. They kind of scare the crap out of me! Thanks for the input!",1,t3_26hzi5
20140526003424,obliterayte,"Yes concealed carry would be a gun. They aren't for everyone.

The main difference between a taser and a stun gun is the taser shoots two prongs at your target, which send electrical shock through your target and rendering his muscles useless. Thus, dropping the person to the ground. A stun gun on the other hand has to make contact with the target and does not shoot anything. It shocks the target much like a taser, but since there is only one point of contact, it does not render anything useless. It is basically the pain of a taser without the demobilizing functionality.",2,t3_26hzi5

Tasers are best for the police to restrain someone who is resisting arrest but basically not moving, like a big muscly drunk dude. If you miss with a taser, you are fucked, and a self-defense situation is stressful and fast-paced. Compared to pepper spray, stun guns are bulky and expensive but are difficult to overpower. I would recommend keeping pepper spray on your keychain and taking a taser in your purse. The reality is that at some point you may get tired of carrying around a stun gun or you may not have your purse, and pepper spray is certainly better than nothing.",2,t3_26hzi5
20140526011024,obliterayte,"Some very good points touched on in this. Your general taser is useless if you miss. And you don't have to miss by much. Even if you hit with 1 prong and the other misses, it is useless. Pepper spray is going to be the best bet, with a taser or stun gun being good situational based option. However this is why I recommend a fire arm. They aren't for everyone I understand, but they are the most effective form of protection.",2,t3_26hzi5
20140526013603,nationalism2,"I have a Sig 380 but I have to say that there are a lot of things to consider before you decide to purchase a pistol, beyond the ""ooh guns are scary"" emotional reaction. You can't take them onto federal property, which includes the postal service (of course, many people do just because the odds of anyone finding out are essentially nil). You can't take them into bars, so if you are carrying on yourself and you and your friends decide to get a drink, you may have to not drink or go back to your car and put your gun up first. Also, a pistol, ammo, a CHL license, and range time for training will end up costing you about $1000.

One other thing I forgot to mention about stun guns (and tasers) (and guns, of course) is that there is a small chance you will kill whoever is attacking you. If you are morally opposed to killing an attacker, then it may not be for you.",6,t3_26hzi5

This website is by women for women. They make cute self defense items that are practical and deadly. I just got a lovely purple ""stun gun"" from them. I believe it's 7million Volts. If you feel you need a method of self defense please get one. You can never be too safe. All of their gear is affordable and comes in cute colors.

Let's write this out clearly: he's punishing you *for making a mistake and tearing up because you already felt shitty* by refusing to acknowledge you and pretending he doesn't understand why his treatment is hurtful. He withholds affection, empathy and common decency towards you. He literally moves from room to room, floor to floor, to escape you. He won't even reply when you say goodbye to him, won't sit near you, refuses to in any way convey anything. And this is apparently a regular thing with him - checking out of your relationship whenever something happens that he doesn't super duper like. Then when he's punished you for ""creating drama"" (ie having an emotion he doesn't like) to a degree he finds satisfactory he'll decide that you're an adult couple again I'm guessing? So where exactly do you factor into all this for him, other than as a convenient partner who will be right where he left you?

That's not a healthy person to be with. :( Frankly the way he's treating you with the leaving any room/floor you're on, not caring, not showing emotion when he most mercifully decides you deserve an entire ""hey"" - *that's how you treat someone* **you don't like**. That's not how you treat your *partner* because she made a *mistake* with your car or, god forbid, cried from feeling shitty. 

There's nothing wrong with alone time, it's important in all relationships, but this *obviously* goes beyond that.

Since I had just gotten home, my SO had no idea what and why was going on, but when I growled ""bitchy PMS mode"" be backed away slowly and went to fill a wine glass. 

That is a thing we both do- talk. Even if it just to say ""bitch mode engaged, not your fault, talk later"". But later on we talk about it, even if it is just to rant about whatever it was that pissed us off. And in my opinion that is how a healthy adult relationship should work. 

Of course I sometimes fall into stupid angsty ""I am not talking to you"" pits, but I have come to realize that when I sulk by myself and go with the ""you should know what is wrong"" attitude, I am only hurting myself. My SO is not telepathic, I don't think you are either. 

If he does not tell you what it is that upset his manly feelings, then you will not know it magically. You might think it was because of the car, but he might actually be upset that you shrunk his favourite boxers in the wash (just a completely random example). But until he tells you what exactly it is that bothers him, you fill feel like you kicked the puppy and then stomped on it, too. 

I suggest to take a day off. Go to the beach with a frieng, windowshop, catch a movie... Anything that will help you to regain your balance and make you feel better. 

Then when you feel like a sane person (not a poke at you, I personally feel that ""the gift of womanhood"" messes me up bad) again, approach the subject casually. A la ""Look, sorry about my inability to deal, this PMS thing is hard on me and makes me act like a wildebeest and it has actually nothing to do with you. Now, I can see that something is bothering you, could you please share, so we could move past this"" 

If he comes back with the oh so female ""im fine"" then... Bah... Then I don't know. I would probably go with a lightly teasing ""male PMS??"" kind of approach, but I don't know if that would help you. ",0,t3_26i9bo

I've seen them thin enough that I could see the outline of a birthmark on one girl's butt, which made for a very awkward escalator ride since my face was at butt level. It wasn't exactly appropriate for the situation. 

I don't think the debate should be ""Are leggings/yoga pants pants?"" I've been known to wear them as pants, so I'm not really opposed to that use in general. At the same time, please make sure people can't see right through your leggings and yoga pants when you're in public. If I can see through your clothes in ways you don't seem to have intended, it's probably not appropriate for class or work or really anywhere public where bare butts aren't appropriate.",4,t3_26ik7m
20140526084304,vitrol,"I think this is really the crux of the issue. Wear what is appropriate for your setting. That said, i don't know that i have an issue with see-through tights either; people wear fishnet tops and bras as crop tops and no one seems to take issue with that. ",4,t3_26ik7m
20140526085359,Lil_Boots1,"To me, the difference is that ribs and bellies are considered acceptable in public in Western culture, though of course not in all situations, while butts and crotches aren't or are relegated specifically to certain beaches or areas. 

I'm also a lot more uncomfortable around unintentionally exposed skin than intentionally exposed skin because it feels like I'm seeing something I'm not supposed to. It's like the difference between watching porn and walking in on your roommate having sex. No matter how much porn you watch, accidentally seeing someone having sex is much more awkward because they didn't mean for you to see it. Maybe these women know their cheeks are completely visible, but it doesn't seem like that's a choice they were trying to make and to me, that makes it much more uncomfortable and distracting. It's like someone you don't know has toilet paper on their shoe or their skirt tucked into their underwear, except worse because you can't tell them and have them fix it immediately if they want to. I guess it's still their choice if they want to wear see through leggings, but I hope they at least know that they're see through.",2,t3_26ik7m
20140526090319,vitrol,"I can completely understand where you're coming from. I won't say that every single fashion choice someone else makes makes me comfortable, I am personally fairly reserved in my own clothing choices, but I think If we as a society pick and choose what clothing pieces are acceptable and what is not acceptable, we really can become demeaning and patronizing.

It's also incredibly hypocritical, when certain looks, such as the really high cut short, are not universally hated, but for some reason tights are. I don't get it.  I don't think either should be an issue, but I have seen plenty of girls' butt cheeks coming out of shorts and no one seems to care, but a pair of yoga pants in public is suddenly a major issue? It just seems like there is a huge double standard, and people should just be able to wear what makes them happy. ",2,t3_26ik7m
20140526102448,Lil_Boots1,"I don't think it's necessarily fair to say that someone should dress only in ways that make me comfortable, but at the same time, as a society we do and always will dictate what is and isn't acceptable to wear. Some things, like covering most of your butt, are gender-neutral and so I don't really have a big problem with them. It also seems like the social acceptability of exposed butts is similar to the social acceptability of exposed boobs. Showing a little crack or cheek is generally considered unfashionable and only appropriate in specific contexts but not awful and a whole butt is unacceptable in most contexts, just like showing a little cleavage is ok and a lot is only appropriate in specific contexts and showing whole breasts is unacceptable in most contexts. Note that I have a problem with the difference in acceptability of female breasts and male chests, but it is an example of other body parts where there's a gradient of what's ok.",2,t3_26ik7m

I am all for wearing appropriate clothes in certain cases, like not wearing this to work unless it's at a gym, but if you're just going to the store or the movies, who cares?

We're a fantastic community (with or without the influx of people from r/all). Should we begin by talking to the mods and making it Reddit-based? Maybe the mods could keep a list in the sidebar of users who are willing to be contacted and their general regions? (This could be a problem with us being a default now. Maybe we should make a separate sub for this?)

Even before being a default we wouldn't be able to support this, I'm sorry, it's a great idea but inherently unsafe both for the users offering rides and those looking for them to rely on an anonymous forum. We've always had trolls here and always have had to be aware that not everyone was posting here in good faith.

Keeping lists easily found by nefarious people of our users and their locations isn't something I wouldn't feel good about, we can't vet people any more than regular users and I wouldn't feel comfortable saying with certainty that specific people are ""safe"". 

Your option 1 of an off-reddit site sounds the most promising if you and others are willing to do their due diligence of making sure pro-life extremists (or worse!) aren't abusing the system. From both directions, the people looking for rides could be looking for trouble as well. Before sending people there we would have to be convinced of your methods though.

Gah!  I used to be pro-life when I was strongly religious, and still deeply believe that abortion is a terrible solution to a pregnancy problem.

I know what it's like to make that hard decision, and no one should ever have to go through something like that alone.

On another note, I was thinking that maybe for safety reasons, some women on this sub can volunteer for specific areas (cities/towns) and their reddit username would be on a seperate post. That way if women need help, whether just needing to talk, or a couch to crash on, they could PM the user. This would keep people's identities safe. If meeting in person is required, meeting in a public place would work well, and would give time for all parties involved to at least get to know each other. Furthermore, because the individual needing support would be PM'ing the volunteer, no other individuals outside the circle would be aware of it.

My biggest concern would be the outside public. With topics, such as abortion, that are sensitive and tend to be seen as controversal, it would be awful to have the outside public interfering. People are quick to judge, and with a subject like abortion, have this strong urge to tell people their two cents.

The background check involved collecting information such as name, all addresses in which the person lived within the past five years, and social security number.

They would send us back a report with information we requested, which was usually just included any citations or violations that had been filed within the last 10 years. As long as there weren't any violations that were flagrantly offensive (minor traffic violations were usually okay, anything involving violence, alcohol, or drugs was not), we moved on to the reference check.

For the reference check, we usually asked the applicant to submit anywhere between 2 and 4 references, one of whom has known the applicant for X number of years (usually somewhere between 1 and 5, depending on the position). We'd ask these references about the applicant's character, level of personal responsibility, and whether they would trust this person alone with children (the nonprofit I worked for dealt with a lot of children).

This is kind of a PP-heavy approach and would probably be really complicated to get all of them on board, and I'm not sure how your site would fit in, but it would be a nice way for those of us without a lot of volunteering time on our hands to still help somehow.

A third option might be to set up another safe contact. So if a women needs to visit a clinic in a particular city, match her with both a safe home and a safe contact for both. If either the women holding safe house or the women seeking medical care has an issue, they can reach out to the third women for help.

You could also make a rule about that both parties must contact the third person during the visit and after the visit. That way if something is wrong the third women can immediately contact the police with the relevant details.",2,t3_26jcb2

No fear of having people freeload off of the money, since it's the provider who is approving it's use. And we can give the clinic discretion in the use of transit/room-and-board rebates.

Obviously it's not 100% perfect but you wouldn't be able to tell unless you saw the nipple anyway.

The additional damage caused by the secondary operation on the belly or butt should be avoided until the patient has recovered from the primary cancer treatment. Either the patient has already undergone chemo or is likely to start soon and the body is or will be weakened further. If radiotherapy is required it's better not to radiate the healthy tissue that is transplanted.

This is not to say immediate reconstructions are not performed, but usually these are done with silicone implants.

We went out, searched around the house, found no signs of anyone, and called it quits (after a brief lecture on how I should just scream my head off next time something like that happens).

Two hours later we went out for breakfast. When we came home we found that someone had tried prying the window in our backdoor apart. The frame was in pieces. 

The next day I decided I was being silly and called the sheriff's office to file a police report. About ten minutes later an officer came by, took some pictures of the scene, and talked to me about what had happened. While of course they never caught anyone, we got a case number, alerted the police to crime in the area, and got a ton of helpful tips on securing our home and property. The officer also gave us a pretty solid theory on what had happened and some information on crime in the area and what may have been causing a spike in activity. The only even mildly uncomfortable question he had was ""Why didn't you call us when it happened?"" And I answered him honestly that I thought I had imagined it and that was that. He was incredibly understanding and kind and I still have his card on my fridge in case there's ever another break in attempt. 

Yes, nothing happened, but this is still exactly the kind of thing the police need to know about, and yes, you can get valuable information out of just talking to the police. 

For me at least, it offered a lot of peace of mind having made that outside connection about the break in. I hope you can be comfortable in your apartment again soon. It's an awful feeling. :(",9,t3_26jjed

Safety and familiarity. In addition to basic safety/handling classes, most instructors also let you shoot a number of different guns/calibres to decide what you're most comfortable with.

20140527101920,Skully_Roger,"As someone who recently went through a pretty traumatic armed home invasion, I completely empathise with how you're feeling. The fear of when it happens in or around your own home is the worst. Mugged or attacked on the street? Still absolutely horrific experience but you can go home afterwards and feel a measure of safety. But when that sense of safety is taken from you, you start to feel like your own home is a ticking time bomb. Every sound, every shadow, gives you that horrible adrenaline spike and feeling of dread.


Someone here suggested putting bars on the windows and I highly recommend this. I know they look awful but I'm sure you can find ways of making them pretty funky. I'd also suggest an alarm if you can afford one, we have beams around the house now, it obviously won't stop an actual invasion but sometimes having that warning can at least give you an illusion of safety and a few moments to lock yourself in somewhere and call the cops. It also means you won't have the horror of waking up with someone in your home.


I also see you mentioned in another comment about learning self defence techniques/tools. I can't tell you how much this helped me get over my own ordeal, it helps you fight that sense of complete powerlessness that comes after something like this (though we were also told a thousand of times by police and other victims that if you are in an invasion situation to co-operate calmly - it still helps to know that if shit goes down you can at least do a bit of damage back to the bastards). Also as for guns I've heard too many stories about people waking up to find their own gun pointed at them, unless you're absolutely positive in your own ability to pull that trigger in this kind of situation I'd suggest something non-lethal like pepper spray.


And most importantly do not let them steal your own home from you. Do not let this break you. It fucking sucks so fucking much when something like this happens but you can't let it turn you into a paranoid wreck.

If someone pops the screen off from the outside, they can't slide the window open because the dowel blocks it from moving. This works for sliding glass doors too.

Those situations can turn nasty really quickly, and having a gun could save your life. 

However, owning a gun is a large responsibility, and I would only go this route if you are willing to take all the training and necessary precautions that go along with it. There is no sense in owning a gun if you don't know how to properly shoot it and take care of it.

Many cities have women-only gun safety courses, and (at least in my area) many ranges have women-shoot-free policies, and have workers who are more than willing to help you become a better shot. A good handgun isn't too expensive, and you don't need any sort of permit to own one and keep in your house (carrying in public is a different story). To purchase one, you usually have to be a resident of the state you are buying in, have no felonies or violent crimes on your record, and have not been institutionalized for mental instability (individual state laws vary, but thats the general idea).

There are different sizes of cups too, some have a larger capacity than the diva cup that I use. 

The real bonus IMO is two fold: On heavy days you empty less often than you'd change a tampon, and on light days, you don't get that scraped raw feeling when you pull out a dry tampon *shudder*.

I attend Harvard, my sister attended Dartmouth; my little brother, however, attends a Community college and throughout his time in high school had drug problems. I ask you: is he worthless? Or is he...worth less? Or perhaps he's fought off more demons than I could conceptualize that, in turn, had made him much stronger than I could ever be? He can literally fix anything that's broken in a house, yet I have trouble using a plunger. He can instinctively navigate and remember any address, location, intersection, etc from home...and find places with pure instinct. Me on the other hand? If my GPS fails I have to load up Google maps on my phone, type a nearby location, and navigate there with so much difficulty it's as if I'm solving some unsolved problem in  quantum physics.   
   
The point is, your ***worth*** is not dependent upon other people. This Elliot Rodgers was not some downtrodden geek with no options in life. He grew up in a wealthy family, drove a BMW, and wasn't bad looking. His problem was his sense of entitlement grew so large that he literally believed he was *owed* a relationship.   
   
People like Elliot, without the entitlement of course, need to stop looking at the world to determine their self-worth. Losing your virginity is not an accomplishment. Having a relationship doesn't mean you're ""winning"". Having no friends is an issue that can be solved with hard work, not some woe-is-me attitude.

It's shameful to admit, but the first time I had sex was partly because I had intimated that I would withdraw my friendship otherwise. This was an immoral act.

They **will** judge you. take this as a fact of life, a certainty you just have to accept, like needing to shit or having to drink water. Heck, sometimes the stuff they say to you is even true. Again, take not being perfect and having insult-able features as a fact of life that everyone obeys. 

So? 

The world has so much to offer. In your future you will meet so many amazing people, as long as you try. They won't be many but that doesn't matter. Them being nice in a sea of assholes will only make them shine brighter. All it takes is admitting defeat before even putting yourself out there and then going put anyways. Letting yourself either fail as expected or be surprised by success. Because nothing good will ever just fall in your lap. You have to work for ot, be a bit lucky and keep trying. But by avoiding social contact you will never have social contact. You lose every chance you don't take. 

So you're judged for being a virgin? Everybody gets shit for different reasons. You're virgin, he's short, she's fat, he has a big nose, she has a flat chest, he's awkward, she has a squeaky voice. Once you start empathizing with others around you you realize we all go through the same treatment. Even those elusive happy kids are putting up a front. I have met so many successful hot looking happy people who were depressed as shit. Never envy anyone. You have no idea what their life actually is like. I would never exchange my life for anybody else's because I know how much stuff can look perfect and be rotten on the inside.

You are not special. This is not a diss but a comfort. Your experiences are average. You are not a loser. To be a loser you'd have to stand out somehow but you are not. You share a great deal of experiences and feelings with countless men and women. You are not as lame, ugly, stupid, fat as you think you are. But this averageness this only means you are in the perfect place to go anywhere you want to. You, as a young person, have massive riches you aren't even aware of. Opportunity. So much possibility. This is a luxury that is lost with age. Virginity? Who the fuck cares about that when you have an entire world to explore. Make friends and become a person other people like, and other things shall follow. 

Few people label you as a loser because they care about you in any way, positive or negative. We are all self centered people playing a monologue in the lonely spotlight of our consciousness. We are too busy worrying about ourselves to concern ourselves with others. Once you realize that you realize how little people's remarks mean. They are all too busy with their own mental shit to evaluate you. It's all knee jerk reactions. You labeled as a failure? Who the fuck has time to actually look at you? Nobody. They just grab at some obvious fact like virginity and run with it. Their insults have no weight and no penetrability. 

Now you may ignore all above as a platitude, so let me just share with you my fool proof virginity busting tool - lie. Say you had sex once or twice with an ex. Boom! You are now officially not a virgin but a person with limited experience. Does it feel any different? No? Neither would having sex once or twice. Trust me, nobody can tell the difference. Having sex a couple of times doesn't actually teach you anything you already didn't know. To actually become proficient it takes years. Take this idea, believe it and act like it is true. It will make interactions so much easier even though it makes no sense.

20140529021620,woopwooppoowpoow,"And I am telling you you should choose better people to communicate with. I am also a loner, not so much by choice but by circumstance (though quite happy withy how my life is) and I take this kind of judgement as ""ok douchebag alert, abort mission"". 

Society is not a monolith. Other people are not homogenous. Heck, you can imagine that, as a woman, I had to deal with a bunch of shit from people who think women shouldn't or can't do certain things. But I do not generalize and assume all men or all people are like this. 

I used to think like you and then I changed my entourage (not friends just people around me) and everything changed dramatically. Most of it was also growing up and not being around teenagers/under 25 year olds. But a big part was also choosing a circle of acquaintances I could occasionally have a chat with, who were not douchebags. 

But also regarding the virgin thing, I was quite a late bloomer but nobody noticed or anything. i just didn't talk about it. Why are you talking about personal stuff that concerns nobody except you and perhaps the next person you kay bring home? 

Finally you may want to analyze why people treat you like a weirdo if by any chance you are contributing to it by being awkward about social cues. I am a pretty tolerant person and I can hang out with anyone for a chat unless they are skeevy and I can tell you some people just come off weird not because of who they are (virgin, fat, geek or whatever they think) but because they just haven't learned how to make social conversation. It's a skill that you have to put active energy in and perhaps a lot of effort to compensate for innate differences. 

So a weird person is not necessarily defined by who they are but I often meet people who just break social rules such as: talk too long and not pay attention that their partner is signaling boredom, ignore personal space and sort of hover too close despite the other person signaling awkwardness by stepping back, make sailor jokes with people they are not accustomed to yet and risk alienating them, not look into people's eyes or the opposite look without wavering, which unnerves people, misinterpreting politeness for interest, talking about stuff that is too serious or personal in the context of idle chat, use too fancy words from having read too many books, use too serious topics when the audience is not receptive etc

And the reason I mention this was that, by being a loner you get like this. Rusty at human interaction. Again, I had to deal with this as most of my teen years I was pretty much isolated and depressed for other reasons. At one point I took an executive decision to learn how to be social. Not to become a social butterfly (which I hate) but for my own good. And to give an example, I had to train myself how to laugh. I had spent so many years emotionally numb that smiling to me felt like a weird grimace. Completely unconnected to the act of being happy.

And in the beginning, I was, by all intents and purposes, weird. I felt like Robinson Crusoe coming back to society. And if you yourself isolate yourself to a degree, I am guessing it is similar. But the lessons I learned were - don't tell people shit they don't have to know. I did not tell people i had no friends, was an orphan, was a virgin, etc. If they mention it, make vague sounds of approval and change the subject. They wil most likely follow your cue. Empathize as much as possible. A conversation does not happen merely on the information level. Just as important is the level of interaction. Here you exchange mild entertainment and empathy for social points. You have to cultivate being a pleasant somewhat funny and accepting persona. And people will then enjoy talking to you. After many fails I actually became a ""fun person"" and I am telling you it feels like a suit. It's not me, but it's something I can put  on to go out into the world. And it serves me not just for friends. By far the most important uses are for work, interviews, workplace interaction, getting paperwork done, solving problems. You may be fine with being a loner but you need this kind of skill for so much stuff.

So if you find yourself in a shitty social situation, don't accept it as final nor as general. Change it out. By the people you interact with and by yourself.

From wiki.

I strongly, strongly disagree with your idea that he wasn't 'so driven' by his need to kill women. Let's look at his pattern, here: he targed people close to him (his roommates), then went to his next target: women. When that failed he went on an outright spree. His main targets should be determined to be personally connected to him, and women. 

I'll be honest here, your comment really disturbs me because you seem to be taking lack of body count to mean that misogyny wasn't a driving force. Meanwhile you then go on to say 'he hated the males getting laid' but ignore the obvious problem, here - he hated them for getting something that he felt *entitled* to. It is all strongly shaped and guided by his view of women as sexual objects to be attained for his own gratification. 

As I said before, his mental health is a big part of this, but the misogyny embedded in his hatred towards women and the men who had attained what he hadn't - physical access to women - should not be ignored. ",4,t3_26j0w0
20140526235430,IAmTheNightIAmBatman,"I honestly do not think you understand my point. Misogyny was a driving force. Okay sure. He hated women; this isn't under debate. The fact you seem to glaze over is the fact that sane minded people DO NOT KILL OVER THAT. You can hate someone til the cows come home. That doesn't mean you are going to shoot them to death. Hatred has caused people to do awful things to other people, but generally killing each other isn't something a right minded person does or even considers. Yes, he hated women. BUT you are failing to take into consideration the fact that he was clearly mentally disturbed and that this was the underlying factor of it all. This isn't some opportunity to make a public agenda of women's rights. You know what he was more than misogynistic? Narcissistic. He thought because he had money and good looks, he deserved the world, that he's entitled. So, sure, let's talk about changing the fact that a lot of guys determine their worth around getting laid along with how women are seen as objects. Talk about how sex is seen in general by the media. How money affects people's values. Make a big public forum about it. BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. You're ignoring just how full of himself this guy was and just how out of touch with reality he was, to the point he felt the whole world needed to die besides himself. As a woman, I know we aren't treated equally, and it sucks. People with mental illnesses are treated worse.  I will agree to disagree with you, but honestly I think you should sort out your priorities. 

Edit: Grammar",2,t3_26j0w0
20140527001234,codeverity,"The fact that people with mental illnesses are treated poorly should be a reason for you to *want* us to discuss his hatred and misogyny, to be honest. You know why? Because talking about spree killers only in the sense of highlighting their illness only serves to stigmatise them further. There are many mentally ill people who *do not* go on spree killings, and that's in large part because they aren't driven by seething hatred. 

So we need to strike a delicate balance - emphasise that mental illness is something that our society needs to work on and fix, but also emphasise the fact that this man's hatred also fuelled his actions. Which goes back to my original point: we need to talk about both. ",0,t3_26j0w0
20140527005727,DeSanti,"You know, this whole case sort of reminds me about the case of ABB here in Norway -- who slaughtered 77 teenagers and adults back in '11 because of a paranoid, insane world-view that he held.

The main point of the trial there was whether or not he was criminally or legally insane. The question was never if he was sane or not, but if he was *criminally* so, which would have meant psychiatric treatment rather than the prison. Now the entire process is something of a clusterfuck but in the end he was judged legally insane and fit to be judged as a sane person. 

The point I was trying to make, though, was that no one was denying him of being insane. That was evident by his actions alone, a sane person does not kill 77  teenagers belonging to a political camp without mercy just because he think he's some Knight Templar Reborn and was preventing a Muslim Invasion. 

Fact is that all the racism, the paranoia, the fear, the delusion of grandeur and so on; it requires a mind with absolute lack of empathy, a lack of understanding consequence and valuing human life. And it's not an excuse, it's a very valid, very central piece of it all.

For example, one can talk about charisma unrelated to flirtation/sex as seduction.  Hell, this prominent Infectious diseases physician was talking to me the other day about finding my inner seductiveness when engaging with people.  He didn't mean talk to everybody sexually/flirtatiously.  He was talking charisma.

And even in sexual terms, I think seduction can be a good thing.  If a partner seduces his/her partner (the partner of course wanting to be seduced), it's just sexy times with a little extra sexiness and passion.

I don't often post to 2X, because as a guy I don't necessarily feel that I will receive overwhelming support for my opinions, but here it goes.  I read through E.R.'s manifesto, or most of it anyways.  From what I have gathered, I can tell that he was spoiled, narcissistic and obviously forming radical ideas about women and sexuality.  I recall him being offered and job which would have required him to clean bathrooms.  He considered this beneath him and would never degraded himself by doing something like that.  Indeed, I believe that these personality traits contributed to his radicalization and I think he could have learned something about humility.  Nevertheless, I found myself wishing that I was able to reach out to him.  Not that there is anything that I can say to him now, nor would I if he had survived this whole ordeal.  I suppose for me that once you cross that line and decide to take innocent life, you no longer deserve my sympathies.


 No, I wished that I could have reached him when he was forming these ideas.  To let him know that he was not alone, and not unique in suffering indignation at the hands of women while trying to vie for their attention.  I know there is little comfort in knowing that someone is suffering beside you,  I prefer to see people happy and thriving.  But in a very real way, I could understand some of the pain he was going through.  I have myself been ridiculed by women I was trying to court.  One experience, when I was called ""a pussy"" and ""a loser"" really stuck with for a really long time.  I was incensed, mortified and despaired.  How can you be so callous and cruel?  I was trying so hard to gain your affection, trying to make you laugh, to feel desired, to build you up and yet you are trying to tear me down?  I don't know that many women truly understand the hopelessness of a situation like that.  She may not have stabbed me in the heart, but at times I wished she had.  I had at times felt panicked, doomed to a life of solitude and unfulfillment.  That no matter what I did, that could never fight this perception of me by other women.  That whatever she saw in me, that others would see the same as though I was permanently marked or scarred.  This had profound ramifications on my psyche, outlook and motivations.  I had been rather successfully in other regards, I was smart, had many good friends and up until now had been pretty happy, but when it came to women things just fell apart for me.  I guess I would point to [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), to explain how I felt at the time.  I felt as though my emotional development was disrupted at the ""Love/Belong"" stage and without that kind of fulfillment that the higher order needs ""Esteem"" and ""Actualization"" could not not fully be realized.  I tried to push through this and build as sense of esteem, pride and achievement, but without the love, support and affirmation of a woman none of these things really seemed to matter as though I was building upon a tower that was ready to collapse at any moment.


Well, now I have put myself out in the open, share some of my most intimate though and said that I can related to some of what Elliot was going through, what is my point?   I guess one thing that I will always haunt me about tragedies such as these is that I think that it could have been prevented at any point.  Granted, I think that Elliot needed to reshaped the way he though about women and sex.   I wonder how he might have reacted if he was told the truth that sex was for me, as it was for many others I gather, another disappointment that does live up to your expectations of what it will be.  But really, I think that this was not just about sex as it was about acceptance.  It seems to me that society/humanity has a terrible way of picking on it weak.  What an injustice is that, these are people that are most in need of our compassion and yet we treat them with scorn and ridicule.  Why would a girl I was trying to attract call me a loser?  Because she could, because there is no repercussions for doing so.  I know that the world can be a harsh place and sometimes all you can do is have thick skin and poke back, but I hope that people would learn from such tragedies and show more compassion towards others.

I'd like to clarify by saying that I understand that women should try to be empathetic and kind when they reasonably can, when they are rejecting potential suitors, and people in genral should be kind to one another.

I don't believe that murdering other is ever a justified means of dealing with your emotional issues.  I mean how can I on the one hand argue for a more compassionate world, but on the other argue that his murder justified?  That is a complete contradiction and I think you might be misreading/reading into what I am trying to say.


I do, however think that it is easier to disregard/dehumanize Elliot, by labeling him as a monster or crazy than it is to attribute any relatable emotion to him.

Please don't think that I am trying to blame women for this, or that I am implying I think that they deserved this.  


I was fortunate enough to have a supportive group of friends and family to talk to during my darkest days and perhaps if Elliot had the benefit of something similar he may have deviated from the course that lead to that ultimate end.  Trust me, if I was able to talk to him about any of this to be sure I would have pointed out the fallacies of his ways.  How self-entitled and egocentric he was being, how misguided and objectifying his view of women was.  Of course they aren't going to like you.

20140526184851,settler_colonial,"i didn't interpret the above as suggesting that there should be repercussions... just that for people in positions of social power there often aren't repercussions for humiliating the weak. If we are honest with ourselves and remember the times we've humiliated others, we all know that doing so makes us feel good about ourselves. That's why people do it... even if we remember those events with some guilt or shame.

I read the manifesto and watched the videos too. Clearly there is something more deeply wrong with this kid beyond the twisted red-pill ideology he took his unhelpful solace in. /u/funroll-loops seems to be arguing that the best individual response to tragedies such as this one is to reflect on how our own behaviors contribute to a culture that produces such messed up people as Rodgers. 

I want to tell a little story. When I was in year 11 I remember a new kid came to school who'd been home schooled up until then. I won't go into the details but he was extremely confused and anxious about sex and sexuality and despite trying his best to make social connections was routinely humiliated. Since I could empathize with his marginalization (and also all my good friends had dropped out of school) we became friends. I introduced him to my out-of-school circle and we tried to look after him because he was a good man and an interesting character. We also made fun of him all the time in our Aussie country-blokish mode of socialization and homo-social care. That probably hurt him more than we realized. The long and short of it is that when university etc separated us after high school and he didn't have any social support he started getting weird. He wasn't able to make the kind of social connections that he'd had with our little posse. He was socially alienated. When we spoke on the phone (often, because one friend and I were quite worried about him) he'd tell as tales about going to prostitutes and swinger parties. I don't know if they were true or what. He was probably trying to establish some kind of sexual identity that to his mind was respectable. Within months he dropped out of uni and joined the navy and pretty soon he was dead. The navy said it was ""unnatural causes"" which I assume means he topped himself. I guess the point of this story is that when young men are particularly confused about sex and sexuality and are also extremely socially marginalized to the point of alienation it does them massive damage. In the words of my mate from the old posse, the moral is: ""always look after the stragglers"". ",4,t3_26j0w0

Also, this article is a bit naive when it comes to advising men on what they should value about themselves and how that translates to being attractive to women.

You will probably have an easy time getting a guy if you're a pretty girl, who is nice and interesting. You're probably going to have an easy time getting a guy if you're an average looking girl, who's nice and interesting. But the fact is, being a man and getting a girl takes work. It's a contrivance of making sure you look good, making sure you say the right thing, making sure you behave correctly, making sure you project confidence, and making sure it all looks like you aren't doing any of those things. This woman's advice is clearly the perspective of someone who doesn't understand what it takes to charm women because she has never had to be a man who has to charm women. I'm not saying that the PUA technique is the one men should be employing -- many of them are manipulative and amoral -- but if you go according to this woman's advice alone you will be sorely disappointed and lonely. Every man learns this lesson, unless he looks like Ryan Gosling and/or has natural charisma. The rest of us need to learn how to do it, and you don't learn how to do it from women, because they will give you naive, useless advice.

And the 18-20 year old males will have a tougher time (I always remind guys that age that it will get better...18 year old girls are not as fond of 18-19 year old guys as they are of 22-25 year old guys, in general...reasons).

There are always exceptions, but as a man gets into his mid twenties, his prospects widen up.  

We can discuss the reasons why many men, aged 28, would prefer a 21 year old woman to a 28-30 year old woman, but a 21 year old woman may often have males aged 18-30 (and from even broader age groups) ""competing"" for her.  

An 18 year old male is unlikely to have women aged 18-30 competing equally for him.  His own age mates are likely to ignore him (and this is a source of angst for many a young man).  

It all evens out in our 30's and 40's, but the earlier ages may be developmentally geared toward establishing patterns of dating/sexual engagement.  

Every semester, there are at least two or three 18 year old women in a class of 100 who are dating men over 30.  46 is so far the oldest boyfriend anyone has admitted to in the past 15 years of me asking the question.

No, no one is neglecting that fact. This whole thing is devastating and no one here is saying that the women who were killed were more important than the men. What they are saying is that if he'd gotten in that door, the body count could have been much larger (which was his goal).

When you say ""get"", you mean ""have sex with"". Now here's the thing, you're not considering the social climate surrounding sexual stigmas at all. The reason it is easier for a woman who wants sex to get it than it is for a man is because society has decided that women shouldn't want anonymous sex, and shames those women who do. Men, on the other hand, who want anonymous sex are encouraged to do so, and those who achieve it are praised. Not only that, but it's just easier for men to have a satisfying sexual experience. Men's bits are typically pretty straightforward, women's bits - while also not that complicated, do typically (at least in my experience) require a little bit more effort to get a satisfying sexual experience. Additionally, there's always an inherent danger involved when you decide to go somewhere alone with someone who you've just met that can physically dominate you, which further pushes women away from pursing anonymous sex.

So why is it easy for women to ""get"" men? Because anonymous sex typically just works better and is more rewarding for men than women, both due to social pressures and the satisfaction from the act itself.

If instead of using ""get"" to mean get sex, we use it to mean get romantic needs fulfilled, then no, it's not easier for women to ""get"" men than vice versa. If we talk strictly about the difficulty of both sexes finding partners who fulfill their very specific needs, I think it's pretty equal.",9,t3_26j0w0

No. I reject this premise and thus your entire argument.

>If instead of using ""get"" to mean get sex, we use it to mean get romantic needs fulfilled, then no, it's not easier for women to ""get"" men than vice versa.

The first thing either sex needs to do is get the other sex to take interest. It's easier for women to get men to take interest because men are typically interested by looks first. As long as a woman doesn't do anything insane, if she walks up to a dude, and he's single and says ""Hey, I think you're cute. Lets get a drink sometime"" everything will go fine. The reverse will not work most of the time unless the dude is either REALLY smooth or REALLY good-looking and at least a little bit smooth. Any awkwardness and that shit gets canceled. If there is awkwardness on the woman's side it's probably not going to be that big of a deal, as long as it isn't egregious. That's just in a one-off stranger approach type situation.

Okay, that's just not true. Women can't just walk up to random men they don't know and get guaranteed dates, at least not anymore than guys can. If you're a woman, you must be exceptionally attractive to think this is the case, and if you're a dude, then who on earth told you that this is how dating works for women? 

Asking total strangers out to drinks will almost never net you a date, regardless of your gender. People (men and women) have better shit to do with their time than go on random dates with people they know nothing about. People who will definitely say yes to a date from anyone are extremely desperate. I don't know why would use this as an example anyways, since it's not something that anyone actually does. I get that you're trying to reduce the situation to it's most basic premise by forgoing any conversation topic or whatever, but this basic premise doesn't get dates IRL.

Anyone who has told you that they would hands down say yes to someone who asked them out on a date without any prior conversation has probably never had someone ask them out on a date without any prior conversation.",3,t3_26j0w0

Also, have as much fun as you can now. Be safe, obviously, but do all of the things you want as much as you can *right now*. Once you graduate and have to enter college/the real world, you'll hardly ever have time for the hobbies and passions you used to love.

> ""Just respect yourself. You have to love yourself, have faith in yourself and that way you won't take mess from no one else. A lot of these young girls get manipulated by these young guys by them just telling them ""you aren't this or that"" and controlling them. Just love yourself and know your worth. Don't settle for less. Some kids may not be raised around someone who's strong. My father was abusive to my mother, but my mother left him. My mother showed me her strength. I knew she was a strong woman raising 6 kids by herself. As far as self-respect and being strong, it was her.""

How to change a tire/pump your own gas

Start thinking about what you want to study in college and take into account the average salary in that field. Salary.com is fantastic.

Improve hygiene habits- look up studies on how to treat your body now. Brushing teeth, putting on deodorant, taking care of your skin, etc. are actually a lot more complicated to do RIGHT than you may believe. 

Eat/ drink for the 50 year old you. Not the 16 year old you. 

Self defense classes ARE A MUST! If you/ your parents have the financial wiggle room, DO IT! Not just for your safety, but also for a different perspective on life. Many martial arts have wonderful philosophies - not something you want to miss out on.

Don't be afraid of mistakes. You're gonna make them. You're gonna hurt people. The best thing you can do is learn from those mistakes and swallow your pride. Then try to make someone smile :)

20140526132158,DuckOFace,"1. Abuse rarely starts with overt, obvious signs. If someone you care about starts routinely suggesting ways you could ""enhance"" your looks or ""look prettier"" take a long hard look at their motives. Maybe they're being helpful, or maybe they're starting the process of wearing down your self-esteem.

2. Start moisturizing your face AND neck now. Get a gentle, oil free moisturizer and moisturize daily. You will appreciate it when you're thirty.

3. If you aren't doing it already, start eating healthy and exercise regularly. Nothing serious or crazy, just get some veggies in and take a walk around the block.

4. If you aren't sure if you want to go to college, or aren't sure what you want to do, no sweat. Taking a year off to work is not going to hurt you, no matter what they scare you with in high school (Ivy League universities at be different). And if you want to start but don't know what you want, go to a local community college. Get your general education credits while taking a few exploratory courses. You'll be exposed to lots of things and hopefully find your passion without spending a ton of money.

5. Go easy on the daily makeup. It should enhance. It can be hard on your skin, so try not to overdo it.

6. Don't be scared of turning 25, 30, 35, etc. This will obviously be different for everyone, but life has gotten a lot more fun as I've grown older. I love being in my thirties, and so should you!",2,t3_26ioew

20140526142209,HotDickens,"Here are some things i wish i knew, and some things that i'm glad i did when i was younger.

Actions speak louder than words. If someone says one thing, but their actions repeatedly hurt you, blow you off or contradict their promises, then they didn't mean those words and probably don't care about you as much as you care about them. These people are okay to leave. And sometimes, they aren't worth giving a second chance. there are a lot of people that didn't deserve my forgiveness and compassion for a second, third, fourth or even fifth try. 

Learn to forgive easily for small things, and not automatically forgive the big things. People make mistakes and a little compassion goes a long way. 

Be honest with yourself over what you feel is important and don't let other people belittle those feelings. your feelings matter, as irrational and overwhelming as they sometimes seem. 

Listen to your gut and follow your intuition. If something is making you feel uncomfortable, it's okay to remove yourself from whatever is making you uncomfortable.

People don't change unless they want to. choose friends based on the present, not the past. If someone is being totally awful who used to be a good friend, it's alright to move on to new people. 

It's better to be alone than with people who don't treat you right. You deserve good friends and if those are in short supply, don't feel like you need to be with people just so you at least have one friend. Some people aren't worth keeping around, and can actually make you feel worse than any loneliness ever could. And if you do end up being alone, use the time to better yourself.

sports and physical exercise aren't just for the fit kids! Weightlifting is fun! Frisbees are fun! cycling is fun! swimming is fun! I can't believe all the years Ive wasted when i could have been having a really good time and feeling better about myself. 

Fake confidence. fake it til you make it is very real! be brave, be loud, take risks. Challenging yourself this way will help you be a resourceful, capable young adult. A lot of your peers are just like you, learning about who they are as people, discovering themselves and all that. So don't feel bad if you feel like you haven't figured something out that others are weather its sex, relationships, friendships what have you. Don't sweat these things!

Read books. so many books. some books i read now i think to myself ""i would've really liked this in my teens"" or ""i'm glad i read that in my teens."" catcher in the rye, ender's game, speaker for the dead, watchmen, maus, slaughterhouse 5, breakfast of champions, stephen king novels and fear and loathing in las vegas were books/comics I read when I was around your age that I had really enjoyed. Look for books that sound interesting to you and read them! It's so easy to put off reading books so make a little time and make a habit of it.

also, if you're really interested in something, or even just mildly curious, go out and do something about it! Don't let having a weird/uncool hobby, interest or passion hold you back :) You like art? go to a gallery! you're interested in writing but aren't confident in your abilities? write anyway, and post to a forum for comments and criticism! same thing with music! And even if they're not typical/popular interests, you can find communities for almost any interest on the internet. Coding, welding, cooking, taxidermy, wood working, carpentry, animation, poetry, activism, geology, etc. Get the fire in your belly started young

I've spent many years working my hardest at school, so don't let peer pressure or anything else detract from your work ethic and dedication to a successful education. 

Relationships. You do *not* have to take anyone's shit. Most likely your first relationships will fail, and that's alright. If you know it's just not going to work out, then move on! I definitely think you will know the right person when you find them. When you meet that person who you can share everything (even the gross and embarrassing things), you'll know that's the one for you. Don't settle for anything less.

That way if your stuff gets stolen or lost, you'll have a way to call your contacts for a way out. I always keep a calling card on me when traveling.

When traveling in sketchy areas, keep your credit cards & some cash in your shoe or sock. Also for sketchy areas, never get in a taxi that you haven't called for. Never tell a stranger where you're staying.

If you'll be traveling through areas without cell reception I highly recommend getting a SPOT device. If your car breaks down you can have the SPOT send a pre-set custom message & your current location to your emergency contacts with something like, ""Hey my car broke down, can you call the nearest towing company to my location?""

Also, get a full size spare tire. I just learned that lesson this weekend - got a flat 100 miles from town with no cell reception, and the manual said to only drive on the spare tire for 45 miles. Whoops...

I'm a fellow solo female traveller, and have travelled solo in Europe, Asia, and South America. The most important thing is to have your wits about you at all times. Do not put yourself into a situation that could turn bad, and always have an escape plan. Don't feel bad for missing out on 'authenticity' if you have a bad gut feeling. 

And since few seem to have mentioned it: Traveller's health insurance. Get it. It's really important to get a policy (and it will be heaps cheaper than US insurance normally is). Carry the card and information with you at all times, and make an emergency contact card with the contact information of a relative or close friend that you carry on your person. 

A final, favourite tactic of mine is to lie my face off. Are you alone? Nope, my husband is in the truck! Where are you going? Insert some place the complete opposite direction of where I'm going.

20140526161227,xsfoolishness,"I personally have been using the cup for about 8 years, and the only brand I have tried is DivaCup, which I have been very happy with. 

As far as sizing, there are only two. They recommend using size one unless you've had a child, so start there. The size difference is tiny.

I have heard that switching to menstrual cups have reduced cramping in some women. I have not had this experience, however, my cramps were never that terrible to begin with. 

The ""suction"" that is mentioned is less ""suction"" and more like creating a proper seal around the walls of your vagina to keep blood flowing inside the cup instead of around and down it. The tiny air holes on the side of the Divacup allow it to expand inside of you, but once it's open those holes are now very gently helping create a seal. 

The cup does not rest against your cervix and is worn slightly lower then a tampon. It's soft and flexible, so it's not painful at all. If you are experiencing pain, something is not normal. The stem on the DivaCup is supposed to help pull it out, and can be a little uncomfortable. DivaCup suggests cutting the stem respectively if it pokes you, which I do. I find it easier to pull it out from the base of the cup anyway, not the stem.

Learning how to put it in and out does take practice, and I suggest wearing liners the first time you go a cycle on your cup until you learn how to properly put it in and can recognize if it's not sitting inside of you correctly. It can be in and almost expanded, but if it's not and there is no seal, you will have leaks. That being said, it's really not hard once you have had some practice and have a system that works for you.

Just like a tampon, you do not have to empty it when you pee or poop. Although you cannot feel it normally, sometimes depending on how I'm sitting it can feel like I need to pee when I don't. 

Public restrooms are not that bad. The cup lasts a lot longer then a tampon or pad (up to 12 hours even on a heavy day) and on the rare occasion that you have to empty in a public restroom, your fingers will get a little messy but it's easily wiped mostly clean with TP. Then just wash your hands as normal. I have never had an issue in a public bathroom. 

All the pros and cons factored in, I love my cup HANDS DOWN. Not only is it easier on my wallet, it's environmentally friendly, saves a ton on packing space, making water activities easier, and i'm not wrapping up any old tampons to leave in garbage cans around the world. Make the switch!

I got my first Diva Cup about 8 years ago. It took me about three cycles to really get the hang of it, where I was confident enough not to carry a tampon too. The suction was a little too strong and it seemed to have trouble expanding properly and creating a seal. So I sterilized a safety pin and gently inserted it in the holes, increasing their size ever so slightly. It was enough for it to unfold when inserted. The second one i got after my first child didn't have any problem in that area. 

I found that sometimes the seal would pop when I had a difficult BM and i pushed hard. 

My cramps greatly decreased when i switched to the cup. They were very sharp and intense before, now they're mostly a dull ache if i have them at all.

It's definitely one of the best purchases I've ever made.",7,t3_26jqy6
20140527001055,caviabella,"You can feel when it expands/unfolds and when the seal breaks? Like, for sure? Or is it one of those ""I think that maybe might of could have been...""? ",2,t3_26jqy6
20140526205158,kiiiwiii,"The Diva Cup works great for me. 


My cramps are noticeably better with the Diva Cup compared to using tampons. 


When inserted correctly, there should be no pain at all. You actually shouldn't even feel it. 


The blood flows directly into the cup, so you should not get any on your hands when you are removing it since blood doesn't actually touch the outside of the cup. 


Nope, you just have to empty it out when it's full so the timing has nothing to do with if you've gone pee or not. 


The stem is not painful at all. It depends on how the cup sits in you, but I've read some women prefer to trim the stem so it does not stick out. For me, the cup sits higher so I am so thankful for the stem (it helps me pull it out) and would never trim it off.


You should not be able to feel it at all. 


I just got mine last month so it's only been one cycle, and it's been easier than I predicted. I'd recommend practicing a few times before your period actually starts, just to get the hang of it. It was actually great because I put it in the day my period was supposed to start, and then didn't have to worry about tampons or running to the washroom in the middle of being out. 

",6,t3_26jqy6
20140527001953,caviabella,"Thanks for suggesting I try it before my  period starts. That's a good idea! It makes me feel better knowing you're new to it but already like it! How do you know when it's sitting where it's supposed to be?",2,t3_26jqy6

20140527003258,kiiiwiii,"No problem! I inserted and removed it twice before my period started, and that was all I needed to feel comfortable enough to use it once it actually started. The first time I inserted it, it felt somewhat uncomfortable/I could feel it, so I took it out right away. Then I waited until later in the day and gave it another try. That time, I couldn't feel it at all (much like a tampon). I guess you just know it's in correctly when you can't feel it. You should not be able to notice anything at all.

Size is based on the brand. Some have two some have more. Go to their site and look at what they say. I'm bigger too and that may mean you will need a bigger size but since you are young maybe not. Look at their size charts and comparative ones found online. 

Divacup and Mooncup are the big US brands. I have a Mooncup and two MeLunas which are German. They are all good brands. Meluna has the most in terms of size options but you have to order it online. I did. Nbd. But the traditional choices I listed are also great. 

I have minimal cramps but I get sore. Cotton absorbs all moisture. Sore, dry, bad. Cups hold, not absorb. I noticed less pain in that respect. 

They seal when inside but no pressure is felt and when you take it out you easily break that seal, also pain free. 


You never really need to change them in public. You can wear it longer than tampons so minimal need and no need to change every bathroom break. Twice a day is more than enough for most folks flows. I change it when I get up and again when I get back from work. If you do, empty it, wipe it with tp and put it back in. Clean it more intensely later. That isn't a problem. 

I trimmed my stem so it's round. But you can cut it off. The cup is easily grabbed on its own. But if you leave the stem you won't feel it. Cut it to suit you and what you feel comfortable with. 

I can't feel it at all. I could feel tampons and their pressure from expanding after a few hours. No feeling it. Easy to get in and out. I never struggled. At all. I expected to a little. I didn't. 

You would need to talk to your doc about cups and IUDs.

I had similar problems with tampons (I had to angle them to stay in) though so I'm sure it's something you would be aware of by now if you had similar issues!

20140526161749,nerdscallmegeek,"I have a copper IUD (and had a Mirena IUD for five years before that) and I've yet to have any problem with the diva cup which is the brand I use.

Unless you've had kids, go with the smaller size. Just because you're a slightly bigger gal doesn't mean your vaginal canal is wider. 

You don't have to change it usually more than twice a day. Once when you get up and once before you go to bed so you really don't have to change it anywhere but home. 
It's silicon so there's no chance of toxic shock syndrome like tampons. You can keep it in for like twelve hours and you can even put it in before your period even starts so there's no ""surprises"". 

With my copper IUD I have a hella heavy flow and I still never really fill the thing. I think I've had to change it three times in a day once and it was right after I got my IUD inserted when my periods were twice as heavy as they are now. I still wear a pantyliner with it just in case it leaks a little but it's hardly ever more than a couple drops.

If you absolutely have to change it in a public restroom, you can just wipe out the excess blood off the cup with toilet paper and reinsert it until you change it at home. 

There are very informative YouTube videos showing you how to insert and remove the diva cup properly with minimal spillage on your hand if any at all. And blood wipes away with toilet paper so no worries there.

The suction doesn't hurt and I almost immediately forget it's in. It actually feels a lot better than a tampon because there's no string rubbing anywhere or getting in the way when I go to the bathroom. 

The tip isn't sharp and it points down so it's not poking anything. 

I still get cramps but they're not bad. Actually the only time I do get cramps is if I have to poop cuz the cup kind of presses against your rectum ever so slightly which is a little uncomfortable if there's something in there. (TMI but whatever) 

You have to be comfortable sticking at least your finger and thumb partially inside your vagina to pull it out. You just sit on the toilet, bear down a little to bring it close enough to grab, squeeze it a little to break the suction, then gently pull it out over the toilet bowl and pour it out. 

Have a few pieces of toilet paper handy to set it on and wipe it out with. Finish your bathroom business then rinse out the cup with hot water really well, dry it off, reinsert it and you're good to go!

- In public restrooms, take a bottle of water in with you to rinse it off.
- After you've finished using it for the month, boil or run under scalding water and scrub with an old toothbrush.
- If the stem is too long and bothersome you can snip it off completely.

20140526161906,dontmovedontmoveahhh,"1. The most important factor in choosing a size is how heavy your period is. A small cup is still bigger then a tampon and if those aren't falling out you don't have to worry about being too big for a small cup. There are virgins who need the extra capacity a larger cup offers. You sound like a candidate for the smaller cup but it's up to you.


2. There other brands available in the US. Lunette and Sckoon cup are both available in the US on amazon.com. The diva cup is one of the longest cups available and some women find it uncomfortable. The lunette is perfect in my opinion, but if you can only find a Diva cup I wouldn't worry about it,

3. Anecdotal evidence says menstrual cups do help with cramps but I don't believe it stops them for most users. I've never heard of a menstrual cup causing or worsening cramps but there's no research that I'm aware of on this subject.

4. The suction forms a seal that keeps the blood in the cup, you won't feel it. If you try to pull it out without breaking the suction (wither by squeezing the cup or using a finger) it might feel uncomfortable but I've never felt any painful.

5. You can go as long as 12 hours without changing it so it's fairly rare that it needs to be done in public unless your period is very heavy.  The handicap stall is great for rinsing cups! There a number of solutions. Some people bring in a water bottle, others dump it out and reinsert without rinsing. I just clean up with toilet paper so no blood is visible to any curious observe and go rinse everything in the sink.

6. No, not unless you want to.

7. No, it's made of soft silicone and shouldn't poke or scratch, although the Diva cups is a little stiff for my liking personally, you can trim the stem or turn the cup inside out so you don't have to deal with the stem at all.

8. It's similar to a tampon once inserted, if you can feel tampons, you will probably feel the cup but if you normally don't notice tampons you won't notice a cup

9. There's a learning curve to insertion and removal, the first couple times it'll take you a little longer but once you're familiar it doesn't take any longer then the insertion and removal of a tampon. You'll want to follow the instructions and there are great resources for troubleshooting if you do have trouble.

10. I use a menstrual cup and an IUD, it's pretty common especially if you get the copper IUD. You just have to make sure you don't accidentally pinch the strings when you remove your cup or the IUD will come out with your cup. It's not difficult but you do have to be careful.

There have been times where I've had to pull all nighters, but that's cos I have bad time management. So just make sure you manage your time well or be prepared to stay up all night (I've don't some of my best work when I did it all in one night haha). So I'm not suggesting don't do your work, but I'm just saying somethings don't need your 100% effort.

Don't be afraid to talk to someone just cos you think they're too popular or something for you cos I've thought that a couple times but those people actually ended up being good friends.

If it's a larger school, speaking from experience here, don't be too overly worried about being well liked or being popular. There's usually going to be someone who is willing to be your friend. 

The idea that ""no one does drugs"" in high school is a blatant lie, but you still don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. The same goes for sex.

For the love of god, do your homework. Ask for help. Go after extra credit opportunities, because they will become scarce. Especially if you decide to take AP courses.

No matter how many hard classes I've taken each year, I've made it a point to get at least one class in my schedule I could completely blow off. It helps.

Do not worry about your clothes. Wear what's comfortable and what makes you feel good. The trope of a bitchy clique of girls who spend all day making fun of other girls for their clothes is pure fiction. 

If you end up failing at romantic endeavors in high school, don't freak out about it. I'm going into my senior year, and I know plenty of people who haven't had any kind of serious relationship. It's not an uncommon thing, don't let anyone make you think it is.",3,t3_26jqrg

When you're assigned a large project (read a book, write an essay, conduct an experiment), immediately break it into smaller steps, figure out how long each step will take you, and create your own mini-deadlines for those steps.  Put them in your planner.  Last-minute work sucks.  

Do something you like.  Join the band, try out for a sport or a play, write for the newspaper, whatever you're into, but have something you do that isn't academics and that you like.

Don't stretch yourself too thin.  Do one thing you like, or maybe two, not five.  Accept that in life, you can never do ALL the things.  You'll have more fun if your extras don't stress you out by eating all your time.

Don't worry that much about dating.  Some people do.  Some people don't.  It doesn't make that much difference in whether you'll ultimately end up in a happy adult relationship.  

Regarding sex:  The brain, heart, and loins are involved.  Don't have sex until your heart says 'I am in love,' your loins say, 'I am horny,' AND your brains say, 'I'm prepared with effective birth control, and having sex with this person is a wise choice.'  If even one of three says 'no,' skip it.  There'll be another chance for sex later.

Make good judgments. Don't let any peers pressure you into doing anything you don't want to. High school isn't quite like what you've seen in TV and movies, but the pressure to fit in is still there.

But at the same time, if you want to dress all pretty and wear makeup and heels, do it. Your choices are your choices and no one else's.

20140527001529,GerundQueen,"Hi! Congratulations, my sister is going into high school next year too! (Y'all are growing up way too fast, btw.) I have a couple of points of... *ahem*...""wisdom"" which you may or may not wish to review. I'm going to divide it up into academic advice and general life advice.


Academically: Learn good study habits. Seriously. Even if you don't need to study, that won't always be true on down the line. Good habits include 

-Taking neat, organized notes.

-Reading over the notes you take when you get home everyday. (This doesn't take nearly as long as you think it will)

-Reading your textbook cover to cover. if you read a section or two each day, in between classes, this isn't as monumental a task as you might think.

-Learn a new language. Even if it isn't offered at your school. Seriously, pick a country you wanna visit someday, go to the website cafemocha (or some  other free language learning site) and start doing the lessons in your spare time. I picked Japanese and I currently live in Japan. Did I know that's what I was gonna do when I was 14? No, I just knew I liked anime and I liked the Japanese voices better than the English voices, but it's a skill that has been very handy.

-Start rigorously studying for tests three days before they happen.

-If your teacher gives you a syllabus, TAPE THAT THING TO THE FRONT OF YOUR BINDER. Don't lose it! Treat it like the word of God and check it every day to make sure you don't have something coming up.

-Participate in extra curricular activities. I was in one service based club, some academic teams, and I did choir and dance which was fun for me. If you apply to college, these things will give you a more well-rounded resume.

-Don't keep loose papers in your backpack.

-Always bring materials you need for class. Notebook, textbook, pencil.

-DON'T be afraid or embarrassed to ask for help. Seriously. Especially the teacher. My ass was SAVED many times by sucking up my pride and telling the teacher after class that I was completely lost and I didn't know where to begin. They are 99% of the time happy to help and respect you for asking. Ask your friends too, if they are willing to help. And if anyone asks you for help in a subject you're good at, DO IT. Teaching is the best way to learn.

Now, as for more life advice for high school. The most important thing to remember, during tough times, is that HIGH SCHOOL IS NOT FOREVER. It is such a small part of your life. It seems so important, and everything that is happening feels real and forever, but it's not. I'm 24, graduated 7 years ago, and I talk to maybe three, four people from high school. Of course, some people keep many more friends than that, and I sometimes check people out over Facebook, but my point is I'm not bound to those people. What they thought of me back then, what they think of me now, doesn't matter. It doesn't affect my life in any way.

Another thing to remember is to stay grounded. Be chill, especially with your parents. Sometimes it's hard to remember when you're dealing with adults that they were once your age. I was sure that my parents didn't take me seriously all the time because they didn't understand me, or because they thought I was still a child and they couldn't see that I was growing up. Looking back, even though I'm still young, I realize it's because I WAS still a child. I had a lot of growing up to do, and I thought I understood a lot more than I did. I think back to some things I said, some things I did, some things I WORE, and I cringe internally. You will make decisions, right now, that your future self will hate you for, or at least will be embarrassed remembering. That's OK. We *all* have those moments. But when you're so angry at your mom for grounding you, or when your teachers don't understand, try to keep in mind that you have the capacity to be wrong, and this might be one of those times.

My brother spent much of his high school life being embarrassed by my mom, not for any particular reason, just for being around. My sister is the same way. She dreads being seen with my mom. My mother doesn't do anything embarrassing, I guess they just worry what everyone else will think. Protip: no one thinks about you as much as you think about yourself. So don't worry so much. No one really cares what you do with your life.

Don't spread rumors. Don't make fun of people. Don't bully people. If you see your friends doing this. Don't laugh, don't look interested. Don't reward the behavior with a response. If you see bullying, speak up. Be kind to people who are bullied, or who have problems. Be kind to EVERYONE. If someone is mean to you, act bored, or unimpressed. Don't respond. Don't react. If you accidentally do something embarrassing, roll your eyes and make fun of yourself a bit. If others see that you don't care what they think, they'll be responsive to that attitude. They can't take advantage of your embarrassment if you can't be embarrassed. 

Make sure you have an adult you can trust if something happens to you. Hopefully that's your parents. If it's not, make it a friend's parent or a relative. Try not to make it a teacher, not because teachers don't care about you, they do, but teachers have a protocol they have to follow, and schools have agendas they will push, so make this adult confidante someone who has no motives except your safety and happiness. 

Don't put too much personal information online. On social media, always be positive. In fact in life, always be positive in public. Don't air dirty laundry where everyone can see. Keep your life private.


Watch adventure time, 30 rock, Parks and recreation, and doctor who. They are all fantastic shows.

20140526124557,whisperingmoon,"Preface: I am Canadian. We have paid maternity (and some paternity) leave here. My country has *way* more in the way of social support for mothers than the US. Anyway.

My mother is a doctor in the public health system. (My father is too.) When I was born, and later when my sister was born, she took off a few weeks and was immediately back to work 50-60+ hours a week as an OB/GYN. She and my dad both worked extensively, and basically had to co-ordinate call schedules so that they wouldn't both be working 36hrs straight simultaneously. 

She is a great mother. (He's a great father, too.) Truly a great mother. I have never doubted that for a moment. I have always been resolutely offended when people imply that working mothers are somehow less dedicated to their children, no matter what profession those mothers do. If my mother can be a doctor and a great parent, I have no doubt that a single mother working triple shifts at WalMart to support her family can be a great mother too. In fact, I *know* that those women can be great mothers because if they didn't love their children, they wouldn't work so hard. 

There's an ugly, classist narrative which claims that women-- obviously affluent-- have to spend all day baking cookies and doing laundry and going to ""mommy and me"" yoga to do a good job of parenting. Bullshit. Running a mommy blog is not a prerequisite to raising a great family. Neither is staying home all day through your children's infancy.

There is nothing wrong with having childcare support, whether that comes from Grandma or a nanny or daycare or your anyone else. (Though obviously childcare should be afforable and accessible! This is crucial!) There is nothing wrong with being a working mother. It's 2014. We should not still be having this fucking conversation.

Emma Thompson is completely entitled to do whatever she wants with her life to parent in whatever she sees fit. Obviously, given that she is an actress, her job probably involves more travel than most. But what's good for Emma Thompson is good for Emma Thompson. She should have phrased her statement to reflect the specificity of her reality.",13,t3_26iuc0
20140526132445,NervousPreggo,"There's a huge difference between baking all day and being a Stepford wife and not wanting your child in daycare for long hours. The evidence shows that there are disadvantages in terms of emotional development to daycare particularly for infants under a year old and not everyone has an extended family nearby to lean on for support.

With the situation as it is taking time off is likely to damage your career and I think going back to work is a totally valid choice but to pretend that it's a simple choice and doesn't have very serious disadvantages is to ignore the reality of the situation.",2,t3_26iuc0
20140526105130,DefinitelyNotFreud,"Raising a kid is tough. Raising a kid under the poverty line is really, really tough. Can it be done well? Sure! But I'm personally convinced that it takes a superhero to do it, and that there are a bunch of super hero single parents with 2 or 3 jobs and good relationships with their kids.

But anyone who has gone through that will tell you that without a certain amount of self sacrifice and luck it is impossible or at least seems that way. Child care costs a lot more than what some jobs pay. Without another wage earner you need to be in 3 places at once. 

Being able to take a year off is a privilege not everyone has. I work from home, and don't have kids of my own but my partner does, and I do a lot with the kids. They know I love them and would do anything for them. And if something happens at school or they're sick, I always feel super lucky that I have a job where I can just take a break and deal their needs and make up the time later.

Parents need more resources. We need to completely change how we treat work and employment in relationship to parenting. Mandatory paid maternity and paternity leave is amazing headway, but corporations need to figure out that having a child means producing another member of the work force and/or another customer, it's not like a personal hobby holiday. The job of raising kids is the job of the community, not just mothers, or parents.

So on the one hand, Emma's right, mothers who work long hard hours usually can't see their kids as much as rich people, or people with more flexible work, but that is not something we should blame mothers for, we need to figure out collectivity how to do better for children.",7,t3_26iuc0

She is not parenting (or parenting very little) when she is working or away, so why wouldn't she be happy to have time off?

Same with some dads. When they have more time to spend with their kids, they probably feel like better parents.

It doesn't mean a full time working parent is a bad parent, but nobody can deny it's good to spend as much time as we can afford to spend, raising our children.",4,t3_26iuc0
20140526172932,Waury,"I think that mothers who are also working are taking it as a slight to their quality as a parents, while it's one sentence in the context of an actress who has a potentially very demanding job clashing with daily family life, and who has the money and context to afford taking time fully away from work.

Was that inconsiderate of mothers who have to work two jobs to make ends meet? Yes. But I don't think the comment was meant for any other context than women who choose to invest themselves so wholly in their career (as personal goals and preferences VS necessity to keep a roof over their family's heads) they have little time and energy left for their children. She also used ""great mum"" and not ""good mum"", as in exceeding expectations VS doing a perfectly good job meeting all of their children's needs.",1,t3_26iuc0
20140526132507,NervousPreggo,"There is evidence that too much time in daycare is detrimental to children  - particularly in their first year. Babies require secure attachments from familiar caregivers who have the resources to be responsive to their needs and provide reassurance and comfort. This often can't happen in daycare where there are usually at least two or three babies to each daycare worker - often many more and you have a high staff turnover.  

Lots of kids do go into daycare in their first year and most come out fine but it's certainly not the ideal in terms of child development. It's a shame that most people no longer have an extended family on their doorstep to help with childcare and that careers are not more flexible to allow mothers and fathers to share the burden of care while both maintaining a career. (NB these kind of options would probably be great for child free people who have important commitments outside of their work too).
In Germany as well as one year paid maternity leave there is the further option to have your job on hold (unpaid) for a further three (I think) years which would be wonderful for those who could afford it. 

I don't think one parent sacrificing or severely damaging their career is a great option but neither is leaving babies in often overcrowded daycares. 
It's a difficult problem that too often receives a blanket response of ""oh just put them in daycare"" or ""well give up your career and be a mother"" neither of which is satisfactory (not to me anyway).",4,t3_26iuc0

Her mistake is prescribing that moms should all take a year off-- something the vast majority of women cannot afford to do without a lot of planning and sacrifice. I chose to stay home full time with my daughter, but this took years of planning for my husband and I to make it work. You can't just go from making $65k to making $35k (which is what we did) unless you spend some real time preparing for it, and make major life choices leading to that goal.

Plus, if you're generally an inattentive parent, then one year at home won't make up for that. Your kids need to know that they are always important to you, no matter the circumstances. They need to know that they matter when they are 2, and when they're 10, and 16, and everywhere in between. ",3,t3_26iuc0
20140526105859,Lil_Boots1,"I also think there's a difference between an acting career and a career as an engineer or researcher or teacher or welder. I think as out-of-touch as the Gwyneth Paltrow quote sounds, she had a point. Being at work 8-10 hours a day and home most evenings and weekends is pretty different from being completely away from home for two or three weeks at a time and working 14 hour days when you are home. You can maybe take your children with you on those trips, but realistically you still won't see them much and you'll be uprooting them all the time so it's not really the best thing for them. 

Taking extended leave from a career like that might be necessary to bond with your children and really be a part of their lives, while my working parents were able to make it to our games and concerts and help us do our homework and learn to do home repairs and everything because they were home evenings and weekends. My dad was always on call and sometimes traveled for work, and once he rented a car and drove home overnight to make it to my brother's soccer game. My grandmother worked nights and slept when the kids were in school and was awake to interact and be a parent when they got home. It's possible to work a normal job and be a good parent, but I'm not sure it's possible to continually work as an actor and be a good parent without taking leave like Emma Thompson did. It sounds like she phrased it poorly and didn't mean that regular working moms needed to take a year off working to bond with their teenage children, just that she needed to because her job isn't exactly conducive to raising children and being home with them ever.",6,t3_26iuc0

I really loved the freedom and confidence I gained learning to go out by myself, and starting conversations with strangers.

In my experience when I stopped trying and started focusing on being happy myself I immediately started attracting friends. I found that other people saw me happy and thought I was fun so they wanted to join in. Might not work for everyone but my advice would be to find out what makes you really happy and keep doing it and other people will follow.

On the same note if you see someone who looks really happy and fun talk to them and find out what they are doing and if it would make you as happy. Thats how I've made friends, it might seem overly simplified and probably is but its worked for me.",3,t3_26jqjo

20140526103751,gwenthrowaway,"OK, step one is to take a step back and stop thinking about your situation as something that has happened to you. We create our lives. You didn't make your husband the way he is, of course, but my point is that you are the creator of your life, with full agency, not a victim or a passive observer. When you say ""while nothing physical has ever happened it wouldn't surprise me if it did,"" little alarms ring in my brain, because that's the kind of language that distances you from being responsible for what happens.

Take charge of yourself and your power to choose.

The immediate problem now is that you don't seem to know what you want. Do you want to fix your marriage? That will take some hard work and real commitment and parts of it may not be pleasant. Do you want to leave your marriage? That's going to be hard too. Do you want to just drift along unhappily and fall into an affair without really deciding to? That's an option, but I don't advise it.

It sounds as if your husband has personal work to do. It will require the assistance of a therapist. From what you say, he's not really fully available to be in a marriage right now, so therapy should be a top priority. If I were you, I'd make it couples therapy. Your husband probably thinks his life is working quite well except for his relationship with you...and that would be working fine if you didn't want to change him somehow, if his emotional life hadn't somehow become subject to your attempted control. (I'm just trying to imagine how it might seem to him when you let him know you want therapy.)

You say you love him and I'll take your word for that. We don't need to know why. But I will tell you this: You don't want to spend a lifetime with the person you described to us. Everyone deserves more than that. So if you're committed to staying in the marriage, get yourselves into couples therapy.

Your flirtation with having an affair suggests to me that you may not be fully committed to the marriage. That's okay. People fall in love and they fall out of love. That's been a fact of life since marriage was invented, and it is explicitly recognized by an entire body of civil law. If you've decided that the lack of emotional involvement with your husband is something you aren't willing to settle for, then you are not only entitled to leave, you are right to leave. It will be better for him too, though he may not realize it. 

It is not honorable, however, to try to have it both ways, to be in the marriage and out of it at the same time. That's where you're headed with your co-worker. You're supplementing your lack of emotional satisfaction with your husband by flirting and sharing with another man. You don't need us to tell you that's not right. Of course it isn't. You've got to decide if you're in your marriage or your're out, and then act accordingly.

If you are telling this co-worker the things you've told us, sharing your dissatisfaction with your marriage, then stop. Nobody outside your marriage should ever hear that sort of thing unless it's someone you've hired to help you fix it. It's disrespectful to your husband and disrespectful to your marriage. The little shot of ""oh, I'm understood"" warmth in your belly isn't sufficient to make up for the way you have to avoid your own gaze in the mirror. Respect the privacy of your marriage. You owe yourself that.

I suspect you are setting up your co-worker to participate in an ""exit affair."" This is an affair you have when you don't have the guts to file for divorce, or you 51% want one but you don't want to be the one to break up the marriage. You dither and wait and suffer...and then you sleep with someone outside the marriage to put an end to that impossible state. It's a way of pulling the trigger on a dying marriage.

For what it's worth, in the history of the world, only three or four women have wound up in a long-term relationship with the guy they had the exit affair with. That's not what those affairs are for.

My problem with SOME (not all!!) women, is that they're hard to trust, as well as maintain a regular friendship with them. However, I also have trust issues with some male friends, because I'm sometimes unsure of their intentions with our friendship. It all depends which situation you're dealing with. 

I wonder if you're just around a more difficult crowd at the moment. I have one group of friends and all the ""new"" girls are so friendly. Especially if you welcome them personally. Asking them questions, including them in your interests and conversations. We all get along great, and I love it, but sometimes it really does take that extra effort. 

Just try to look passed the biased ""bitchiness and drama"" because I assure you not all females are like that, just like how not all men are pigs. You just have to look in the right places for each of them.

When I said I was in the same boat as you, I meant I don't have many female friends. Literally I can think of only 2 I hang out with regularly, both great people. I wish I had more girl friends, but hey, life goes on and falls into place how it does, and you just have to accept it.

It's usually because they get a boyfriend and then just ignore me from then on. I already made the mistake of getting into a relationship, and then losing some friends. I will never do that again. There's always room for compromise, and time for everyone!

Also, don't ever feel bad about having mostly male friends though. There is always so much shame put onto girls for that, calling them ""teases"" or ""sluts"". HOW? A friend is a friend. We shouldn't have to feel guilty just because they're the opposite sex. It's ridiculous.",0,t3_26irkq

The only way we're going to lessen misogyny - and all types of discrimimation - is by becoming aware of the subtle forms it takes place as, the words like ""pussy"", the unsollicited opinions, the ""nice guys"", recognizing and admitting, *even if just to themselves*, that it's part of the problem. I sincerely believe that most men out there genuinely don't mean harm, psychological or physical, to women, and that they don't realize when they do it.

If they or my mother's generation (or my own generation - and we were far more jaded) had had to put up with what today's younger women see and hear on a daily basis...well, let's just say that most of you are pretty sturdy.

The fact that it's some men (and in some cases, some men and some women) causing the problem doesn't mean that all men are responsible nor that they should take the blame. The vast majority of feminists do not ask that men as a group take on the blame--in fact, most feminists would be fine with things changing for the better and nobody taking the blame--but men tend to hear the bad things that *some* men are doing and want to make sure that they're not being blamed and that it's clear that they're not part of it.

You need to figure out how to hear a story about a woman being raped, or complaining about getting catcalled, or whatever, and not make it all about yourself and your feelings, instead of theirs.

I understand why you feel that way - I'm a white woman, and when I first started doing anti-racism work, I was really uncomfortable, felt guilty, got defensive, and said some things where I made it all about MY PAIN instead of really just listening to what it's like to live as a black/latino/asian/etc. person in our society. 

At some point, you just have to 
1) realize that it's not about you or your feelings
2) let go and just really listen without getting defensive, making it clear that you care about the issue, and are willing to see their perspective
3) try to live your life in the best and most-self-aware way possible, so you don't contribute to the problem. 

EDIT: 
I feel like I should re-emphasize that the feelings you have are totally normal and reasonable, just not always productive to share in that moment with the woman talking about sexism.

Sometimes it really helps to talk about your feelings with another person from your group who has made more progress than you have (i.e., me talking to another white person who does anti-racist work, or you talking to another dude who's into feminism).

I've heard this explained a couple of ways.  The most common is ""that's the way men think.""  But I think some women think in blame-currency as well and are always looking for it.  I was certainly raised with a lot of blaming and it takes a long time to get off the blame soapbox.

I don't know how many times I've been interested in just the facts or in a feeling, and instead, the conversation got into blame.

Feeling insulted when you're being told that you're being insulting/harmful to someone else is a huge problem.

Rape jokes. ""I would never rape anyone!"" Do you know who thinks all men *are* rapists? Rapists do. And the banalisation of rape in jokes reinforces that idea.

Unsolicited opinions on preferences of women's clothing, body shape, size of breasts, body modifications, haircut, makeup. The number of men who will acknowledge a woman's personal choices by stating their own general standards is astonishing. Why is it a problem? Because it comes from the idea that women's looks are made to please men. And don't get me wrong - both sides believe that. But women are getting annoyed, feeling insulted, and when they say so, they're dismissed as overreacting.

Elsewhere in this thread: Patrick Stewart. He is the perfect example. I'm paraphrasing here, but he'd a dedicated advocate for women's rights. ""People only listen to old white men. I'm an old white man, so I'm speaking for girls and women."" *THAT*. He is acknowledging three privileges - age, skin color, gender - not taking offense in it, and actually using it to help.

We don't need to be reminded that ""not all men"". We know this. We're not even saying that ""all men"". We're saying, there's this huge problem, we're in danger, and when we're talking you're not only refusing to listen by cutting the discussion short after ""not all men"", but you're also dismissing our experience entirely because you feel we're overreacting.

Should we be so considerate of men's egos as to pretend that they don't involuntarily perpetuate the problem, when sexual assault is a daily concern for us, when saying no gets us death threats?

We don't want *blame*, we want *change*. If men - and I'm using the word as ""those who"", not as ""all men"" - feel blamed when we say misogyny is responsible for that kind of event, what does that say about them?

It's not a defense, but please realize that it is very difficult to understand, in any useful way, another person's experiences, especially when they are a different sex than you (or from another gender, culture, race, class, et cetera). I logically understand what you say when you say you are sexualized all the time, but I don't get it. Likely never will.

I'm not trying to excuse anything, this is more a comment on the debate in general, but when that otherwise great person in your life doesn't react the same way as you do to a terrible encounter you've had, it's because they don't understand.

I was utterly blown away tbh, the first was basically wondering why men would opt to abuse someone citing:

>There are serious legal consequences. Being known as a woman beater isn't exactly a badge of honor. Its a great way to limit future contact with women. Its frowned upon and extremely taboo. There is no benefit to abusing women, only cost.

Not that he didn't get that in some aspects of life/society, women* have a quantifiable more difficult time if things, but he didn't *get it*.  After a few days, when we'd both calmed some he told me all of this. He told me he couldn't believe a)that any man felt I was his to do with whatever he pleased &amp;amp; b) that in 2014, a cop would ask me *what I was wearing*. (Answer: hospital gown). 

And  have say, seeing him able to encounter something new to his experience. not dismiss it or try to cram it to fit in your preconceived notions, then really examine some long held beliefs was...frankly it was kind of hot (I like 'em smart &amp;amp; introspective I guess). 

And now he speaks up at work when the guys are ""just kiddin' man, it's just a joke"" rapes comment. He's dressed down ER docs &amp;amp; just.  He was always amazing, but he's kind of my feminist hero now. Other than Kathleen Hannah.

And a lot of men actually listen to women who explain the kind of struggles they face everyday, and done their best to understand.

I'm a white cis women, relatively straight as far as I know, technically atheist but raised in a very vaguely catholic household. I do not know the struggles of non-white people, especially those who live in a perceive white majority; I don't know the exact struggles of men, of trans people, of gay, bi, asexual, queer and genderqueer people. I don't know the struggles of a Muslim woman, in western societies or elsewhere. I have my reality, which is constrained by who I am, and how I've lived.

What annoys me most in any debate opposing two of the aforementioned groups is when arguments try to invalidate someone else's reality because of their own. In the debate on feminism, it's usually in the form of ""women are overreacting"" and ""that perpetual fear is irrational and unfounded"". It's actually how I realized that we don't instinctively perceive other people's realities, because we assume our own is pretty much how everyone experiences theirs.

I've taken to try to watch for PoC representation in stories, especially in movies. And now I'm starting to understand why people are angry. I've listened to my trans friend, and my asexual friends, and my bisexual friends, and I've begun to understand their struggles with their peers, with society and representation. My little corner of the world recently has had trouble with legislation that would put non-Christians at a high disadvantage, and through the feedback of the people it was aimed at, I've had a glimpse of how they live their faith.

It is a LOT to take in. It sucks out fun of a LOT of entertainment. But the understanding that comes with it, and passing on that information to help people become more aware of what they do and how they affect others and themselves is important.

20140527191931,Tiyrava,"Saskatchewan--we're about 20-30 years behind the rest of Canada (but there's like no air pollution--moved here from Ontario--and the sunlight is year-round awesome). 

*I* think there's evidence. Rape trials in Canada have resulted in convictions on less evidence than what I have just sitting useless in a duffel bag in my closet: 

* clothing/panties from that day the police told me to leave at home when they ordered me to the station for an interrogation against my will. 
* witnesses they haven't gotten statements from--after asking me for their contact info and telling me they would interview them.
* photographs of the blood/bruising--police said they didn't want them.
* the full story that I haven't been able to provide to the police in my own words. They wouldn't acknowledge the differences that my being Autistic would affect--made assumptions about what I'd just ""know"" when, as someone with has Autism, I can't pick up on social signals and non-verbal communication or get people's intentions or recognize danger...my brain's not wired to do those things but the police just assumed I'd 'get' what a neurotypical woman would.
* there's my word, I mean, my credibility's excellent (PM me for details) and it's a well-established fact that people with Autism very rarely lie (as in, just make stuff up for no reason--it's unheard of), but unfortunately the employer of the rapist (and also myself until I was fired for not signing a gag-order contract to not speak about being raped in the workplace by a coworker) slandered me to the police before I'd made a report and discredited me. 
After that, nothing I said to the police they took seriously, failing to verify anything I said while they very easily could have done so. The guy's credibility isn't great--the guy's been caught lying to his wife about him cheating and to our employer about what he was wanting to start with me and I've got screenshots, letters, emails, and video to prove that. 
* hours of therapy records from a sexual assault center counselor, a psychologist who specializes in adults with Autism, and a psychologist at the student health center. 
* medical reports from 2 separate independent physicians/gynecologists stating that the damage done to my reproductive system was caused by a sexual assault and that the ongoing problems (such as I can't use certain feminine hygiene products, can't have sex--and by extension, can't have kids ever either) stem directly from being raped. 
The report states that there's nothing in my life history or previous-to-the-rape sexual experiences that would cause this, I wasn't raped before and was never abused by anyone ever, not sexual, physical, or emotional. 

It was never ""he said, she said"" it was: ""His employer--who is also the big boss for the police department--spoke to the police about her statement that she'd been raped after the employer had told her she was lying because, 'Married men don't rape.' She was unwilling to speak to police after the employer had met with them in private. The assailant was never spoken to, but his lawyer was--at least seven times.""  

The police told me that even though I said, ""No, I don't want to have sex with you,"" and repeatedly pulled my pants back up, that I still consented to sex because the circumstances were such (I was in a room alone with a man) that the circumstances implied that I was saying yes even though I'd verbally said ""No."" The police have ignored my pointing this out to them [this recent case](http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7942/index.do) which says:

""[47] The jurisprudence of this Court also establishes that there is no substitute for the complainant’s actual consent to the sexual activity at the time it occurred. It is not open to the defendant to argue that the complainant’s consent was implied by the circumstances, or by the relationship between the accused and the complainant.  There is no defence of implied consent to sexual assault: *Ewanchuk*, at para. 31."" *R. v J.A.* (2011) SCC 28 

I never even got to argue with the defence about implied consent--the police were defending the rapist's actions and telling me I'd agreed to have sex with him from the very start. The transcript of their interrogation of me is pretty damn interesting to read but it's long--about 17,000 words--and rather intense given the subject matter. 

There are some incredible lines from the police's sex crime investigator, who said things to me like, ""women lie about rape all the time to try and get away with things, like to get out of writing exams. You're no different from them, so just admit that this wasn't a sexual assault."" I was too stunned by the sexist rape myths she was relying on to rebut her very much but I definitely did try.

The point where I lost it on reading your story was the comment she made about ""women faking this all the time."" I've heard this before, but luckily I never got this one since several people overheard the violence and my protests, and since I wasn't the one bringing it forward in the first place.

I have heard some pretty stupid stuff. For instance, my closest guy friend who was in the other room and overheard said, ""why didn't you just fight him off? He's not that big of a guy you should have kicked his ass."" 

Obviously I *did* fight him, as did my best friend when it came down to it. Why didn't you do anything when you were in the next room over listening to this? Why did you leave it up to our 90 pound 5'2"" friend to help me when you were by far the largest and least intoxicated person in the house?

Or the other day my sister, who is an exotic dancer, was talking about how she's met girls in her industry who have been raped through their jobs, and she said ""you have to admit though, some of those girls who get raped bring it on themselves.""

There are any number of lies he could have told her...or maybe it's not one girl, it could be one night stands or even prostitutes.

Also all males know women talk, perhaps he's worried if you do meet his friends SO's partners they will tell you something. That's how I found out. 

The whole ""Silly, you can meet them any time."" is a much too flippant response for something that obviously bothers you. It's manipulation. It's making you feel crazy for questioning him, when in reality, he's the one who's not acting normal. This thread should have proven that to you.

Acting a bit different around your friends is not something you hide for six years, one night stands etc are... 

Some cheating tell tales to watch for:

Does he have an ""old broken phone"" which he hasn't got around to throwing out yet, that lives in his nightstand top draw? 

~~Does he let you have access to his facebook?~~
Is he super secretive of his facebook world?

Does he take his cell everywhere, even into the shower with him? 

Do you do the accounts, what are his bills like when he does go away? Does he go where he is saying?

Have the conversation, but be prepared for what you might find out.

My gut feeling is it's not going to be good news.",93,t3_26k0p1

If he's worried you're going to start crashing every guy's night out, you can emphasize you just want to meet them, not go every time.

But if he really starts acting weird or trying to avoid it... that's weird. Don't let it go. Don't just let him ""not follow through"". Bring it up before the next time he's going to visit - ask if the next weekend trip you guys can both go. 

There is really no good reason to not ever meet his friends. If it's just a ""guy's night out"" ask him in advance to do something different. Whatever makes sense for you guys. Dinner. Clubs. Movie. Drinks. Wine tasting. Hiking. Doesn't matter - just something that isn't a ""guy's night out"" and with expectation SOs would be brought.",9,t3_26k0p1

I'm going to disagree with this one, only because I'm married to someone who, if I straight up asked him, would give me access to facebook, but we value our privacy in our messages, so we don't go through it, and he would be upset if I asked for it for no obvious reason. However...

>Does he take his cell everywhere, even into the shower with him?

THIS, OP. And anyone else reading. This this this. If your SO will never even leave their phone sitting on a couch for a minute while they run to another room or go pee, it's a red flag. I say this as someone who used to be a frequent cheater.

And as a former cheater, not inviting your SO to places with you like weddings and outings with friends, or family events, is an sign of someone living a ""double life"" and/or not intending you to be a permanent fixture in their life.",14,t3_26k0p1

Except the other guy knew and they'd talk shit on me over text while she spent almost every minute with me (the other guy lived a lot father away than I did).

If youre spending all this time and effort just so he can have fun, he should be incredibly grateful for it. *He* should want to talk to *you* about all this to make sure youre ok with it, simply because youre taking on so many of his parenting obligations if nothing else. If your relationship is truly how you say, you should never have had to come onto the internet about this in the first place.

Unless hes completely oblivious, he should be aware of the problem just as much as you are. It should be his problem too! If you truly care about your significant other, you dont let things like this just slide... not for six years. 

At the absolute best he is neglecting you as a friend. And unless hes an idiot, he probably knows it. It doesnt really matter what the worst case scenario is. Either way your relationship has some serious things to work out before you can honestly say you are best friends.

In my mind the female doctor one is sexist because the problem isn't the ""doctor"" part, it's the ""female"" part. The male nurse one is shitty but not really sexist; the ""male"" part is fine, or would be if it weren't for the ""nurse"" part.

20140526213910,TheRealBobo,"This is actually an issue that I have been thinking a lot about lately. I am a male medical student entering my final year, and I happened to have two very inspirational female mentors during my training. 

First, while that article was written in a very inflammatory manner, it is actually tapping into a real issue. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2336235/Female-doctors-NHS-tremendous-burden-married-children-want-work-time.html is a less inflammatory article from the UK on the same subject.

I am actually very excited that women are opening up a new set of beliefs that working physicians 80 hours a week for life and having them abandon their families is not acceptable. I am very fortunate that I had two female physician mentors who did manage working reasonable hours to balance time with their families. I am actively pursuing a specialty that will allow me to be more flexible, because I don't want my life to be run by my job. I want to see my children and have a meaningful existence outside of the hospital, and I couldn't care less if I make less money because of that.

Personally, I've always resented the American work ethic that forced both my mother and father to be away from home for much of my childhood. I think it is great that females are breaking into the medical field, and this new focus on balancing family life with work is (in my opinion) a very good thing. I don't have a solution for the problem of needing more doctors, and I imagine part of it will be lowering physician pay, but I'm happy to see the old ways torn down.",33,t3_26k5fy
20140528042310,ahatmadeofshoes12,"I completely agree with this. I have a friend who is finishing up medical school currently and he posts all these horrible articles about the high suicide rates among physicians and how many med school graduates come out with PTSD from the stress of the program. I think it's horrible that the system does this to doctors. How can someone care for others if they can't care for themselves? 

The work life balance is one of the main reasons I decided to pursue my doctorate in occupational therapy rather then medicine. I want to have a life and while I love my career and I'd do anything to help improve the quality of life for my clients I can't do that if I don't care for myself first and foremost. ",1,t3_26k5fy

My mother only worked 2/3 time, and it was something she had to fight for. At one point her all male partners tried to axe her because she wasn't working as hard as them. I agree I don't think it's great to work 80hours a week, and a big part of the push back from that is part of this change in a historically male dominated field.

20140526232923,CrucifiedButterfly,"I really like what you're saying here. Thank you for sharing your experience. 

When I first read the article I felt so angry because I think that, in general, it is true that doctors who are women may, in the long run, spend less time working/work less hours per week/etc. than males in the same field for any number of reasons (family being the foremost). 

Instead of looking at a percentage of women doctors as the issue for not living up to American work ethic expectations, perhaps we should look at work ethic expectations and consider whether or not they are reasonable and conducive to a happy life outside of work (for men and women--not just women).

20140528001951,Hookerlips,"50h ours a week? I wish I could work that few of hours! Realistically it's more like 70 plus on average. ",2,t3_26k5fy
20140529012251,Hookerlips,"Well, that's a hard question to answer. I certainly don't prefer it. And I don't think that physicians are able to have peak empathy at that kind of hours. At the same time, if I don't work, there really isn't anyone else to pick up the slack. When one of the other rads got sick last week, I just worked longer. He was in the hospital, what was he going to do?  


Where I do disagree however is in the residency. Even with the reforms many go over the 80 hour work week. I will admit I did ( though never reported it ) And it isn't even 80 hours a week, its an  average more than 80 hours a week over a four week period. 

But I do believe that residency was very important, and it would be really hard to achieve the level of mastery that one needs to practice with out the long hours every week. Looking back, I wish I spent more time working in residency, to be honest.  ",1,t3_26k5fy
20140529173428,Hookerlips,"Well thats what I would argue against, actually. IF you could learn and retain all that information in residency, then yes, longer would be better. But I don't think that is how it would work. 

4 hour case or 8 hour surgery? Plus the peri-operative recovery time? You can't really split that up, its just how it is. Following someone to understand the healing process. If you aren't at the hospital, you won't be there to experience and manage the bumps in the path to recovery.  If you aren't in the clinic for the bumps in the road, you won't see them, and you won't know how to deal with them.  

Same thing with the boards. You don't take a test in one thing and then a test in another, as you have to be able to see the big picture. 

After you have gained that competence it is easier to maintain. I still look things up everyday, and probably should, because things also change quite rapidly. Still taking a week off is wonderful and doesn't make a huge difference in competency. 
 




Payment is another issue entirely, and yes, there is really no justification for the low pay that residents receive other than greed. ",1,t3_26k5fy
20140527062928,Astraea_M,"The author is wrong.  The three reasons why we don't have enough doctors are:  medical school is ridiculously expensive, the residency requirement is long and hell, and the pay actually doesn't compensate for the very long educational pipeline and those costs, most doctors don't start earning until their 40s.

There are fewer people going into medicine than we need.  The issue isn't happening with the number of people dropping out, but with the number of people entering the pipeline.

20140526220338,Hemiptera,"She is wrong, we don't want to go back to 70 hour work weeks.

I used to work for a non-profit in the medical education field in Canada, so not the US, but all the same problems.  It's true that women work less hours than men.  But IIRC women were above 35 hours on average.  So it's not like the women were slacking off, and the reduced hours are a good thing.  The norm used to be 70 hour weeks for the men in the middle of the 20th century, which is way to long for knowledge workers to be productive.  Particularly ones in a high stakes environment.  But both genders are reducing their hours to something more sane, so limiting women would only delay the problem.  Not only that but in Canada doctors can get paid per piece so it's not like the extra hours save money while practicing.  To top it off the med schools and research hospitals were increasing capacity to deal with the reduction in hours and have been for decades.  Although the schools have been adding capacity more reactively then using projections to guess at need.  As a result we've been playing catchup for decades.  For those citing tuition; there hasn't been any major free capacity in the education system.  So spots are the bottle neck not tuition.  Although tuition is affecting the amount of poor and middle class students going into med school.  The problem is no one wants to pay for the capacity in the education system unless the doctor shortage is in crisis mode.  Particularly when it takes an act of legislation to raise it. 

There are also other problems with finding doctors.  In Canada there is a huge shortage of rural doctors. 


",8,t3_26k5fy
20140527085630,medstudent321,"I actually just finished med school and I think there's a  limit with ""increasing capacity"" and thereby limiting the number of hours people work. I'm actually Canadian, but went to medical school in the States, and I saw some of those problems. The first one with increasing capacity beyond controlling for population is you get medical students without the proper training they need because there isn't enough pathology to go around. I met a lot of Caribbean and (sometimes!) DO students who would be forced to rotate at community programs because all the big academic places were already full of allopathic students, and whenever an appropriately complicated case would show up that they would need to know about (beyond the level of mid levels), it went get punted to an academic place; hence you would get poorly trained doctors because there wasn't enough pathology to go around. Another thing is that it takes a LOT of time to train to actually be good at being a doctor. When I first entered medical school i hated the idea of 70 hour work weeks but after doing a bunch of sub internships I realize that I could either stomach them and actually be good at what I do, or not do them and simply not be competent. Simply put, there is not enough time in say the last two years of medical school and residency to become a fully functional doctor if you only work 40-50 hour weeks. You can't: theres no way. I used to think it could be done but my clerkships have painfully shown me otherwise. The only way we could lower work week hours more would be to increase the length of residencies, which would mean an even worse doctor shortage (since people would take forever before they could practice independently) and worse patient outcomes because continuity of care suffers.

Even aside from the actually insane, sexist content, it's bad for our societal health to complain about ""too many female doctors,"" because research generally concludes that female doctors are less likely to make mistakes, and far less likely to commit the kind of egregious errors that would get them suspended/punished. And of course those suspensions take doctors entirely out of the work force for their duration.

",32,t3_26k5fy
20140526192120,selfhatingjudge,"I agree with you, and the article seems to acknowledge that fact but in a dismissive way because it is not worth waiting for society to adapt since our resources are limited and our top heavy society is catching up faster than we can keep up with. Making employment more family friendly for men and women has always seemed like an obvious benefit to everyone to me. I have never understood why that eludes so many people in the United States. You often hear the counter argument that policies enabling people to take more time for family favors people who choose to have children, but these polices would also benefit people who want to have healthy romantic relationships or take care of an elderly and/or ill relative among other things. 

I also find it funny that this article, beyond simplifying the issue of having too few doctors to the problem of doctors not working enough, seems to think that by denying more women acceptance to medical school we could began to solve the problem. It is funny because less women in the field of medicine would lead to fewer primary care givers which would cause more stress on the system as a whole. Furthermore, in a country like Japan where it is very hard for women to stay in the workforce after having children and where their aging population is already causing near insurmountable stress on the economy their response is to make it easier for women to keep their jobs and take care of their families.

Example from Ann Coulter:

""If we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president. It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a personal fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen. And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women. It also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it. I mean, you do see it's the party of women and 'We'll pay for health care and tuition and day care -- and here, what else can we give you, soccer moms?'"" Said by Ann Coulter 10/2/2007

Also, I really wouldn't say it is ""socially acceptable"" for women to take time off to take care of their family. They pay for it in spades just as men do by passing up on career advancement, and society is very quick to judge them for making that choice (as evidenced by this article).

It is true that this is an issue for the demographic the author is talking about, but if the reverse were put in place in all of our media, then millions of straight, cis gendered, non minorities would now feel this way when they went to the same media.

I don't say it would fail because it is morally or ethically right, just that media is a product, plain and simple. The producers want money, and they go with the route they feel is most likely to get them money.

After you all graduate and go out into the world, these people are your connection to future jobs, not (usually) your competition. I'm not saying that you should smile and network and be fake friends with everybody. But presumably, though competition is causing strain now, you don't hate 'em all. So don't burn any bridges long-term through momentary frustration. They aren't trying to backstab and sabotage you - they're just trying to get a job too.

You will sooner or later get a position. And your skill set will then start to diverge from everyone else's. They will no longer be graduate carbon copies - just people you may work with (or for) again (almost assuredly if the field is as metaphorically incestuous as you say).

Also... I wouldn't look too harshly on a classmate not wanting to share a lead on a job they want.

I don't know you or her (nor am I a mind-reader), but if I had to make a couple of guesses: She could be freaking out about the fact that you're growing up, and reacting very badly about it. Parents can get weird about that. To her, like, ten minutes ago you were starting kindergarten, and now you've got bigger boobs than her and you're starting high school. That's the charitable view. 

She could be annoyed at the cost, because bras are really expensive sometimes, and she doesn't want to go forward buying you new bras whenever your boobs grow, at this rate. This would be pretty terrible, but not outside the realm of possibility given some mothers I've known.

Or, I don't know, does she have body image issues? She could be jealous of your figure. Once again, this seems vaguely ridiculous, but... I've known some messed up moms. 

Either way, um, you really do need the new bra. Do you have an aunt or someone you're closer to that you could go to the store with and fund your new bras? Even your dad, I bet if you just wore your current bra with a thin shirt he'd see how uncomfortable it must look in terms of boob sticking up out of the top (you poor thing, two sizes too small in the cup!) and the nice thing about the dads of young teenagers is that they're often so awkward about the whole puberty thing that they'll say yes to anything so that they can stop thinking about it. I mean, don't abuse that, but it's something that needs to be done! You really do need the larger size. 

Alternately, I wonder if you could buy the bras online, now that you know your size? The fit can be iffy, but it's at least better than two sizes too small. The ladies at /r/abrathatfits can likely help make recommendations there. If you have any money saved up or can beg some from some family, that's a good way to circumvent your mother. 

As for your second two questions, I can't help you... I somehow missed all the giant boob genes in my family, so I wouldn't know much about having them. But I *have* worn shitty bras before, and had a crazy mother, and you do not need any of that nonsense in your life. ",18,t3_26kdg5

Yeah, I'm thinking that mom has some issues with her own looks.  She's a bit overweight, lost some but everything's kinda saggy. She won't wear a swimsuit anymore, and we have a pool.


I don't think money is the issue. My dad is a lawyer, makes OK money, but we hardly see him.


The problem is, I don't have any money!!  I don't work, I don't get an allowance, my parents just pay for what I need.  I could lie and say I need money for the movie, going out to eat with friends, whatever, but then I'd be lying, and I guess I'd feel bad about that.

OK, tell me straight up - if you do a bra ""fitting"" do the store women, like, grab your boobs and measure them?  That seems SO freaky - I could never let some strange woman do that, I think. Or do they measure you, like, through your clothes??  I might could handle that. Maybe.",3,t3_26kdg5

Show them the pros: you learn money management, you learn how to shop for your own clothing and stick within a budget, you learn how to use a bank account, etc. Often, bank accounts can be linked with your parents - mine were, so my parents could keep track of my spending. Make an estimate of how much they spend on you now for clothes and entertainment &suggest a reasonable allowance based on this number. Perhaps offer to do certain chores? Cleaning the pool?

You can measure your self for bras - check out /r/abrathatfits. You'll need either a sewing tape measurer or something flexible like a ribbon + a ruler. Either way, no boob grabbing necessary.

28F is a normal size. I look pretty average and wear a 28E. Browse through /r/ABraThatFits and look for ""fit check"" posts. You'll see that many women wear bras your size. It's not freaky at all.

The tighter band in a 28 just means that more support comes from the band and less from your shoulder straps. That helps prevent back pain, and if you ever want to wear a strapless bra, it means you won't spend all night tugging up your bra (or at least hopefully less of it...)",10,t3_26kdg5

You could also try looking for advice on /r/ABraThatFits (28F is a pretty common size; someone might have an old one they'd be willing to mail to you) or browse /r/braswap for bras in your size. 

I know this stuff can be frustrating—we've all been teenage girls and have had to deal with our growing bodies, and I can assure you that the growth you're going through is completely normal. It was really hard for me when I first started needing bras (my mom would only let me buy sports bras because she didn't like underwires). It's hard to get things you need for yourself when you don't have an allowance and you can't drive—do you have any adult women you could talk to about this? Aunts? Friends' moms? You could always show your mom the calculator. If she thinks F is way too big, you could show her the [bra band project](http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=28&cup=F&age=&brand=&sister_sizes=0&search=Search), which shows what real boobs with your measurements look like. You could even get her to measure herself. It's likely she's wearing the wrong size as well. ",8,t3_26kdg5

They ask you to put your hands on your hips and they first wrap a measuring tape under your breasts to get your band size, then around the fullest part of your breast to get the cup size. A bra that fits should not push the girls together and should lie flat against the skin around the back, up from the cups and in the center between cups with no gapping. It's all done very professionally. They will bring you some bras that should fit and ask about what kinds you like or what issues you have had (straps falling, bulging, etc.) If you are comfortable with it, once you have the bra on they can take a look and tell you if its a good fit, help with strap adjustment. Its a really good idea. If you can talk to your dad about the issue I'm sure he would be thrilled to just give you the money to get a few decently fitting bras, rather than go shopping for them. Just maybe be nice and get some that are supportive and cute but not pushing sexy. while its great to have, at your age it might give dad a small aneurism. ",3,t3_26kdg5

My good adult advice is that lying is bad. On the other hand, were I in your position, I would have lied. I'm not officially *telling* you to lie, because lying is bad, but... yes. Just saying. They're not being reasonable in the slightest, and this is coming from an adult perspective. 

Still, there's other options. If you ask your dad, like I said, he could just give you what you need so that he doesn't have to face the fact that his baby girl has boobs now. Or maybe just tell your mother you want to buy some new clothes for school, and don't specify you mean to buy bras?

Yeah, if you don't want them to grope you directly, wear a thin shirt. If you're wearing something thick like a sweater, they pretty much do need you to take off your shirt to get a good measurement, but if you wear a thin one they can just work around it. And if you're uncomfortable with even that, you can always try the old fashioned method of just trying on like four sizes of each style of bra until you find one that fits okay. 

The measurement really isn't freaky, though. Generally, they just measure around your ribcage under your boobs, and then around the fullest part of your bust. They might need to kind of put their arms around you for this, but yeah, they shouldn't need to really grab a boob or anything. ",6,t3_26kdg5

Bigger boobs need a bit of architecture to hold them up and something may feel great in the store but not support you properly.  Go to a GOOD department store and get measured (not victoria's secret- they measure wrong A LOT)  

Sounds like your mom might just not understand the issue or is freaked out by you growing up so quick.

And the entire time I was living at home she refused to entertain the idea of tampons. 

I'm going to be real with you. I think my mom and the tampon thing and your mom and the DD thing have a common thread-- there is something that society has deemed ""sexual"" about completely normal female experiences, and I think that's what has made our respective mothers uncomfortable. My mom didn't want me sticking things in my vagina because young ladies have no place doing that-- kind of along the lines of the myth that using tampons makes you ""not a virgin,"" which by the way is a load of crap.  I kind of sense that your mom might think it's (for lack of a better term) ""inappropriate"" for a young woman your age to have DD sized breasts. But guess what? You can't make them any smaller! 

You have a right to be comfortable in your clothes and comfortable in your body. Go for the DD bra that feels good on you. If you are a bigger size, don't worry about it.

If that's not an option, you may have to just take some good friends and go yourself if there's really no way of getting your mother to get you fitted. Finding some educational resources on how bras work might help too. Unless she's just going to reply with ""I'M YOUR MOTHER AND I KNOW BEST."" 

NUMERO DOS. Some boys are going to hit on you whether you want them to or not. Thank society for that one. It will happen and unfortunately you need to be prepared. Carry the lion in your heart and know that when you're uncomfortable, it's perfectly okay to tell them to back the fuck off because you're not a piece of meat. You're a human being with feelings, dreams, hopes, and thoughts of your own. Cherish that. Envelope yourself in that. Be proud of that. It will be okay.

You are fine. Some girls take a long time to develop (I took.. three years? before it finally stopped) and some develop very quickly.

So slightly-chubby little me got teased a lot because I turned red and gaspy, while my friend with adult-sized boobs got absolutely nothing because she responded to everything with ""So?"" or ""And?""

Good point about boob reduction for the future, just in case things don't work out between you and your boobs. I hope you give them a chance though. (then again, mine are a/aa, so I have boob envy) ",2,t3_26kdg5

You are more than your boobs. You are a female, but more importantly, you are a human. Just like the boys are. Don't ever forget that. People only can make you feel bad if you let them. Value your abilities, talents, and skills over things you can't control, like your boobs.

20140526214031,birdmommy,"It's normal for breasts to grow quickly - the summer between the end of grade school and the start of high school, we joked that a lot of the girls went away to 'boob camp' because they had nothing in the spring and a full bust in the fall!
Regarding your mom, she may have been thinking that your bra experience should be the same as what hers was at that age. My mom wouldn't buy me a bra at all - she said that girls my age 'didn't need them' and that it was 'bad for your breasts to wear one'. Great for her - she's a B cup at best. I was at least a C, and got harassed like crazy because I 'bounced' when I walked. I ended up getting a summer job specifically so I would have my own money (in my province, you could work at 13 as long as you had your Social Insurance Number).
How will people treat you in high school? Just like they would if you hadn't grown breasts. Some people will be jerks and make comments, some will hit on you - but some will be your friends, some won't even really notice your boobs, and some people won't be attracted to you because of them (e.g. guys who are 'leg men'). If you hadn't sprouted breasts, there would be something else about you that would make people make fun of you or hit on you - or just like you for who you are.

Also, I learned to measure better and got tips on how to do it accurately. I wen  into the bathroom to measure in front of the mirror, which was a recommendation to get the tape placement right. Apparently I was also holding the tape way too tight in all the measurements across the bust. I guess I thought the tape was supposed to be pulled snug, when really it's supposed to just be touching at all points. The snug measure is the UNDERBUST measurement, not all of them, lol!

So, apparently I'm a 28G :0 !

But you know something...I don't care. I saw dozens of posts over there from women who were the same size  or bigger, and all proud off it. I feel so much better! It's amazing how finding something on the net can completely change your thoughts.

But...I still have the problem of getting the right bra, and, well, mom.
This sounds stupid, but I'd almost rather talk to my dad. He's a great guy, and has always been awesome, and  I know he loves me (I'm his little princess). He's just not around much since  he got promoted at his job. 

So, do you think my dad will be weirded out if I bring it up with him?  I love both my parents, it's just that mom and i have been a little prickly for the last few months. But, I couldn't stan  it it if I made dad that way too by talking to him :(

1. You are fine. It doesn't take decades to grow them. You get a surge of hormones and it happens. 

2. Teens/adults are far more interested in their own bodies than yours. Just like you. You're not deformed! Maybe you are interesting to look at, but not car accident inducing. And as interesting as you think you are to everyone, no one finds you are interesting as you do. Remember, it will be a bad hair day for some of those people, and they will be too pre-occupied to deal with you. ""Hope that girl doesn't see my ugly hair!""

3. Yes, you may/may not get more romantic interest towards you. Learn karate*.
4. Only you know how to talk to your mom. But you went to school. Your school taught you how to write a persuasive essay. You know what persuades your mom. Think of talking to her like a homework assignment. I can't offer you advise about this but this is what I would do. Put her in your shoes: Mom, what would you do if you kept growing, but don't particularly want bigger bras, but it hurts? WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

*Karate is how to act towards people, with romantic interest in you, in a way that is polite, concise, and to the point. Basically give them an answer - yes or no. Just be honest. It's a mental thing you're going to have to learn, as well as how to love yourself and deal with love/hate of other humans. I know it's hard to change. You're going to deal with a lot more changes in life. Try to enjoy it and stay cool.

1)Take a look around your vagina with a hand mirror. It's possible (though unlikely) that your hymen is getting in the way

2) Use a plastic applicator like tampax pearl or U by Kotex in the ""slim"" or ""sleek"" size. Plastic applicators are just easier and the slim size is designed for younger ladies who haven't lost their virginity or just have small openings. 

3) Try propping one leg up on the toilet when you're inserting the tampon. I had my first successful insertion in this position. 

4) Read the instruction in the box, they really helped me a lot.

This way, you control what you eat and don't have to spend too much time on it.

It just has to become a habit. 

Other things you can consider is your portion sizes; do you eat accurate portions? Many portion sizes in restaurants are too big because they want you to leave with a full feeling; if you leave and you are hungry afterwards, you will blame the restaurant for not giving you enough food and not worth your money. You can find out what normal portion sizes are by weighing your food and calculating how many calories are in it, and using online resources to find out what normal calorie amounts for meals are.

20140527071415,twicex,"I started looking at the food pyramid a little more closely and realizing that I not only have to eat from all groups, I have to eat the right proportions of each group as well.

It also meant that I didn't have to eat as much meat as I was, and that a lot of the nutrients contained in meat are also found in vegetables.

If I'm not mistaken, you can eat healthy at Subway too. Get the pita/flat bread option, no dressing (some olive oil if you want), one type or no meat, lots of veggies (the ALL THE VEGGIES option is really satisfying)

Another thing I do is to always have a fruit, bag of nuts, and/or tea bags in my bag, wherever I go. It makes me less inclined to buy a candy bar or milkshake or some sugary snack. Also, the constant presence of food gives me a choice of deciding whether or not to have a snack.

Being passively mindful of one's diet is a good way to keep calories in check, however. I let this set breakfast of eggs and coffee work itself out. Subways also makes salads, and you can build them up with cheese and meat and beans so that they are as filling as the sandwich, without (as many) carbs, but that is just from my perspective.

20140527093727,WhiteEraser,"I never cared about what I ate as much before I was diagnosed with a severe gluten allergy (waiting to be tested for celiacs). After I found out, I started realizing that a lot of the stuff I was putting in my body was acting like poison to me. I started to re-evaluate what I was eating. You don't need to diet. Rather, just be more aware of what kind of foods you are putting into your body. I found that cutting out a lot of processed foods, refined sugars, and preservatives has made a big difference. I don't pack on pounds as easily, my skin is clearer, even my mood is better. 

I don't have a lot of time to spend making meals, so I make really simple dishes during the week (Fish/chicken, with veggies) and then on Sunday, I will make a meal that will last for lunches for the entire week (this week me and my fiance made Ratatouille). Since I cannot eat anything with gluten, it is more difficult for me to get my hands on carbs (bread, pasta, etc) so I don't eat very much of it. I also do not eat red meat, all of the protein I take in is lean (chicken and fish/seafood).

For snacking, I usually have air popped popcorn, or mixed raw nuts with raisins. Instead of juices, I drink water and if I need something fruity, I will eat the fruit itself. Also, I am a starbucks addict, so I cut that down and make my own Frappuccino's at home (which cuts down the calories and sugar). I also drink tea to cut random hunger (like when you are suddenly hungry an hour after you stuffed yourself) and it also helps when I have a craving for sweets (Many specialty tea stores have dessert flavoured teas....my favorite, red velvet cake!)

In the end it's not about diets, it's about a lifestyle. I wish I had the mentality before I got really sick. I was pretty well forced to change my entire thoughts on food because I simply just can't walk in anywhere and eat anything I want. It's also worth the time when you go grocery shopping to always read the labels, it's amazing what you find in processed foods (and scary too). 

If you need to get takeout, there are still a lot of ways to cut down sugars, fat, etc. For example, at Subway, instead of regular bread, switch it up for a wrap (If it's an option), load it up with fresh veggies, avoid the 'lunch meat' style protein choice (go with something like chicken breast), you can also easily skip the cheese, and for the dressing, get something that isn't a cream based (no ranch).

My parents got understandably upset when they found out I was talking to him again, and took my car away and called my boss to let her know I needed time off for personal reasons. This sent me off the deep end and I moved back in with him at his parents house. I got my job back, but I have no car and no means to get one right away. This makes me feel stuck. Any other family I could stay with is too far away to keep my current job, which stresses me out to wondering how I would support myself in their rural area. I just feel so stuck and scared, and I know what I need to do. It hangs over my head the thought of how guilty I would be if he did commit suicide as a result of me leaving. I am 23, and he's 26 btw.

20140526215656,writergal1421,"Reckless, this story is good news: If you got out of this bad relationship once, you can do it again. It's not easy - it's never easy - and you've seen the lengths he'll go to to convince you to stay. However, if someone is willing to do as much damage to themselves as jumping out of a speeding car, how much compunction do you think he has for harming other people?

You already know what you need to do. Is there any chance you can ask your parents for help again, on the condition that you cut all contact from this boyfriend? If not, are there any craigslist or roommate.com listings for your area? Getting out of his and his parents' house is a must, and maybe you can find someone in need of a roommate to move in with. 

As for feeling guilty if he should commit suicide - well, that's exactly the emotion he wants you to have. Threatening suicide if someone plans to leave is a form of emotional manipulation and abuse, one that you don't have to put up with. Whatever happens, whatever he decides to do with himself after you leave, he is responsible for his own choices and reactions to the world. Suicide is a choice that he makes; not something you caused him to do. He's 26. He's an adult. He's old enough to know how to respond to adversity and curveballs in life. He chooses not to. That's his choice and *not* your responsibility.",2,t3_26kgwy

20140527202210,AwkwardBurritoChick,"I have to agree with this.  It's all about carrying your weight on a team.  I was put on heavy equipment because I wasn't capable of lifting and carrying 150 lbs of steel.  But I could cut with an oxy-acetelyne torch with great steadiness in my hands, and was able to think smarter, not work harder.  

One thing I definitely suggest is to learn how to shovel and use your gardening trowel to the best efficient manner.  Shoveling is more of a scooping motion; when planting flats stick the gardening trowel in, lift the earth about 6"" then put the flat in the hole, pat down, next.  Also lay out the flats prior to scooping. 

I worked with this one older dude, the best on the landscaping team (Nicknamed Papi) and we had mini-contests which we were so organized we always planted our flats far more faster than other 'teams'.  (one of us would lay out, the other would dig/plant).


I couldn't bolt as tight as my male counter parts, but I was able to foresee and anticipate needs and helped my foreman organize projects better.  As long as you contribute, don't be whiny, remember more what you CAN do versus what you cannot do, will carry far.  

The staying sober is also accurate.  Based on my experience with landscapers which now was about 15 years ago is that there is a lot of drug/alcohol abuse.   These guys also knew more about basic criminal law than most lawyers.   Don't let this scare you off because it could be the start of a new career for you to advance easily and maybe an education in landscape architecture.  Just keep clean, rise above, and with men it's okay to call it like you see it.

In having come from a department in which I worked with an all woman team, they usually don't do that and the norm is to be catty and behind backs.  With guys, especially in labor related fields, just call them out.  

My only last suggestion is when you call out someone or a plan, to only do so when you have an alternative that may work out better or save money.  One of my pet peeves is 'that guy' that will try to dictate or hold up a project because ""it won't work"" and when I ask what he has to offer that's better, ""I don't know"" means to me ""shut the fuck up"".

I owned a landscape company for several years, and the most important things are good boots, hydration and energy. Invest in a quality set of footwear, probably steeltoe/shank -- you don't get a spare pair of feet when these ones get injured. Also invest in good work socks that wick moisture, (**EDIT:** not) 100% cotton. 

For hydration, pack lots of water. What I do is freeze half the bottle overnight and add half the bottle fresh in the morning, then wrap it in a kitchen towel to keep it cool. I also have these neck wraps that I got at a motorcycle shop that you soak in water and tie on. They swell with the water and help keep you cool. 

And finally, protein bars! Fresh fruit and veggies! You are about to be in what might be the best shape of your life, and you're going to get paid to do it. Help your body out by giving it good building blocks and you won't need to spend time in a gym if you don't want to.

Re: landscaping

There is *good* money to be made in that field if you're smart.  Learn everything you can about irrigation and pesticide application.  In my state, having a pesticide applicator' s license means a starting wage of $18 or $20 per hour.  Also, being a woman can open *a lot* of doors for you, once you know your stuff.  Many property managers and board members of HOAs are women.  Several of them have mentioned to me that there are a lot of...shall we say, ""difficult to deal with"" men in landscaping....and dealing with the gals in my company was refreshing.  So capitalize on that shit!

Also, depending on the company/type of landscaping you're doing, remember to save some of that money you get paid during the summer.  Often, times are lean in winter time and it helps to keep the feast/famine aspect of the business in mind.",8,t3_26lkz4
20140527164019,shloppypop,"Boot salesperson here,

boot's 50% 
fit's 50%

And I think what they mean by shank is a plate. To qualify for the highest level of safety (at least here in Canada) You need both a toe guard and plate that mean crushing/puncture resistance. A shank generally refers to a rigid piece of material that supports the center of your foot.

Composite toe and Plates are preferable as they are generally lighter weight, non conductive, and meet all the same safety requirements. 

Waterproofing: A waterproof/breathable sewn in booty is the only way to go but they do impede breath-ability of the footwear

Style wise -  Hikers are comfortable and lightweight but tend not to last as long as a real boot (Welt sewn, full grain uppers, etc etc)

**Fit: Unlaced, make sure you can fit one finger behind your heel when your foot is pressed all the way forward in the boot. Don't listen to the number on the box - It's a guestimation. It should be firm around the mid part of the foot and the heel should fit like a ball into a socket. Toes should be free to wiggle with no pinching - Leather will stretch, protective toe boxes will not. The lacing: the eyelets should have 1"" - 1"" 3/4 gap across the tongue. Once you walk around in them make sure your heel doesn't slide up and down. Lastly, Use your common sense of comfortable and once you found one you like wear them in the store for 15-20 minutes. The leather will behave differently and you'll get a better idea of how the boots will feel in the long run.

Socks: Look for content and construction. Good padding, fitted to the foot, breathable material (I like a mix of wool, polyester, nylon, pima cotton, rubber/spandex, and/or polypropylene)

For starters, most of these stories are about breakups. Suggesting this is due to 'refusing sex' is merely reducing every woman's worth and relationship into how much sex she can provide (Which is ironically the same objectification that this is claiming to 'counter'.). Many different emotions (rejection of something you care about, heart break, or even loss of control) are responsible for leading to acts of passion.

Considering that very rarely do these people go on to suggest that the 'lack of sex' (There is however objectification and entitlement going on, but generally to the woman and relationship as a whole), suggesting that these are in the same ball park is straight up incorrect.

Secondly, even if they were the case, these in themselves are 'anecdotes'. I can go out and google search for similar cases of the opposite sex, and find plenty, such as: 

http://wordondastreet.com/girlfriend-kills-boyfriend-tweeting-wcw-k-woman-crush-wednesday/

Now, I will punctuate this with the fact that when we only use actual statistics women are at a far higher risk of 'murder of passion:

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116352/hosb1210-chap3.pdf

Page 61 has the tables.

Women are more at risk are in their own homes (74 vs 212), making it a  25/75% split in favour? of the women. However it is also worth nothing that this is 286 deaths in a population of 60 MILLION. That is less than 5 deaths per million people a year. To put this into context, on average 217 people a year will die when involved in a vehicle crash involving an animal (Such as hitting a deer). Yet you'd hardly call that a 'society wide issue'.

Remember, violent crime of all kinds is on the sharp decrease, regardless of what the media may claim.

Edit: I used incorrect stats originally, I used the USA road statistics, but the UK crime statistics, which is my bad. To use a better statistic, 200 people a year die from drowning in the UK, yet this is hardly considered a societal problem.",4,t3_26lkjl

It took awhile to get him fired/retired (I think he decided to retire early).  The number of people (men and women) in the room who had had him go all Combat on them was rather large (as in, all the people in the room who had met him).

It was a woman who finally was encouraged to pursue a case against him (the management wanted him out, they coaxed her into reporting his behavior - he injured her while trying to grab a male coworker by the throat).  I don't think she's ever really gotten over all the feelings involved in that year long investigation.

If I am not wrong the UK has 63 million and not 318 million inhabitants. (You are quoting UK numbers here.)

And to put that into perspective (whatever perspective your are trying to create here): in 2012 a whole of 1,754 fatal road incidents occurred. I doubt 200 of them were animal involved. (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reported-road-casualties-in-great-britain-main-results-2012)

And the analogy still fits, regardless of your attempt at analogies. The fact is that a small minor minority of people (Majority of this minor minority men) are sick enough in the head to objectify others to the count that they are willing to take their lives.

If you want to look at world wide murder stats: http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Globa_study_on_homicide_2011_web.pdf

Women are primarily killed by their spouses, then family members, then acquaintances, then strangers. For men it is the exact opposite in terms of who kills them. You can see examples and breakdowns by country in that report. It is a world wide societal problem that women are killed primarily by current and former domestic partners. 

There is a reason for that. To say it's just ... what? An accident? A statistical oddity that women get killed primarily by their domestic partners is flying in the face of reason. While murder rates go down in countries, the percentage of people who are killed being female goes up. Domestic murder rates drop at a lower rate than over all murder and there is a reason for that. 

In western democratic countries the it's usually guessed that 1 in 4 to 1 in 8 women (depending on the country) experience domestic abuse in their lifetime. If a quarter to a tenth of your population experiences a specific kind of violence, and most female murder victims are murdered by their spouses, that's a societal problem. It indicates a sizeable minority of your population thinks it's OK to harm women and that this problem has not been adequately addressed.",2,t3_26lkjl

You're absolutely right, it's not unbelievable, but most people don't hide being an asshole.  Unless they're psychotic. It's generally a fairly present trait, because it usually effects most of their behavior.  

If someone is an asshole only about how you touch their favorite guitar, that doesn't make them an asshole.

Nor was I talking about her ex being an asshole.  I was just saying, he's probably your ex for a reason.  
It's just uncanny how many women, no matter how badly their ex treated them, would go back to their shit ex in exchange for a little comfort and security. Again, this is not about the OP, nor does it apply to every situation.  Just in general.

I had a hard time even calling it molestation for a long time. Not until I took a child abuse and neglect class in school where my behavior throughout my whole life was just so spot on to children who have been molested.

Another aspect of my issue is that there were a lot of mental games that we're used to control me.
I was molested by two sisters who would hold me down and hump me or pull off my clothes and look inside my vagina. All while being babysat by their mother who truly was oblivious.
Their mother was also really strict on diet I.e. No junk food. The girls would get really jealous of the fact that I was allowed to eat fruit roll ups and pop tarts and all that crap. So, in order to get my treats.. They would kind of blackmail me by saying ""if you don't bring us pop tarts tomorrow we'll tell your mom you like to touch us down there.""

Even though I was the victim, they would threaten to say I was the aggressor.
The older of the two girls was 14 while I was 6. Truly, a 14 year old knows what she is doing much more than a 6 year old.

I have always felt as though people think I'm a lesbian because of those terrible years being babysat. And this happened for a period of about 3 years.

This is the important part. Many kids do weird sexual things when they are little, and it is often mutual. There are clear cases of molestation/abuse, and those tend to be marked by both reluctance on the part of the victim and mental scarring. If you look back upon these experiences and don't feel angry, regretful, dirty: that's okay! If it is not affecting your daily life my suggestion would honestly be to not over-analyze it. Thinking about such instances might make you feel differently about them because of your adult perspective. Feelings might change. But, in most cases, it's just ""weird kid stuff.""

However, if you can say definitively that you WERE forced into doing these things and they made you uncomfortable/upset/unhappy or hurt you DURING THAT TIME then yet, it was abuse. BUT, if the kid was the same as you, it could also be unintentional. Anything involving two children is so hard to analyze. Of course it's a very, very grey area but I think digging into scenarios involving childhood messing around can be pretty damaging for the psyche if you start ""looking for abuse.""

I think a lot of ignorance will be lifted as gender roles get eroded away as well, they probably contribute a lot to people thinking women are incapable of abuse. 

The problem is that you're looking back on your actions as a child with the mind of an adult. What you did seems terrible, because now you know it's bad. It's obviously not as serious, but plenty of perfectly normal adults stole things and bit people as children, because they didn't know it was wrong, or didn't fully understand what they were doing.

It started as play and my friend sort of pushed it towards something that became a lot more, but while I was uninformed about sex at the time, I was in no way opposed to what we were doing. It was enjoyable, and considerably mutual, and it went on for years every time she would come to spend the night. On the other hand, because the experience left us both so vulnerable emotionally, I can completely sympathize with what you must have gone through over this. Any time I saw this friend in a school setting, knowing what we had done the night before, I was struck with an overpowering sense of embarassment and shame. That is how I know, because you were actually molested, how great these challenges are to overcome internally. Years later, once I came to the full realization of what my friend and I had experienced together, I wasn't necessarily upset that it happened. I still love and care about her to this day, but as a child with no one to talk to about this, I still went through periods of self-loathing and questioning of my sexuality, as well as a lot of guilt. I was guilty that I had engaged so willingly, that we had enjoyed it, and I wasn't sure if the experience meant I was not a virgin, not ""straight"", etc. Again, having no one to talk to about this made the anxiety over what had transpired much worse, and it wasn't until I came clean to people years later that the stigmas were removed. To this day, I still recall that the two of us got other girls we knew involved in our activities a few times as well, and I regret that what seemed like ""fun"" could have potentially impacted those people, even though none of them had ever objected or seemed uncomfortable at the time. From my experiences, don't blame yourself for emulating the behavior of someone who was older than you that you respected. If the girl I had been hooking up with hadn't been my best friend at the time, and my same age, I am not sure I would have been able to rationalize the experience this well as an adult. You have experienced legitimate sexual abuse, and no matter why it occurred, you were too young to have been able to comprehend the full implications of what was happening.

Don't put him down by saying that you've faked it, making him feel as though the sex was disingenuous. If you are willing to try new things thats something you and him can discuss, but don't make climaxing the focus of sex, this could lead to much disappointment and a feeling of failure if you do not find something that makes you finish. Sex should be fun and it seems like you have fun having sex with him, so emphasize that and don't make the climax the end all of sex. To be super cliche, its about the journey not the destination.

Your body is off-limits without your express say so, especially in a professional work environment. Touching, attempting to touch, making comments about your status (pregnant or not), is both very rude and sexual harassment. 

Even if you were pregnant, and announcing it, they would still have zero recourse to touch you without your permission. I don't understand why people have a problem respecting pregnant women's bodily autonomy.

Regardless of the brand you use, lube is the great equalizer.  If your having trouble, slather the applicator with it.  

TSS is very rare these days because tampon manufacturers have to limit how absorbent their products are.  If you're worried, stick to regular or light absorbency tampons and change them more frequently.  

You can also try a menstrual cup if the idea of tampons is just too uncomfortable.  No risk of TSS, and because the material isn't absorbent, it doesn't ""tack"" to your vaginal walls the way a cotton tampon sometimes does.",2,t3_26lemx

Get to know yourself! 

Take a mirror, feel, explore. You will notice your vagina is not that deep and is blocked by your cervix so things don't really get easily lost in there. Also knowing the shape/direction your vagina is in will help a lot with inserting a tampon.
The lube advice is also really good. Remember the best/cheapest lube is your saliva ;)

For my second pregnancy, we were trying to get pregnant, so I was paying more attention to possible signs. The only early sign of pregnancy I had was a really strong aversion to smells. I was sitting at the kitchen table, and I was disgusted by the smell of egg shells that were in the garbage can in a closet. I couldn't take the smell and had to take the garbage out to get rid of the stink of eggshells. I took a test first thing the next morning, and it was positive.

Often they are competing for the same girl that the persistent cute but down-on-his-luck protagonist. And the girls are resistant and the audience hates these guys for being pushy. 

This imparted on me the lesson that it's really bad to be at all aggressive with girls. By not-at-all-aggressive, I mean that I wouldn't ""make a move"" or try to escalate a situation. We're kissing? Well, I'm not gonna try to touch her boob, that would make me too aggressive. Which put me into a long series of awkward mis-steps at dating where I was not making a move and the girls were waiting for me to make a move, and so no move happened and our dating would quickly fissile out and I'd be left wondering what I did wrong. 

It only really fuels the idea of women as gatekeepers and that the men are just trying to impress them until the women reward us with sex. When in reality it's just two young people feeling each other out for how interested they are, and when you don't make a move, they might doubt that you are that interested in them. 

My girlfriend tells a story about how she went on a date with a friend in college and rather than kissing her, he moved in close, so close, like it was obvious they were going to kiss, and she wasn't backing away...and then he asked if he could kiss her and that this was a huge turnoff for her and it got awkward and no more dates. 

Thus, boys are learning that you need permission, you need to earn her trust, you need to not be too aggressive...but are totally missing out that you also need to make a romantic connection and have chemistry and turn her on, and if all you're doing is earning trust and begging for permission, you're not turning her on and so she's not going to be inclined to say yes. Whereas the ""douchebag jock"" is probably erring on the side of less caution and probably being a little too aggressive, and probably making moves on girls that aren't that interested...but also making moves on girls that are interested enough to go along with it and therefore getting their ""foot in the door.""

Doing that is, well, kinda looked down on, so when it does happen, it's generally assumed that yes, it was probably a mental health issue. 

But there is definitely several vocal and vehement communities of men that do this for their negative feelings about women, communities that the shooter was part of. Being surrounded by nothing but like minds is basically like an echo chamber for the worst aspects of the group. 'I resent women for denying me sex so I deserve to take my anger out on them,' is a state of mind that a huge number of men either have, or unknowingly contribute to in our culture. The toxic messages about what define manhood and dehumanize women in just about every form of media just hammers that mindset in even further.

20140528031912,HonestNeckbeard,"Thank you!  I'm one of the guys that fits your description. Now that I'm in my 30's I've had to try and accept that companionship, love and sex are simply not something I get to experience. Sometimes I'm fine with it but other times it hurts a lot. The world can be a very lonely place at times. Does this mean that I hate women? No.  Do I blame others for my flaws? No.

What I don't like though is the way that men like myself are increasingly becoming stereotyped as misogynists. Perhaps I just notice it more because I frequent sites like Jezebel and have many feminist friends, or perhaps I'm just more sensitive to it, but it has got to the stage where I feel even less able to express how lonely I am as it feels like guys like me are no longer allowed to say that they feel lonely without coming across as entitled.

Unfortunately, in many ways I fit the ""Nice Guy"" stereotype too. Physically I fit the bill. To the point where if I was photographed next to one of my female friends and the image ended up on Reddit there would be several ""LOL FRIENDZONED"" comments within seconds. I'm not physically attractive and yeah I have a neckbeard. My kind is mocked, and I'm used to that.  I'm ugly, and I'm used to that. But now I feel that because of the way I look and because of my lack of relationship experience people are starting to presume that I must therefore be an entitled bitter misogynist.

The unfortunate truth is that there are misogynists in every part of society. There are misogynists in the office, on the sports field and yes, at sic-fi conventions. Some misogynists are attractive and date many women, some misogynists will likely die virgins.",8,t3_26mswy

20140528061318,JimminyBobbit,"The people on reddit who post ""LOL FRIENDZONE"" at this pictures are guys.  You need to talk to the guys about this.

You're probably not as 'ugly' as you think you are because you know what?  ""attractiveness"" is not a static thing and is not something based on purely a physical look and everyones preference of physical looks is different anyway.  DO NOT BUY INTO THE MYTH OF THE ""X OUT OF 10 SCALE"" that is BULLSHIT.

Example - people think Johnny Depp is amazing, gorgeous, blah blah 10 out of 10 - I don't see it AT ALL.   People think Jennifer Lawrence is amazing, gorgeous, blah blah 10 out of 10 - I don't see it AT ALL.
So physical looks are very open to interpretation.

Despite that, there are ways to make yourself appear more physically attractive - and that is, of course, good hygiene, good grooming (taking care of your face and hair etc and you know, getting rid of monobrows), dressing tidily and in clean presentable clothes that fit you, standing up straight, with your head level, looking people in the eye, smiling, interacting appropriately with others, being polite to others etc...  This is not about trying to up numbers on some mythical scale, this is about presenting people the image of someone who cares about themselves and presenting the best of themselves in the world, because they have respect for themselves and intend to respect others.

Those things get noticed and are considerably more attractive than the absence of them.

Personality is a HUGE huge thing. 

It doesn't matter if you look like.. I don't know..  Hottest guy on Earth right now, if you have the personality of wet cardboard, you aren't going to have good relationships - platonic, or romantic.

Nice guys are NOT the problem and are not the demons that some people make them out to be.  The problem is the users who take the 'nice guy' term and apply it to themselves, when they are not NICE guys, nice people AT ALL.  They are using it as a label to explain away any fault in them not getting what they wanted.  When there sense of entitlement is shook, they say ""oh.. well I'm a nice guy so of course she didn't say yes to going out with me, even after I sent her 48 text messages!  She'd rather have an asshole who doesn't message her!""

You don't have to be mocked, or ugly.  You don't have to be used to it.  And it makes me sad that you think you should.  This is not about entitlement, or revenge.  This is about being the best version of yourself and having esteem for yourself.

There are things you can do to not be that way, things that are normal and natural and NOT about trying to manipulate anyone.  Firstly, you need to not buy into that PUA crap about 'attractive scale' and that people need to date 'within their attractive scale' - fuck that, you don't know what the person over there thinks is physically attractive anyway, and there are many more things that go into being attracted to someone than the distance between and the color of their eyes!

I'm not sure what the neckbeard thing is, but you could probably shave it.

That, however, doesn't necessarily support your assertion that this is why false rape accusations happen.  Firstly, less trauma does not mean no trauma, or that the supposed benefits of being thought to have been raped will somehow outweigh the costs involved in being publicly labeled as a rape victim.  

Secondly, making any claim about false rape is difficult because we don't know how many false rape claims there are.  False rape accusations are exceedingly difficult to measure.  Not only does measuring a false allegation involve proving a negative, but it's complicated by police actions and prejudices, as well as different definitions and different laws across jurisdictions and studies.

Definitely an important thing to consider.

The problem is that this is precisely when women need you, a good man, to speak up. Otherwise you give the bad ones tacit approval of their mindset. Here is a short list of the things you need to call men out on, even when they're joking:

* Rape jokes. These are never okay, and perpetuate a culture of rape.
* Catcalling. It is not a compliment. It is a randomly hurled barb of unexpected and potentially dangerous attention most women don't want.
* Talking about ""crazy ex-girlfriends."" More often than not men use the term to dismiss women, rather than diagnosing a real mental illness.
* Using terms like bossy, catty, pushy when women do things men get away with easily.
* Saying things like ""I couldn't date a woman who doesn't shave."" or ""Women shouldn't dye their hair, natural looks better."" or ""She should smile more."" These phrases are all about taking away a woman's right to manage her own body, even if the men don't think of it that way.
* Implying that women get preferential treatment because of their gender. The amount of shit women have to put up with is in no way balanced by a sexist cop occasionally waiving a ticket for a pretty woman.
* Discussing women's looks, pretty much ever. Sometimes it can sound like butchers sizing up a cut of meat. 
* Talking about the ""Friendzone"". The concept of the ""friendzone"" is essentially that women don't have a right to choose who they're attracted to.
* Disparaging women for having many sexual partners. It's no business of anyone's how much sex women have, and it has no impact on their value as a person.
* Implying that men have uncontrollable urges. Saying things like ""I can't resist"" or ""I can't be held responsible"" are bullshit ways of placing blame on women. 
* Belittling men about being unassertive. There is a lot of cultural emphasis placed on men's sexual dominance. This is bad, and trains men to think they should keep trying if women say no.
* When men get more offended at false rape accusations than rape itself.
* Blue balls. An attempt to place the burden of sexual satisfaction on women, as though they are intentionally causing them harm by not having sex with them.

There are a lot more. Any time something like this happens, be the voice of opposition. Don't let them think that casual sexism is okay, because that's what leads to much worse things.

Sure everyone can have a preference. But there's a difference between tacitly agreeing to their preferences by not saying anything and asking them in response ""Well, do you shave your legs?""

It's not about smashing a feminist book into their heads. It's about breaking the echo chamber that has led to the majority of men not even being hesitant to admit that they want women to remove a natural part of their bodies.

I find it funny that you specify ""as a dating partner."" This is not about who you, personally, would or would not date. This is about not judging people based on things that are none of your business.

If someone were to say ""She's a total slut, she slept with the whole school,"" the appropriate response is ""So?""

Then it should be stated as ""I prefer X,"" not ""she should do X."" Besides, most fashion choices women make are *not* to appear good-looking to men, they are to appear good-looking to themselves.

>This is far too broad of a statement, it has no impact on their value as a person, however it may have an impact on their value as a dating partner( and I use this statement regardless of gender)

I think /u/WatersLethe is trying to say that having had mutliple sexual parters in the past (not more than one at a time) does not make you any less of a person or a dating partner. I don't think they were trying to say having more than one at the same time should be okay to any potential dating partner (although some people are fine with polyamorous relationships).

- Rape jokes. These are never okay, and perpetuate a culture of rape.

No. No, they actually don't. Do violent video games make people violent? Are people *really* that easily swayed? The fact is that even the term ""rape culture"" has been denounced by the [*largest, American organization against sexual violence*, RAINN.](http://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf) I think it's a very dangerous way to go if  you think humour (which often by default is tasteless to the majority) perpetuate violent action. 

- Catcalling. It is not a compliment. It is a randomly hurled barb of unexpected and potentially dangerous attention most women don't want.

Agree with you a 90% though I'm not sure if it's dangerous, it's absolutely harassment and should be discouraged whenever possible. No one wants to be yelled at one their way home/work or whatever just because of their gender. Should be, and many place is, a form of sexual or just plain harassment. 

- Talking about ""crazy ex-girlfriends."" More often than not men use the term to dismiss women, rather than diagnosing a real mental illness.

Not entirely sure what you mean here and I can pretty much guarantee  you that women are just as liable to smear their ex-boyfriend like the men, and I don't think anyone but psychiatrists are very much accepted to diagnose someone's mental illness, so I don't think that's what men ought to do. Some relationships end badly and with bad blood, it's natural that some smack-talk will happen. 

- Using terms like bossy, catty, pushy when women do things men get away with easily.

I think both genders are just as liable to do and be accused by both. It's a cultural stereotype that women are the bosses of the relationship/home, and I can guarantee you that this is a stereotype used by plenty a'women to justify their authoritative actions. Less now, hopefully, but it has a historical reason to be. 

- Saying things like ""I couldn't date a woman who doesn't shave."" or ""Women shouldn't dye their hair, natural looks better."" or ""She should smile more."" These phrases are all about taking away a 

You need to relax with this, because you're going dangerous near thought-police actions and trying to demand people to not have personal opinions. Look, it's entirely justifiable for a person to not date or go out with people who have body hair or something that doesn't appeal to them. Now, don't get me wrong, it's something else entirely to *demand the other person to change* based solely on your preference, but having preference isn't wrong. Many women wouldn't date a man with beard and have their own superficial code of dating but that doesn't make them any more sexist than men having the same type of preference. 

- Implying that women get preferential treatment because of their gender. The amount of shit women have to put up with is in no way balanced by a sexist cop occasionally waiving a ticket for a pretty woman.

Somewhere they do, like in some countries they enforce quota to get a certain number of women into the work-force, but it's just some places. I don't really mind that and think it's been a clever way to force changes in the employment scene. What I'm focused on is that we treat women less like victims. They aren't, they're human  beings and they aren't constant victims of sexism and they aren't evil people hell-bent on global domination. 

- Discussing women's looks, pretty much ever. Sometimes it can sound like butchers sizing up a cut of meat.

With all due respect, fuck off. You **can not** argue that sort of limitation. People WILL discuss other peoples' look and they WILL judge them by it. Women or men, and NEITHER is a sexist, racist or evil act by itself. So what if someone says they prefer blondes or red-heads? Are they not allowed to have preferences? Are they not allowed to talk about them? You do not get to set such limitations. 

- Talking about the ""Friendzone"". The concept of the ""friendzone"" is essentially that women don't have a right to choose who they're attracted to. 

Agree with you a 100% -- Friendzone and the whole concept of it is just idiotic at its core. It seems to imply people are entitles to romantic relationship because they've been nice or something and *how dare* the woman just regard that person as a mere friend? Tch. Idiotic. 

- Disparaging women for having many sexual partners. It's no business of anyone's how much sex women have, and it has no impact on their value as a person.

Yup. The sexual relations of whatever person is their own business. Women aren't sluts or whores because they like having sex or have had multiple partners, that sort of moronic thinking is what's wrong with men these days, if you ask me. But that idea of sexual impurity has been propagated by more than just men and religion; splinter groups of feminism has actually been complicit in that. 

- Implying that men have uncontrollable urges. Saying things like ""I can't resist"" or ""I can't be held responsible"" are bullshit ways of placing blame on women.

Agree with you again. I've never understood nor supported the idea that men are somehow ""horn-dogs"" and can't stop themselves. Of course we fucking can and of course we are liable for what we do. That's just idiotic and to be honest it's insulting to men when someone claims that. 

- Belittling men about being unassertive. There is a lot of cultural emphasis placed on men's sexual dominance. This is bad, and trains men to think they should keep trying if women say no. 

If I get what you're saying, that you're tackling the whole ""she's just playing hard to get"" or ""if you just press on it will be bound to happen"" then I'm with you a 100%, that sort of idiotic nonsense ought to end and is often given credence in movies from Disney and the sort. 

- When men get more offended at false rape accusations than rape itself.

It's entirely possible and probably probable to be just as offended by both.  It's really not an ""either / or"" discussion. It's horrible that some people try to falsely claim rape and it's abominable that people get raped. You're allowed to be concerned with either without being accused of diminishing the other. 

- Blue balls. An attempt to place the burden of sexual satisfaction on women, as though they are intentionally causing them harm by not having sex with them.

Kiiiiinda not getting this one. I mean I know the concept of blue balls, but it doesn't imply that women are at fault, just at men aren't getting any sex or such and it's frustrating. That is entirely legitimate to feel that you aren't getting any. But then again it's not justification to accuse other people of doing you injustice. 

Phew. Lots of stuff written here, hope you can forgive me for that. You wrote a lot of interesting points, but I don't think you're hitting the mark entirely and some of what you've written seems unnecessarily aggressive and judgmental towards men.

A woman of course has the right to her own body and do whatever she wants with it.  But at the same time, I as a person have formed my own opinions on what I find attractive. I have the right to decide if the changes a woman makes to her body changes the way I think about her.  Obviously the reverse is true as well.  I doubt my SO would like it if I grew out a joe dirt mullet.   

Another example is with gauges,piercings,tattoos.  I do not find them appealing and so I wouldn't think of dating a woman who had an abundance of these.  We all have personal preferences about what we like in a partner.

The above categories hold a ton of power over our society and our culture, and they are hugely overwhelmingly occupied by men. Thus, those men are driving our society and our culture almost entirely. Women's voices in the driving forces of society and culture are absolutely miniscule.

it isn't easy to do.  you will inevitably harm some relationships.  some others will be strengthened if your friends have the insight to respect your stance.

since you asked for specific examples, here are some from my own experience.  i've tried to include some color about the consequences so you know what one might expect:

* confront sexist speech.  how gently or boldly is up to you.  example: interjected in a conversation where a bunch of guys were critiquing a mutual female friend's appearance (specifically, that they thought she was a butterface).  this is, by the way, a high-achieving friend training to be a physician.  i said something to the effect of ""c'mon guys, that isn't cool. she's a great person, is going to be successful and most would be lucky to date her.""  that was met with mumbled ""yeah, i guess so""s and the conversation drifted elsewhere.
* refuse to participate in sexist activities.  i have a very strict policy against strip clubs and my stance on that is crystal clear to my friends.  if they go as part of some social activity (e.g. bachelor party), i will wait elsewhere or skip the overall social event.  i doubt it has influenced any of my friends, but it's important that they know that someone objects.  it almost came to a showdown once with a friend who tried to physically force me into one.

men with progressive views about gender equality need to serve as a visible standard to those who don't.  it's probably easy for men who don't hold these beliefs to dismiss those who do as buzzkills or ""white knights"" or whatever.  but i'm hopeful that my position can at least cause some of my male peers to question their stances.

In order to spare myself some stress, I just started finding her behaviour amusing instead of irritating, and when she gets really difficult I just practice acceptance. At this point, there's nothing to gain by arguing with your mother over whether she has it worst. Just validate her feelings if you can, keep it silent if you can't. If she's blaming everyone but herself, play her game and act shocked when things don't turn out well.

20140527114600,Judgymental,"Then just practice mentally letting go of the irritation that comes with hearing her complain. I think I learned it from a brief meditation exercise I did. You basically catch yourself getting annoyed, then  breathe in, breathe out, and mentally stop focusing on it. The amusement might come later, I started finding it funny when I was able to look at my parents (and everyone around me) with compassion. You have to realise, that for her, it is hard on her, and if she has no capacity for empathy or compassion, she probably thinks that it's harder for her than for your father. **That will probably never change.** Repeat that to yourself until you start to accept it. You have to come to peace with it, you're the only one who's getting stressed out in this situation. Your mother certainly isn't stressed out. 


As for your situation with your father, I'm assuming you're helping out, and you and him get to hear her complain? Maybe he finds it annoying too and wants it to stop? In that case, you have to employ a longer term strategy. Either you or anyone else who is close to your mother will have to build up a relationship with her before you tell her to knock it out. The exact strategy will be dependant on what your mother responds to. Shaming by others? Asking her to consider your father's viewpoint? (highly unlikely by the way you've described her) Leverage your relationship? If all else fails, simple dismissiveness might be your last resort. She complains, you go 'I know Mom, but I don't want to hear it anymore'. Repeat till she stops. If she objects, stay calm, do not get angry (practising this beforehand might help). Again, this is a long term strategy, do not try it before you build up some trust with her (validation of her feelings works for this). 

I'm sorry you're going through with this, just a reminder that you need to find self preservation strategies. Stuff that will lower your stress and build up your mental strength. This will probably be a struggle until she dies, don't lose yourself in it. ",4,t3_26m2gg

She'd scream at me if I headed toward the bath at 9:01 instead of 9:00. She'd lunge at me if I was on the phone for five minutes, one second instead of five minutes. She'd berate me ad nauseam through the bathroom door (it takes as long as it takes, a'ight?) if I left a single spoon on the drainboard, but when I was able to come out she'd already put it away.

She'd insist I keep my bedroom door open, claiming that one one was going to invade my privacy ... except that's all she ever did. Barge in without knocking, demand use of my printer, then stand there and criticize my housekeeping while she waited. If I minimized a window as she came in, she accused me of behaving suspiciously, of acting like I had something to hide. Not that there was anything wrong with what I was looking at, but she **would** criticize at length and make me feel as though I was responsible for its existence and ought to feel terribly ashamed of it. (Not religious, by the way!)

Among other things as I was growing up, she barely let me do anything or go anywhere or have many friends. And she wonders why I'm not setting the world on fire with my amazing life skills. She was always verbally attacking me over inconsequential things: ""Why are you doing it ***that*** way?"" with such a disdainful sneer. As if it mattered. As if it affected her.

She nearly ruined my wedding by continually insisting that things go the way *she* wanted them.

I can't have a phone ""conversation"" with her without wanting to scream and strangle her. I can't get a word in edgewise, even after she asks me a question.

This might seem like a weird question, but do you feel like your mom got worse after menopause?  The reason I ask is because once my mom hit about 45, she took a nosedive and while these bits of her personality were always present, they became magnified by 10000 after she began menopause.",3,t3_26m2gg
20140527122708,JamaisVue,"Oh, for sure. When I was little, she was pretty good to me. When I turned about 11, she started getting jealous, yelling at me all the time, and just over-all went completely psycho. It was like a jekyll/hyde phenomenon. Since that point, I swear she gets worse regularly. Nowadays, she's much less outwardly angry. She used to break things out of violence and push me, scream all the time, cry and make a huge scene everywhere, etc. It transformed into more gaslighting, less yelling but more passive-agression, more guilting me, definitely way more using me for money and items.

",2,t3_26m2gg
20140527161647,27thproblem,"It is totally okay/normal/healthy to dislike your mom.

Being a mom-- like every other job in the world-- is something some people are naturally gifted at, something that others can learn to do well, something that some have to struggle at and may never really get right despite their best efforts... *aaaaand* something that some people are just totally absolutely not cut-out for and never will be.

Your story is pretty similar to mine and my mom's-- one big difference being that my mom is very smart and a very hard-worker and, well, she would fall into that third group I mentioned above: she's been trying her damnedest all my life to be a Good Mom-- but the fact is, she and I are irreconcilably different personality-wise and that's not something she'll ever be able to overcome.

At this point (after a lot of therapy) I've accepted that when it comes to social/emotional stuff, I have to *always* take the high road with her. I have to accommodate her. I have to shield her from stuff she can't handle, accept a certain amount of unintended verbal abuse and just brush it off, *listen* to her constant advice on stuff but then immediately force myself to forget it lest it ruin my life, and just basically be the best-friend sort-of person she was never socially well equipped enough to get for herself.

I *could* just cut her off. Refuse to speak to her anymore-- but I think in the long run that would just make me feel worse, not actually fix anything with her, and, truthfully, I know she *means* well-- she just does not have the ability to understand me. She never has and she never will.

One of my coping strategies is that I won't spend more than a day or two continuously in her presence (if it can be helped at all)... Growing up under her roof, I learned how to be extremely patient with mean, angry and irrational people... but even I have a breaking point. More than two days in her company and I start to lose my cool.

I encourage you to stop guilting yourself for not loving/liking your mom-- you are not responsible for her in any way and that is all there is to it. You don't owe her anything and don't let anyone shame you into thinking otherwise.

If you don't want to cut her out of your life completely-- set boundaries, even if they're secret invisible boundaries that you don't tell her about. Identify for yourself exactly how much time you can bear to spend with her and then refuse to exceed that limit. And don't feel beholden to visiting her periodically-- there's nothing wrong with choosing not to see her for months or a year or more. Give yourself space to get over her and even grieve over the fact that you didn't get the mom/daughter relationship the world taught you to expect.

The thing about relatives is that you *can* not see them or speak to them for a long time and then come back to them and that's okay.

50 yr woman here.  I don't like my mother.  She is a terrible person.  She treated me very poorly most of my life and is still not pleasant to be around.  

I do see her about once every year or 2, for about 48 hours.  I try to call for 5 minutes on a weekly basis (get the answering machine most times) - mostly for weather updates.  I no longer allow her to drag me into her drama.   

I moved several thousand miles away.  And she doesn't visit.    

Keeping very strong and firm boundaries is really the only way to go if I am going to keep any type of relationship with my mother.  I have accepted that I will never have the mother/daughter relationship that so many of my friends have.  She will never be my best friend, or even a good friend.  She will be treated with kindness and respect, and that's about it. 

Out of 4 kids (2 stepbrothers, me and my younger brother), I'm the only one who even makes an effort - small as it is.  

No, you don't have to like her.  You don't have to see her.  You don't have to deal with her.    Having toxic people in your life is toxic for YOU.  I chose to have her in my life on my terms.  I have no qualms about cutting her out of my life again if necessary.  So she behaves herself now and our relationship is better than it's ever been.

Anyways, I've always said that just because someone gave birth to you doesn't give them the right to be an ass.  My mother is a very emotionally manipulative crap bag. My dad passed away when I was younger, and she resents me for being more like him and, frankly, liking him a lot more. 

I turn into this shell of a person when I talk to her/interact with her in any way. I am stressed and anxious and upset. And I think, if I had that with another person, would I continue that particular relationship?  Absolutely not. So why should it be the same with this older woman who is completely mean to me, just because she gave birth to me?

We are adults, we deserve to be treated with respect.  Frankly, when we were children, we still deserved at least *some* respect.  This person has screwed that up in my life for 25 years, and thus, is losing her own child as a presence in her life.  

Sorry, this turned into a vent session for me.  OP, you are not alone. And do NOT feel like a bad person--there are many of us out there with the same thoughts/feelings/etc about the person who gave birth to us.  

I have a new job, a new boyfriend, a new apartment--I wish dearly I could be like ""Look mom, I want to show you my place!"" or ""I've found someone special"" but I can't.  And that's okay!

The work your boyfriend is doing now is setting himself up for success down the road.  The more he can front load his career, both the higher he can climb that ladder, and the more money he can bring in for the family.  It also means that when you two have a family, he's in a much better place to support multiple people, not just you two.

You are working as a team.  He can't front load his career unless *you* give him that opportunity.  That's entirely on you, and that comes from working together.  In other for your household to operate, there is a set amount of work that has to be done.  That work has to be done regardless of you being at home or you being someplace else bringing in extra money (dishes, vacuum, grocery shopping, etc).  If you are at home doing that work, A) you two get to spend more quality time together, b) you don't take a big an income hit when you have kids, c) as I said earlier, you two are setting him up for a better career, which will enable him to provide for you and your family better when kids come into the picture.

You are very lucky.  

*edit* another way to look at it is this way....  think of how many executives have the same assistant for 20 or 30 (or more) years, even between multiple companies.  Why is that?

Every great executive assistant that I have seen speaks AS that executive.  They are a team.  The assistant isn't a secretary, they aren't a gate keeper, they aren't just someone that answers the phones.  They are someone that operates as half of a whole.

My boyfriend says he doesn't expect me to do anything extra, but I still feel obligated to do a lot of the housework. I usually take care of the housework, we split the dishes for the most part, and take a ""whatever"" approach to who cooks. Once I'm working I'm not sure how these tasks will divvy up, but for now I feel like it's my ""job"" to clean house.

So I definitely feel where you're coming from with the guilt. I get worried he'll end up resenting me if I don't justify me weight. However - I think you're doing awesomely, and the fact that you're worrying about it shows that you're not just a ""worthless freeloader"". You're a functional member of the household, and just because this is how things are right now doesn't mean they'll always be this way.

The biggest thing I've been working on while struggling with this is not worrying about the opinions of other people. The person whose opinion I value most is my boyfriend's, and if he's okay with me turning down crappy jobs to wait for a better opportunity, then I'm not going to let other peoples' potential opinions about me being a ""freeloader"" bother me. I just do my best to apply to jobs, be helpful, and clean house. I know I'm not freeloading, he knows I'm not freeloading, and that's what matters.

By that I mean are you going to school or recovering from something medical/mental that would require a stress break? Because priorities definitely come into play.

My situation is a bit different because my boyfriend makes more than enough to cover the both of us (we're both 26), but I've still been helping out a little with groceries/necessities etc from my savings. I'm actively looking for a job and fingers crossed that I'll get one, because I *want* to contribute more. He's fine with things right now, but I don't think it would work for him (or me) forever. If I wasn't actively job hunting I think he and I would have a conversation since he didn't sign up to support me.

However, if I got a part time job that didn't make enough for me to cover 50%-50% on our joint expenses (and manage a reasonable savings on top of that), I think it would only be fair to go with something like 30%-70% or 20%-80% proportionate to income. It's something he and I would have to discuss and come to an agreement on, because it really depends on what you and your partner expect in a relationship and how each of you defines ""fairness"" when it comes to expenses. It can be really tricky and stressful to discuss this kind of thing, but it's so important to be on the same page as your partner!

You are probably asking yourself ""How the heck does that even work?!""  Well, let me tell you!  First of all, I'm also going to school.  So, yes, I do get out of the house from time to time, but only during my daughter's school hours, and definitely not every day of the week.  Next semester my on-campus classes will only take up 2 hours of time twice a week.  The rest of my classes are taken online, which allows me to do the work after my daughter goes to bed at night, or during my free time while she is at school.  ""But how can you afford school supplies, groceries, AND bills?!"" you are undoubtedly wondering!  Simple!  I live on a strict budget, and I work online (also doing some transcription work, and other odds and ends through mturk and similar websites) during school hours to bring in more income.  

But that doesn't really answer the heart of your question here… See, you asked what we stay-at-home folks do to feel valuable, but that isn't what you really need to know.  The fact is that no matter WHAT you do, it will not change how you feel about yourself.  You are already doing a lot of stuff!  You go to school, you pay your own bills, you cook and clean and you still want to do more!  You ARE absolutely 100% valuable already, and if you don't FEEL like you are valuable, doing more stuff will only make you more exhausted, but it won't change those feelings.  Those feelings are coming from somewhere deeper inside you, perhaps from a place of self-laothing or insecurity (which is *totally* normal).  I think that the only way you will feel more valuable is by taking time for YOU.  You need to spend some time looking within yourself and recognizing the good things about you, and the good things you do.  You need to build up your self-confidence and take notice of your achievements!  Spend time with you, and spend time knowing you.  If you work on really loving and appreciating yourself, you'll realize just how much value you really have (hint: it's a lot!).  You mentioned you are unhappy with the work you are qualified for, so maybe part of getting to know *you* would be figuring out what your dream job is and how you can make it happen.

Another suggestion would be checking with your local library for volunteer positions. Shelve books, man the info desk, or do story-time.

These are just two low-stress options that can fit into a busy schedule and still make you feel like a productive member of society. Feel free to find a cause you're passionate about and throw as much or as little of yourself as needed into it.

20140527131707,PretendNotToNotice,"> the body I think I should want

If not having the body makes you feel all those bad things, then it isn't just something you think you should want, it's something you'd actually like to have, and it's okay to say that.  Consistency doesn't require you to seriously pursue everything you want.  You only have one life to live, and there are more desirable things in the world than there is time to pursue them.  It's human nature to want contradictory things, and it's normal to feel regret for the path not taken, even if you're glad you took the path you did.  So it's fine to say you want that skinny body; it doesn't mean you have to go after it.

However, it sounds like you're suffering from more than a nostalgic regret like, ""Oh, what would life be like if I had moved to New York and become a writer instead of going to medical school,"" or, ""Oh, I wonder what it would have been like if I had married that carpenter who was madly in love with me during that semester in Florence.""  Feeling like a failure makes it sound like you doubt that you're making the right choice.  

You shouldn't try to externalize that doubt.  I know there's always pressure to internalize socially acceptable feelings and externalize ""bad"" feelings, which in the context of this subreddit means saying, ""**Inside, my true feelings are** that I prefer to enjoy my lifestyle and accept my chubby body, but **out there, there are forces that make me feel** like I should live healthier and be skinnier.""  For you, personally, both feelings are inside you and are equally valid and consequential for your life.  Just like you have to be realistic about your body, your genetics, your desire to exercise every day, etc., you also have to be realistic about what you want.  

I think what you're hoping to do is exorcise your doubts.  You want to prove to yourself that your lifestyle is a choice, not a failure, and that it's the best choice for you.  Luckily, there's a way to do that.  You can give the healthy lifestyle a go and see if it makes you happy or not.  Don't think of it as being ""better,"" just think of it as auditioning a new lifestyle.  You want to choose how to live, so you're inviting this lifestyle to come and audition so you can decide whether it is a better fit for the part of ""motherofpearl89's lifestyle"" than your current one.  Change your diet, lose some weight, and then ask yourself:  ""Is this better than what I had before?""

There are problems with this approach:  the long time commitment, dealing with the inevitable failures and setbacks, feeling self-conscious about not sticking to a single story about who you are and what you want, etc.  Imagine where you'd like to be in five years, though.  Imagine that five years from now you're living exactly the same lifestyle you are now, and it's the right one for you.  Would you rather *know* that it's right for you, and that it was a choice, or would you rather still be fighting the uncertainty that maybe it's the wrong choice, or even worse, not a choice at all?  I say go for it, have an adventure, and put your doubts to rest.

Then it sounds like you're living a very healthy lifestyle, and there's no reason to change anything about your diet unless you want to.

>I'm always going to be a bit chubby, have armpit fat and a lack of a thigh gap

That's because everyone has a different body shape. I have a ""thigh gap"" because I have a very hourglass figure, and have hips that are very wide-set. I would probably still have a gap between my thighs if I was overweight. Conversely, someone with a smaller pelvis/less wide-set hips might not have a gap between her thighs even if she was extremely skinny. ""Thigh gap"" is most definitely not any kind of measure of health or attractiveness.

I've seen so many female friends really wreck their lives by getting extremely hung up on trying to have a certain body size or shape that is not natural for them. By ""wreck"" I mean things ranging from ""getting so incredibly obsessed with dieting and the gym that they had time for nothing else, including friends, their SO, or devoting proper attention to work or school"" to ""developing an eating disorder"".

I think it is a bit silly to think you cannot lead a healthy lifestyle while still enjoying life. I workout daily, eat healthy, and have a toned body but still enjoy wine, beer, cake, and burgers. I also work at a coffee shop so sugary drinks are a huge part of what I drink, on weekends especially. I have never detoxed, and fruit smoothies are amazing.

When I ate fast food multiple times a week and drank tons of sodas, I always felt so heavy and bloated and not energetic in the least. You don't have to eat totally clean but not trying to eat a balanced diet everyday is not good. I am not a super fittie, I don't eat ""clean"", I just eat right and do whats right for my body. If you do not want to be healthy, that is fine. But to say you can't be healthy and enjoy yourself at the same time is ridiculous. 

Another thing, you don't have to let the healthy lifestyle consume you. Sure you can get caught up in it from time-to-time, but if you treat yourself every so often you stay on track more. Hence me drinking wine and eating cake. I often get judged or made fun of by co-workers for bringing in baked chicken or quinoa or spinach, but I often laugh at them because they are overweight and making fun of *me* for being healthy. 


But anyways, for the third time, my point is that if you want that body, you will get that body. You will work for it and eat right and you will still know how to enjoy yourselves. The biggest problem with fitness today is that people have your attitude. They don't know how to balance out the lifestyle. 


EDIT: Oh and one more thing! I used to eat totally crappy and weight 20 lbs more than I do now. I used to skip lunch and feel bad about my body in middle school and sometimes in high school. I'd count calories like crazy. But I realized it wasn't the right way to do things. I grew up, I got educated, and now I am on my way to becoming a personal trainer and nurse. Like I said, you will do it if it's something you truly want. Just don't be one of those girls who makes fun of others for doing it. ",1,t3_26lu5q
20140527175200,motherofpearl89,"I really hope like it didn't come across like I was making fun of girls that do it because that's the last thing I'd ever want to do. Thank you for your response, its lovely to hear from someone who seems to have got the balance right. You sound really happy and that's awesome :)",1,t3_26lu5q
20140527104524,malfyz,"The *actual* problem is that your behavioral patterns are incongruent with your internal desires.  The ancillary problem are your self limiting beliefs.  
>but I know I'm never going to look like those girls.  
  
How do you *know* this? Why can't you look like them? Of course if you've already decided it is so, if you have already made up your mind, then surely you can't look like them.  
  
I'm a hypnotist.  I'm going to give you a simple exercise.  Imagine being exactly the way you are now, for the next 6 months.  Imagine all the things you would and would not do in those 6 months with the body you have now.  Imagine opportunities you would miss or would not participate in because of your body.  Imagine every way you think it would affect you.  
  
Then imagine having the 'ideal body' for the next 6 months.  Notice everything that's different.  Imagine the confidence and what it does for you.  Not for just 1 day but for the next 6 months.  All the things you would do differently if you had *that* body. Imagine your past, what would be different with *that* body?  Then ask yourself, which of those makes you feel better?  Which makes you feel happy?  
  
Next imagine an ideal outcome.  Doesn't matter how big or small, just an ideal outcome, that you would love to be true.  It could be winning the lottery to, learning how to get along with people better.  Then, I've got a question for you. As you imagine your ideal outcome, do you see yourself receiving the outcome as if looking at a picture?   Or does it seem like you're actually in it and doing it?  If you 'see the image of yourself,' you're not gonna get shit, because you're holding the outcome outside of yourself.  If you're ""over here"" looking at the image which is ""over there"" and the benefit is in the image, you're not gonna get it.  You have to feel like you're actually experiencing it, to let your subconscious know, you actually want it to happen.  Otherwise it's just fantasy, a sort of mental masturbation.  Things you actually intend to be *real* need to be communicated in such a way that you subconscious will understand.  
  
Imagine the person you want to be.  Imagine every little detail.  How your body looks, the posture you hold it in, the way you speak and smile, and carry yourself.  Imagine what things you have and where you live, everything that sums up the most favorable version of yourself.  Imagine that today is the day you become that person.  You've done it, you've arrived, you achieved everything you've ever wanted to, and you're there now. **Step into the picture..**  Once you know you're there, you know you are that person, look back behind you in your imagined past, and see all the steps you had to take to get to that moment. Look at exactly what you have to do, to get what you want.  Additionally, once you're *""that person""* an interesting question can be asked.  Now that you've ""arrived"" and you've achieved all you thought you wanted, you've acquired your highest ambition, now ask yourself whats next?  *Now* what's my highest ambition?  
  
It's a funny thing, ask someone what their highest ambition is and they'll give some answer.  Now, assume they've achieved said ambition and ask again, what is your highest ambition, and see that again they can answer and go beyond the limits the previously imposed on themselves.  
  
oops I'm getting off track a bit... ok so the main thing is to change your neurotic patterns into ones that work for you instead of against you. (thinking i'll never look like those girls, definitely works against you.)  Emotions and thought are energy, you actually have to burn calories to think.  Emotions are *energy in motion*, they are the symbols your subconscious mind uses to communicate.  Every thought you have, every emotion you feel is a clear message to your subconscious of what you want more of.  Think about you memories.  Why are some so much more clear and prominent than others?  Why are some days from the past all but forgotten, while others can be recalled in great detail?  What is the difference?  It's the amount of emotion invested in them.  Not just at the time of actual experience, but also in every time you've brought it back up through memory and felt the feelings associated with it.  Every time you remember it, you're sending a clear message to your subconscious that, that's what you want more of.  After all your committing all this thought energy, and emotion to the experience, it must be highly desired.  That is how the subconscious thinks.  Whether the experience is positive or negative is irrelevant, the more emotion you give it, the harder you subconscious tries to make it real for you.   
  
Worry is negative anticipation.  It's imagining a negative outcome and attaching negative emotion to that outcome.  Typically something someone worries about does not seem far-fetched like winning the lottery, but seems likely *as if it's really going to happen.*  This is the same kind of imagining that leads you to highly desirable outcomes as well.  You can use the same structure and just change the content.  ",-4,t3_26lu5q

Surely the new g/f is showering, charging her phone, etc., so she's also incurring additional utilities costs. 

Speaking up now is not being a bitch, it's realizing your rubicon has been crossed and that you pay for a safe, comfortable domicile. 

If you can, ask to meet just with your roommate. Beforehand, decide whether this new chick may stay, and under what terms. Treat your current roommate to a coffee, and calmly explain that you're concerned about the sudden new tenant on the property. Review any agreement you made when you signed the lease with her, and point out how this violates that agreement even if just in spirit. Keep yourself as calm and neutral as you can, and be prepared to negotiate (which means you already know what's not negotiable). 

If your housemate is unwilling to budge, investigate whether you can relocate or whether your landlord has feels about the third tenant not paying her fair share. You may have to cede the apartment or get her kicked out for violating lease terms, if you feel like taking it that far.

Also, before you talk to your housemate, take some time to clarify what you want, what is acceptable, and what your deal-breaker is. That way you cannot be taken for a ride on your emotions; you already know what calm-you wants, and you can navigate from there.

Someone who isn't on the lease or paying bills there isn't as likely to respect your home. They don't deal with the consequences if they forget to lock the front door and your things get stolen. 

Also, what happens if they have a nasty breakup? I wouldn't want someone who's pissed at my roommate having a key to my home. 

Aside from that... just nope. I might be okay with an extended guest *if* they were significantly contributing or it was reciprocal (ex: if I frequently eat over at your place, you're welcome to raid my fridge). But things like toilet paper, dish soap, electricity, etc. add up. It might not financially be a big deal right now, but this is a really easy way to form resentments eventually. Six months down the line, things are tense with your roommate for some completely unrelated reason, and then you remember that her girlfriend has been there, using all your stuff... it just adds unnecessary fuel to the fire.

I guess the next question you have to ask yourself is if she wants to pay part of the water utilities and rent, are you willing to let her stay? I would decide that before you start the conversation. I think asking about her situation helps as well. It's possible she is having a rough time wherever she lives, or might not have a place to live.

> 

i have lived in a few shared flats in my life. 

the best way to split costs is as following:

rent (and rent only) is shared so that everyone pays a share that is equal to the ratio of private space. communal space is split so that anyone pays an equal share.

all utility costs are equally split. there is absolutely no fair way to calculate heating, water, electricity and internet usage.

given the fact that you really don't mind the gf in the flat you should propose changes to the rental agreement. 

it's okay that you pay a bit more of the rent (rent !) because you have more private space, it's very much not okay that you pay utility for someone else.

We got a three bedroom, and we agreed that I'd get my own bedroom and the second bathroom would be mine, while he and his son would take the master bedroom, and his daughter (the 8 year old) would have her own room.

Things were fine at first. He had women come over every so often, but they never stayed the night. I had privacy, etc. About 4 months ago, he's started seeing this woman (who I personally think is very clingy and needy) and she not only has her own key, but pretty much lives at our apartment. She sleeps over at *least* 4 nights a week, and they lounge at the couch, cook in the kitchen, etc.. just like they're living together with the kids and I'm an afterthought. Many times I've heard her go into our apartment after picking up his kids and start cooking dinner, using our water, the fridge for the food she's bought, even moving in her slow cooker in the kitchen.

Yes, she showers there, uses electricity and watches cable, brings her laptop and uses our Internet access, and always leaves a pair of shoes behind (so, yes, for all intents and purposes, she damn near lives here). 

I find this ridiculous of course, more so because he's taken back the spare key from his best friend of 17 years (and someone I'm sort of seeing) because he came over to use our internet for a few hours when his was down, and ate MY sandwich. Of course I don't care if he eats my food, but to take away his key because of it? Yet his girlfriend can use all of our resources free. I was livid at this.

I don't feel like I can really talk to him about it. I'm technically just renting a room out (he pays 65% of the rent since it's him and his two kids, but we split the utilities 50/50). The lease will be up at the end of September, and this has been going on for so long I feel it's a moot point in bringing it up now. Kind of wish I spoke up sooner but it is what it is.

Even though all three of us were on the lease. He got away with paying only 500/mo..his girlfriend didn't even work. Throughout the whole lease they both were horrible and dirty and lazy, never cleaned, did their dishes, or the catbox.

You do realize that the advocates of that theory *aren't* a part of that world, right? Men, as a group, do not receive any benefit when you have sex with ""a man"", singular. You're viewing men as a homogeneous entity, and we're not. We are all individuals, just like you.

Now, do you want a REAL window into some psychology? Think about this: what is the ideal male life? Yep, exactly what they disparage in women. Have lots of fun, random, party-time sex with hot chicks, and then find a nice girl to settle down with. Y'know, someone who is interesting, yet just boring enough to never cheat on you, and then raise some kids, have a family, and reminisce to yourself about a youth well enjoyed, and an adulthood well earned.

In other words, by doing these things that they struggle to do, the carousel-riders have *out-manned them*. These women have become better ""men"" than they were ever able to, and it chafes on their self-esteem and their pride. It's a brittle and terrifying insecurity; to be so thoroughly poor at the male role (or the perceived male role) that someone who isn't even male can best them at it.

Additionally, you cannot pre-empt feelings by asserting a friendship boundary. Feelings are feelings and aren't beholden to an explanation or boundaries. It's not that the guy just ""didn't realise"" you were only friends, and its not that you ""invited"" those feelings. It's just that you're a female, and he's a male, and often that leads to attraction rather than platonic friendship. It's as simple as that and there's no real way of declaring yourself ""off-limits"" as far as attraction goes.

All you can do is be friends with guys, and if one becomes attracted to you and wants you for a girlfriend, and you shut him down, you have to respect his right to not want to be friends with someone he wants more from just as much as he should respect your right to reject his advances.",7,t3_26lztc

Of course it doesn't kill any feelings - but it does give the opportunity to readjust expectations and decide if the relationship is worth continuing. Some people are able to acknowledge their feelings, acknowledge that those feelings are not requited, and decide that the friendship is more important than a crush. While the attraction will remain, the person may change his or her behavior to respect the other person's boundaries and the feelings may very well fade over time as the interested party finds a partner. Others are not able to do that, and for those people, a discussion about lack of interest and boundaries is important so that they can decide to stop investing in the friendship. 

I'm happily married and am friends with men I'm quite attracted to, both mentally and physically, and my husband knows this. It's not about killing feelings but instead making the clear decision not to act on them in any way and not to let them affect the friendship negatively.",1,t3_26lztc

Right..but that's exactly what already happens. If you read the OP she says

It just so happens that every male friend that met the girl she's talking about decided they were of the second category, being unable to continue a friendship.

OP is talking about pre-emptive strikes designed to disarm feelings from the beginning. Your ""solution"" is exactly the problem that the OP is trying to solve; namely the large number of men that fall into this category:

What I *do* suggest is to have these conversations about interest and boundaries sooner rather than later. Making friends is a bit like dating, and if things are going to end over this issue, you may as well do it sooner rather than later so that neither person is as torn up about it and so that you can move on to making new friends.

Two girls or women that are friends will be very expressive, they'll hug, they'll style each other's hair, they'll even sit on each other's lap.
Now two guys that are friends will just drink beer and shout while watching a ball game. They won't be expressive, they won't be touchy, they certainly won't be sentimental (or will be so very rarely).

So a woman that wants to be friends with a guy and ""assert the boundaries"" should understand that there is a cultural gap between how friendship is understood by the two sexes. It doesn't necessarily mean that the only friendship she could have with a guy is one where they attend games or talk about guy stuff in a guy way.

>  How do you go about asserting the boundaries of friendship without inviting anything further?

Honestly? The best way to do so is explicitly - instead of relying on body language, joking around, or any other such beating around the bush, be clear in telling a friend that you're not interested in anything romantic. You can use body language to back that up - for example, hugging may be fine but choosing not to engage in back rubs, cuddling on the couch while watching a movie, etc - but in my experience it's very important to discuss the issue outright even if it's not the most comfortable conversation. Having this conversation earlier in the friendship rather than later is most likely to keep a friendship together since it heads off any expectations of things becoming romantic.",6,t3_26lztc

The difference is that both touch and flirting isn't intended to titillate.  
Flirting is just my way of saying ""hey you look good"", and physical touch is just my way of saying ""I like you"". I don't do it to get off, and would feel uneasy if my guy friends popped a boner or if my female friends got wet from our interactions.  
I keep things light-hearted and fun. I have had to be up front with friends before (I'm a very blunt person) and will say things like ""Hey, just need you to know I'm in a stable monogamous relationship so there better not be any funny business!""... And if lines are crossed, we discuss it, as friends, and talk about what we perceive as inappropriate or what makes us uncomfortable.  
All relationships require maintenance and good communication.  I don't find relationships with my male friends are much different than those with my female friends. Everyone is different and everyone has a different threshold of acceptability and appropriateness. Mine are very loose and are based on what I know my partner would find inappropriate.

Woman: ""I can't, you know I'm already dating whatshisface.""

Instead, try this:

Man:  ""Hey, I know we've been friends for years, would you like to go on a date?  Like, a date date?""

Woman: ""I'm sorry, but I don't feel that way about you.  I value your friendship, but I'm not interested in anything sexual between us.""

I have an appointment on Saturday for a consult to get my rx renewed and when I made the appointment, they didn't say anything about needing a pap/exam in order to get the rx. HOPEFULLY that'll be the case and I can get the rx filled, and they will probably remind me that I need the exam, otherwise, my appointment on Saturday will be a waste of time, BUT if it's going to get in the way of me getting the rx, then they should have told me. I don't mind making an appointment for an exam/pap in the next few weeks when I have more time to go in, and I'd honestly call and ask if I could add the exam/pap to this upcoming appointment, BUT I'm on my period right now so...but I NEED to go in ASAP because I'm all out of refills and have no new pack to start when I'm done with this cycle, hopefully they will understand this. I don't have a risk of cancer in my family, I have had only one partner since I have been sexually active and am otherwise healthy and the last pap I had did come out normal so hopefully given those facts in mind, they will allow me to get my rx without the pap as long as I go in for one soon. 

About the HPV vaccine, I had asked about it a few years ago and they basically made it sound like it wasn't necessary but I still kind of want to get it. When I go in for my appointment, I'll ask about it-they say it's for women 26 and under so I should still be eligible to get it. If I end up staying with my current partner then I don't see a need for it, (we've been together 7 years and he has been the only person I have been sexually active with) but I'm afraid if I ever do wind up not with him and with someone else, then I have to worry about all the people he's slept with, etc. so I think I would feel better getting the HPV vaccine.

20140527152314,CanadianMiss,"I work at a store that specializes in bridal registries. Go in and talk to someone at the place she is registered. Most registries list a price point and go for an item in your price range. Depending on your financial situation and how long you've known her, I would suggest something between 20$ - $50. If you don't want to go for something on the registry, there are things that everyone needs that are great gifts. A neutral color set of towels is nice (bath towel, hand towel, and face cloth) and keeps you in that price range. A neutral sheet set works as well, but will probably be more expensive. If you're still not sure, get her a gift card for the place she is registered. Many stores have ""completion events"" where a bride can come in and get the remaining items on her registry for a discounted price (usually 10-30%), and a giftcard would work great for that in case she doesn't get some important items that she wanted. Some places even wrap the gift for you for free!

Think about the couple. Do you know if they already live together, have they just gotten a new place, etc? That can help in choosing a gift. If they've lived together for a long time and haven't moved, chances are they already have all the basics and would just need things replaced (new silverware set, new towels, new coffee machine, etc). If they just moved to a new place, they might need more than the basics.

20140527190432,TheHermioneStranger,"False accusations, it's basically this [one](http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/16/12/1318.abstract). Many people cite the FBI report, but it's really not methodologically sound, and basically just lucked into the right number. 

Reporting, going to trial, and convictions: [Full Report of the Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/183781.pdf)

RAINN is decent, though they tend to use somewhat older stats, and also rely almost exclusively on stats done by the justice department and FBI (but not usually the CDC), so the angle they're coming from is very much ""how do we work well with the DoJ"" not ""how do we understand sexual violence as a public health issue"" or ""how do we understand rape from a radical framework?""

It's important to note that rape statistics vary quite a bit, based on definitions, specific phrasing of questions, and methodology, and numbers can be rather contested. Right now, a lot of numbers are starting to be reconsidered regarding sexual coercion and also gender. Evidenced-based arguments are wonderful, but it's also a good idea to not lock yourself into a viewpoint or argument that only stands if researchers are reporting very specific numbers, especially if you're largely using something like RAINN as your resource.",1,t3_26mboy
20140527142938,bananapajama,"I think if you're trying to build an argument, having statistics from multiple sources/source types that roughly corroborate each other makes the strongest point. I think RAINN is generally well respected, although it has been criticized in the past both by feminists and mens rights advocates. You could also look at the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=317) or the CDC [[pdf warning](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf) with links to academic articles]. Scholar.google.com is also a good resource if you have access to academic journals through your school/library. Start with one article, check its sources if you need more info, and continue.

For any statistics, it's crucial to evaluate the methodology used to collect the data. It would be nice if people only ever cited statistics that they understand... I think thats an unrealistic wish, though. 

Whenever possible, read about the methodology - who were they surveying? How many people did they survey? Does this sample accurately reflect the population you are trying to apply the statistic to? For instance, surveying female college students may yield results not applicable to men and women with no post-secondary education. How do they define ""rape"" and ""consent?"" For instance, people may be more likely to say ""My vagina has been penetrated by a penis without my consent"" than ""I have been raped."" How was the data collected? If it is based on police reports, you neglect any crime not reported. 

Another important thing to remember is what the motivation of the authors is. If you read something from a mensrights blog, they might emphasize/overstate the amount of female on male rape or false rape accusations. If you read something from a feminist blog, they might emphasize/overstate the number of female victims and low jail time served by male rapists. That doesn't mean that their statistics are necessarily wrong, they just could be stated ingenuously or may have been misinterpreted. For these scenarios it is particularly important to assess the methodology. For this reason, I think government sites and academic journals and well respected non-profits are your best sources (to check the validity of the latter, try googling ""name of nonprofit + bias or controversy"")",1,t3_26mboy

Also, do NOT skip a day or two-- that is TERRIBLE advice and it can lead to very bad things and probably won't actually help at all. 

Maybe see about different SSRI's if you feel comfortable with it-- especially if this is your first time taking them, I understand there's a tendency to kind of cling to the first pill that seems to work-- and that's fine to an extent-- again, don't do anything you're not comfortable with-- *but* from personal experience I can tell you that just trying a different pill could easily help (assuming the sertraline is the problem here).

Last, it sounds to me like this is one of those relatively common moments in under-30 relationships where, for whatever reason, one person is dealing with heavy shit that the other simply hasn't experienced yet and therefore cannot relate to.

I can't say for sure that this will work-- it might be that the only way your boy will learn/grow here is the hard way (i.e. you dumping him)-- but before it comes to that, my suggestion is to lay out *everything* for him. 

Tell him flat out that you don't know for how long your sex drive will be like this-- maybe a few months, maybe a year, maybe longer-- you can't possibly know and that's not your fault. Tell him that right now his behavior is making you feel guilty and ashamed when you have to tell him 'no'. 

And then, well, I don't know if there's a way to tell him this exactly, but for you, I want to say: one of the difficult things about long-term relationships is that, inevitably, everyone changes. And, despite what the after-school specials taught us, asking people to change a little to make things work is OK... I would say you're asking him to change in this situation-- and that's fine, even *good*-- and maybe he'll do it, maybe he won't... But either way it might help you come to terms with it if you try to imagine yourself in his shoes. Think of the girl you were when you first met him-- would that girl have wanted to date a guy who only wants it 2-3 times a week?

Its true-- 2-3 times a week is perfectly healthy-- but I'm just saying, as frustrating as this is, try to stay cool and patient and give him the time he probably needs to grow/change/get over it.
