I won't say I'm confused as to why someone (or many) is down voting every single one of my replies, but I think it's pretty ridiculous. I thought this sub was for sharing views on subjects like this. I wasn't proving a point, or forcing my opinion down anyones throat, or even being rude or preachy, I was simply sharing my experience with the subject lately. But, whatever, continue on with the downvotes.**

Hi everyone, 

I've seen a lot of posts recently about women sharing their positive experiences with Abortions, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the other side of things. 

For as long as I can remember, in regards to Abortions, I have always been very Pro-Choice. I always believed it was a woman's right to do what she chose with her body, including terminating an unwanted pregnancy for any reason. 

However, slowly over the past few years, my views have been changing, and they honestly took me by surprise. It started with a conversation I had with an acquaintance and the subject of a mutual friend of ours wanting to get an abortion. Our mutual friend was struggling heavily with the decision (she ultimately did end up having an abortion), and the acquaintance said ""Don't feel bad, I've have four!"". 

Before I knew it I blurted out ""You've have FOUR ABORTIONS?"" and she laughed, and said ""Well yeah, it's not like there's a limit"". 

All I could think then was, *well, there should be*.

Now fast forward a few years, and I am in my second trimester of my pregnancy, and am over joyed, as due to health problems I never thought it would happen for me. 

So needless to say now that I am pregnant, I seem to view abortion even more different than I did a few years ago. What really changed things for me, the turning point I could say, was during my first ultrasound at 12 weeks. 

I saw this little being, kicking it's little legs around, putting it's hand in front of it's face when the ultrasound technician would tap my belly to try to get it to move position, as if it was annoyed and just wanted to keep sleeping. I couldn't believe it. I have no idea, that at 12 weeks, I would see this little thing that is growing inside of me kicking and twirling around my uterus. 

Now a days, I can't help being against late term abortions, and abortions caused by apathy and ignorance (such as the acquaintance I mentioned above, who would proudly declare she would have unprotected sex knowingly with 4 different men in one weekend, over and over again, to end up making an abortion a regular thing for her). I have a friend who had a very premature baby at 24 weeks, and is now happy and healthy, and can't imagine...*terminating* that baby, that viable little being. 

I feel like I am still Pro-Choice, but apparently only within restrictions I form in my head, such as rape, age, etc., and feel like a hypocrite of my former self. I'm sure those of you reading will also think I am a hypocrite, but I just wanted to share my thoughts on the other side of the fence. 

I despise those who picket local abortion clinics with signs telling these women they're going to hell, that they are murderers, and would never in a million years protest an opening of these clinics or stand in the way of a woman wanting one. But with that being said, when I know a baby can survive at 24 weeks, and some abortions are still legal until what, 26 weeks, I refuse to believe that someone can say it's not a real baby yet. Regardless if it's legal or not, having an abortion at a late stage, is killing the baby. I don't mean that in a judgmental way, or a YOU'RE A MURDERER way, I simply am stating that the procedure is killing a baby. I mean, is that wrong, isn't that technically exactly what it is? 

Am I still Pro-Choice? Am I a hypocrite? Maybe it's all my baby brain. I don't know. 

Has anyone else had their views shift on the subject, to either side?

Thanks for reading everyone, but please remember especially with this subject matter, it isn't black or white, and I am just sharing my thoughts on how I've been feeling lately.

So a few years ago I was in an abusive relationship emotionally and physically-mostly sexually. He was my first and we were together for a while. I've been dating my current boyfriend for 3 years. We want to get married and buy a house and i'm really excited for our relationship to move forward. I'm extremely motivated and think of myself as a capable woman. About a year ago I realized I needed help with issues from my previous relationship. So, I went to therapy and things were going okay until I hit a bit of a snag. In theory I love sex.  It's a fun and amazing expression of love between two people. Unfortunately because of my experiences with my previous relationship I have like zero sex drive. This has been an issue with my partner, even though my guy has been VERY supportive. Sometimes I will give in and have sex with him when i'm not really in the mood (which is rare honestly) but when I do, I just sort of shut down. My experiences in the past have told me that my main worth as a female lies in my willingness to put out. I know its very unhealthy but my ex did a fantastic job of slowing teaching me that. Currently things seem to be going really well and then I just hit an emotionless wall of terribleness. Anyone have any advice on how to make sex feel like less of a chore? Or any other ladies who have gone through abuse have any ideas on how to cope or explain it to my partner in a way he might understand? To be honest i'm feeling a little lost right now. I know sex is supposed to be fun, but for some reason my brain and body refuse to cooperate.",12,20140520234326,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

We were on/off hook-up buddies from like 2010-2012 and I tried to rekindle things in 2013 but he wanted a girlfriend and I didn't want a serious relationship with him. On the 9th we went to a concert together, I got hammered, and he invited me to spend the night. We had sex, but I was really drunk and don't remember a lot of what happened. 

The one thing I do remember is that he asked me if I was on birth control and I said yes. **I lied. I was not on birth control and we had unprotected sex**. Drunk me wanted to have sex and thought it was a good idea to lie instead of just getting a condom. I hadn't taken birth control in about a month due to complications with the doctor's office and general laziness (I honestly didn't think I would be having sex for a long time). 

I took a pregnancy test today and there was a faint but clear 2nd line. Most of the sources I read online said that this meant a positive pregnancy. I've decided I want an abortion, but I'm uncertain if I should tell the guy about it. I fear he will either be mad at me for lying about being on birth control or that he will not want me to get the abortion. He's not religious and I'm not sure if he's pro-life or pro-choice, but the mere possibility of him wanting to keep it makes me nervous. 

Should I keep him in the dark about it all and hope that it never gets brought up? Or should I tell him? I'm going to get a blood test this week to be sure and if I did tell him, I would tell him after the results of the blood test. ",9,20140520184947,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

How does one make friends again?","I'm sorry for being venty and whiny, though I feel like a lot of people have this problem. If you don't already have a bunch of friends it's so much harder to make them.

I'm a little over halfway through college, and all of my friends are from high school. The new people I've met are their new friends, and they're all in different circles now. I don't feel like I belong in any of them, and I'm usually the one asking my friends to hang out. I always feel like I'm bothering them.

Most of my social life in college has, stupidly, revolved around guys that I was sexually involved with. That's the only way I can make friends, it seems, but those aren't really friends. 

I was recently super disappointed because I thought I had made a new friend, but then he hit on me. Not wrong of him, and it's flattering, but now I feel like I have to be careful and we can't be close friends.

I had a long term boyfriend for a couple years, then fell into a close fwb type situation shortly after. Now that both are over, I want to be single and make some close friends or at least have some fun with the time I have left in school but I don't know how.

t3_262bz8,"The one female programmer on ""Silicon Valley"".","Caveat: if you are watching the HBO show ""Silicon Valley"" but haven't seen the latest (5/18/14) episode, consider yourself warned that what follows is a spoiler (albeit a very minor one, at least as far as I can tell without knowing what will happen in future episodes).

For those who saw it: this week when the protagonists went to TechCrunch Disrupt SF, we finally encountered the first (as far as I've seen; I'm not counting anyone who may have visually been in the background) woman in any kind of coding or engineering role. Hey, cool! It's an attractive woman, yet one who doesn't seem to be at the conference in a ""booth babe"" role judging by her attire, and she's a Java programmer. I was really excited to see where they were going with that.

....Aaaaaaand then we find out that she doesn't write her own code, and just flirts with male software engineers to get them to write code and/or fix bugs for her. 

Was anyone else as annoyed by this as I was? It bothered me far more than most instances of sexism I've seen on TV, and here's why: apart from that scene, I find the show to actually be an astonishingly realistic, albeit a bit cartoonish, depiction of Silicon Valley and its startup culture. I know a guy who is exactly like the protagonist. I know a bunch of people who live in ""geek houses"" just like the ones in which the main characters reside-- and that house even looks exactly like the actual ones do, right down to the era of house and the objects contained therein. Those archetypes of the ""we're going to change the world of X via Y gimmicky app!"" startups, of illogically egotistical programmers, of comically out-of-touch rich execs or angel investors-- they're all simply exaggerated versions of very real things, which is why they're funny. Yeah, the show has had a few plot points that are implausible to the point of near-impossibility, like Jared's accidental island voyage, but those things seem to be portrayed in a way that is deliberately outlandish. If their plot point regarding the female programmer had been about a woman who codes but then she doesn't really code because she is in fact a hyper-realistic android created by one of the other startups at the conference and sent to infiltrate Pied Piper to gather recon and steal their ideas, then that would be fine, and probably even funny. But all they've done in this case is create a situation that started off rather realistically, but chosen to just turn the female character into an unrealistic sexist stereotype, instead of the cartoonish but still ultimately realistic portrayals of many of the other characters.

I find it a bit unrealistic that they've only shown one woman in an engineering role; I used to work in that very area, and I was far from the only woman. While there's still certainly an immensely disproportionate percentage of male vs female programmers, it's far from a 99.9%/0.1% split. But what I find really unrealistic and offensive is that when the finally did show a female engineer, she was a fraud.

Hi Ladies! 

Okay so this morning I was freaking out because I couldn't find my Mirena strings. I got the Mirena two weeks ago at Planned Parenthood and everything was going great until I couldn''t find my strings. I freaked out and walked in today to get it checked. The gyno checked and could not see it either. Then she slightly opened the opening to the cervix and saw that the strings were resting right at the opening. She said the IUD was in the right position and everything was fine. 

However, I am concerned because now I won't be able to check my strings every month because they are too short. So how will I know that the IUD is in the right position? I mean the whole point of getting the IUD is to have greater peace of mind. She told me that I should not worry and just live life normally. But if I really was concerned the only option would be to have it removed and insert a new one with longer strings (which would run me another $625).

What would you ladies do if you were in my position? Would you get it removed, reinserted, and pay up for the extra peace of mind? Or would you live with it and trust that its all okay? 

Thank you so much!

We talked about it, he agreed that it would have been a terrible idea to become romantically involved, and now we laugh about it. 
He has a steady, serious relationship now. They moved to Australia for a year, about 2 and a half years ago. Before they left, he and I were still really close. He would come over all the time, with or without her and just hang with me. Hanging out at my place watching tv, having a drink (or more) became a habit when I was a stay-at-home single mom. (I'm Canadian - 12 month mat leave, and have really supportive parents.) But since they got back, I feel like a lot of distance has grown in place of our close friendship.

His gf has anxiety and depression issues, and often leaves group events because of overwhelming social anxiety. The last time he had to cancel it was because she was ""freaking out"" and wouldn't let him ""have fun without her"", his words.
I was complaining about this with my mom, and instead of the support I was looking for, she told me I was wrong for pursuing a friendship with him. According to her, when in a relationship, friendships with the opposite sex are unacceptable.
I shut that conversation down, because there was no way we will ever see eye to eye.

I've just recently found out that I'm roughly 7 weeks pregnant. I already have a son who is 15 months old. I can't stop going through the range from excitement to I-fucked-up. I already had to deal with everyone's judgment of me and how irresponsible I am to have had one child, and I know it will be even worse with two. 

Through my first pregnancy and the first couple months after, my long-term boyfriend developed a serious opiate addiction. We separated, he got on Subutex, got a job, and he recently became a part of my son's and my life again. I hope things will work out for him, but the thought of having another baby to raise on my own is not something I want.

I work part-time and started taking classes again. It's a struggle every day trying to find a babysitter for my son. I've looked into daycare, but everywhere I can afford is full. I've tried using family and friends, but everyone gets so stressed by him that they don't answer my calls or make excuses now. Because I live with my parents now, I don't qualify for state-assistance for childcare. My parents have already talked to me about when I am moving out/having my son here is stressful. I would not feel comfortable to stay here with another baby. I also know I would lose their support if I got an abortion.

I went to my first appointment before I realized just how mixed my feelings were. I know 100% that I am in no place to have another baby. I know I could manage, if I wanted to. I guess I just don't know if I am ready for it.

t3_263ey2,"My closest friend and I have been through a lot, I feel anxious about seeing her this weekend.","This is going to be a very long post:

I have had the same best friend since I was 13. When I moved across the country 6 years ago our friendship suffered some blows.

The worst of which was in January of 2013 when she told me that she no longer wanted to be my friend but ""hoped we could find our way back to each other some day.""

It seemed to me that it occurred rather abruptly and out of the blue.

It was right after she came and visited me to enjoy some sun and surf. The whole week we spent together things just felt super tense. She seemed on edge and easily angered. After a whole week of her snapping at me and generally coming off as kinda pissed at me she went home. 

I did what I could the whole week to try and keep trying to get us back in the usual groove of our friendship. We went out and I picked up the tab, got manicures, tried to just enjoy some girl time together.

When she got home she was very upset when her on again/off again casual hook up blew her off at the last minute for some standing plans they had. She called me really upset and said that she didn't know how she could ""change herself to make him like her more"" and I told her she absolutely shouldn't change at all and a guy should just like her for who she is and if he didn't then they simply weren't compatible. Because she is awesome and deserves the best.

Normally, she always appreciated my honest advice. And I appreciated hers.

She blew up at me (like nothing I have ever experienced before) and I told her I really didn't want to talk to her while we were both upset, she sent me a couple angry texts and I told her I thought we should just talk the next day.

I thought she might just need a clear head to sort out her feelings about the guy in question just being a no good jerkward. But the next day I get an e-mail friend dumping me saying I had been a killjoy since my last breakup and she no longer wanted me in her life. In summary, that our friendship had run it's course and she was no longer interested in maintaining it.

 I was really devastated. We had small fights in the past but nothing on this level. I told her I didn't want that but I respected her decision. 

I feel like I really was at a place where I no longer talked about my past relationship and had started a new chapter of my life so to be called a killjoy for it really sucked. Also I felt I really made the week she visited an awesome vacation for her and she really couldn't specify why exactly she was so done with me other then we had grown apart and had separate interests.

I felt because she had been working alongside the department of corrections and spending so much time in the jails she was just being really negatively affected by her profession and that maybe her negative feelings would pass. But I respected her decision to cut me out.

I only contacted her twice after that once to get some stuff returned since it was pretty apparent she was done with me. I deleted her off facebook and tried to move on with my life as best I could even though it really sucked losing someone so close to me. 

Back in March I had to ask her for a contact number of a mutual friend trying to keep it positive I just said I hoped she was well and I still thought about her often and hoped she knew I didn't have any negative feelings towards her and just wanted to remembered all our awesome years of friendship fondly.

She said she had actually regularly snooped my facebook had seen I had gotten engaged, she congratulated me and said how much she missed me and wanted to be friends and catch up. So we have been kind of tentatively talking ever since and updating each other on our lives. 

I did ask if she had interest in being in my wedding party. It was hard to imagine my big day and planning it without her. But this weekend will be my first time actually seeing her since we mended our friendship.

I feel really anxious about seeing her and potentially having her be negative and easily angered around me again. But I also don't know how to raise the issue with her. She really wanted my fiancee and I to stay at her place which is a studio apartment and I really didn't want to be in such close quarters after everything. I want to carve out some girl time with her this weekend and try and ensure our friendship is back on the right track. 

But I also feel like I want to talk to her about how bad she hurt me. She had never apologized for terminating our friendship and I felt really used that she did it after I basically put her up on vacation.

How should I approach this or am I forced to just put the past in the past if I expect our friendship to have a future?

I genuinely feel like we have made some good progress in the past two months and I feel like she is genuinely happy for me in all the great ways my life has changed in the 14 months we weren't speaking to each other (I finished school and met an amazing man who asked me to be his wife). She seems to be in a good place as well. However, literally a week ago she dumped the same on again/off again guy because after going through another round of casual sex but no commitment she realized he was never going to change. I don't really voice strong opinions on the guy since she obviously really liked him, I just told her I thought she should be proud of herself for putting her needs first and ending it even though it was a difficult choice.

I have had a total of 3 partners, one of which is my current SO who I have been sleeping with for over a year. We have sex pretty consistently (3-4 times a week, permitting). I have also been on Beyaz for going on two years now, and am up to date on my lady visits and have a clean bill of health down there. (Aside from a couple of yeast infections this year, thanks in part to antibiotics I had to take for illness). I am able to insert and remove tampons without issue. 

Anyway, EVERY time, without fail, initial insertion is extremely painful. It doesn't matter if there has been sufficient foreplay or not, it hurts and it takes a minute or two for it to be comfortable (I assumed when I first started having sex, it was because I was new to it, and that was why). My current SO and I have tried different positions for insertion, all have been painful. However, the pain goes away after those couple minutes. I spoke to my lady doctor about it, and she said it could be that maybe he is too large for me, I need to be comfortable, etc.

I am incredibly comfortable with my SO, he is the love of my life, and I never feel weird around him. I have done some Googling (I know, maybe not the best way to figure it out) and have seen a few sites that claim it could be a condition where my vaginal muscles just tend to tighten up like that, vaginismus, and it's involuntary. Whether or not this applies to me, I don't know. I've also noticed sometimes after sex, I cannot have sex for at least a day after that. My vagina gets inflamed, and any insertion during this time is EXTREMELY painful.

Now, usually, we just suck it up when it comes to this topic, even though the code is often applied inconsistently or unfairly. However, today, a couple of girls in my grade put up posters in the halls in protest. The posters said to stop sexualizing 13 year old's legs and shoulders, and that it shouldn't be up to us to cover ourselves up to stop boys from sexualizing us, that should be something they educate themselves about. A petition was also passed around promoting a bit more leniency in the code, and gained a lot of support. The teachers ripped all the posters off the walls and threw away the petition. Not to mention, the girls got in huge trouble. Let me stress that none of this was done in bad taste, all of the posters and the petition were polite and professional. The female student body is angry, but we don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",0,20140520175940,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_263n1c,"[Advice] As a Girl, Women are Scary","Sorry for the wall of text, ladies! I'm putting a tl;dr at the top, because I'm not entirely sure if this is suitable.

tl;dr: Cut a friend out of my life, realised she was abusing our friendship for years, now paranoid that all the other females in my life are like that too and I just haven't realised yet. Want to be friends with other women, don't know how, would adore some advice.

So I'm kinda young (22) and very sheltered. I was never much good at making friends with girls as a kid, but I met a whole bunch of incredibly friendly ladies at 15 and we hit it off. Four years later, I was in charge of an activity that the volunteer organisation we were all part of was running, with the closest of my friends my immediate subordinate. She works in childcare and is the oldest (and favorite) child, so doesn't take not being in charge well. She threw a tantrum in the first fifteen minutes of the first day, I handled it poorly due to it being unexpected and things fell apart from there. At the end of the event, I decided to give both of us a week's space to cool off and didn't attempt to either seek or offer an apology in that time.

Ordinarily, we'd text every day. After a week, though, I realised that our relationship was less than equal and not particularly healthy. I was being used as the ""ugly friend"", treated as inferior and was considered, essentially, an ear without a mouth, to be spoken at but not listened to. She did other things, too, which I'm not going to detail here.

She approached me and asked if we could talk. I'd realised over the time we hadn't spoken that she actually meant that she was going to lecture me and manipulate me into apologising for both her behavior and mine. I agreed to go, met her, apologised clearly for my own mistakes, but refused to apologise for hers, while requesting that I receive an apology as well. Despite the fact that I didn't receive one, I told her that she was forgiven, but I didn't think I wanted to continue being close friends with her at this point in time. She started screaming at me--in public--and, eventually, left. She commanded her boyfriend, his brother and several of my other ""friends"" to stop speaking to me, and they agreed.

Four years on, her behaviours haven't changed (still manipulating and hurting people) and I don't believe they're likely to any time soon. I've made attempts at polite interactions, but they've been rebuffed. 

The real problem, however, is that I'm kind of terrified of all the rest of my female friends and acquaintances now. I know it's not reasonable, but I'm so incredibly scared that someone else is going to snap at me over something tiny, start screaming, then tear away my remaining friends. I don't want to keep feeling like this. I want to make new, awesome female friends (or connect with old ones), because there are plenty of fantastic people out there and, honestly, not having anyone who'll understand the girly chat I need sometimes is getting old. My guy friends are great, but they don't want to hear about anything that doesn't relate to our shared nerdy hobbies. How would I go about getting over my fear of other women and making friends with them? Any and all advice is appreciated.",13,20140521014318,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_263sph,"I get a UTI almost every time I have sex","It is so frustrating and painful. Almost every time I have sex, the next day or a couple days later, I get that all too familiar stinging feeling when I pee and a constant pain in my UT. I always make sure everything is totally clean beforehand, both for me and him, but there seems to be no effect. The only thing is that I don't pee after sex. Don't get me wrong, I always get up and try, but the thing is... I don't understand how other girls do it? I can't have sex with a full bladder because that would be unenjoyable and uncomfortable for me, so I pee before sex. But my bladder doesn't just magically fill up within 20-30 minutes so I can pee again right after sex? And all the instructions always say to pee before AND after but I don't think that's physically possible for me. Does anyone have any suggestions?

I've had problems with UTIs all my life and had them constantly as a pre-teen and teen even before I started a sex life. Back then I even went on a preventative medication for 6 months which eventually did stop the UTIs from coming for years, until I started having sex. But I don't want to go on this medication again because I suffered a lot of hair loss from it and I have very fine, thin hair as it is. This was over 10 years ago (I'm now 23).

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the advice! I'm going to try adding cranberry juice and cranberry tablets to my daily diet, as well as drinking lots of water right before sex so I can pee afterwards.

I'm in a stable long-term relationship with a career-focused man who still makes time for me.  I've volunteered with kids and the elderly, so I have some idea as to how to get along with people.  I've had close friendships throughout my life, and life happens and people move or go to different schools et cetera.  Recently, my female friends have started to pull away.  I actually moved closer to most of these friends, so hanging out should be easier to make happen.  I've reached out to them and they either don't respond to my text messages asking to hang out, don't call me back, or give me some excuse as to why they can't and don't follow up with when they can hang out.

So I'm a 21-year-old female (almost 22) and after years of dreaming about it, I'm finally ready to get rhinoplasty. 

Some backround... Ever since I first started to care about looks, I've hated my nose. My nose tip is very wide and droopy when I smile and it seriously bothers me. I have small eyes and small delicate mouth and although my face is square shaped and quite wide, my nose just looks wrong. No matter how pretty I feel, I can't help but wish my nose was different EVERY single time I look in a mirror. I never ""truly"" smile in photos and that's very depressing. You're supposed to feel beautiful when you smile and I never do. If I'm happy and laughing, it doesn't take long before I remember how my nose looks and then I feel ugly. 

I have told one friend about my plans and she of course said that I'm crazy and I don't need to have anything done. I don't think she's lying because I don't think any of my friends need plastic surgery. They're all so gorgeous! She said that everyone has flaws but they only make you *you*. I have other flaws that I've accepted  but I've waited my whole life to be ok with my nose and that hasn't happened. It makes me so insecure! It's like in my head I'm beautiful but then I look in a mirror or take a photo and see a face that *isn't me*. 

I know it's a huge decision but I feel more confident about it every single day. I also know that I'm still very young but I don't want to take the risk of feeling like this till I'm 40 and regret that I didn't do anything sooner. I want to enjoy my life now damnit. 

How's that for a rant? Anyway, is there anyone in the same situation or someone who has gone through rhinoplasty? Any advice?

Since y'all are a default subreddit now, I figured I'd use one of my throwaways to get your opinion on something I've been having trouble with. If anyone's up late and looking to humor an internet stranger, I'd appreciate it. Ready? Here we go:

First, let's assume I make it very clear to any sexual partner that I am not interested in a romantic relationship. Like... literally saying that to anyone I am sleeping with. Multiple times.

With that said: If a sexual partner fails to inform me of their growing feelings for me, and continues our casual-sex relationship in the hopes that I'll somehow change my mind... at what point is it my responsibility to end the relationship?

Is it the second I SUSPECT they're being untruthful about their intentions? This is obviously a difficult situation to ""catch someone lying"" in, and it would be incredibly arrogant to claim to ""know"" someone's mind better than they do. Is there some sort of sign I should be looking for, or a particular moral compass I can ascribe to in this situation?

I don't like hurting people, and this problem has occurred a number of times. And while each partner has admitted they were the ones being untruthful, a recent conversation has me seriously considering a vow of celibacy.

So. Am I a pompous, deceptive ass? Or have I just had bad luck with overly-romantic sexual partners? Or is there some magical answer here I'm not seeing? Pretty much just throwing this out to the internets at this point. Lemme know what'cha think.",0,20140521034646,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I was trying to wait until marriage to have sex, not for a religious reason, but because I wanted to save something special for marriage.  I was very adamant on waiting until marriage and told my ex on multiple occasions ""Never ask me to have sex if I've been drinking.  I might say 'yes' but my real answer will always be 'no'"".  I was okay doing some sexual things (oral was as far as I was willing to go), but I had made it very clear I did not want to go all the way on numerous occasions.

We liked to drink white wine, and one night we had way too much.  I think I had a whole bottle or more.  I was intoxicated and I even remember the room spinning.  We were making out in bed pretty intensely and as my sex drive had been low lately (I think it's because my psychiatrist prescribed me Prozac for depression) I guess my ex wanted to take advantage of this opportunity and pushed hard for sex, asking if I wanted to have it.  I was unable to say no.

About seven seconds later I felt this feeling of horror come over me as I realized what was happening and pushed away and rolled over to the side of the bed.  But it was too late; my virginity was gone.  My ex was clearly irritated and asked a few minutes later did I want to have sex again because the first time was really short, but I said no.

That was the only time we ever had sex.  I got dumped a couple weeks after that happened, probably because I freaked out and acted weird the whole next week.  But it's still on my mind a lot, and I feel like I should have been able to say ""no"".  I'm very conflicted right now.

>This involves conduct that is not directed at a particular individual but results in an overall poisoned atmosphere. This can include:

>* demeaning nick-names, sexist or racist remarks, stories or emails, unwelcome jokes and cartoons, nude pictures, displaying of racist or bigoted pictures or materials; and

>* exclusive behavior and social isolation of one employee by others; and

>* any other pattern of unwelcome conduct that creates an uncomfortable or hostile work environment for one or more employees.

>Indirect harassment also includes conduct/remarks or malicious gossip about an employee that are not directed at him or her at the time.  If the employee becomes aware of demeaning remarks or gossip and is adversely affected as a result, then such indirect comments may constitute workplace harassment.

*From http://www.mfrresolutions.com/crucial-facts-about-conflict/workplace-harassment-and-bullying* 

Ladies, in my 16-year professional career, this is the first time I've really experienced anything like this. One of the senior managers at my workplace calls people inappropriate nicknames (one of them racist toward South Asians), intentionally excludes women from non-work social events like happy hour or sports games & tailgating, and badmouths some of his direct reports to their peers. *edit: all of this has happened in front of me multiple times. He tells me stories using derogatory names, bad-months my own team members to me when they aren't around, and invites my male peers to a ""team happy hour"" right in front of me and another woman, except that only the men from the team are named. I fear confronting him because I fear he will come up with his own name for me and bad-mouth me to others... If he doesn't already*

He recently told a male coworker to thank him for putting ""eye candy"" (a female coworker) on his project. and I've about had it. I've considered talking to this manager, but if I do so, I feel I have a high risk of not only getting my own nickname, but permanently damaging my potential to progress my career here. 

I've weighed my options, spoken to my boss about it, and am going to this director's boss tomorrow to formally report his behavior. I'm nervous about it, though I know I shouldn't be, but it's time to put this to an end. 

My purpose in posting here is this:  No one should ever have to work in an environment that is toxic, whether to themselves or others. Everyone should know what indirect harassment is, and that you have a right to work in a place without it.

**edit** My formal complaint will be that he is engaging, as my company defines it, in ""Misconduct or Inappropriate Behavior""  - not Harassment - because while he isn't necessarily breaking a law (maybe?) he is breaking several of our company policies.",25,20140521105217,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26543c,"I need help explaining why sexual harassment can be so humiliating","A man at my office has been sexually harassing people.  I don't know exactly what he's been doing to other people, but in my case he has given me an uninvited and unwanted kiss and spanked me with a stick(!).  He has said to me that he is just joking, and he thinks his behavior is rather minor, and he doesn't understand why it is a problem. The people who have to deal with this are taking it seriously, but they don't seem to be able to explain to him why this behaviour is wrong.  Their approach seems to be ""we don't do that sort of thing anymore, because some people find it offensive.""  They know that I find it offensive, and they accept that, but they don't really understand why.

This is a problem because they are not able to explain what is wrong with the behavior to the perpetrator, meaning that he does not really understand why he has to stop doing it.  Unless they can really understand what is wrong with sexual harassment themselves, I don't think they will ever be able to deal with it effectively.

I'd really like to be able to explain to them why it is so offensive, particularly in a professional environment.  I want them to understand that it is intensely embarrassing, and that it feels as if your professionalism has been instantly and completely undermined.  I think this is something that is quite hard for men to understand.  Does anyone have any resources which really explain WHY sexual harassment is offensive?  Or the ability to express more fully than I have?

EDIT: thanks for the advice y'all.  Unfortunately I still don't feel capable of explaining this to them.  I was sort of hoping someone would point me towards some pithy essay that would lay it all out really clearly.  I guess it's not my job to make people understand how it feels, just so long as they do the right thing.

UPDATE:  So the man that was doing this has now been suspended, which is a good result.  I agree with various people who have posted that this behavior is so ridiculous that it appears unrealistic; nevertheless, it happened.  It was altogether a surreal experience.

About a month or so ago, I met a guy on okcupid and ""dated"" him for nine days before I realized he was obsessive/a ""clinger"" and an alcoholic (that's a hell of a story, if anyone is interested). 

We had sex three times in those nine days, along with oral sex.  Actual intercourse always had condoms.  But, in the post-""breakup"" anxiety I was feeling because I was scared he would come to my house and harass myself or my roommates, I decided to get tested for STIs and HIV.  He mentioned he had friends who were recovering heroin addicts. My anxiety was taking over.  I went to the planned parenthood and was tested for the usual spread, and requested an HIV test.  I tested negative, but they told me it was too soon for it to be 100% accurate and to come back in 6 weeks.  My 6 weeks are now up, and I am going tomorrow night with a friend because I just need someone to hold my hand.

Logically I am aware that my chances are incredibly low.  Despite the fact that condoms to us are just a millimeter of latex, a condom to a virus is like trying to cross through the Berlin Wall with a plastic spoon.  We used condoms every time.  The probability of a heterosexual white male being infected and not treated is also very low.  My standard screen for STIs came back negative.

I know I sound like an idiot.  I am ashamed of the places my anxious mind takes me.  I have a friend coming with me tomorrow, and I am very thankful to her, but I'm just fucking scared.  I am convinced I will come back positive and will have to tell my family and friends and move to a metaphorical leper colony.

I'm not even 100% sure why I feel the urge to post this. Maybe I'm looking for other women who have been in similar situations.  Maybe I'm looking for other women to tell me my anxiety does not make me a fucking crazy person. I don't know.",13,20140521120414,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_265bu1,"What to do about my (mostly) sexless relationship... trying to get back to ""normal""","So I have been in a committed relationship for almost 4 years and things have been pretty good... including the sex, which happened regularly and was fun and good until maybe like a year ago. At this point, I had a horrible job that destroyed my self-confidence and kicked off a major struggle with anxiety/depression. The meds that were helping destroyed my sex drive, which was frustrating for both of us. I felt better but I didn't care about sex and that didn't feel right. Going through the motions didn't feel right (or comfortable -the meds don't just affect how you think about sex, it affected how my body prepared - or didn't - for sex). I went off meds and have been doing well with the support of a therapist. 
But the sex stuff didn't fix itself. Now I'm not sure what's going on. My bf has been mostly patient, though occasionally goes through periods of making petty comments about this - that I don't want to touch him, he's not attractive, etc. These things are not true, we're close otherwise - I enjoy being affectionate with him, the next part just doesn't kick in.
I'm thinking maybe just getting out of the habit has made me anxious about this - or made it seem unnatural. I do think about initiating again (since he's sort of given up) but that feels really forced and overthinking it makes me awkward and less likely to engage. Recently, when I've tried to start something - he's so confused/startled that he doesn't really respond and since I'm already being a weirdo/awkward, I back down really easily.
We were just at a wedding and stayed at a B&B... and it seemed like a really good opportunity. I was in our room undressed and thinking how to proceed when he made a comment about this and how he wasn't allowed to touch me (I don't remember exactly) - and it was snarky enough to throw me off again.
So it's been months with very little activity, and this is putting a strain on our relationship, obviously. I feel awkward about it, don't really know how to explain it - except that I have literally not been interested/excited by anything, so my general comment has been in the realm of ""it's not you, it's me"" but that has never helped anyone.

Some other factors - we have different enough schedules that we don't ever go to bed/get up at the same time, so I feel like this makes it hard for anything to organically happen with us. We share a bed part of the night but we're not really aware of each other at this time.

I've gone through horrible moments in past relationships, just like I'm sure many of you have. I was lied to countless times, and cheated on twice. It's a very difficult thing to go through, but I've put that behind me and I no longer have feelings of hatred towards the guys who have done that to me.   

Here's where the problem kicks in.   

I'm dating this FANTASTIC guy right now. He's nothing like the other guys I've been with. He respects me and I don't feel embarrassed to tell him things about myself that I would never tell anyone else. I'm in love with him and we're talking about moving in together in August, although I'm at his apartment basically 24/7 now. My problem is that any little hint of ANYTHING that could be taken as a sign that he's cheating on me, I take the wrong way. For example, he just started a new job 2.5 months ago and he often stays late to impress his boss, etc. My mind immediate jumps to ""he's cheating on me"" even though the rational part of me doesn't think he ever would. He's really close to a girl that he's known since childhood that he talks to sometimes, and although they live in different cities my mind is still suspicious. I want to be clear though; I know he's not cheating on me but I can't help for it to be my immediate reaction when something happens, and it always upsets me. He knows that I have these insecurities and trust issues and he's very supportive, but I know it frustrates him sometimes, and I don't tell him about my worries every time I get them. It's getting to the point where it happened last night, and I told him. He rolled his eyes a little and reassured me that I had nothing to worry about and that he loved me, but that was the first time it really seemed ""taxing"" to him. Our sex life is usually great, but last night he couldn't get hard and I couldn't get horny either. It's also turning into nightmares for me, and I want it to go away.       

Ladies of 2X, I'm hoping someone out there can help me. I know he's not the same guys I've dated before and that I shouldn't automatically expect the same things from him, but it doesn't help. My mind still jumps to the worst conclusion. Can anyone give me any advice?

TL;DR - My previous relationships have caused me to have rough trust issues and I need advice on how to get over these trust issues so that I can stop hindering my current relationship.",4,20140521083515,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

My name is Sharon and I’ve been studying in a male-dominated field for about a year now. I am one of only two girls in a class of thirty. I am generally treated well and seen as an equal among the guys, though I do overhear the typical sexist-jokes banter from time to time, which I’ve learned not to be bothered by.  

I decided to write to this subreddit because of a recent incident with a one-time tutor who was giving our class a workshop. We had never seen her before, and there is no denying that she was a very attractive woman. Obviously this got all of the guys a bit excited but one of them, - let’s call him Ross, - took it one step further, which has been bothering me ever since. 

Ross asked the guy in front of him to ask this woman a question, so that she would be facing backwards to Ross. When she was in the right position, Ross took out his phone and took a picture of her behind, - with flash, - while she bending over helping the other student. He then proceeded to send this picture to multiple guys in that class who then also shared it.

The whole affair made me incredibly uncomfortable and think less of the guys I’m in class with. What should I do/say?

t3_2663l1,"I'm having a problem with this guy in my comic book club","I've been a member of this comic book club for about 6 years or so, and I love it. Up until now, it's been awesome. But lately, I've been having a problem with this one guy.
D is an extremely talented artist. I've known him for nearly 6 years and have always considered him to be a friend. But he's been bringing extremely graphic work to our meetings, and it's making me uncomfortable. D's latest project was an incredibly graphic ""Wonder Woman"" parody comic wherein the lead female character was repeatedly raped. He talked at length about the project, referring to it as his ""obsession"" and claiming that he wanted to ""reinvent the Tijuana Bible."" He seemed to be fishing for compliments, as he also kept pointing out how ""well-researched"" his project was. We had three new female members that night, and they haven't been back since; I'm thinking that D's art drove them away. I'm not the only person who felt uncomfortable, but I was the only one to speak up. D was dismissive and said that I was overreacting and that I didn't understand his work. 
I was emailing my friend A, who moved away a few years ago, and she dropped this bombshell on me: prior to moving, she stopped coming to meetings because D made her uncomfortable. He had brought in an ""Archie"" porn parody about the girls' locker room being a secret peep show (because that's an original idea, sarcasm). A asked another male member, M, to talk to D about his art. M is one of the founding members of the club, and many people consider him to be a leader. M basically told A to talk to D herself. Since she didn't feel comfortable doing that, she just left.
I've talked to M about this, but he's wishy-washy about the whole thing. M claims that he doesn't support D's work and that he's offended by it, but he doesn't want to ban anyone from the group or dictate what people can and cannot bring to meetings. I agree that censorship is a bad thing, but I also think that bringing hateful material (whether it's misogynistic, homophobic, racist, etc) to meetings is inappropriate. M keeps insisting that D has already been ""raked across the coals"" and that he doesn't need to be ""raked across the coals"" a second time. I argued that D's behavior has driven people away from the group (on multiple occasions) and that something needs to be done. D is completely unapologetic about the whole thing; his attitude is one of ""oh, poor me, no one understands my work, I'm being singled out, etc."" In fact, he was baffled that I (and several other women) felt uncomfortable because of his artwork. 
I'm honestly angrier at M here. Whether he intends it or not, he is supporting D by allowing him to bring misogynistic work to the meetings. And the only message that D's artwork conveys (at least, to me) is one of misogyny. 
I don't know what I'm looking for here. I guess I just want to vent a little. I always thought of my comic book club as this little bubble where misogyny didn't exist. There are dozens of talented female creators in the group, and no one has ever discouraged them or pulled the whole ""comics are for guys"" schtick that's a common part of the comics fandom. But all of a sudden, there's an unapologetic misogynist in the group, and it's upsetting to me. D doesn't come to meetings a lot, but I don't think that we've seen the last of his offensive porn parodies. 
Thanks for listening, or reading. Any advice would be much appreciated.

I'm working at my first full time line cook position since graduating from culinary school. But I'm having some real problems with my male coworkers.  
**Back story, skip if you like.**  
The place that I work at is about six months old now. In fact, I helped open the kitchen. It was me and one other guy and together we worked out creating recipes, where equipment should be placed, what needed to be ordered, what responsibilities were to be given to who, all sorts of stuff. So maybe calling me a ""line cook"" is a little weak, because I do a lot to keep that kitchen organized and functional. Even to the point of telling my boss what product to order for the next day, keeping track of inventory, as well as a key-holder. (should also mention there are no managers, no executive chefs, just employees and my boss. It's a pretty self-governed work environment).  
The coworker I started with ended up quitting our very first Friday. Couldn't handle the pressure I guess. Since him leaving we've hired two additional line cooks, a prep cook and a dishwasher. To my surprise, the number of women in the kitchen is slightly more than men. There is me, our prep cook and one of the line cooks. My problem lies with the male line cook, and his friend/roommate who we hired as our dishwasher.  
Both of them were hired maybe three or four weeks after I began. I am technically the senior of the kitchen, if even by a few weeks. I am the only one there who had any part in the initial opening of this restaurant as far as back of house goes.  
**Okay. Back story over. Here it goes...**   
Despite my seniority in the kitchen my two coworkers seem to have no respect for me. Basically they see me as a female, not as a coworker. Both of them have what they call ""baby mommas"", meaning women they are no longer with but share children with. Both of them think they have women aaallllll figured out, simply because they have what sound like some pretty rotten ""baby mommas"". I can't seem to get them to realize that while they may have *one* type of woman figured out, they do not have *all* women figured out. I can't bring up a single reasonable concern about work without them excusing it as me just doing what women do: complain. I've have even approached them about not treating me so differently because of my gender, but it's the same thing.  
I am frustrated, and I don't know what to do. I have worked in all-male kitchens before, but never have I been treated this insignificantly. My physical strength may not be on par with them, but other than that I consider myself a hard working asset to the restaurant. I'm tired of being punished for their bad choices in women. I don't consider myself to be your average female line cook as far as personality goes. A lot of women I was in college with were real fierce and tough, practically ""one of the guys"". That's not me. I don't like aggression, and conflict makes me nervous. I don't have the line cook attitude, but I can tell I have some talent in this field. That's why I stay. How can I assert myself as someone who deserves respect from my coworkers that see me only as a woman in a kitchen?  
  
Should also mention that my boss is a total doormat who *also* hates conflict. To the point where if a customer has a complaint and demands to speak to someone in charge, he sends one of us out instead while he hides in the back. I don't think going to him about this problem will solve anything.",14,20140521164501,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_265ov4,"Sick and tired of my son's father.","Shortest version of the story(I've posted most of this in a comment before); Now this was the man I was head over heels in love and have a beautiful son with. I found out he had been cheating on me with his ex wife. He disappeared, so I left him. He had moved back in with her before we were no longer together.
This was the woman that had him incarcerated under false charges, ruined his credit, didn't let him see his son for 2 1/2 years, and also filed with the VA that he was fully disabled from combat so she could collect $3300 a month. 

He didn't see our son for almost 2 months. I had to track him down to confront him. Now I'm lucky if he'll see him once a week for a few hours. When he actually does show up, he'll try to pass the baby back to me every chance he has. Now he's avoiding/running from child support.

I also found out a few days ago that he's been lying about me to our mutual friends, trying to ruin our friendships. I'm lucky enough that they came to me to talk about my ""gossiping"" before they stopped talking to me all together.

My biggest issue is that I cannot find where he and his ex wife live. They are completely unlisted. Child support services have tried ever option. I even used a site I have to pay for trying to find them. Its been 5 months since my claim has been accepted. He refuses to give me their address. His court summons has to be physically given to him. 

If I think of more, I'll add more. Im also not sure if this is where my post should go. Sorry for formatting and any typos, I'm on mobile.

t3_265uyf,"Question about different experiences with IUD's","Last week I had a Skyla IUD placed (basically the baby sister to the Mirena - less hormones, smaller). I've had two Paragard IUD's, both started to come out so I am hoping that the Skyla is a better fit (literally and figuratively).

However, for the last week I have had cramping every day. It lasts anywhere from 15 minutes to hours. They're very painful (worse than the cramps when it was inserted, though honestly insertion was relatively easy). When I am cramping, I am spotting. I don't notice any blood during the day when I'm not cramping. 

I didn't have this experience after either Paragard insertion. So my questions are these:

*  Do any of you have the Skyla? If so, did you have a similar experience?

* Those of you that had Mirena, did you experience this? I'm wondering if it has something to do with hormonal BC vs. the non-hormonal BC. I haven't had hormonal BC in years.

* If you've experienced this, were there any issues or is it normal?

I am going to contact my doctor if this lasts through the week. I tend to overreact to pain so I thought I'd look for comparable experiences first.

I finally decided to start dyeing my hair once it was easily 30 noticeable strands instead of just the one or two, and now I've been dyeing it about every 2-3 months with my hairstylist for about a year. In the beginning, he was just painting the ones he saw, and I was really frustrated that he didn't seem to be doing a good job because I would go home and comb my hair and immediately see hairs that he missed. But I thought, maybe it takes time to start covering them all and not missing any. After a few times of this and the problem not going away, I told him I needed something more aggressive. So instead of just painting those hairs, he started dyeing my whole head. But I'm still seeing maybe one or two he missed once I get home. Even worse, it seems like the dye fades off my hair very quickly. Right now it's less than a month since I last saw him and instead of beginning to see grey on the roots, I am beginning to see entire strands!

Having never done this before, I don't know what to expect. Is this normal? Is missing a hair here and there normal for the hairstylist? Is beginning to see the entire grey hair within weeks normal? I thought that you only had to touch up your roots, and the hair strand stayed colored. I'm starting to get really frustrated that I don't look much different from when I went in after a few weeks have passed. Is this to be expected, and I should go more frequently?

I have a great life, amazing job, nice house, etc. I know that people love and care about me, but sometimes it feels like I annoy the shit out of them. I think I care too much about their approval, even though I know that they approve of me most when I'm just being myself.

My best friends work with me. I'm not disclosing what my job is, but the setting I work in is basically like a giant family. My boss and coworkers are the best people I know, and we are all super close. However, there are these days where I feel like I'm the odd one out. It feels like I'm the younger sister in a family full of older siblings that are always going to be cooler and more successful than me. I get really worked up in gaining their approval sometimes, and I will feel left out when I'm not even being excluded. My coworkers are older and more experienced than me, and I'm a few generations behind with more room to grow. They're naturally cool; I'm naturally awkward.

The problem isn't that my life revolves around them. I have other friends and other interests. But having other things to be happy about doesn't take away that pang that I sometimes feel. Sometimes I just want to scream and cry because I love these people, but I'm so goddamn awkward and annoying sometimes. I know I can get on their nerves. They don't get that they are my favorite people to be around. I want to be all cool and collected, but I also want them to know that I'm upset so they can give me some comfort, but I also don't want them to know that I'm so attached, so I just try to get over it. 

Then I go home and isolate myself and cry in bed that night and pretend that they (OR a crush, or a celebrity crush, I don't even know) are here with me and hug me. and then I get over it and move on with my life and act normal again.

>>>>>ALSO!, I have noticed that I often (not always!!!!) meet a new person, feel 'meh' about them, then notice something really cool about them, then suddenly develop a really big crush on him, then slowly just like him as a friend only. Does anyone else get like that?

So yeah. I know I sound really dramatic, and I promise I'm really not obsessed with them. I only feel like this once in a while, but it still bums me out when it happens.

We've been close for 6 years, and she's one of the most important people in my life. We're the kind of best friends that are brutally honest with each other. To give an example, her two primary nicknames for me are mi amor and loser.  If I'm wearing something ugly, she's going to tell me.  If I think she's being too narcissistic, I'm going to tell her.  Of course, we support each other on serious issues, but we also help each other sort out what is serious and what is an overreaction.  With that background in mind, here's the situation.

My friend dated a boy for three or four months when she was in 10th grade.  He was her first and so far only boyfriend.  I thought it was a pretty good relationship at the time.  They cuddled and kissed and he gave her a stuffed bear for Valentine's Day.  He broke up with her rather suddenly without ever really explaining why.  He said something about she spent too much time on her phone (which is true, but he was also kind of needy).  However, he also apparently pursued one of our other friends a few months later and claimed to have liked her throughout his relationship with my best friend.  Another friend says the boyfriend was spreading rumors that he fingered my friend in an elevator (not true).  My friend says that he would often talk about other girls who liked him and ex-girlfriends while they were dating (she never told me this at the time).  Because of all this and more, my friend wants absolutely nothing to do with her ex.  Won't even say hi to him in the halls of our very small school.  I understood this at first, but think she needs to move beyond it now.  She's upset that I invited him to our joint grad party (an invite sent via Facebook that also went out to about 130 other people) and I decided to give twox a shot at changing my mind.

t3_265tm4,"How should I handle this ambiguous, unsettling hot tub encounter if it happens again? Details in post. x-post from /r/relationships","Last night around 8:30pm I went to my apartment complex's shared hot tub. There was 1 person already there, a middle aged man. He was sitting in kind of an awkward position. Usually people in hot tubs sit with their back against the tub, arms out. But this guy was rotated about 90 degrees -- his side was against the side of the tub, and he was kind of hunched a little bit over the side of the tub.

I thought maybe he was looking at his phone or something on the ground outside the tub, but when I took a closer look he wasn't, he just seemed to be concentrating very hard on the ground.

Also, I usually say hi and give a wave/nod to others as I get in the tub, but this guy didn't look up or acknowledge me in any way.

I kind of ignored it and got in the tub, but after about 5 minutes, I looked over, and he had rotated his body so he was facing the side of the tub, exactly where a jet is. He wasn't pressed up against the side, he was very awkwardly positioned about an arm's length away from the side.

It really started to look like he was masturbating, so I stared at him for a few seconds. His arms were submerged under the water, and the jets were on, so I couldn't really tell if the movement of the water was from the jets or from his arms.

I kept staring at him, and he never made eye contact at me. I was so creeped out I just got up and left.

1. Do you think he was masturbating? Or does he just have an odd way of enjoying the hot tub that doesn't involve being in a relaxed position?

2. What is the best way to handle this if it happens again? I was really close to saying something, but I honestly couldn't tell if he was masturbating or being inappropriate. If he wasn't, I would have felt like the world's hugest asshole. And I couldn't think of a polite way to say, ""Pardon me, but are you masturbating in the hot tub?""

Some days , I feel like I could take on the entire world. I feel gorgeous, I love my body, and I am smart.
And then, there are days like this. I woke up this morning and knew today was going to be a bust. My husband hasn’t touched me since last week, he barely looks at me, and so I feel like I’m nothing to him. I feel huge, and ugly, and stupid. Even as I write this, the only things repeatedly cycling through my mind are that he could do so much better than me, and that he will inevitably find someone who leaves me in the dust. All those thoughts come from the lack of words. He never tells me that I’m pretty, not that I depend on that, but it’s still nice to hear once in a while, isn’t it?


I watched “The Mirror Has Two Faces” today, and I found myself identifying with Barbra Streisand’s character, in that she bettered herself, only to start getting the right attentions from the wrong people. I, on the other hand, get no attention (even from the right person), and I don’t care what other people think of me, it would just be nice if my own husband could bring himself to tell me I was beautiful. He says he doesn’t, because all I do is reply that I’m not pretty. **HAS HE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT TELLING ME I’M BEAUTIFUL WHEN I ACTUALLY FEEL BEAUTIFUL?** Not when I’m sweaty, or when I feel horrible, because at those times, and many more, I feel everything BUT beautiful. 



I’m tired of wondering if he’s even attracted to me anymore, or if he dreads coming home to me. I’ve even wondered if he regretted marrying me at times. But, all of those questions remain unanswered because he doesn’t think they’re worth answering. If only he knew that when he doesn’t answer, he’s breaking my heart into tinier pieces.


UPDATE: I talked to him when he came home tonight ( I had been crying a little, so I was kind of emotional). He didn't say anything. I told him exactly what was written here, and he said NOTHING. He just got up and walked away. So, yeah....my night? Shaping up to be grrrrreat.

The picture was of a young woman. An average sized young woman in a funny pose that showed that no, she is not skinny, she is not athletically built, but she is completely fine and healthy looking.

I clicked the comment section hoping to see funny cat gifs (and I did), but I was not expecting the absolutely immense amount of harassment and cyber-bullying that was happening. I hope she never sees it.

It doesn't matter what my body-type is, I got **angry**. I was so upset by the mocking of this poor girl. And anyone can say, ""It's just reddit, they're arseholes don't worry over it."" But the fact of the matter is that reddit is *people*. Reddit is my college professor, the waitress, my neighbors, the clerk at the grocery store. How many people go about their daily lives actually thinking this hatefully? Do people judge every man and woman they see in such harsh negatives?

I truly do not intend for this to be a drama-inducing post. I just would love a discussion to give me some insight.

Edit: Some more insight after reading through so many comments. Should we really just ignore hatred when we see it, or be forced to toughen up? Is the correct response to bullying to turn around? Now, this certainly is a large scale issue, but if each person took it on themselves to be just a little better, I think the world would be a lot nicer. But I may just live in a world of corgis and daisies.

2nd Edit: I got a great response from someone pointing out how I had compared her being ""normal"" against skinny/large. It really made me think. Normal was the wrong word to use, and I wouldn't want to demonize any body type. So I edited my choice of wording.

How is this less upsetting than saying that all Muslim people are terrorists or that all Christian people affiliate with Westboro Baptist?  It really feels that I have to over justify myself when speaking about the issues of any size a lot of women face for fear of being written off as a (god forbid) feminist.

Some background; I am a 20 yo I coming from a **very** traditional family with whom I don't share beliefs with. When I moved out she made me promise to stay a virgin until marriage, a promise I never had any intent on keeping. We are not emotionally close, though she believes otherwise. I support myself financially but my parents do try to help out every once in a while.

I called her this week to let her know I have some time to visit this weekend and she tells me she wants to talk. (Talking in my family usually revolves around them telling me what I should do with my life regardless of what I've chosen, I learned early on to just sit and take it) She tells me how disappointed in me she is and how she is losing sleep over it. She then goes on to tell me how a girl's virginity is very valuable, and how I'm basically worthless now that I've given it up. She brought up a bunch of mistakes from my teen years and how the consequences were a divine punishment for not listening to her. This goes on for about an hour.

We hang out a lot, but we are not deep-call-you-if-something goes on in my life confidents. But we are friendly.

So when she became engaged I was happy for her. And she begin planning a -huge- wedding with about 7 bridesmaids, I was surprised to be invited but said yes. (Although her fiance having so many close friends probably played a large part). I had been a bridesmaid before and spent around 100 dollars. My best friend had been planning a casual wedding (that got canceled) and costs were similar.

We are young college students or newly graduated. Weddings are not exactly super grand. I myself graduated a week ago and could not even afford to walk! I have been unemployed since january when I began student teaching and went through my savings. All things she knew! While I am waiting tables this summer and applying for teaching jobs, I am in pretty bad financial state. 

Then she started planning. First was the bachelorette party- it -has- to be out of town. She wants to go to new orleans for four days and hit up the city. Sounds fun...a little pricey.. but ok. But her sister mentioned ""and don't forget, it's customary for the bride not to pay!""--- which I could get if we went out drinking in town or whatever, but not paying for a four day trip?

And then she sent out pictures of a dress. A dress that costs 250 dollars and will never be worn again. This does not include shipping or alterations! Or shoes or makeup or hair or jewelry. 

Tonight I broached it, when she brought it up and mentioned that I wasn't sure how I could afford both. 

She claimed it was cheap for a bridesmaid dress, when I told her it was more than a week's pay she asked if my parents would pay for it?? I was a little frustrated and asked if -her- parents could. 

Then she changed tactics and said I -had- to be at the bachelor party and mentioned that if I was going to new orleans with my boyfriend this summer then there was no reason I couldn't go to her bachelorette party in october (WHICH I ALSO DOUBT I WILL BE ABLE TO GET TIME OFF FROM MY HOPEFULLY NEW TEACHING JOB-which she also dismissed). 

I reminded her that we are couchsurfing and only staying for three days. Boyfriend refuses to take gas money. The whole trip will probably cost under 100 dollars. Not to mention we have been planning this since last fall! But she didn't seem to get it.

She has not formally asked me yet and I think is planning on making pinteresty invitations. Can I back out now?

t3_268dmt,"I shaved my vagina today and it was great and this is why...","I was in this relationship once. His name isn't important and he was emotionally abusive. I stayed because I was 19 and he was my first boyfriend, first sexual experience, first fight, first love. He wanted me to be completely shaven. That was the only way his little bare mouth would even consider heading south (birds of a feather, maybe).

My Dad's Italian and I'm Italian and our hair is resilient. Shaving became something I dreaded because it never turned out okay. I'm not fucking flexible. I can't hold my leg up over my head, bent around my shoulder just so I can get that patch of hairs around my inner labia - but I did. Every. Other. Day. Sometimes it paid off. Other times I had to sit on the toilet after unsatisfying sex, just looking at the red bumps all over me. 

We broke up. And I didn't shave for a very long. Having a bush is fun. There's always something to twiddle with while you're on the phone with loved ones. Periods suck less. Sometimes it tickles your inner thigh, like ""Hey girl, you're not alone."" 

But now that summer's here, I want to wear revealing bikinis because I'm lifting and I fucking want to. Today, I turned on Kanye, plopped down in front of my mirror, spread 'em, and brought it around town for forty minutes. Every once and a while I'd stand up and dance, just looking at myself, trying to decide which parts of me were newly emerging muscle groups or merely shadows. 

When I was done, my pussy looked beautiful. I mean fucking immaculate. Never have I ever had such a clean shaven vagina. I literally just looked at myself for like fifteen minutes, appreciating a part of me that I have been shamed into thinking was ugly and unappealing for more than a year.

t3_267epl,"Pregnant & scared about my future [support]","Hi 2x this is a throwaway but I have been coming here for some time and could use some support.

I found out yesterday that I am pregnant. A second test today confirmed it. I am 19 and I'm planning on starting school in the fall to begin pre reqs for nursing. I work part time at a clothing store in the mall and I live at home still. My boyfriend is an on again/off again situation and right now we are off, unfortunately. 

I don't know how supportive he will be. I am pretty sure that he will want me to get an abortion... But I really don't want to. I feel really strongly that this is already my child, even though she is so small (for some reason I think she is a girl) but she is still a person and still mine. We made her, and now I'm carrying her, and I could never bring myself to harm her. 

I think my parents will be supportive. I had a rough few years in high school but I'm getting my life back on track, and they want to help me out through that. They know I am sexually active and they are fine with that as long as I'm safe... Which I was, by the way... I was on the nuvaring so I don't really know how this happened. 

Anyway. Just looking for support. I'm a little shocked still and nervous about what comes next. I guess I'm due in January or so? I'm thinking I should still take classes this semester at least. But I don't know what to do next.

I'm also pretty scared of labor and delivery. I'm scared of what will happen to my body. I have seen the criticism women get sometimes from being proud of their bodies after having a baby. Stuff like ""that's nasty, cover that up,""  or even something as simple as ""I would be so upset if I looked like that, I never want to be pregnant."" So I'm sad that my body will not be the same... I know it's superficial.

And I'm scared about doing this as a single parent. I don't want to deal with child support and custody and all that stuff but I guess it is inevitable... And I'm worried I won't finish school now.

Has anyone been through this before that can encourage me? Let me know that it's possible? I love my child already but I'm also scared and even mourning for the future I thought I had. I am sure this new one will be wonderful and challenging and beautiful in it's own way so I'm trying to remember that.

t3_2680hz,"It feels like there's no winning with men.","Maybe this belongs in /r/rant but I figured that some ladies on here can relate to my frustration and possibly give me their thoughts.

I work retail, and get asked out pretty frequently, which isn't necessarily a problem; I'm happily in a relationship and very politely decline the advances. However, the more this happens, the more it irks me. These men know absolutely nothing about me. Our conversations almost never leave the range of general small talk. They don't ask me about my interests or try to get to know me on a personal level. It's all based on my looks. In fact, I am often surprised when customers ask me out because it's always the guys who don't really talk when I cash them out; always the ones who have minimal interactions with me. 

I understand that shyness plays a big role in it, but most recently I've been very disheartened by it all. Basically, this guy gave me his number and told me to call him, leaving before I could explain to him that I was not interested. He seemed like a pretty cool guy, so I didn't want to ignore him. I texted him giving him the usual bit about how I'm I am in a relationship and not interested in any romantic pursuits. I then mentioned that I do think that he's cool and invited him to be friends with me, if he didn't find it too awkward. He responded with 20+ text messages starting out with ""It'd be too difficult for me to be friends"" etc (totally understandable). As I read on I started getting disgusted. He had transitioned into sexting me, after I had put in a thoughtful effort to let him down gently and expressed my disinterest with clarity.

I'm just not used to such aggressive attention. I've been with women throughout the majority of my dating experiences, and the boyfriend that I have now is the first serious boyfriend I've ever had. I've gotten male attention in the past, but I guess that it's always been short-lived considering my lack of interest in men at the time. I will admit though that when this was the case I didn't really ""look straight"" (whatever the fuck that means). Now that I don't have super short hair and wear more feminine clothing, I feel like men have been scoping me out more frequently.

It's reached the point where I feel unwillingly disgusted when someone calls me beautiful. It isn't a compliment to me. It adds no value onto the person that I am or to all of the things that I've worked towards in my life. I can't help the way I was born, in fact I often hate it. I don't put any effort into my looks at all and try to be the least amount of flashy as possible so as not to draw any attention to myself. I don't even wear any make-up. This doesn't stop the advances. 

I feel like most guys don't give two shits about my actual character or personality. This is only further confirmed by the fact that I've known countless women in my life who are interesting, brilliant, intellectually-sophisticated and completely deserving of love and appreciation that are often ignored by men solely because they do not fit into the ever-inflating beauty standards put forth by society.

It makes me so fucking tired. I've met a lot of great guys, many of them being the closest friends that I've ever had. It feels like this was the case because my interest in them was out of the question at the time. Why can't this just be the case now? Why can't guys just ask me to hang out and be friends? Even if they do have an attraction towards me, why is it made so fucking blatant right off the bat without any prior knowledge of my other traits? It's like I'm a piece of ass or completely nothing. I'd rather just not have the male attention at all.

I don't mean to come off like a man-hater or anything. I know that society suppresses men within their sexuality in a similar way that in suppresses women in the confirmation of their abilities. It's hard to blame guys completely for their conditioning, but it doesn't make the issue any easier to deal with.

I have had a belly pooch for as long as I can remember. No matter how much weight I lose or exercise I do I can't seem to get rid of it. At the moment I am 5'8"" and weigh around 118 pounds. I do exercise about 3-4 times per week and my calorie intake is naturally quite low (around 1400 - 1800. I was curious and logged what I ate on MyFitnessPal for a while, I'm not actually trying to lose weight and have been this weight for about 3 years). I don't eat processed or fast foods often. Maybe like once or twice a month I'll eat fast food.

Now, I know my belly pooch isn't (just) stored fat. I know that because it goes flatter and bigger regularly. Some weeks it's barely there, others it's like a mini pregnant belly only below my belly button. It looks odd because my stomach itself is relatively flat, then I just go out below the belly button. Anyway, I've read that it can be due to water retention and/or bloating. I've bought some pro-biotic capsules that also focus on Candida (because I heard this can cause it too?) as well as everything else.  I've also gotten some cereal that is very high in fibre but low in sugars to increase my fibre intake in case that's the problem.

I'm also kind of thinking I could be allergic to something I'm eating on the reg. When that area bloats it can be very uncomfortable and it can cramp badly, the cramps are very similar to period cramps. But it can be followed by a shifting sensation - as if everything is moving through your bowels and you can *feel* it all. I only get that sensation sometimes, and it lasts no longer than a few seconds but it's quite painful. How would I go about figuring out if I'm allergic to something? I have no idea where to start with it, since I eat a variety of things daily. Would a doctor be able to do tests on what I could be allergic to, if that is the case?

My main questions are, have any of you ladies had the pooch but then managed to shift it? If so, how did you do it/what was causing it for you?

t3_268eve,"[SUPPORT] Struggling to come to terms with a particular instance of sex","Hi TwoX,

I've been struggling to come to terms with this for quite a while and I've decided to ask for help.

Three years ago I was in an abusive relationship where I was raped. Almost a year later, I hesitantly began another relationship with a man I met three months after the end of the abusive relationship. We had been friends for a few months before beginning a relationship. He identified as a feminist, and was involved in gender equality and feminist movements since before I met him. When I told him about the previous relationship, he was incredibly supportive and never made me feel like there was something wrong with for it, or that I was in the wrong. I had lost faith in relationships, but my relationship with him helped to restore it. Honestly, the relationship was great.

About half a year in, I got sick with tonsillitis and it screwed with my sleeping pattern. I was already on antidepressants at this stage, and I was given 3 days worth of sleeping pills to help get my sleep cycle back to normal. The information leaflet that came with the sleeping pills warned that they may react with my anti-ds and lead to sleepwalking, sleep talking, and the like. My partner stayed over the first night I was taking them.

I took the pills right before lying down to go to sleep. They made me really sleepy quite suddenly. I thought I went straight to sleep. The next morning, my partner told me something along the lines of ""You were acting pretty strange last night"". I asked him what happened, and he told me I'd been spouting nonsense, saying things like my walls were made of stars and there was a walrus in my door, which he found pretty funny. He also said that I'd been scratching at my underwear or something like that, and that he started touching me because when he did I started to say weirder things. I asked if we'd had sex. He said we did.

I don't remember him touching me. I don't remember having sex. I don't remember saying any of those things he said I did. I developed vaginismus shortly after, and we had sex less often until I eventually stopped wanting to at all because it was so painful. Almost a year after the night I first took the sleeping pills, we broke up. I never explained to him how this contributed to it, or how it made me feel.

I still think about it sometimes, and it upsets me. I am still good friends with this man. We are still mutually supportive of each other, and I still feel I can open up with him. I feel like it wasn't consensual sex, and I know that if I told him this he would feel so awful about himself, which I don't want to happen.

I don't know how I should classify what happened to me that night. I don't know if I'm right to refer to it as non consensual sex. I feel so confused. I haven't talked to anyone about this before.",27,20140522140537,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_268iaa,"Who is an example of a ""Female Power Fantasy"" from pop culture - movies, games, TV - and why?","When discussing movies, tv, and games, it is often said that both male and female characters are designed to appeal to men. 

Idealized women are ""objectified"" to appeal to a male audience.
However idealized men are said to be ""Male Power Fantasies"" - they are designed to look how men want to look themselves, and not because women should find them attractive. They are handsome because men want to be handsome. They are muscular because men want to be physically powerful (and not because the muscular physiques are designed to appeal to women.)

So, for example, the reason that Wolverine looks [like this](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/51f67cd069bedded60000009/the-wolverine-slashes-past-the-competition--heres-your-box-office-roundup.jpg) on film and Batman is [drawn like this] is to appeal to a male power fantasy. Conversely, Black Widow [looks like this](http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/screencrush.com/files/2014/01/black-widow-poster.jpg) on film and Lara Croft [looks like this](http://cdn.pjmedia.com/lifestyle/files/2013/03/lara-croft-tomb-raider-2012-screenshot-cg.jpg) in games in order to titillate male audiences

So who is an example of a ""Female Power Fantasy"" rather than someone designed to appeal just to men? Theoretically, she should be attractive, have an idealized body type, be intelligent/skilled/influential (if the explanations of the male power fantasy hold true). 

How do you tell the difference between an idealized woman to appeal to men and a ""Female Power Fantasy"" designed to appeal to women?

In Jan 2012, I started working on a contract basis for a family-run business that provided an online community platform for a niche hobby.  Initially, I handled email customer support, often completing 50% more cases than my co-workers. By March 2012, the father (CEO) and daughter (COO, my age) asked me to join the company full-time as her assistant because I ""was too smart and too valuable to be in customer support.""

Over the next two years in such a small company, I became a Jack of All Trades - marketing outreach, publishing, event planning, project management, online media, visual arts, public relations, B2B account management, plus executive assistant duties.  I pretty much handled everything the CEO, COO, and VP didn't either have time, nor interest in doing, like conference calls, report writing, and presentations.  

In addition to those actual office tasks, they had me running their personal errands, entertaining their children at times, baby-sitting co-workers who got too drunk at company events, planning their vacations, etc.  The CEO and VP have a pretty raunchy sense of humor, and since I was ""like family"" to them, I was often present for some really impressive sexist and off-color jokes.  The CEO was also touchy-feely, patting my stomach once and asking how I stay so rotund if I don't eat that much during a company lunch.  Since I had the type of relationship with him where I could tell him to f*ck off, I dealt with it that way, and preferred that he sent that kind of attention towards me than the other ladies I worked with because it made them so uncomfortable.

When some co-workers started high school-esque drama after our CEO announced I was his favorite, my COO said it was up to me to figure it out and smooth it over because I was ""the rational one.""

I worked an average of 65 hours a week and hardly took any days off.  Even vacation days, they'd call me because something couldn't wait. But all of the downsides to working for a such a small company didn't really matter to me because I loved what I was doing and I loved them.  The COO and VP were good friends of mine, especially since we're all the same age.

For my performance reviews in 2013 and 2014, I received nothing but excellent marks from them.  Having gotten a mid-year raise in 2013 when no other staff member did, I wasn't due for a raise in 2014, but I got another 5% raise with a 5% bonus plus 2 extra vacation days because, in their words, I ""work harder than anyone else in this company.""  By the end of 2014, they saw me joining the executive team.

In late March, I was moved to an Ops mgr position that had me drawing on my skills and previous experience as a customer service manager and B2B account manager.  According to my COO, this move solved all their problems with the poor service the support team had been giving.  Everyone was really excited about this transition.

I spent much of April getting that sorted out while working on another project that the VP had all but abandoned.  I worked every day for a month without a day off while the executives took a week off for Spring Break.  When that project finally finished at the end of April, I took a couple of vacation days to visit my family, still checking in and helping co-workers with items, and returned to work on a Thursday.

Wanting to do a post-mortem on the project, the CEO, COO, VP and I trudged up to the conference room and settled in.  Then the CEO told me that my position was ending.  At first, I thought he was joking because he started my review with that same line earlier this year, but then he continued that it was for no other reason than financial.

I just stared, mouth agape.  Finally I stammered that I'd just been given a promotion and was really looking forward to turning that department around, and you just gave me an unexpected raise.  All at once, they started explaining that I was their favorite, I never complained, I'm so much fun, I bring so many fantastic ideas and qualities to the company, I have so much heart, etc.  The COO and VP started getting tearful, at which point their dad reminded them firmly that ""the decision has been made.""

So I got a severance and a nice letter of recommendation.  My family, friends, and other small business owners I know think that if they wanted to trim the fat, so to speak, then there were other ways than to get rid of their most personally invested, longest term, most experienced, and well-versed employee. Considering one employee was fired earlier this year for performance issues and another recently left the company, and there's one staffer who can only be relied up to make errors or watch tv on her phone during work hours, it seems something smells bad in Denmark.  I'm finding myself emotionally stuck.  I've lost jobs before, that sucked, but this was soul-crushing.  How can I move on without having that vindictive yet worthless feeling in the pit of my stomach?

Oh, and the kicker is that we had a huge event just before my vacation where I made a lot of business contacts so they've been calling me non-stop.  Talk about awkward as I explain I'm no longer with the company and then have to text my former bosses that so-and-so needs help with this or that...

Thanks for letting me vent.

Tl;Dr: Rug pulled out from under me when I got laid off the day I got back from vacation after working in a family business with whom I'd grown very close to for 2 years.  Bosses always gave glowing comments about working with me, even when they were letting me go for financial reasons.

t3_268gzl,"Copper vs Hormonal IUD for women with heavy periods pre-insertion- advise please!","I am currently trying to decide between a copper IUD (Paragard) and a hormonal one (Mirena). My doctor told me that the copper option can be less appealing for women who bleed heavily when not on birth control, which I do. But reading here on the side effects of Mirena (bad skin, cysts, intensified PMS) and the fact that it is hormonal has made me less convinced that it is the right option. If anyone could give me some advice from their own experiences and what helped them decide between the copper or hormonal I would be extremely grateful!

**UPDATE:** So after much consideration of the pros and cons on both sides I went ahead and decided on the hormonal Mirena IUD. Basically my choice was made because it seemed that terrible, increased periods and period pain were almost inevitable with the copper IUD. I already had terrible pain for the first day or two, so couldn't bring myself to increase that any more (despite having a pretty high pain tolerance). 

As to the choice so far- I got the Mirena inserted just over a week ago. OMG, it hurt like a bitch. I am usually pretty non-fussed by the ideo of upcoming pain (injections, dentist, tattoos) so wasn't really nervous at all. But once it started- shit... It lasted maybe a few minutes. There was the usual speculum discomfort, but then opening my cervix up- that was weird. It sort of hurt, but was more just unpleasant pressure. I wanted it to end though. That maybe lasted a couple of minutes- disinfecting whatever they were disinfecting felt pretty gross. Then came the real pain. Like 15-4 seconds of brain exploding, white hot pain. Like the worst cramps you could imagine spreading through my lower body. I tried my best not to tense up but it was totally out of my control at that point. When they finished it was the hugest wash of relief through my whole body. But I felt really sick. I thought I might throw up, and then I felt ready to faint (I faint on occasion due to anemia). I asked them to bring me water and just lay down staring at the ceiling for maybe 10 minutes. Then I hobbled out of there. I live in New York so I didn't have to drive anywhere, but I would strongly advise against driving yourself home. I walked the pain off a little and then I actually went a did some shopping, distracted myself from the lingering crampy pain, and rewarded mysel for surviving through it all (probably more convenient an excuse than legitimate). 

Now, a week in I am feeling good about my choice but definitely not feeling 100%. I had se with my partner the next day and that was all fine. Really great actually not to worry about a thing :) And no sign of the string poking anything so that was a relief (he is pretty big so I was worried). 

The only problem so far is that I have had cramps every morning and light bleeding almost every day. The cramps such. They aren't intense, but they make me feel weak. Waiting for the train to work is a bitch, standing and carrying laptop and handbag etc. I am hoping the cramps go away soon. From what I have read online they can last anywhere from a few days to 6 months. I guess I will just have to wait it out. 

But for the time being it is great to be sperm-proof! Hope this helps someone in the future in their decision making process.

t3_267zyg,"My ex disappeared without a trace and I am having a hard fucking time about it.","Hey. Just want to vent in a safe space. 

The long and short of it: I spent a great year and a half with M, who I considered to be the love of my life. We met here in the US because I was taking Dutch lessons from him for my upcoming move to the Netherlands and, well, the rest is history. We were inseparable for the first 11 months and it was the happiest relationship of my life, but 5 months ago he moved back home to the Netherlands and we had to finish out the days until the end of summer (when I officially move--something like 85 days from now) doing the distance thing. He became less responsive and things got strained. We went from being completely 100% committed and one the same wavelength, happy, in love and solidly looking towards marriage to... none of those things. Lots of confusion, hurt feelings and just... general ""out of sight, out of mind"" stuff. He has severe ADHD so he can't concentrate long and I'd always been mindful of that, trying to keep our Skype dates short. In person it's no problem but online it's a whole other kettle of fish. He has anxiety issues and doesn't like to be alone--so, while we were together here in the US he was never really alone, but once he moved back home to the NL it hit him that I was no longer there and he was anxious about being alone. This means he started going out a lot again (and late) with our mutual friends and spending less time at home or even checking in with me. One day he'd say he loves me, wants to marry me and that he'll wait and the next there was radio silence. It was incredibly hurtful to me.

Two weeks ago he just disappeared. He said he would call me on May 8th; I hadn't heard from him all day so I called him. Went to voicemail something like 5 or 6 times. And the next day, and the next. Until I saw him being tagged all over facebook at his soccer competitions and posting about them. I'm absolutely crushed. I never did anything to warrant this and in order to ease the distance I told him he could even sleep with other women, as long as we return to monogamy when I get back. I was 100% okay with this (truly) and I feel like I had been such a supportive, loving, fantastic partner. He and I both told each other that though we were allowed to, we have never slept with another person. He has never given me a reason to mistrust him, so I believe that. I don't know what happened, and he won't even talk to me anymore but he won't block or remove me from anything. I'm now going to end up in the Netherlands alone, so back to square one. The problem is my new job and university are about 10 minutes from him so I'll always be reminded of the ""what if?""

I fucking miss him and the not knowing why he did this hurts most of all. I want to call him when I get there (it's such a sad thought that the only way he will answer me is if I call from an unknown Dutch number...) and ask him out for a beer just to get closure, but what's the point?

Does this happen to you too?","I really hope that this doesnt in any way sound like one of those rants about how guy friends are better than girl friends because it really isnt. I value my female friendships and I wouldnt want to give them up. 

Having said that I notice that there are occasional tensions with many of my close girlfriends. Like as far as I know we didnt fall out or anything, but for a day or two she cant look me in the eye or her voice will be a bit brittle when she speaks to me or her smile doesnt reach her eyes and if we are in a group, she will go out of her way not to address me. Most of the time the tension passes and nobody ever mentions it.

 I just had an incident of this nature where I spent the day with a close friend and another group of acquaintances. The close friend went out of her to avoid me to the extent that she chose to take a different train back. I wondered if I was imagining it, so I wrote down the days events and even setting aside my feelings, her behavior was really off today. I **know** in a few days, all will be well again. I guess I just want to understand why this happens. I havent had very much of the same with my male friends (again, in **no way** suggesting that those friendships are superior. They have their own challenges just not this particular one).

t3_267r02,"So when IS it the IUD? (And what's next?)","I've had my Mirena for a little over a year now. It's the first form of birth control I've ever used (go for the big guns!) and I was hoping this would be the end all, be all for me. All of the things I was worried about symptom wise (weight gain and acne primarily) have not been a problem since having the Mirena inserted. Didn't kill my libido, either, which was a relief. On the flip side, I have developed a whole host of other problems, many of which I barely or never dealt with before having my Mirena inserted, including:

- thinning hair (like...worryingly thin. Not coming out in clumps, but I've noticed a bit of a receding hairline)
- two ovarian cysts (one ruptured and put me in the hospital, the other is a dermoid that will have to be surgically removed at some point)
- all sorts of stomach/digestive issues 
- Several yeast infections and one mild case of BV
- hip/joint/back pain. This is the most troubling part. It's gotten exceptionally bad over the past few months...to the point where I can't walk more than a mile or two without my legs/hips/back SCREAMING in pain. Day to day I have an all over achey/blah feeling. I'm getting some bloodwork done to check for arthritis (which seems to be a rarely reported side effect of Mirena) and I'm 29 years old, for goodness sake!

I have also had three really horrible colds and one tonsil infection since last April...after not getting sick for almost a year and a half before having the Mirena put in.

I keep trying to think of other things that could be causing these issues. Maybe the cysts were just a fluke. (Doubtful, according to my gyno.) Maybe I just need better shoes for the joint pain. Maybe the thinning hair/all over blah-ness is from stress. (I have been under an exceptional amount...mostly because of the emotional and financial strain all these medical issues have put me through.) At what point, though, do you think you CAN contribute symptoms to the IUD?

The situation is seriously stressing me out. Mirena has been great for it's intended use...condom-free sex is so much better for me and my boyfriend and I am not at all worried about any mishaps. I'm not sure I would be this comfortable with other methods...so the thought of having to switch to other options is (unnecessarily?) freaking me out. 

So I just want some opinions. Do you think the Mirena could be at fault here? Is there a chance that it's just taking longer for my body to regulate itself? 

For those who had Mirena removed...what was your next option? I don't want to deal with the Depo weight gain (after losing 95 pounds) and I have a hard time remembering to take vitamins, let alone a birth control pill. The implant freaks me out but I'd maybe consider it...though I watched a youtube video of it being inserted and I almost passed out. 

Thoughts on NuvaRing post-IUD? I don't know if the effectiveness is high enough for me to consider using it without a condom. I also don't want the hormones to turn me into more of a stressed wreck than I already normally am.

Sorry for all the questions...I'm just going crazy over the whole thing and I'm super, super bummed I might have to get rid of the IUD (even despite all the side effects it may be causing.)",9,20140522101718,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_268ki7,"Brown discharge for a day.. Now nothing. Help!","Hi there. I'm asking for help because google has only shown me scary unrealistic outcomes.. as usual.

So here it goes. I have an incredibly irregular period. Sometimes it will be a week, two weeks late. It can be heavy or light, last an entire week or three days, you get it.. So I usually go by how my body feels and the week prior. The week prior to my periods, my breasts are sore and I'm more emotional and irritable than ever.

It seems that this week or the week before should have been when I start my period, but alas, all I got was four or five days ago just a bit of brown discharge. That sometimes indicates I'm going to start in the next few days.. But it's been too late now.

Having said all that, it seems obvious that it is implantation bleeding.. Except  I've been pregnant twice already and remember the symptoms very clearly, and I had a lot more symptoms with it. I was extremely sick, I hurt, I was tired, My breasts hurt more than ever.. And I don't have any of those symptoms. But then again, I think I got those symptoms after the bleeding. :/ But I had an abortion last march, and my period was very late when it did come last and before that I had some complications with it. I had an infection afterwards and had to be on a regiment of antibiotics for some time. 

I'm not sure if that has anything to do with how my period acts now, but I've read on scary google that it can be a factor.

So please, does anybody have any insight on what I should do or what is going on?? I don't keep track of my periods because they are so out of wack so I'm a little lost. I want to go to planned parenthood but I have no insurance or money at the moment.

t3_269kxf,"So this is what a healthy relationship (and amazing sex) feels like...","Just needed to write this out and share it with someone. 

I grew up in a conservative christian household and was sexually abused as a child for two years. My parents never knew and never talked to me about sex. I didn't lose my virginity until I was much older and bounced from one abusive relationship to another. Until 8 months ago, I had never had a healthy, happy relationship and had never had comfortable sex with any partner. I say comfortable because even though I had good sex a few times, I never felt comfortable in my own skin during it. I wasn't able to orgasm from intercourse and thought I was part of the group that needed clitoral stimulation for sex. My intimate partners so far have all been rather selfish. Yes, they were interested in me reaching an orgasm but that was never a priority and since it was difficult for me, I just pretended I was okay with not orgasming when I wasn't. Sex was always something shameful for me too. It was hard for me to feel good about myself after having sex, even in a long term, serious relationship. I always felt somewhat ashamed. I would find the need to shower immediately afterwards most of the time. I wanted to have great sex and really longed for it but I thought I would never be able to get there. 

I met someone a year ago. We knew each other briefly before we slept together one night. It was amazing. I thought it would be a one night stand but over the last eight months, it has developed into one of the most amazing relationships I have ever had. Who knew you could find someone you can have amazing sex with, laugh with, cry with, talk about anything under the sun with, and still be respected as an individual? I never had that. He's an amazing partner to me in every way. Not that my past relationships are a standard but I have never felt happier with someone. I have never felt more of a whole person in a relationship as I have with him. But what I want to share (and show off :)) is the sex. Oh my god, the sex! I am at my heaviest right now and it's the best sex I have ever had. I have NO trouble orgasming from penetration alone with him. I can come as quickly as within five minutes. He fulfills my needs completely. Things I never thought I'd enjoy before, I love doing with him. I hated giving blowjobs. I LOVE giving them to him. The idea of it turns me on so much and when I do it, I get surprised at how turned on I get. I never would let anyone go down on me but he makes me feel so comfortable and so amazing when he does. I can orgasm multiple times with him. Last week was six times in five hours (I was EXHAUSTED) and in just one 'session' that lasted about 50 minutes, I came three times. If a friend told me that in the past, I would wonder if that was true but oh my god, I BELIEVE now! 

I don't know what the magic combination is with this amazing man. I don't know if the sex is so good because even though I am the heaviest I have ever been, he makes me feel so comfortable. I don't know if it is because it's the first time I have felt so respected in a relationship or because he makes me laugh all the time. We can jump from talking about work, to talking about politics, to talking about sex, to talking about a tv show and throughout our conversations, I feel like I am heard. For the first time in my life, a negative conversation/interaction does not result in yelling and screaming and hitting. We don't do that. During every negative interaction, even the really negative ones, he never crosses the line. He gives me space, he takes his space, he comes back and talks to me and he makes me feel like I can say whatever is on my mind without invalidating what I am feeling even if he disagrees. Wow. I have never had that. These might be all be the norm in most people's relationship but I have never had an experience like that. I am tearing up even writing this because of how happy I feel and I can't believe I have this. 

I can't tell you how much having a positive, healthy relationship has changed me. I hope it lasts but even if it doesn't, for the first time in my life I feel like I will be okay. That there is hope. That I am not doomed for a life of horrible relationships and bad sex. It's easy to point out what a bad relationship is like. It's much harder to know and understand what a good, healthy one is like. I am so glad I have. I just needed to share this with someone. I feel like screaming it to the world.

After getting lectured about how there is no excuse for me to not see a doctor, how actually my insurance does cover routine preventative care and with my consent, she did a full workup along with treating my illness.

It goes without saying that I am not nearly as healthy as I thought I was. Actually, I'm pretty sick, but with reversible issues.

The problem is that I have NO IDEA how to take care of myself. Sure, I possess basic life skills, but proper care and maintenance of the body is something that I can't grasp. I have neglected my medical care, my diet (I either eat not at all or the kind of foods you would see on a child's plate, and I am 32 and in before fat, I'm not), my physical and emotional self to such an extent that the doctor informed me that my life expectancy could be years and not decades if I don't fix this.

I was abused as a child. It was literally a matter of survival that I stopped registering pain/discomfort/sickness until they became unmanageable on my own or I was strong armed or bribed into getting proper care as an adult (I received proper care as a child). I don't know my body in the sense to find a way to fix it if something is wrong - I most often do not feel pain or any illness until they are completely incapacitating. I had to not. Survival.

I don't know how to feed myself a proper diet. I don't know how to tell if something is physically wrong. I don't know how to search for or vouch for a doctor - I just picked a name out of a book and saw if they accepted my insurance. I need a gyno, but I don't even know how to find one of those, and if I do they have to be someone who can deal with a certain level of crazy I get because I was sexually abused. I have terrible PTSD and can't be touched.

I feel guilty and terrible that I have neglected myself to the point where dying is a possibility. I feel terrible and guilty that what I went through was obviously this bad that I don't feel human, that I feel like an object, and that the thought of care frightens me.

I can acknowledge I'm not the ugliest person in the world, but I am still by no means attractive. I actually dabbled with the idea that I was asexual for a while, before realizing that it wasn't that didn't have an sexual/romantic attraction for boys, just that I found myself so unattractive I couldn't fathom the idea of anyone being attracted to me, that it didn't seem worth the effort. **(Has anyone else ever felt like this? I've never told anyone that because I know it sounds ridiculous)** Like, the possibility of me finding someone seems so ludicrous to me that I've just given up on romantic feelings entirely. 

I know that's pathetic, and I know it seems like right now I'm looking for someone to throw me a compliment to save me from my sea of sorrow, but I don't know who else to turn to.

When I hear him, I stop and turn around and don't say anything. He then goes ""kom hitt"" which roughly translates into 'come here'. I go ""Nei."" (no) in a pretty aggressive and pissed off tone. He goes ""kom hitt"" again and I said ""NEI"" and start walking away. He then says something else like a little rant to himself, I'm not sure. I just keep walking away quickly and rip out my phone and desperately start calling my sleeping boyfriend. Walked the rest of the way back (about five minutes) with the bf on the phone.


I'm living in Norway and everyone says it is so safe here, but it's experiencing more and more crime. I don't care if it is 'safe' there is no way that a drunk guy in the early morning telling a girl to 'come here' in a parking garage - there is no way that is ok. And fuck him for saying 'come here' like I'm some fucking dog. Fuck him. He just stood there and expected me to come to him. Fucking loser. 


And so while I'm thinking these things, yes, it dawns on me. He did this in the early morning, with no one around, dark outside - in a parking garage. There is no way he had any good intentions. Because I'm wearing a dress he can treat me like that? Because I'm a girl? It is so fucked up. While I'm angry, I am also pretty freaked out at the same time.

Now that she's had the abortion, the whole thing is *very hush-hush*. Only talked about in whispers - always danced around in conversation. My sister recently brought up not doing grad school because of the expense and time. My mother said **'then it would all be for nothing'**.

It was meant to be encouraging but my sister didn't take it that way. As if my she owes the world something because the abortion. She has to live in this child's shadow for the rest of her life? Not to mention how no one can talk about it without whispering and acting like it was this big tragedy.

.


First let me say something strange. I love you for sharing about your rape in a way many don't understand, and not in a creepy or weird way. But in the same way I know some people loved me for sharing my rape. So let me share mine with you. I am a 6'5 masculine man. But when I was 5 I was kidnapped by a 17 year old boy, brought to an old garage, and raped.  He was caught and went into the legal system, but I never even got to know his name (as he plead guilty as a minor).  I had nightmares until I was 12.  Really awful nightmares. I also had a distorted sexuality, and was attracted to 5 year old girls until I was 11 or so, but thankfully never acted on it. I used to speak in college about 1 in 6 men and 1 in 4 women being raped or molested by the age of 18. That's over 20% of all children. And if you look in the room (saying this in college) you can count how many men and women there are, and on average how many of us have been raped as children.


I have never had someone look down on me for that. Not once in all the times I've spoken about it. I can't promise no one will look down on you, but the people you truly want in your life will love you more for sharing this. Just as people who have read what you said online love you more for it and support you unconditionally. You are a wonderful person, and when you ask us for help or advice it give us worth. It is no burden for me to help, and you know that because when someone asks you for help you love them more for it not less. Them trusting you is the hard part, you giving them a hug and a loving message is the easy part.


Don't ever feel guilty. If this had happened to someone else, you would have felt no guilt and considered it a ""natural consequence of that guy's action"" to get fired. And rightfully so. As you know, he's built himself up on lying and manipulating people into thinking he's a good guy then attacking the vulnerable. I think it's important that people know who he is and what he's done so he has real consequences. It's the best chance he has of every becoming a good person. Telling people what he did is more likely to help him, as he has to truly come to terms with what he's done and admit the horror of it to other people.  It may also hurt him, but generally, as they say, ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant"". And things get better and better as you let more people in and heal.


Never, ever feel shame for this. You never did anything wrong, and there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed about.

Be safe and be happy :) Ask me anything anytime.

I hope you all know that this applies to every one of you.  I got counseling as a child and as an adult, and encourage anyone who hasn't spoken up about this stuff to find help.  I have never used these services, but a couple places to start for rape or child molestation in the US are:

You are also 100% welcome message me to talk, but I am not going to be as good as the people who do this every day.

It has been a long time since I felt any shame myself for any of this.  And I know it sucks horribly sometimes, but the rest of you can get there as well.  Be safe and be happy :)

(Trigger warning; sexual abuse)","So I have been struggling with depression and anxiety most of my life but am going through a really rough patch right now.  I finally reached out to get help and am doing all I can to get better, but right now that isn't much.  My friend, and roommate has been awesome at helping me but something came out at my doctor's appointment today that I have not told anyone about, ever.

I am pretty sure I was sexually abused by some teen-aged boys that lived in our townhouse complex when I was four or five years old.  It may have even involved my half brother(s).  I am not going to go into the details of the event, because I don't really even fully remember them, but I get flashbacks of that day.  The flashbacks started about ten years ago, and I was never sure about it, so I just kept pushing them back.

Anyways I want to tell my friend about this because he is my only support where I live right now.  He knows pretty much everything about me and wants to help me get better.  I want him to understand why I will be going to certain treatments or therapy or whatever.  (I am still waiting for the mental health intake program to schedule me for an intake appointment).  I also feel like this is something I need to start sharing so that I can start to accept it myself.  I am really reluctant to tell my parents because at this point there is nothing that can be done about what happened then and I don't want them to blame themselves for not protecting me.

Anyways, if you all have any advice about situations such as this or wouldn't mind sharing if you have been in a similar situation yourself I would love to hear what you have been doing to heal yourselves, and how you have handled telling the important people in your lives.

We're a pretty raunchy group so one of my friends started talking about how he found a probably months-old used condom caked to the carpet under his bed. That spawned a conversation amongst the men talking about how messy it is being a person who produces semen. So i, feeling left out, attempted to join the conversation by explaining that vaginas are a constant mess and sometimes you flex your core to stand up at a restaurant and suddenly you have a watergun in your panties. This new dude literally told me to shut up because he didn't want to hear about it. Keep in mind this is my close group of friends who have been my go-to group for over 4 years and his first night.

To the men who also offered your experiences with learning about how the female body works, thank you as well. It really makes me happy when I encounter men who truly care about the women in their lives and have a desire to understand their struggles and simply how their body works. Unfortunately, there were also some negative responses from men who insisted that either women complain too much, or that they don't understand why interactions like this are insulting because basically ""yeah it's gross get over it."" Never once did I claim that it wasn't gross. I just wanted to know why it was grosser than male functions. No one seemed to have an answer for that, and it was extremely disappointing.

I saw myself as always being pro-choice,  and I still am, but I never thought I would ever have an abortion. 

When I found out I was pregnant it felt unreal, it in fact never felt real until I went to the clinic and they did the ultrasound. At times it still never felt real. My boyfriend was against the idea of me having a baby the entire time. He would spend countless hours trying to convince me it was a bad idea and not always in the nicest ways. I knew it was, I knew I could never afford a child no matter how much I worked or how much I made, it wasn't plausible. I also didn't want to subject it to a father who resented its mere existence and couldn't fully love and care for him the way I would want him to. Our relationship, which was a couple months shy of a year at that point, wasn't in the best of places at that time either. My best friend was also pregnant, when I saw how excited her fiance was that's when I knew abortion was the right choice, because that's how I felt it should have been with us as well. Supportive, excitement, I had none of this. Every reservation I had just didn't matter any more. 

We spent our one year anniversary at a two week check up. The whole ordeal brought us closer, as weird as that sounds. And he has expressed guilt about how he approached the situation. But he likes to pretend it didn't happen so we don't talk about it much. I haven't really been able to talk to anyone about it. I flat out lied to my mother and told her I had a miscarriage just because at that time I was going through so much pain I just needed her. 

Next month will be two years since I had it done and I am now letting go of all the shame I have  held on to these past years. I hope to one day I can fully let go of all of it and talk to my family about really happened. I now know it's not something I should be ashamed of because it was the right choice for me.

So my sister is in 7th grade and two of her old best friends are harassing her over text, instagram, and in school. She's not ugly (far from), she's smart, and can sing well. But unlike her classmates she's a bit different since she has two older brothers (me and a 24 year old) so her personal style is a bit...different. For example, she likes music but instead of listening to Justin Bieber she listens to Jimi Hendrix and instead of singing Disney sings she sings Lauryn Hill songs; naturally this disconnect in interests makes her somewhat of an outcast.

She's been having trouble with some of the girls in her class who have been talking shit. Today she came home crying because she found out people were calling her a slut because she wore - school supplied - gym shorts to free dress Friday. On top of that they're calling her an alien because she got head shots taken for a play she was auditioning for and posted them on instagram. I also found out that one of the boys in her class punched her in the shoulder and immediately high fived one of her female bullys. Now, keep in mind, she's not fat, ugly, or dumb.

Now the problem is that there's little we can do about it. She mostly confides in my mother who helps her by crafting appropriate responses to her bullys; my father wants to take a more proactive approach and talk with her teachers but my mom won't let him in fear that it'll just make her life worse. Which it probably will.

As a guy I'm a big fan of the right jab, left hook approach but that's obviously not an appropriate answer. If this were my brother or me our reaction would be to go with the blows and display our disinterest with the situation by making an spectacle of it. Both my brother and I are incredibly weird and carefree, but this made us popular and immune to most bullying. 

I know that she looks up to me and I know she listens to what I say and how I act, but it sucks to see the things I found effective be completely ineffective for her. I (and my brother) live across the country so were hardly around her, I'll be visiting until Saturday and want to say/do something to show her how to best handle the situation.

No longer on medication. Still issues with depression and anxiety at times but since its not constant, or every day most doctors agree its not really an issue for them.

 I started seeing a counsellor a few weeks ago at the advise of a recent psychiatric assessment. and Ive been finding it helpful, the venting, to have my feelings acknowledged. I had seen forms of therapists all my teens but it literally took me until the the counsellor before this one in college to figure out exactly how to open up and make the most of it.

The place I'm going specialises in Systematic Psychotherapy. Which focuses a lot on relationships, family, partners, the people you interact with in your life. She's asked that my boyfriend, who I live with comes in with me. I agreed this might be good for us.

He was very reluctant to go, he's never had mental health issues, and never done anything like this. He's tried saying ""I don't need to see a therapist"". It took a lot of persuasion to get him to agree to go with me next week. I had to really plead, saying I needed him to do it for me. He's now reluctantly saying he'll go, but not promising results.

Im the kind of person with the mindset that anyone can benefit from counselling, no matter whats going on in their life, but Ive never done it with another person. My boyfriends been asking if I'll be in the room, if I can leave, worried about what I've said about him. I mainly just want to help him understand me better, how thing affect me. But also communicate about us and how we work together and such. 

I have no idea where to start it I want to prepare him. Or how this is going to go.

SO and I have been together for several years, and we are ending our undergraduate careers now. He went on a departmental weekend trip (I was invited but unable to go), got raging, blacked out drunk, and then apparently had sex with one of his female colleagues. 

I say apparently, because no one really knows what happened. Others saw him and the girl definitely flirting, holding hands, touching her legs, etc. but then when they walked away from everyone else, all the stories diverge. She is claiming that they had sex. However SO woke up alone, and fully dressed (buttons on pants, shirt and belt done correctly), and only remembers puking that night. 

The girl and I have previously met, and she knew we were together, yet is not sorry for her actions and was upset that they stopped having sex - she told him a few days after the situation that they stopped having sex because he was freaking out about not having a condom (he got tested today, etc.) 

The twist is that both my SO and I really doubt if they actually had sex. This is because he was puking a lot that night, woke up fully clothed, and the girl has changed her variation of the story a few times. But regardless of if they had sex, there was some sort of physical activity, hand holding, kissing, leg touching, etc. 

Because of our long history together and our immense trust, I am trying to work through this with him. I feel strangely 'okay' right now, and it's been a few days.

The thing is I have some other medical complications, like I have Iron Deficient Anemia, I have some random rare condition that has put me on a feeding tube and (I don't eat by mouth at all), I have some bizarre onset of arthritis or ""Joint Pain"" because doctors don't like diagnosing someone as young as me with arthritis.

In June, I'm going in for a procedure that involves swapping the feeding tube out for a smaller ""low profile"" one in June. I'm practically an expert at procedures and right now my parents (the ones financing this potential reduction - so they have a ""say""/power) want me to wait until the feeding tube is removed however that is like a life sentence because the tube is going to be in anywhere from Six Months - THE REST OF MY LIFE (worst case scenario)!

I know RIGHT NOW isn't the time, but I want to start the research part of getting this reduction. I'd ideally do it end of July/mid-August. I live in the plastic capital of the USA (Los Angeles) and figure I could find a really good doctor that could fix me up and help me greatly.

Obviously, I'm really sick of waiting for this. I think it could really help my back/joint pain in that area of my body. I always used to say before I got sick, ""I'll do it in x amount of pounds, when I'm fit."" Well the truth of the matter is I'm a normal weight now and I just need this done.


Fuck. I don't even know what to do. My family has made it very clear they aren't supportive of the idea unless the feeding tube is out but with another Six Months - THE REST OF MY LIFE range it just seems ridiculous. 

Ideally as well since I'd be going under for surgery I'd have them get rid of a little tummy/hip/tight weight too but with the feeding tube in I don't know how possible that is, and I'm cool if they don't do that. BUT I REALLY WANT THE REDUCTION. SOONER THAN LATER! While, I'm still improving on myself and doing nothing serious with my life.

The mansplaining will stop. The jerks constantly playing devil's advocate and arguing for the sake of arguing will stop. But it hasn’t.

 Yes, the mods do a very good job of removing abusive posts. But, often times it’s not quick enough. By the time these posts are removed, they’ve been seen by someone. And since this is supposed to be a safe haven for women, who are often in an emotionally vulnerable place, once the vitriol has been read, the damage cannot be undone. 

I love TwoX. In the two years since I’ve been a redditor, TwoX has been a huge support system for me. It’s a place where I can air my grievances, ask for advice, share my stories and provide support to other women who need it. It was a breath of fresh air, a break from male-central that is the rest of Reddit. 

But I just can’t do it anymore. In the two weeks since it’s become a default, I’ve gotten PMs telling me that I should stop “lying” about being raped, because “you know you liked it”. That I’m going to hell for having an abortion. That my inability to carry a child is punishment for being such a “stupid cunt.” Even after posting harmless, non-inflammatory comments. And I’m just one user. 

And to all the people bitching about having a “woman’s sub” as a default, I think you're missing something. You ask why there’s no “male equivalent” as a default? It’s because YOU DON’T NEED ONE. All of Reddit is a boy’s club. Don’t believe me? Observe the front page for a few days. Better yet, go watch /r/all. Every single day posts about blowjobs, boobs, attractive women, and being “friendzoned” make it to the front/all. Not to mention the circlejerks about false rape accusations. How often do the female equivalent of these issues get any attention (cunnilingus, naked, attractive men, being “fuck-buddy zoned”)? Rarely. At least, until TwoX became a default anyway. One post about period poops makes it to the front page and all the men lose their minds. That’s why we need this place.  

Thank you for everything TwoX. As much as I hate to do it, I think taking a break from Reddit for awhile will do me some good. Hopefully when I come back TwoX will be the awesome, supportive sub that it used to be, sans trolls.

t3_26as0z,"How do I talk to my SO about equal labor / invisible labor in marriage?","Throwaway, SO is a redditor... My older sister and I were on the phone the other day. She is recently married, and I am soon to be. We're both career-minded, working women, and we love our SOs, who are men, very much. They are good guys, who support our careers and are willing to do half of the ""third shift"" work at home. 

The problem is, at least in our experience so far, they don't really know WHAT to do to help. They will do a chore, if asked to do it. They will make dinner, if you tell them what to cook. If you tell them to ""think it up"" they will usually default to one recipe they know well. They will swing by the grocery store, but they have no idea what's in the pantry and what we might need. I think it's an issue of socialization - we were trained by our capable mother to do the ""invisible work"" of keeping a pantry inventory, keeping the calendar, thinking up what we'll cook for dinner. Doing ""half"" the housework (or, a fair share) to me should include knowing what needs to be done and when, and taking the initiative. We both have about the same standards for what ""clean"" means, so that isn't the issue. But for example, if the carpet needs to be steam cleaned once a year (silly, but go with me here), I don't want to be the only one who knows when, and who to call, and what to do to prep the house. He should be just as capable. I have to figure things out as I go along. So should he. 

My big question is this: how do we start our relationships right, and communicate this problem to them, without sounding like we aren't grateful that they are willing to help? I want to be a wife, and I want to keep my career, and I don't want to be his mother. I think he wants that too. Help, please. Men and women - how have you jumped this hurdle?

t3_26ammf,"Being sexually assaulted by someone with learning difficulties?","Hey 2x, I've got an interesting one for you. Using a throwaway because blah blah blah. I'll try and keep this brief.

I'm 21F and attend a college that also caters to people with various levels of learning difficulty/special needs. 


Yesterday, I was sat in the computer area of the library when a lad (tricky to age, but probably between 18-25) with learning difficulties sat down next to me. He stared at me for a while before poking my bottom with one finger. It made me jump and turn towards him, when he said ""hello!"" loudly. I said ""hello!"" and he asked my name, which I told him, and he told me his. I said ""nice to meet you,"" to which he responded by asking if I had a boyfriend.

I said yes, and then we carried on working silently. After about thirty seconds, he began stroking my hand (it was resting on the mouse). I said ""okay!"" in a kind of telling-off tone (I'm a trainee teacher, I'm mastering my stern voice!) and moved my hand. At this point, perhaps I should have moved but us Britons are terrified of offending anyone so I suppose I stayed put just out of politeness.

Not long after that, he rubbed my upper back. I sat forward, he dropped his hand away and I shook my head at him.
I have zero experience with people with learning difficulties so I had no idea how to handle this without being offensive or patronising. 

Again, we carried on working silently at our computers, although by this point I felt deeply uncomfortable and wasn't sure what to do and so
I was just pretending to do my work. I noticed him staring at me out of the corner of my eye. Then I noticed that he started masturbating through his trousers (as in, his hand was on the outside of his trousers).

 I completely panicked. I know that I should have got up immediately and told the nearest member of staff but I just froze. I can't explain it. I'm confident and assertive and have no problem telling a cat-caller to go f**k himself, but this was different. None of my friends were still at college so I fired an email over to a trusted teacher and asked if he was still around (this was after normal teaching hours). 

After I hit send, the boy reached over, slid his hand quickly across my thigh and grabbed my genitals. At which point I leapt up, shouted ""NO!"" And hurried over to the library supervisor. I whispered to her what had happened, tears in my eyes, and she initially **told me to just move computers**. After realising what she'd just said and seeing the look on my face, she got up and took the boy's name before asking him to leave.

He called over ""sorry! Sorry! Sorry!"" To me and I just nodded at him. I sat back down and the supervisor came over to talk to me and apologise for what happened. She took my name and said she would let the boy's tutor know, as he obviously needs to have some lessons in this kind of social interaction. I then sent my teacher (who had replied to say he was still at college) a quick email letting him know what happened.

I then left college and went straight home. I was shaken up and teary and confused.

How am I supposed to feel about this? There was a group of girls who saw the whole thing and laughed hysterically. Am I supposed to laugh this off and treat it as a sweet incident involving a misguided special needs kid with too many hormones to deal with? If I had been assaulted by someone without special needs in the library, it would seem more clear cut and I would be very angry at that person.
But I cannot be angry with this person. He is not 100% responsible for his actions. 

Any advice would be welcome! Am I overreacting?

First of all, I wasn't asking his damn permission. I wanted to discuss it with him because well done tattoos can be expensive, and we always discuss purchasing expensive items before actually doing so. He has zero problem with the cost; he just thinks that if I get this tattoo, I won't be taken seriously by any company I want hiring me once my contract with the Army expires. I explained to him that it's a half sleeve. I'm going to make sure that it won't be seen in my PT uniform (as per the new Army regulation). Therefore, it will only cover from the top of my shoulder to about 3/4 of my bicep. 

Secondly, it's MY body, and I already have tattoos. None of which you can see in uniform, but my second tattoo is on my collar bone. Does what he said hold any weight? Do many companies still feel that visible tattoos are unprofessional? If I needed to get hired on somewhere that badly, I guess I could cover it up during the interview, if it even showed at all.

I just started dating a guy a few months ago. The night I got the letter I called him to come over. It was hard to tell him. I couldn't say it, but I have him the results from my Pap smear. Breaking up with me didn't even cross his mind. He's going to support me through this. Odds are he might have it too.

I just don't know what to think right now. I've gone through so many emotions in just a few days. I don't really know what to expect.  
I'm not too sure what I'm trying to accomplish with this post. Maybe just some support and advice. Or any questions that I should ask my doctor.

He said it's not that bad someone else he dated had it. But he wasn't very aware of hpv or how it's transmitted or how guys don't have any symptoms. So I think I probably got it from him.

t3_26bavx,"Confused: I let a friend ""sexually harass"" me.","This is weird and all over the place. I wanted to wait a while to collect my thought so that this would be coherent but it probably won't be. I made quite a few errors during this ordeal, so I'm not trying to evade the blame, I just want to talk it out I guess.

I made friends with this guy, let's call him Mike, last year. My relationship ended a few months ago and as such I was spending way more time with my friends, him included. Eventually, Mike admitted to be that he likes me but I was up front and honest about it and told him it was not mutual. He understood, we remained friends, and besides him making awkward jokes about it all the time, I thought we were fine.

A few weeks ago, I went to go visit my friend and him (they live down the street from one another). I live very far, so I planned to stay at her house, but turns out she had work at 6 am and the buses don't run until 10, so Mike offered me his futon. This isn't weird or anything, I've crashed there after pub nights and stuff (albeit, this is before he told me how he felt). 

We got drunk, played some beer pong, listened to music, and hung out like we always have. I got very, VERY drunk. Eventually, my friend left and it was just me and Mike. He brought up his feelings again and I, again, explained to him in nicer words that it would never, ever happen. We're sitting on opposite ends of the room, and all of a sudden he darts out of his chair and puts his hands around me. I was out of it and I thought it was a hug (an uncomfortable one at best). I didn't even reciprocate but the next thing I knew he tried to kiss me. I pushed him away, said no, and distanced myself.

He did this a couple of times. Tried to be romantic by pushing my hair away from my face, stuff like that. Each and every time I told him that made me uncomfortable and told him to stop. 

Finally, I was drunk enough to fall asleep. I went to go sleep on the futon and he offered me his bed (and he would sleep on the futon). Eventually I agreed went to bed. This next parts groggy, mostly because I'm a dead heavy sleeper, but I remember him coming in at one point and asking if we could share the bed because the futon was unbearable. I made a ""wall"" separating us with pillows and went straight back to sleep.

I wake up a lot during the night, and at one point I wake up, the wall is gone, and he is fondling me. He's in his boxers, he's straddling me, and his hand is under my shirt, on my boob. I just froze. I laid there frozen and didn't know what to do. I half shuffled away, pretending to be asleep, and got away from his touch. This happened a few more times. Every time I woke up, he was cuddling me. The last time I woke up, my bra was unhooked. I gave up and went to the futon.

The next day he asked me if I remember cuddling him. I lied, I said no. He said ""well, you agreed to it"". I don't know what he meant by this and frankly I don't want to know. 

I'm not saying I was sexually assaulted at all, I was aware of what happened, but it's just disappointing. I had a large amount of respect for this guy.

Now, the kicker. I gave him the benefit of the doubt after this incident. I hadn't seen him since it happened, but a few days ago we all went out for a friends birthday. There I met a friend of his friends who was very fun but very, very drunk. It was her first time at a bar and she came in with 200$ and ended up still having to use her credit card. She was out of it, like x10 worst than I was that night. They all go home, I stay for a bit with some other people, and we leave. All is well.

Mike texted me the next day saying ""wow this girl threw up on my comforter!"". At first I thought he just gave his bed to some one (he lives in a house filled with uni students, it's not uncommon for party goers to go crash). But it reminded me a little too much of our night. I asked who it was, and he told me it was that girl, the one who was so drunk. I asked if he slept with her, he said something along the lines of ""yeah but she was so out of it it wasn't even fun"".

I lost it. I called him out, he called me sexist (""because I was drunk to""... No, he was not. I saw him, he was fine). I told him why I thought he was wrong and he said ""sorry I don't want you to have a bad opinion of me"". It has nothing to do with me having a bad opinion of him, it has to do with NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULTING PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE DRINKING.

I recently took a job as a cook at a super fancy restaurant, lowest of the low on the totem poll but it pays more than the other serving job I was at and it's pretty crazy. I took it sort of spur of the moment because I was feeling the pinch of having my hours cut at the other job. I like the job, I do! I love food and the restaurant business and I always wanted to see how I could fare in the kitchen. 

The problem is, even after the second day, I knew that this was not the way I wanted my life to go. I don't want to be a cook. The hours are worse than my last job, and I already feel like my social life is kind of drifting away. The restaurant is so serious I feel little camaraderie with my co-workers. 

I have a college degree. I was applying before and I'm still applying to office jobs.  I want to work 9-5 and actually see my friends and family on weekends. I love this but I know that if I keep applying to those office jobs, eventually I'm going to leave, maybe even after only a few weeks. I worry that I will disappoint my new boss. She's been a great teacher and really took a chance on me and I realized that this isn't what I want and I'm going to disappoint her. Has this happened to anyone else? Sorry for the wall of text.

We can add to all of this the fact that I am 3 years single and pretty chubby in appearance. So yay self esteem issues!

Sorry it's been so long since my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/21mdm7/pregnant_and_terrified/), I've just been extremely busy taking care of end of term school projects and sorting everything out. I'd like to take this chance to thank everyone who helped me in my time of confusion, your comments and advice really cleared my head and allowed me to make good decisions. 

I mentioned in my last post that I was almost certain that we'd either go with an abortion, or carry to term and adopt. However after a lot of thought and consideration, my boyfriend and I have decided to keep our baby and raise them with the support of those around us. In the time since my last post, so much has happened. We told both of our parents, who after differing reactions all came through and are fully supportive. It's going to be a huge change for my parents, but one that they're seeing as an opportunity instead of a challenge. The friends that we've told have, for the most part, been alright with it. Word obviously gets around, and there's one or two people who ""let it slip"" to others that I didn't want to know, but over the course of the next few years that's something I'm prepared to deal with. There's a lot of stigmas my boyfriend and I will face as young parents, and challenges as we continue with our education both during and after high school, but with the support of family and friends I know we can do it! We may have to take a different path to it, but in the end we'll still achieve our goals. And now we have some very strong motivation to succeed and build a good life. There's some good programs in our area as well that provide a lot of resources for people in my situation, and we're slowly putting plans in place to prepare for everything. 

Again, I'd like to thank everyone who has given advice in one form or another. I'm extremely grateful for it, as it reassured me that everything would be alright and allowed me to think clearly. You guys are fantastic :) ",6,20140523153828,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26b8ro,"Should TwoX stay a default? Thoughts on the sub and a possible petition to have this sub removed from default.","Exactly what the title says. Every day I see someone on this sub who has experienced negative consequences for having this sub as a default or discussing negative consequences they have seen. I am really tired of having this sub put through the filter of people who are unconcerned with its contents. It's become a less respectful and honestly more circle-jerky sort of place since the change has been made (at least from my perspective).

/
/

But when people discuss their unhappiness with the change, it's often a pretty negative discussion without ranged input or full of people who are very frustrated because they feel like they have no avenues of action.

/
/

I would really like to hear some honest feedback on this idea. From both sides. I am hoping it will be an open discussion without 'downvotes because I disagree', and I would really like to hear what people think of it. If people do support the idea of a petition, I would love to hear what sort of platform people would prefer, if it should be a vote sort of thing or a sign sort of thing(?). 

/
/

As for my thoughts, I think Reddit is a very male dominated space, and while I have plenty of love for then men and boys in my life, and appreciate the input of others, it was really nice to be in a place where I felt safe stating my gender, that was less reactionary and aggressive, that welcomed opinions and discussion on female topics. I think it is good that this sub is welcoming of both genders, but I am turned off by the idea of a female-topic sub being put on the feeds of mostly men. I think by having it a default for a site mostly dominated by boys/young men, it's changed the audience and is resulting in a lot of hurt feelings and feelings of... demotion to put it best. 

/
/

I am happy to discuss and/or answer question my opinion on it, but I want to keep my input short and sweet because I would really like to just hear what you all think. 

/
/

**TL;DR: what do you think of twoxchromosomes becoming a default? Would you like it to stay that way, or would you prefer it to be removed from the defaults? If you seek change, what sort of avenues do you like? How do you feel about the sub since the change, what seems different/the same?**

Reddit, I am a 205 pound, 5'3 woman and I know I am overweight. I know this. Maybe I am in denial and hearing it was hard.

t3_26aold,"My self-centeredness is going to ruin all of my relationships","Hi 2X. I had never heard of this subreddit before it became a default and now I'm so glad I did because I need some advice.

The title pretty much says it all. I feel like a huge asshole, but for some reason I can't stop being selfish and jealous and envying what other people have. Friend gets a really great promotion? My first thought isn't about how great that is for her and how hard she works (much harder than me), but it's ""why don't I get work promotions?"" Boyfriend is traveling for work and having a great time with his co-workers, going out after? I get irritated and my first thought is all about how I don't want him having fun unless it's with me. My cousin graduated from a great university and has an awesome job lined up? I immediately think ""Yeah well she's not all that great anyway she kinda sucks so whatever."" College friend getting engaged? Why not me.

Afterwards I always kind of hate myself and berate myself for making it all about me when it is clearly not all about me. Sometimes I'll hear the way I say things and INSTANTLY want to take it back because you can hear the annoyance and irritation in my voice. It's like I feel a need to compete with people I love for things I don't even want that badly, and it ends up with me taking happiness away from the moment because of my own selfishness.

You don't have to tell me that these are toxic behaviors; I know that and I hate it. I have always thought (and still think) that a huge factor of love is the ability to take joy in your loved one's joy, but I just can't seem to get there. I try to give the appropriate reactions when people tell me their good news, but I feel like my selfishness is holding me back from being as happy for them as I could be. This bothers me so much because I really DO love these people and want nothing for the best for them.

t3_26apon,"Just a quick PSA from me to you about regularly seeing your OB/GYN (VERY text-heavy)","Just a little bit of background information about me: I'm a soon-to-be-24 year old young woman who recently graduated with her Doctorate in Pharmacy. I come from a family with multiple nurses and a pretty excellent health care background compared to most people. I understand the medical lingo, I take pretty good care of myself, perhaps lacking only in the physical exercise for the past few years due to the stress and time constraints of my education. (I was a was involved in multiple sports during my early childhood and until the end of high school.) I eat well and don't smoke cigarettes. I will admit to smoking hookah on a regular basis for the past 6-8 months or so. I eat well, cooking most of my own meals are rarely eating fast food. My BMI is probably on the low side of normal, but its been that way ever since I was little. Overall, I'd say I'm in pretty darn good shape. Now, on to my story...

I started seeing an OB/Gyn when I was around 16. I was having irregular menses, where I would skip a month, get my period, stop, then have it start up two weeks later. As a result, I was put on birth control, despite still being a virgin. It wasn't until I was almost 18 that I became sexually active. Then and until now, I have been almost entirely monogamous. (There was a time a few years ago where I slept with three different guys within 4-5 months, but they never overlapped.)

I believe it was January of 2012 when I went in for my yearly OB/GYN visit, with pap smear. I got a phone call stating that my pap showed abnormal results and I'd have to come in for a repeat test. It was only a few moments before the procedure that I found out what was actually happening. Not just a repeat pap, but a [colposcopy](http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colposcopy/basics/definition/prc-20014027). (You mean you're going to be cutting out bits of my cervix?! Excuse me??!) I was terrified and alone, which didn't help matters. It was also around this time that by doctor informed me I've had slight abnormalities on a pap before, which I was completely unaware of. My former doctor had neglected to give me this information. So I'm there half naked, alone, scared, and furious that my doctor kept this information from me. Not a fun way to start a procedure.

I don't recall the results of the colposcopy, but I had to have a repeat pap about around July 2012. That test, thankfully, came back normal. It seemed as if what they believed to be some sort of HPV infection had cleared.

January 2013: routine visit, no abnormal findings.

This year I switched doctors to a woman who was reported to have a much better bedside manner compared to the other one I was seeing. During my February 2014 visit, she was fantastic. She explained everything that she was doing (and even had a the speculum warmed up, it was amazing!) and was as gentle as one could be down there. She noticed a few abnormalities, some mild dysplasia. She took the smear and glanced at it under a microscope. No microbiology found, but she wanted to wait for the full pathology results before saying much more. I received another call a few days later: ""We would like you to come in for a colposcopy so we may biopsy the tissue and get a better idea about the dysplasia.""

Crap. Not this again. So I continued on with my schooling, finally graduating the beginning of this month, then getting the colposcopy done a few weeks later. Again, my doctor was as great as can be expected in that situation and ended up taking two biopsies of my cervix. And so began the waiting game...

Yesterday, I received a phone call from the office. As it turns out, one of the biopsies was [CIN1](http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=543118) and the other was [CIN3](http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=560661). Although I can tell you a ton about medications, diagnosis is another thing. Needless to say, I was scared shitless when I got home and looked up the terms. The office also scheduled me for a [LEEP procedure](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/gynecology/loop_electrosurgical_excision_procedure_leep_92,P07780/), which is effectively a hot loop used to excise the tissue. From what I've read, this procedure has up to a 98% cure rate for CIN2/CIN3 (according to one study). Even with that information, I'm still terrified. I haven't decided if I want children yet, and I read that the risks include cause infertility or premature birth. Scary stuff to think about when your 24th birthday is coming up in a few days, you just graduated, and need to study for 3 huge licensing exams in the upcoming month. (And to top all this off, my last living grandparent has been in the hospital for a few days with ""we're not sure"" according to the doctors.)

Now for my soap box. Please do not read this and feel pity for me. My situation kind of sucks, but I can only imagine how much worse it could potentially be if I did not see my OB/GYN on an annual basis. Who knows what could have happened if I was lax about my visits. I should also not that I have not received the Guardasil vaccine. I made excuses as to why I couldn't get it (school doesn't offer it, it would be a hassle to travel so frequently to my PCP that was three hours away from school to complete the series, etc). Now, especially last night, I could not stop thinking if things would be different if I had gotten it a year or two ago. Would it make a difference if I were to get it now? Unfortunately, I do not have the answers to these questions. But what I **can** do is urge all of you to regularly visit your OB/GYN *especially* if you are sexually active. Your reproductive health is not anything to fool around with. 

Thanks for reading, TwoX. Even though this is a throwaway, I will stay logged in for the day if anyone has any questions. I won't be tethered to the computer, as I need to do some baking and cooking to get my mind off of things, but I will do my best to answer you in a timely manner.

Recently, some family members have made comments toward my sister about how she is not as task oriented or focused as me and this has really hurt her feelings.

Me- I work in IT. I steer away from very crowded places. I love music, practically all types. I love the outdoors (camping, hiking, etc.). Travelling is amazing :)

Sissy- Loves to craft! Everything from scrap-booking, making jewelry, and pottery. She loves shopping. She loves music (mostly pop, but she enjoys a bit of alternative rock as well). Kind of a girly girl, but she is open minded and willing to try new things.

There were really no boundaries in the friendship as far as what's on/off the tables for discussion, so communication was usually good. 

That having been said, the one thing I could never figure out how to best react to was questions about what I think of her body, or simply how to respond to ""progress pictures"" when the sender was already criticizing herself on/off. We fooled around a couple of times, of course I was attracted to her and told her as much, but occasionally I'd sort of freeze up and not know how to respond in a situation where I was worried I might hurt some feelings.

t3_26bch7,"Help me explain why my boyfriend is wrong","Help me explain why my boyfriend is wrong. I recently had some conversations with him that left me angry and frustrated because I can't make him understand.

1) I commented about feeling uncomfortable because a bunch of the men at sporting event were ogling me. My boyfriend asked why it bothered me. I said I felt like a piece of meat. He said, ""Cry me a river."" He said having too many men find me attractive and having my choice of men had to be the ultimate first world problem. I said I wanted to be respected as a person and not objectified. He said he was sorry men find me so attractive.

2) I said the men were creepy, and I don't know they won't try to take what they want. They obviously don't respect me. He asked if I had ever been sexually assaulted or raped. I said I haven't been raped, but I've been sexually assaulted many times. He said he was sorry and asked if I was comfortable talking about it. I told him about a time when I was 13 and a boy at school walked up behind me and reached around to grab my breasts. My boyfriend asked if the boy was punished, and I described the way my friends kicked and hit him and then held him down while I kicked him in the nuts. The creeper crawled away in tears while everyone mocked him. My boyfriend got visibly upset. He said two wrongs don't make a right, and I sexually assaulted the boy. He said the boy could have been permanently damaged and made infertile. He said the boy was publicly humiliated. He said my friends and I acted disproportionately. I was left speechless. I feel ashamed, but I have a right to defend myself.

3) More recently, we ran into one of my exes, and it was really awkward. I reluctantly made introductions and then hurried my boyfriend away. My boyfriend asked why I acted the way I did. I explained how the ex made me uncomfortable because when we dated, he was always touching and escalating sexual contact. Seeing the ex reminded me of the fear I felt when we dated. My boyfriend didn't say anything for a while, and then he asked, what the ex did to make me afraid? I described a time when the ex and I were at a movie. I was wearing shorts, and he kept sliding his hand along my thigh trying to reach up inside my pants. My boyfriend got all cold and silent for the rest of the evening. When I asked him about it later, he said, he'd caressed my thigh at movies and slid his hand inside my pants in other situations. I said it was different with him because I like it when he does it. He said, he never asked me if it was OK before he did it. He just made the move. He said he is no different than my ex.

Help me explain how my boyfriend is different from my ex. Help me explain how it feels to be objectified. I love my boyfriend, but he can't see how wrong he is, and that makes me love him less.

Some back story; I’m a 20 year old female and I was drinking last night at my friends house who I’ll refer to as S. S has been my friend for years and I thought I trusted him completely. We have hooked up twice in the past if it’s relevant. Besides me and S, the only other two people there were our friend ‘A’ and my best friend and fairly recent ex who I’ll call ‘N’. ‘N’ and I broke up about a month ago after dating for 4 years and living together for a year. It was an amicable break up and we still hang out and are on great terms. All four of us have been friends for years, and we were just drinking at S’s house to catch up since we are all back from college for the summer. I recently lost the freshman 15 I had put on last year and I hadn’t drank in a while so I did not anticipate how drunk I would be from drinking one 40oz. Last time I drank I could finish a whole one and would be drunk but not black out level at all. But last night I only got through half of my bottle and was already pretty drunk. The guys then wanted to play pong which is when things started to get really fuzzy. I stopped drinking then because I was really trashed at that point. The guys then wanted to go outside to smoke some weed, and I also smoked because I was drunk and thought I wouldn’t get that fucked up for some reason. After I smoked I can barely remember anything. The brief flashes of the rest of the night that I can remember are these:

When we were still outside smoking, I remember sitting on the ground and S put a blanket over me. Next thing I know I’m in the basement with N (my ex) looking for my spare lighter while S and A are still outside waiting for us to grab it. I remember N and I making out while we were in the basement, then we went back outside. Next thing I remember I’m alone sitting on the bathroom floor, everything is spinning and I’m trying not to throw up. Next thing I remember is lying on the bed in the basement being half passed out but not fully unconscious/asleep because I was still so dizzy. I couldn’t open my eyes. Then I felt someone kissing me. I knew it wasn’t N, my ex, because he has a beard and I didn’t feel a beard on whoever was kissing me. He kept kissing me even though I literally wasn’t moving at all, I was really close to passing out. I felt a hand on my right boob, and whoever it was moved my knee to spread my legs. The next thing I remember was puking in the bathroom. I don’t remember leaving the bathroom, but this morning I woke up in the bed alone, everyone else was asleep on the floor. 

I talked to N this morning about what happened. He pieced the night together for me. Apparently after I blacked out N put me in bed and no one had been left alone with me except for a half hour when N and A went outside to smoke again and S had stayed inside with me. This means that S had to have been the one who kissed/touched me.  

I guess what I’m asking is what I should do now? I am pretty sure S crossed the line last night. I have no way of knowing what exactly happened, if he just kissed me or what. Please, I just need some advice. I just feel disgusting. I thought I could trust him, I've known all of these guys for years, we've been friends since 9th grade. I don't know what to do

Edit: People are saying to get a rape kit. Is that really necessary? Would I be able to tell if I was raped? If he did rape me, would I be blamed for being drunk and underage?",0,20140523124829,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26bqp4,"Husband thinks I don't help out enough at home. I disagree, would like some opinions.","Hello, everyone. First, the usual ""I'm sorry this is so long"" disclaimer. As with most things in life, my question is complicated. 

I'm the female in my straight relationship and I've never been good at maintaining my house. I know how to cook and to clean, but I don't do it efficiently, I don't motivate myself to do it, basically dread doing anything around the house (except for cooking, which is something I'm really good at and enjoy doing). 

My husband has a call-center job and he works from home. I am a paralegal at a law firm about a 30 minute commute from our house. He makes more money than me, and he had to go through extensive training to do his job, and he really dislikes the work. I also have a skilled job, and have to interface with terrible coworkers, terrible phone calls, useless projects, mind-numbing filing and transcription. My job is extremely high-stress due to a crazy boss, the commute, and the nature of the work.

When I get home, I usually find that a lot of the housework has been done. I'm usually exhausted. But my husband acts like his day is just beginning when he finishes work. He showers and gets dressed at 5 in the afternoon, before he goes either to class or is just hanging around the house with me. He's fresh and ready when I'm exhausted and feel like an empty bag.

A lot of the time when I get home, the first thing he says is that we need to go to the grocery store, I need to do the dishes, I need to fold the laundry. He then proceeds to do none of this with me because he already “spent all day doing that.”

Now, I never ask him to do any of the cleaning. He does this on his own. I could care less, honestly. But, he wants the house clean, and I'm willing to work with him within reason. There are things that I basically do exclusively: I fold the laundry after he runs it through the machines; I clean and replace litter in the cat box and rat cages; I feed and water the dog; I mop the floors (which, due to a disgusting gooey medicine our dog has to take, is an extremely labor-intensive chore requiring scrubbing and at least an hour of my time), I do the dishes occasionally, amongst some other tasks. While these things don't happen every day, I certainly make sure they get done when necessary.

Because of my terrible job, I never feel able to clean during the week (although I do it after we have an argument, most of the time. He always wins). He lords it over me that he spent ""all day"" cleaning, that he's constantly cleaning the house, that I don't do anything to help him. He acts like he can’t possibly imagine how I wouldn’t have time to do any cleaning, even though we spend 100% of our free time together—he knows when I’m busy, tired, doing a different project.

We are both part-time students who work full time. On top of that, I also volunteer with a group that pairs trained adults with children in the juvenile court system approximately 30 hours per month, a commitment that requires extensive training and continued learning to maintain my certification. I'm dedicated to my education, my job (as terrible as it is) and my kid who I volunteer with.

We're both busy, but my husband is AVAILABLE and NOT EXHAUSTED when it comes time to clean. He is motivated to clean and he gets it done. I believe that while equal rights in a relationship is important, it is straining our otherwise blissful new marriage. 

Oh, on top of that, my husband will be quitting his (much higher-paying) job to do school full-time very soon, and I have committed to waiting to do the same until he finishes his degree. This means locking myself into my job for at least another year and a half, while he pursues his passions at art school. I'm more than willing to do this for him, because his happiness is an important part of our relationship, and I am a huge supporter of the arts and film (his major)--I just feel that this should be taken into consideration when telling me that I don't ""do anything"" around the house, and I'm getting more and more upset that I'm making this huge commitment without recognition for the other things I do in our relationship.

I'm just ranting. I feel like if my situation was opposite, it wouldn’t be up for discussion. The woman always cleans, the man isn’t expected to clean as much as her because he’s tired and busy. Damn it all, I want to be that “man!” And I think it’s only fair based on our workloads, my personality, and his personality. Also, have read totally non-scientific articles in Time magazine and similar that ""perfectly equal"" relationships can be stressful and lead to higher rates of divorce.

*So here's the question, TwoX:* based on the info above, should I pull more weight when it comes to cleaning, or am I right in feeling that we don't necessarily *have* to be equal on this, and that he is better equipped to get a larger portion of this housework done?

tl;dr: I'm a girl but I'm crappy at cleaning and I hate it, and I have an insanely busy life that results in me being exhausted at the end of the day. My husband is good at it, gets it done regularly, but bitches and moans that I don't help constantly, says that we need to do exactly equal amounts of housework. I want to know if I need to just grow a pair and clean more or if I am right that he is more than able to take on a little more of that task. ",2,20140523152311,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Dealing with a possible rape in my past","I just read an article at the Atlantic (http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/the-misguided-definition-of-rape-as-force/370954/) about only defining rape as ""force"" and how much damage that does. I'm on my period and it makes me want to cry and I'm at work ffs. 

I've talked about this experience briefly before with friends but it's clear I'm still trying to process it because it comes up pretty often in my head. I have this debate about whether or not I was raped. My friends had no hesitation in affirming that I was, but it took me 2 years to really realize that was a possibility. I think the link really rang true because of all the times I haven't said no or fought back when someone was touching me and I didn't want it - it explained perfectly why I would do that. I had to copy paste the story from an email with my friends because i didn't want to retype it.

so, what happened was I was sleeping over at my friend's place.  this was 2 or three years ago. I had gotten pretty high and maybe had a few drinks. I went to sleep in the separate bedroom, and my two friends who were dating went to sleep in their room. now, I had had a couple of threesomes with them before, and everything went well. Let's call them John and Jane Doe.

i'm woken up by John touching me. I'm really confused, but mostly confused because it's just him. had it been him and his girlfriend, it might have been a pleasant surprise. He continues to touch me and I start asking if this is ok with his girlfriend. I'm still about half awake and very woozy. He doesn't answer, so I keep asking. Eventually he says ""Yeah, Jane's on her period,"" which isn't really an answer, but I relax a bit, thinking maybe she gave him permission? I might have said ""OK"" to recognize I had heard that, I'm not sure. I definitely didn't want to do it if she wasn't OK with it, and that wasn't clear, so I was confused. Things went really fast and we had sex. I was laying there like a fish since I was half-asleep. I don't even remember the entire experience coherently. All I know is it lasted about a minute before he stopped and apologized for it being so short. Then he apologized for not wearing a condom (!!) this is what tips me off: i'm not awake enough to ask about that, I'm not awake enough to tell whether he's wearing one or not and I'm like, oh shit, well good thing I'm on birth control. He leaves me to sleep in the wet spot.

I wake up the next day and am mortified. I pretty much know what happened wasn't ok with his girlfriend, but I try to pretend it is. I don't want to confront them about it, so I pretend it never happened, which blows up in my face later.

and i always thought, i didn't say no, i didn't push him off of me, sure he took advantage of me, but it wasn't rape, i sort of gave consent.  what also troubles me is that i didn't say no, but i usually say, well, i wasn't awake enough to know what was going on. and in other situations when i should say ""no"" or ""stop"", i haven't.

I don't know what kind of validation I am looking for, or advice. Just something so I can stop needling myself about whether I didn't do enough, was it really rape, how can I come to terms with the fact that someone I was friends with possibly raped me and probably doesn't think of it that way? He turned out to be a douchebag in several other ways, so I cut off contact. He apologized for jeopardizing our friendship when he told his gf about what happened - and he played it out to her like it was consensual. At the time I said I was ""out of it"", but I believed I gave consent - I think it was too scary to think otherwise? ",0,20140523145400,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26ch55,"Ladies, I give you a new use for cleaning up after your dog.","
Alright Reddit, since I've got new found insomnia sleeping in a different country than my own this past week and also recently falling in love with this subreddit...I've decided to share a story of street harassment of my own.

The setting: one of the biggest cities on the east coast

Late night after work, I quickly walk my dog before bed. At this point in my life I was living on the fringe of an up and coming neighborhood...needless to say, an early twenty something female should be massively aware of her environment if walking alone.

My 70 lbs mutt had just done his business at a small green square off of a main city street. Deciding he needed a bit more walking time before I took him back inside, i headed over to the main avenue since it was better lit. Standing at the corner of  a busy gas station, I had my dog sit and wait patiently for the light to change even though hardly a soul was driving at the moment.

Then, a car suddenly appears speeding to catch the light...or so I thought. The light is still green yet the car immediately stops at the crosswalk at my feet while approaching the intersection. Finding this odd since they have the green light, I look over at the car (a few feet in front of me) to see why this person has stopped (in my mind, for no apparent reason).

With the passenger side door literally right in front of me, I notice the window is down. Thinking the man inside was going to inquire for directions, I look at him to then realize he is locked in a creepy stare directly at me, furiously masturbating. Upon realizing the grotesque nature of why the fuck he was halting his car - I quickly unload a barrage of expletives at him. And without even thinking, throw the bag of shit directly at him, through his open passenger window. And no, it as not tied off yet.

The look on this face was priceless. So much shock, he drove away. Very, very fast. Completely shoo ken up, yet strangely proud of throwing dog feces at a complete stranger was certainly a mixed bag of emotions. But ever since then, I have never let street harassment bring me down, and actually severely enjoy making men deeply regret their ridiculous and insulting actions.I used to walk around with a chip on my shoulder in the city, hoping my bitch face would mark me unapproachable. Until this happened.

TL/DR: I threw dog shit at some fucking stranger exposing himself to me and have strangely gained massive street confidence since. Stand up for yerself, and if you can, hold onto that bag of dog shit until you get to your destination.

EDIT: Whoa! Thank you kind stranger for the gold, was certainly not expecting that as a super reddit newb. You guyyyyys :)

t3_26bxwu,"Got catcalled and almost sexually assaulted today and for some reason I feel fucking horrible about it.","I wasn't sure who else to share this with, I just needed to get it off my chest. I just feel so fucking violated and for some reason embarrassed and ashamed at the same time.

I have a summer internship that I work at two or three days a week, and today I finished my work early and was able to leave early, which was awesome. I love my internship but really need a paying job so I've been applying all over my city, and since I was off work early I thought I'd follow up at a place at an outdoor market that told me they might have an opening.

The market is really cool and actually fairly famous, but the neighborhood it's in has its ups and downs. It's a bit ghetto and sketchy in places, but also contains a ton of historic buildings, some trendy independently owned shops and restaurants, and a gorgeous park that is probably my favorite place in the whole city. It still has a reputation (especially amongst the middle-class white people in my area) for being hood as fuck and completely unsafe, but from my experience 99% of the people there are friendly, cool, and helpful.

Anyway, I stopped at the market, still in my work clothes (a simple business-casual dress and flats) only to find that the hiring manager had left early and I'd have to stop back tomorrow. But it was a gorgeous day, and not too late in the afternoon, so I decided to walk down to the park I mentioned earlier and enjoy the sunshine for a while, then maybe stop at some of the shops in the trendier part of the neighborhood to see if any of them were hiring. 

On my way down to the park, I realized that the street from the market to the park was actually pretty long, and pretty sketchy. Nothing I couldn't handle, but a couple of jackasses started catcalling me as I walked by (one guy said ""hey baby, lemme get a slice of that pie!"" y'know, shit like that). Ugh. I felt a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed, but I decided to ignore them and go enjoy the park, which I did (had a long conversation with a sweet old black lady about Frieda Kahlo, which was unexpected but cool--like I said, 99% of the people in this neighborhood are friendly and awesome) and then wandered down to the shops for a bit. 

As I started the walk back to my car (which was still parked at the market) I realized that I had absolutely no fucking idea where I was. I turned down what I thought was the right street, looked around, realized I still didn't know where I was, lather, rinse, repeat, until I was totally and thoroughly lost, on one of the sketchier side streets of the area. At this point I was a little worried, but I've gotten lost in worse places, so I just pulled out my phone with GPS for directions back to the market. As I walked in the direction it told me to go, I passed another guy, with several friends, who shouted ""mm baby, how much for that?"" 

I'd never felt more uncomfortable, but I just tried to ignore him and kept walking, even though he was still shouting shit at me, and his friends had joined in. At this point I'm near tears, my feet have blisters on them from my flats, I just want to get the fuck back to my car and go home. I get to an intersection where I need to cross the street. As I'm waiting for the light to turn, I glance behind me and this guy and one of his friends had fucking FOLLOWED me to the intersection and were right behind me, still saying sexually explicit things to me. I turned around to just tell them to stop, thinking maybe that would do something, and saw one of the guys reaching out to try and physically grab my ass.

 At that point I literally ran across the street, because fuck the don't walk sign, and walked as fast as possible back towards where my car was. I made it back to my car, happily, but not before getting catcalled by TWO MORE DIFFERENT GUYS.

I got into my car and literally just sat there and cried for probably ten minutes before I felt stable enough to drive home. I'm probably overreacting, I didn't get groped or raped or assaulted, but I feel so fucking violated and somehow also really embarrassed and ashamed, like it was my fault for wearing a dress and makeup in a sketchy area, or just being in that area in the first place. I feel like if I tell anyone then they'll tell me it's my own fault, I just feel so stupid and ashamed and gross and I don't know what to do or if I should even do anything. All I wanted to do was enjoy a cool neighborhood on a Friday afternoon. Why can't I fucking do that without becoming like some fucking sex object that only exists to be objectified? Fuck.

I'm sorry for the long story and the rant. I just needed to tell somebody. Ugh.

EDIT: Wow, coming back to see all this support really, really helped. Thank you all so much for the virtual hugs and reassurances that it's ok to be upset and that I didn't do anything wrong. I think the most annoying part is that I know with absolute certainty in the logical part of my brain that their actions weren't my fault, and yet for some reason I STILL feel angry at myself. I don't know why that is, and it's as confusing to me as it would be to anyone else. 

For people asking why I didn't put them in their place or defend myself, I should explain that I've never been catcalled by so many people in such a short period of time, and I'm not used to being catcalled at all in the first place (I'm from a pretty suburban area). When that sort of thing happens and you're not prepared for it, your head starts racing and so many thoughts and feelings hit at once, and before you can form a coherent sentence in your defense, even if it's just ""fuck you,"" the moment's over and the people are behind you.

Firstly, thanks to everyone who took the time to reply to my post. I was very upset and confused when I wrote it and your kind, honest responses helped me clarify my thoughts and feelings.

Before I wrote the post, I had intended to leave things as they were and assume that the person who assaulted me would be spoken and we would all live happily ever after.

 But, as some of you pointed out, this probably isn't an isolated incident and this person is, to some degree, a threat to the welfare of those around him. I could have been a child or someone else with learning difficulties. That I am neither of those does not detract from the incident, but they were valid points and emphasised the need for me to take this further.

I have emailed the student liaison officers of the college to inform them that I was sexually assaulted on campus and that I expect a meeting to be arranged for me and any appropriate members of staff. I'm going to make it clear that while I don't harbour any bad feelings towards this person, he is clearly a danger to society and should not be left unsupervised as he has proven that he is capable of assault.

I will remind the college of my right to safety and will let them know that I intend to involve the police if this matter isn't taken seriously.

In hindsight I understand that I didn't handle the situation well at all, as some of you pointed out. However, sometimes it's easier said than done. In this situation, I just froze. I was in a blind panic. It was like my brain was begging my body to do something other than just sit there, but I just couldn't.

Anyway, it's done now. I will wait for the college to reply and keep you all updated.

Many thanks again for your kind words and interesting anecdotes and insights.

t3_26bvh4,"Sexism in physics","I understand that this may be a controversial subject for some people so let me explain:

I am a woman studying physics. I found the environment pretty discouraging and for various reasons I dropped out. After gaining more confidence, I am sure that this is the right career for me except for one thing - the sexism.

I'm not usually vocal about my feminist ideas but being in physics again for just a couple of weeks has made me feel like I need to be one of the guys to fit in. It's hard to feel accepted in the culture. I know that I inadvertently created more problems for myself by trying to be an engaged student: I am in a leadership position in the program and now find myself leading a group of young men (women are not active participants in the club) who are happy to doubt my leadership abilities and aptitude in science...

I brought it up but the men I brought it up to didn't seem to know what I was talking about. So I looked up ""physics and sexism"" on google and found this article which explains it perfectly:

http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/2011/07/20/is-it-cold-in-here/

I am really sad that I even need to talk about this. I wish it didn't bother me so much. I want to have some other explanation like I am interpreting this the wrong way and there just aren't enough women in physics but I know that's not true. I can see women shy away from actively participating in the program. I can hear conversations and see behaviour which would make my female friends uncomfortable. I think that the men in my program are uncomfortable talking about it or don't even realise it's a problem and that's why they don't engage in a conversation about it.

But I don't know what to do. My young sister is interested in physics. She could be a physicist one day! But I don't want to tell her the truth of what struggles she would have to go through. Like me, she has self esteem problems. I want her to go into physics but I don't want her to go into my program as it stands right now because I know that she might drop out. I also get sad seeing the women in my program avoid participating, even so much as putting up their hands in class. But most of all, I want to just be myself without fear of needing to change to fit in. I am past being liked at this point. I just want to be respected...

tl;dr: Any suggestions on solutions to improve the physics academic environment for women?

N.B.
I realise that these issues are not limited to woman in physics. Neil Degrasse Tyson can explain this better than I can:

I want to inspire the women in my program to get together and help me do something about it, like building a community.  How do I do that when I rarely ever see the women in my program, and when I do, they don't stick around for long or speak up?  And the other reps aren't aware/willing to acknowledge of the lack of female involvement?  

I thought about going to the faculty about it.  Sadly, I don't know if they can do much...  It seems like my best option atm.  ",32,20140523161610,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26cso3,"Was molested by my stepbrother when he was 13/I was 6. Was that a crime?","Sorry for throwaway. For context, I am 26.

When I was 6, my mom married my stepdad. At the hotel at their wedding, I was put in a room with my two new stepbrothers. I knew them and had played with them before the wedding. The younger of the two fell asleep, but the older of the two, at the time 13 years old, proceeded to do sexual things to me in the dark. I don't remember what, but I remember not liking it. After the wedding, my mom and stepdad moved into a new house together, and my new stepbrothers joined us. The older one started convincing me to join him in the basement for games. Occasionally we'd play Simon Says, but mostly he just wanted me to let him put his penis in my 6-year-old vagina. I, thinking it was a game, allowed him to do it, and was told we weren't allowed to talk about it. One time, the younger stepbrother came downstairs and we immediately pulled our pants back up. I remember never wanting to play that game, and always wanting to go back to Simon Says, but he kept begging me to play the sex game with him. He called it -- and this part I have never told anyone because I absolutely hate the name of the game he came up with and it's hard to even think -- ""wiggle up the bottom."" *Ugh.* This went on for I'm not sure how long, but I guess at least a month.

Anyway, I told a few people (friends, mostly just guys I was seeing seriously) that I was, generally, molested when I was a kid by someone in my family. I didn't say who. I never told anyone in my family about it. At this point, that older stepbrother is married with 2 young sons, living in another state, and they all seem very happy and very nice. And honestly, it didn't really ever bother me as I went through life. I didn't really think about it at all until I started getting interested in guys: I told one of them about what happened (without specifics) and he was bothered for me but told me something along the lines of, ""well, it was only molestation, technically."" Like he was reassuring me. And that's how I heard it, and that's how I viewed it going forward: that it was ""only"" molestation and it was a very insignificant crime, if it even was one.

In October it will have been exactly 20 years since that started. and I was just reading something here this morning which made me think about it again, and really examine the details. And I'm realizing that it actually does bother me a bit, and that what he did to a 6-year-old was pretty fucked up.

But he himself was only 13. Technically still a child. I feel like even if I had told someone, nothing would have come of it since people would assume we were just playing. Sometimes kids explore their sexuality together, I suppose. But fucking goddamn, not FUCKING SIX YEAR OLDS, what the fuck... This is affecting me more than I thought.

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this here. Was it a crime? It doesn't matter. It was 20 years ago. Just, what do I do now? He has his own kids. Should I be concerned for them?

WARNING wall of text!! 

My mom has type 2 diabetes, which she got when I was about 10 years old. She's always been a big lady, I'm not really sure of weight but I would say at her heaviest she was probably about 320 or so pounds. She's probably around 250 or so now. Her unhealthy eating and lack of exercise has lead to her getting diabetes, high blood pressure and sharko foot. Sharko foot has lead to both of her feet being broken in multiple places. Her feet are now both in casts (they have been since January) and the doctors see her staying in casts for a few more months. Eventually she'll go into walking casts, but they doubt she'll ever be cast free. 

How do I stop feeling so frustrated and angry at her for doing this to herself? She continues to eat horribly and not exercise. I came home from teaching English in Korea to take care of her (cook, clean, take care of the dog, go to the doctor's, etc.) and I'm watching as she continues to eat horrible. I feel as if she gave herself the diabetes, and her shitty diet lead to all the horrible complications. 

I do the cooking for supper, but she has her own decision for what she eats in terms of the other meals and snacks. I make fairly balanced meals, but she seems to eat around the vegetables. Some vegetables she'll refuse to eat (like a little kid!) and she'll leave them on her plate. She always asks for me to make potato wedges, and suggests ordering in all the time. The only fruit I see her eat are bananas, and I've never seen her take any other vegetable or fruit for a snack. 

I feel as if she passed on a lot of her shitty eating habits to me. I never saw her eat healthy as a little kid either. Fruits and veggies were always in the house, but usually went bad as we weren't really encouraged to eat them. We ate a lot of her cooking, which was greasy and buttery (but delicious).Other than that, she was an excellent mother that taught my sister and I to work hard and instilled great values in us. 

I'm a healthy weight now (although I was a chubby kid, and am still by no means skinny), I try to eat my fruits and veggies and I go to the gym 4 or so times I week. How do I stop feeling angry at my mom for what she's done to herself? Every time I've hinted about her changing her eating habits, she's gotten angry at me or cried. What do I do, if anything?

I decided to come off the pill a while back due to loss of libido. I spoke to my partner about it before and said I'd be more than okay with a 'happy accident' and if he wasn't up for this then it was up to him to use our condom stock. Well...He didn't take me up on that offer so we've had sex as normal without any contraception. So to me this means he's okay with the idea I may get pregnant.

So I'm late... I spoke to him briefly about maybe taking a test of nothing happens over the next few days and he's told me that he doesn't think we could afford/look after a baby right now.

I'm really hurt as 12 months ago I was also late and he told me he thought I should get an abortion. It's just mixed signals all the time. He always talks about 'when we have kids'  discusses baby names and things he wants to teach our child, then goes and says this when there's a possibility. 

For the record I would not get an abortion. I'd rather chuck his uncommitted Arse out the door, but it makes me feel ashamed that we had unprotected sex when I told him in the beginning the ball is in his court!

I have never told anybody about this so I am kind of nervous but  I guess I just need some perspective and/or some support if something similar happened to you. 

The summer I was 6 or so I went to a day camp at the recreation center in our town. I also had a dance class there at the rec center--I would attend the day camp, then go to the dance lesson--and then sometimes go back to the day camp if my parents couldn't pick me up right after dance. I (f) had a friend (f) who was a bit older than me (probably 8?) Anyway, one day I had gotten out of dance and was to go back to camp after. So I went into the bathroom to change back into my regular clothes to go back to camp that day. 

While I was in the bathroom, it turned out my friend was in there in the big stall. She invited me to change in there with her (I remember all us little girls had no trepidation about going to the bathroom together, etc. weird I know.) 

This is where my memory gets a little hazy... I spent the rest of my childhood trying to forget it due to the shame/embarrassment. I remember I was just trying to change out of my leotard into my day clothes and my friend suggested I stay naked. I didn't really know why but I did, and she took her clothes off too. I remember her saying we are going to play ""mommy and daddy"" and she was going to be the mommy. I was pretty clueless but I remember being pissed that I had to be the boy. But I didn't know why were naked or what was really happening... she told me that mom's and dad's have sex and that's what we were going to do. I still didn't really know what that was so I was shocked when she started rubbing her crotch on mine. I was super uncomfortable and I do remember trying to put some toilet paper in between us but she took it off and said that wasn't right. 

I can't really remember much else after that. This only happened one time and I guess I didn't really know what to make of this experience. I did feel so embarrassed and ashamed every time I thought about this but I am not sure if this counts as being molested or not? Do little girls molest other little girls? I am not sure what to think.

I thought this might be a better place than relationships/relationship advice seeing as I'm not interested in anyone at the moment and aren't looking for anyone, it's more about me.

* I'm 20, female, British
* I've lost 2 stone in the last year and am now a healthy weight
* I rarely get male attention
* I've had a rough few months and have been depressed and pretty much every aspect of my life has changed in the last year
* Things still keep going wrong and it seems like I'll never be happy and nothing will go right
* My first boyfriend ended up nearly abusing me and pretty much threatened to sexually assault/rape me so I left him. I was with him for just under 3 years. 
* After leaving him my sex drive was low and I struggled at the idea of trusting guys to be intimate with me
* A male friend who I thought was the nicest guy in the world told me that he liked me. He was very inexperienced. We got quite far quite soon. But then he kept changing his mind then dumped me. I felt kinda used and the reasons he gave for not liking me lowered my confidence.
* Other things that he and others have said have knocked my confidence. Plus they said that I'm the opposite of all the things that I'm happy about myself - personality and physically. So now there's nothing I like about myself
* I'm a nervous wreck. I'm scared that guys will either say they like me then use me and dump me ... or if they stick around, they'll turn out to be like my first boyfriend. 
* I have even less interest in sex than the time between seeing those two guys. But I just want someone to love me. But who wants to love a nervous wreck especially one that there's nothing to like about? I feel unlovable. 
* Before when I've been single I've not had much confidence/hope, but now I've got virtually none. And before there were things I liked about myself, that I hoped guys would see in me and like.

I have no idea what advice/support anyone can give me. Maybe one of you has felt this way before. I hope someone has something to say that helps. It's a bit of a getting things off my chest post. I've been to counselling about all of my problems including the way my first boyfriend treated me and its just made me feel worse about everything.

I was at work when a former coworker came in, and we got to talking and he invited me to hang with him and three or four other mutual friends that we shared.  I accepted, and was expecting to catch a movie with him and three other girlfriends of mine.  He texted me later that night and said that none of them could come, so I suggested that we go to a house party that was going on instead.  *I found out later that he actually already knew none of them would be able at the time that he invited me to hang out with all of them...the first thing that pissed me off about that night.*

This is where the trouble began.  Let me preface this by stating that we previously had a strictly friend based relationship- I never so much as flirted with the guy, and never indicated I was looking for anything sexual.  So we go to the party together and because I knew and trusted everyone there, I got shitfaced.  I hadn't been that drunk all year, and ended up puking into the toilet and unknown amount of times.  I remeber him looking in once or twice while I was puking and asking if I was okay, but that was about it.  Next thing I know I've somehow made it to a bedroom (I believe he carried me) and we are lying in bed together.  I was feeling incredibly dizzy and ill, so I didn't mind this.  I finally get to bed, and wake up to him feeling me up/kissing me.  This is not okay. I was asleep, and had given no indications that I wanted anything sexual from him previously.  However- I get turned on.  I consider myself a very sexual person, especially when drunk.  I admit that when he first started feeling me up I was very confused as to what was happening, but after a while I was participating in the acts.  To further complicate things, I never said no or asked him to stop, and willingly gave him a blowjob.  I am so confused as to whether I can even feel upset over this.  I never want to be the girl that gets drunk and sleeps with someone, and then regrets it the next morning and blames the other person.  To be fair, he had been drinking as well (but was no where near as drunk). 

I just want to hear others input on this.  Should I be upset about it?  I feel unjustified due to the fact I never actually asked him to stop and he could have interpreted my involvement as everything being a-okay.  But at the same time, he knew I was far more intoxicated than him and never asked it it was okay. Please give me your opinions, I just want this off my chest and hear what others think about it because I have received mixed comments from a few friends.

I just completed four months of prophylactic aciclovir - it was lovely, four months of feeling confident and secure and smiling, a week after I have finished, its back. I'm in agony and I'm exhausted and dreading the summer months already.

Other people who have the same issue, what are your hacks? What treatments/vitamins whatever, have made the occurrences lessen, and made them shorter.

The only suggestion I've had so far is using saltwater to dry it out seems to make it go quicker...

However, ever since we moved in, I can't sleep without him.

I generally consider myself independent, feminist, etc, would do just fine without a man, etc, but it's really late for me and I am tired and upset because my man is out.

When he's going away for a while, it's no problem- I just make an effort to have an extra relaxing evening before going to bed. And when I go away without him, I generally have no problem getting to sleep on my own anywhere outside of our home.

The problem comes in with spontaneous nights out. Tonight we were with friends, and some of our group split off. I was feeing a little unwell and decided to use the opportunity to head home and get to bed early, he was going to go on to the next bar. I had in my head that it would only be an hour or so; it's about four hours later now. He's posting on social media about how much fun he's having with his friend. 

I feel like it's too late at night and I'm too tired to control my emotions. I'm PISSED at him for leaving me alone in this insomnia. It feels like I'm paying the price for his night out (I never sleep in and physically can't, so I will feel awful tomorrow) without any of the fun. At the same time, though, it feels like I don't have the right to ask him to give up going out with friends at night. I'm a homebody and it's not his fault that my nervous system is screwed up like this.

Am I the only one dealing with this? What's wrong with me? What conversations should I be having with him about this?",2,20140524044841,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I'm 18, and live about 500 miles from home due to college, This Memorial Day weekend, I'd had to travel back to my hometown to participate in a trial. The trial to try and find my rapist guilty of raping me five years ago.

Yes, five years. Which made me 13 at the time. I don't much like talking about it, but I'll give you a small run down.

I went to a little get together with my big sister and friend. None of us were drinking any type of alcohol. But I guess I hadn't been watching my drink close enough. I started to feel extremely sick and went outside with my friend, who then ran back inside to get my sister. The last thing I remember is getting grabbed.

Fast forward five years. I get a call, and it's the court system. Apparently, it took the hospital and police 5 years to put the rape kit through, get the information, and finally tell someone (thanks guys). And they found the guy who did it. He was one of my best friends. So I fly down for the trial and he's finally found guilty.

I'll be honest, I thought seeing him would be a major trigger, but it was actually more closure. Yeah, I felt threatened and scared, but after the case was finished and he was gone, I sat down and cried. Cried in relief that he was finally gone, there was no more threat of that same man coming back, and I'm finally rid of the grief I'd been carrying for five years. 

Sitting down in my old room, I was thinking about it and I thought of you guys and thought it would be a good area to place this story.

So, no big deal, I figured -- there's a machine in all the women's bathrooms for 10-cent tampons. But after trying to stick a dime in the slot for probably a full two minutes (it was as if the slot was blocked, but there's was no ""out of order"" or ""empty"" sign), I gave up and head to the other bathroom, where the tampon machine does have an ""out of order sign.""

It brought back teenage memories of desperately trying to stick a quarter in those weird crank machines and failing, or realizing with dismay that there isn't one in a bathroom at all -- if I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure my ALL-GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL didn't have tampon machines in the bathrooms.

Because I never could figure those machines out, over time I just got used to always being prepared, or being comfortable with just asking a friend for one. I Googled ""how to use tampon machine"" today, and there's nothing but videos of young girls being confused and message board posts with a bunch of ""Hm, I dunno, never use em"" replies.

What the hell?! Isn't this the equivalent of a men's bathroom without a urinal? I'm guessing these shitty machines are never addressed because women don't feel comfortable complaining about them to management.

So yesterday I decided to go running because I'm out of shape and I'd like to be in shape. I jogged out of my driveway and happened upon a flock of 12 year old girls walking along my sidewalk. I jogged to the side as close to the grass as I could. I mis-judged my footing and tripped on the sidewalks edge a little bit. Of course I tripped and whispered ""whoops!"" right as the girls were passing me.





They started laughing and snickering at me. As I fast-walked away I heard them talking about how funny I looked as I fell. I turned around to look at them and one of them was doing an exaggerated fall on the sidewalk. I almost ALMOST said something. One of them looks back at me and says ""OMG she's looking at us"". 




Who the heck is teaching these girls respect anymore? Whatever happened to empathy? If someone had tripped in front of me I would have at least asked if they were ok or something polite instead of being a bully about it.

Hi TwoX, sorry for this wall of text and any errors due to being on mobile but I just need some help. A couple days ago, I was looking on my bf's computer and noticed his Facebook was up. I looked to see who he was recently chatting with and saw a girl's name I had not heard him mention before. Their chat was full of sexually explicit things (sexual talk, telling each other how good the other one looked, all that fun shit). I was immediately in shock mode and all of these scenarios ran through my mind. When he got home, I confronted him. He sat me down and told me that this was a girl he had met online when he was 18 (he's 26), never in person, and was never intending to meet her. He said it was a moment of nostalgia and a narcissistic need to build up his low self esteem, that it was nice to feel that someone else found him attractive. It was not an ongoing online relationship and had only happened that night. He also said that, after immediately typing all of that out to her, he felt horrible and guilty and was intending to never talk to her again. He realized that he's not an 18 year old guy anymore and actually has someone who truly cares about him. He was upfront about everything, answered all my questions, never pushed blame solely on her or turned it around on me, assured me that he had never physically cheated on me or spoke with other girls online like this, and blocked her on everything. He kept telling me that I'm the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with, that I'm perfect, I'm ""it"" for him, and he's going to do whatever it takes to build my trust back up. It seems like he truly feels awful and terrified that he's on the verge of losing me.
I know this would not be considered by some to be cheating and is not as terrible as many of the stories on this sub, but it still feels like betrayal. This is exacerbated by the fact that he knew I had been cheated on before and that I struggle with self esteem and trust issues. I had completely trusted him and he's been nothing but amazing. He does everything for my daughter and I, we have an active sex life, has been supportive of me through everything and every day has always made me feel loved and beautiful. This is the man I want to share my life with, we have a home together, and the thought of not having him seems worse than this. Yet there's still something in the back of my mind telling me that if he truly loved me he wouldn't have hurt me like this, that I don't deserve this and deserve someone who would not even think about doing this to me. I'm still hurt and having a hard time coping. Even though I've been going back and forth, I think ultimately want to fix this and not throw away what we have. I guess what I want from this community are similar stories, advice, and people to tell me how I can move on from this and fix our relationship. ",11,20140524083742,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26e9qz,"[TW:disordered eating] Chasing perfection has brought me to this point","The internet is full of rants like this. I hope you forgive me for posting it anyway. My mother is coming to see me (we haven't seen each other for a long time) and I am getting a mild panic attack.  There is no one I can talk to about this and I really need to get this off my chest. 

I'm in my early 20s, but I feel like I am 70. There are days when I can barely manage to drag myself out of bed, because I am exhausted. My periods are a mess. I'm deficient in nutrients. My hair has fallen out. My teeth are covered in stomach acid burns. 

For the past 12 years, I've been chasing what our society calls “the perfect female body”. I received excellent instructions in this deadly game from my mother, who never hesitated to explain to me in great detail how hard life is for a fat woman in our society. Food was about humiliation and shame, every meal, every day, every week. I will never forget how once, when at a relative's house, I asked permission to have one more serving of chicken, she looked at me with a face of utter disgust and told me that I've had more than enough. 

 At age 10 we were counting calories together, drinking protein shakes and exercising every day. Then on the weekends she would get a fit of guilt and bake huge amounts of sweets and cakes and, I, of course would gobble them up. 
By high school, I was obese by all standards. The school nurse and doctor would routinely sigh when looking at my charts and give me weight loss pamplets. At home, whenever I bloated out of yet another dress size, my mother would scream, force me to take off my clothes and exercise while she supervised me. 

Fast forward a few years and I discovered bingeing and purging. For the first time in years, my weight plumetted. My mother was elated. Doctors applauded me for finally being a normal size. I smiled and nodded, thinking to myself “If only all of you knew, how I got here”.
But along with the weight, I lost my mental health. I was always paranoid of blocking the sink or clogging the drains. Once, after being forced to eat dinner, I took a walk outside and purged in the snow, hoping that no one would hear me.   My hair fell out and I would spend sleepless nights staring at the ceiling, because my chest hurt from vomiting. I had no energy to focus on my school work and nearly failed high school. On the day of my graduation, I was too weak and ashamed to get out of bed. So my mother bought me cake, which I ate and purged alone. 

I clung to the hope that things would get better once I go to college, but the constant threat of becoming fat did not go away. Before leaving me at my dorm, my mother bought me a scale and told me not to gain weight. I did anyway. The academic stress and pressure caused my to gain a dress size. My mother pursed her lips when I came home for Christmas break and told me, “You were so thin when you graduated high school.” If only she knew what losing that weight had cost me. 

I returned to college for my sophomore year and began exercising multiple times a day and eating as little as I could get by on. At nights, when the cravings kicked in, I ran to ACME and binged on unspeakable amounts of food. I knew by heart all of the secluded bathrooms in the school buildings where no one would hear me binge. By now, spells of dizziness and entire days spent in bed exhausted from exercise where the norm. I began skipping classes to binge and purge. Along with all this madness, came an endless cycle of stress injuries from sports. But I just couldn't stay away from the college gym, where girls with perfect bodies and smiling boyfriends ran on the treadmill while watching the Barefoot Contessa stir chocolate sauce on the Food Network (another masochistic perversion). Again, my mother carted me to one doctor after another ( because, gasp, I would gain so much weight if I couldn't continue exercising). I was told weight loss might help. Sure, I said. Sure. 

Now, I wake up every day feeling tired. When I get up my heart races and my head feels dizzy. I spend hours at the supermarket staring at food labels. Have I been good enough to deserve this amount of calories today? Should I? Should I not? I don't have many friends, because friends mean eating out and I can't do that. I sometimes find blood clots in my spit, my teeth have dark stains and my periods are completely out of whack. Everything I eat causes digestive problems; gas, bloating, nasty burps and diarrhea. I don't want to go to the doctor's anymore, because I am not “thin enough” to have an eating disorder. I am usually told that losing weight will solve all of my problems. Indeed. 

I just wish that no little girl would have to grow up to be me; the 20 year old woman, with a frail worn-out body. But I know that's not true. One everning when I was at ACME stuffing my basket with cookies, I heard a little girl, no more than 10 or 11, walking in the aisle with her mother. She was happily rattling off the calories of every product on the shelf. “We won't eat this, because it's got X amount of calories, right mommy?” And the mother nodded. I stood in the aisle long after they left, still staring at the cookies and crying.

t3_26dyaw,"Trying To Face My Past and Living With PTSD, I Found This And It Made Me Want To Vomit [TW: Sexual Abuse]","I was sexually abused as a child by this man. He was an older teen at the time.

I'm constantly trying to live a normal life, and recently I found the courage to tell my brother what happened to me. I didn't say who, but I did say that I was about 7 (It's hard to be precise with no one else to confirm details like this). My family has known for a long time that I have secrets, I started displaying severe PTSD symptoms around 13-14 and was diagnosed at 17. My understanding is that they believe whatever happened to me, happened around the time I started going off the rails, and I let them believe whatever they want to. It's easier that way. I have so many repressed memories that even I am unable to say exactly what happened. Sometimes I wonder if my brain made the whole thing up. But then why do I have these horrifying fragmented memories? Why do I leave the room when his name is brought up in conversation? Why is it so difficult to speak of aloud and on the very few occasions I have, my tears were uncontrollable?

So I'm trying to find out where he has ended up, if he is in jail, what part of the country, etc. Mostly hoping that he is safely in jail. Wondering if he's hurt anyone else.

I found an online article about a crime I knew he had committed, it is not recent, and it's so sympathetic it made me feel physically ill and I wanted to share my frustration. He tried to hold up a store with a syringe filled with blood. He went to jail for it, and this article talks about how he was 'sent away to live with his grandparents' and 'rejected by family'. Sob stories.

Yes, he was raised by grandparents. Who were strict but loving. He displayed disturbing behaviour from a young age, including tricking my brother into getting in a toybox, locking him inside and leaving him there. For fun.

He was into drugs and petty crime as soon as he was old enough to sneak out. He stole from his grandparents and staged burglaries and sold their possessions.

The family tried to help him. He went and stayed with other relatives in a different area to get him away from the criminals he hung out with. He found new ones instead. Throughout, drugs and crime were a common theme.

Eventually he went back to the grandparents. The behaviour continued. He would taunt his elderly grandmother, pulling faces, mouthing things behind his grandfathers head and denying he was doing anything. She became incredibly distressed and became very thin and unwell. He never once showed any remorse for any actions. Although once he was seen to gift some very angry male relatives a bottle of whiskey at a family christmas to sweeten them up.

Eventually, extended family deemed him beyond help and dangerous to the grandmothers health. He was sent away and told not come back unless he changed his ways and became a productive member of society. That was in the early 00's.

Reading this article, and seeing all the 'he never had a chance' bullshit absolutely sickens me. He had every chance and wasn't interested. All he ever wanted to do was have his fun at the expense of others. You could tell he enjoyed it, got off on it. You could see it in his eyes.

How do you deal with it when someone you know and see only as a monster, is treated so sympathetically? How can some lame-ass online 'journalist' write a biased article being soft on some guy who pulls out a syringe full of his own blood on a retail worker? Oh he wanted cash to 'get away', did he? Bull fucking shit. He wanted more drugs.

I need a hug and a stiff drink. This article has really upset me, even if it is 9 years old.

I am away on business (my job requires weekly travel), and my collegues and I decided to end a long day with a drink. A (male) friend of mine (let's call him X) shot me a text saying he was also in town, so of course I invite him along.

After bar closure we decide pizza and drinks at the hotel would be a fun way to prolong the evening, which was going fantastically. We have a few local friends over for a slice and some laughs. X says he needs to get going because his flight home was in the morning. I thought it was also time I hit the hay as the long day and the alcohol was kicking in. So we leave my collegue's room together. I was just down the hall and as I go for the hug goodbye, X lunges in for the kiss.

I was stunned, in shock, then pushed him away saying ""This is NOT okay."" I was oddly calm at first, then a fiery anger took hold of me. ""What the hell do you think you're doing? What makes you think this is okay?"" Then the aftershock of tears poured out ""What the hell man? You're my friend! You can't just do that! I have a boyfriend! You KNOW my boyfriend! What the hell am I supposed to tell him now??"" Then I took a step back and tried reasonning it out. ""Listen I think you're a great guy but I'm in a relationship that I am not willing to compromise..""

In the mean time X look guilt-ridden and blubbers out ""I'm so incredibly in love with you. I just.. I want you so bad. I'm sorry... I'm really sorry.... you're so incredible and mean the world to me and please don't be upset I'm sorry.....""

I told him I couldn't deal with this right now and needed time to deal with what had just happened.

This morning I feel stupid. I knew this guy had some attraction to me as it had been mentionned in the past ""Your boyfriend is a lucky man, you're such a catch. I envy him."" Etc etc. I feel like I should have had a bigger guard up. I feel betrayed from a friend; He made a move I was not okay with, without my permission. I feel loss at our friendship as I don't know if I'll ever be able to face him alone (and we had been close friends). I feel anger at him crossing the line. I feel guilt at having betrayed my boyfriend, whether you consider it my fault or not. I feel sadness at not being able to provide my friend with the love he direly wants (as odd as it sounds, I feel bad for him, and he just got out of an abusive relationship). In an alternate reality we may have ended up together; He is someone I really care about and he was good to me as I was to him, but I have been in a long term relationship as long as we have known eachother. And I had drawn the line very clearly in the past because I am in love with my boyfriend and I would do anything to protect the relationship, but a side of me can't blame X for wondering the ""what ifs"" because I had thought about it too; I just never dreamed of acting on it. (Rereading this paragraph I realize it's all over the place but honestly I don't know how to make heads or tails of these thoughts and it's hard to word them out.)

I called my boyfriend and he took it like a champ. He is happy I stood my ground and makes nothing more of it that I had the oppertunity to cheat on him and did not take it. Although I appreciate his non-chalance and his support, I am still in a turmoil of emotions.

Sorry for the wall of text TwoX, but I need someone to help talk me through what I should be feeling and handling this situation. I feel anger, loss, sadness, hurt, betrayal, filthy, guilty, gross and confused.

t3_26dtbw,"Let me know what you think of my poem, reddit :)","Hey reddit!

I wrote this poem a while back and was curious how it would be received by others. I'm no actual poet by any means, but when inspired, I do occasionally love to write poetry and other forms of creative writing.

This poem is dedicated to my current boyfriend, and it describes the process of falling in love again after having been in love before, somewhat soon after ending another serious relationship with the man I used to think I loved. 

Because I am a dancer and have a serious passion for movement and music, I compare the two relationships to songs and note their similarities. This was inspired by the fact that at many points in my current relationship, I couldn't help but be intrigued by some of the things that both men did.

This poem was inspired by a single moment when I experienced a relationship ""deja vu"". I was sitting at a restaurant with my current boyfriend, realizing that exactly a year ago, for the exact same event (after my ballet show), I was there with my ex, and I experienced a sudden revelation of how lucky I was to have moved on from the pain of that relationship and promptly into another with a man I never could have even imagined existed. I realized what a better place I am in my life and how happy I was to learn that there was a rainbow at the end of that storm in my life.

I noticed striking similarities between my ex and my current boyfriend, but also discuss the important differences that explain why my current relationship has been so incredibly wonderful. As I describe in the poem, it's just like the moment when you hear a song you LOVE for the first time, and cannot stop listening to it. Suddenly, any other song you hear pales by comparison, and your whole world is changed from the beauty of this song. 

Enjoy!









And here we go again...

The sweetest deja vu you'll ever taste

Broken record? Almost, but not a note goes to waste

The most beautiful sound I forgot could be true;

The melody begins again, don't I know this tune?




You see, I've heard this song a few times before...



Danced in its glory, even begging for more

But little did I know as a queen (yet to) bee

That old song wasn't quite right, no, just wasn't the one for me



And now I'm sitting here with that devilish smile, for a reason you might never know


How I once sat here rocking to a different beat, right here, just a year ago


And the sweet sound beings again, different notes, but a similar beat

Without thinking, I let my body dictate the course of movement it craves to meet


You said you didn't like to dance, but with a dose of my venom, here you are

Dancing with me like there's no tomorrow

I never dreamt we could make it this far


Many of the old notes repeat, but now, it just feels so right

I may not be a synesthesiac, but your words taste unbearably bright


And every time the song progresses, 

The beat carries on, the notes repeat

But this song is different, 

since I have yet to grow tired of the sounds you bring to my feet


Most songs run their course, they have their hey day, 'til the DJ finds something new...

But your song to me is immortal, 

forever spontaneous,

I'm posting because for the first time in like 7 years I'm considering dropping the birth control pill. I was having a conversation with my bf,  telling him about the dryness that it caused my eyes and how expensive it is(I graduated, so no more school insurance). He then said that he didn't mind wearing condoms from now on. Since we found the right brand /size for him,  we've been using them every time I forget a pill or I'm on my period. 

I guess I'm just nervous about stopping after so long. I was hoping to hear how women felt about using only condoms as their main method of contraception with their SOs. What are the pros and cons?

t3_26difh,"22[F] about to make a huge mistake leaving her 23[M] and I want to help her stop before its too late!","So my friend is having boy troubles and, as a man, I don't know what to tell her.  From all my experiences with them, he always seemed like a really nice guy.  He is the best boyfriend.  I don't really like to go into *why* he's a nice boyfriend because the list goes on.  Really just a good dude.

Now for my friend.  She's fickle, whimsical, unnerved easily, and insecure.  I know her very well.  She likes to sleep with random guys on the weekends (when shes single) and she likes to... ahem... party.  Shes sexually liberated (which I love ;)) and she is a really fun girl but has her own issues too.  Anyways, here's the issue.

Her boyfriend is currently taking classes at the uni near where we both lived.  My friend, let's call her Claire, already graduated but is younger than the guy.  She's now studying for her CPA test and concurrently getting experience at her firm.  She's really growing into her own fast.  The guy on the other hand, lets call him Dave, is younger than her and still going to school.

Claire's parents are always making this fact known to her on a constant basis.  Everytime she calls them up now, it seems, they always argue about her boyfriend still trying to figure out what he wants to do in life -- which is totally not true, he's just juggling full time work, a kid, and school all at once while trying to hold down a relationship (and by the way hes doing an amazing job).

Anyways, shes ready to leave him.  Says he's a deadbeat, this and that, says he's going nowhere.  I keep telling her ""That's your parents' insecurity talking"" and that she should ""look at it through her own lense"" (Because she's a photographer too, get it? i thought it was clever).

She's never had problems with the guy before and she really loves his kid.  He likes her a lot and confided in me that he wanted to marry her and that he's currently saving up for a ring.  I personally thought it was a bad idea on his part because there is so much about her he still doesn't know but hey, who am I to judge?  He probably knows her way more than I think he does.  So you can imagine my issue with her decision to leave him.  I want them to be together because I know he is the only one who can... ahem... take care of her.  And also he's just a really good dude and as far as I know, has done nothing but been the best boyfriend.

So I turn to you, ladies (and gents), What do I tell my friend Claire in order for her to understand her terrible decision?",0,20140524084536,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I always though feminists were women who didnt shave their armpits, hated men and were possibly lesbians. I even thought feminism was shameful. Now I see that my feelings weren't my own fault but they were caused by the world. I was taught that I should sit down in my box and keep my mouth shut.
Last year I had a class, ironically it was with a professor I absolutely hated. It was Women's History Month and he was telling us about a poetry reading we should attend. He asked this class ""who here considers themselves a feminist?"". NOBODY raised their hand except for him. The class was about 10 females and 20 males. He was shocked that not even the girls raised their hands. 
He explained feminism in a way that I had never heard it before. He said he was a feminist because he wanted women to be treated as equals to men. He wanted them to have equal pay. He was deeply offended by slut shaming and stereotypes. He wanted women to be able to go out and have a career and not feel guilty about it. 
Once he said all that, I knew I was a feminist. I wanted a family and a husband, but I also wanted a career and I did not want a minivan. Nobody could make me feel bad about that!",48,20140524181803,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Unfortunately, there seem to be a few people in some communities who have started taking some pills of a certain high-wavelength color. this has manifested as discussion about how men have are evolved to work and compete, while women are naturally programmed to be subservient, and other, similar things that you expect to see from that ideology. Luckily, the general community response typically varies from ""no, you're wrong, and here's why"" and a few people becoming involved in a gigantic flamewar with the pill swallower, to an overwhelming ""take you bigotry and GTFO"".

Suddenly, I've gone from ""Almost never gets hit on"" to, ""If I'm not mean about saying no, they will keep trying."" I grew up fat. I was always fat. Now, I feel like I'm ill equipped to handle aggressive men. I'm an extremely social person. I make friends like it's my job. Still, when it comes to getting hit on by a guy aggressively, I freeze up bad. 

A few days ago at work (retail), we had a guy who looked to be in his 70's come in (I'm 26). He immediately started to lightly flirt with me. Ok, cool. Old guys hit on me all the time and I flirt back a bit and humor them, mostly because I almost always never took them seriously. Well things quickly turned wrong. He started getting really explicit and nasty. At this point I froze up. Suddenly I wasn't talking much, because I didn't know what to say. 

He took that as an insult I guess, and he got mad and started telling me I needed a boob job, as well as several other mean things about my body. At that point, I got overwhelmingly anxious, and didn't say a word. I was frantically trying to think of how I could get this guy off my back without being rude and losing my job. Finally, as he escalated, I ended up just turning around and walking away while he was in mid-sentence. I then sat in the back and listened to him asking one of my co-workers what time I got off. Thankfully, she lied.

This has never happened to me to this extent before, but it happens to a lesser degree quite often. When I was fat, I used to feel ""lucky"" to be hit on by anyone. If I wasn't interested in a guy back then, saying ""Oh, I'm sorry, you are great and all, but I have a boyfriend""  would make them go away. Now when I say that, many guys keep trying.

I've been living at home since I moved back after getting my Masters and their place has been mostly a welcoming refuge. 

Last night however, my professor friend went to bed early. I and her husband were finishing out drinks in the kitchen. He is like an older brother to me. We were talking about I don't even remember what and he comes out with ""So, why have you gotten fat?""

To have him say something like this, even though I don't think he meant to hurt me, was like a confirmation that I am indeed as disgusting looking as I thought.

I wanted to leave on the spot but I had had a few drinks and had already planned to stay at their house in the guest room. He started asking why I let myself get so fat, what my hangup was, etc etc. I just felt totally ambushed. I wanted to die and have the earth swallow me up.

Well, I never had....before last night. My day started out like a typical Saturday. Wake up early, head into work all day... It was around 1pm when my emotions decided to reign down like the new age apocalypse right in the middle of the testosterone fest that is the break room. Stemming from some texts from my boyfriend, every sense within me was heightened, angry, frustrated and hurt. I began crying. But, not just crying - I was sobbing. Where is the freaking life boat?! Someone save me from my own tears.

A few hours later, I hadn't heard from my boyfriend much more. He was having a busy day, while I was slow at work. What happened? More tears. ""Why doesn't he love me??!? Doesn't he want to talk to me?? Does he even like me anymore.... maybe he is planning on breaking up with me.""

I get home from work, climb into my bed and cry until it hurts. Then I wipe my nose, and head out for a 10 mile bike jaunt around the neighborhood. Cruising past houses lit up by a busy kitchen, or men returning home from work to happy wives, I started crying again. ""Will I ever have happiness like that? I just want to be a happy wife... I was a want happy... What if I never have a happy life? Am I doomed to hell forever?""

Back home. I made a stop at the grocery store and picked up a pint of Ben and Jerry's to try and soothe my hurting soul. I can't say the ribbons of fudge or marshmallowy chocolate ice cream helped at all. The taste felt raw and meaningless in my mouth. Netflix loaded up, I seduced myself with an 80's flick 'Terms of Endearment', ate my ice cream, and quickly drew bored before shutting off the computer, lights, and brain.

I think it was 2 hours of tossing and turning before I finally fell asleep. This is all mixed between tears, and tears, and more tears. I pondered the questions of: Why does my boyfriend not like me? Why am I doomed to a life of shit? and When will things ever change? None of which are questions I would ever consider in my right brain. 

I remember at one point, my boyfriend sent me a one word text. I believe it was a simple ""lol""...I read it and instantly burst into tears. WHY DOESNT HE WANT TO TALK TO ME?! I let the anger surge through my veins before my exhausted eyes decided to put the phone away for the night and attempt sleep.

Then he gave me a scarf and said ""I imagined you'd look good in this scarf. My imagination is rarely wrong"". At this point I felt totally creeped out and disgusted, but I sorta just smiled and nodded politely. Maybe he was just being a sentimental old man right?


He drives me home a lot, because I live on the same route he takes, and we work the same hours. So on the last day, he asked to drive me home again. I was kinda feeling iffy about it, because of what happened earlier, so I tried to stall by saying goodbye to everyone. He waited almost 45 minutes, after I kept telling him it's okay, I can just take the bus. So I pretty much had to get in his car. 


We made small talk, and he asked me what I was going to do that night. I told him I was going to play Age of Empires with my best friend, and his response was ""... I wish I could be there, but oh well..."" I went home and I tried so hard to tell myself that he was just a sentimental old man and didn't have any creepy intentions, but in the back of my head I knew something was wrong. I broke down and cried to my boyfriend for like an hour. I'm so glad he didn't do anything physical in the car. thinking back, I shouldn't have accepted that ride with him. 


I actually feel so grossed out and violated. My entire 4 month work term just feels wrong now, if I think about him thinking whatever thoughts about me.

And then I was talking to a classmate who was also working in a similar job, and a 30 year old married coworker kept asking her if she would date him if he wasn't married. 


These sort of unwelcome advances are more common than people think, especially in fields like engineering or computer science. It's so sad that young women who go into these fields have to put up with this shit from older coworkers or bosses, and can't do anything about it. Often people talk about physical sexual harassment and rape, but sexually implied verbal harassment hurts too. It makes you feel violated and dirty. I tell my male friends about this, and they're all so surprised that these things happen. They'll rarely experience a female boss hitting on them or a unwelcome female coworker grabbing their crotch. It's very unfortunate that women have to deal with this shit. ",16,20140525105233,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26gt3x,"Need advice on how to help my cousin.","A little background: we were born 5 months apart and spent the majority of our childhood together. My parents spent every single weekend at her parents house and we were pretty much sisters up until 14 years of age. (She also spent a good deal of her freshman year of HS in and out of mental wards, although hospitalization was probably overkill on her parents part.) Her parents went through a wicked divorce that caused a rift in the family and her and I ended up fighting over a guy and not speaking to each other for three years. We have since reconnected in a big way, we talk all the time on the phone and we see each other during the summer. The problem is, she lives in Hawaii and I live on the East Coast. 

Now for what happened. I got a couple of texts from her this morning that scared the shit out of me. ""I'm in a bad way, I just want you to know I love you, thank you for being there for me."" There is a huge time difference so it was 6am her time when I got these texts. I didn't want to wake her up so I just waited and she texted me about an hour ago. Apparently she got into a drunken fight with her boyfriend last night and yelled and hit him and according to her ""acted like a psycho.""  She doesn't know where her and her boyfriend stand. I suggested therapy but she doesn't want that. Right now she is just really depressed. ""I'm a horrible person, I wish I could crawl into a hole a die,  nothing I can do to fix it, I wish it had never happened..."" etc etc. I've been trying just to talk her down and tell her that she isn't a horrible person and that even good people make mistakes. Other than that, I have no idea how to help her. And I know she needs help. Hitting your SO isn't okay, no matter what the circumstances are. Being drunk is no excuse. She doesn't want to break up with her boyfriend and it seems like he doesn't want to break up either. 

I love this girl and I want to do anything I can to help her, which obviously isn't much because I'm so far away. Normally I'm good with advice but I'm at a total loss here. Anyone with experience have any advice on how I can help her?",13,20140525145626,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26gbtg,"Badgering someone into sex... consensual but kinda icky, or non-consent, or...?","This is sorta complicated, but basically my ex-boyfriend and I have a history where we've tried being friends, FWB, then friends again, and whatever. Last month I explicitly told him that we weren't going to have sex ever again. The next time I saw him and we hung out, he spent most of the time asking me over and over and over to make out with him/have sex. I told him no each time, until finally I caved in. 

He's actually done this many times, where I'll say no and he'll keep asking until finally I just give in. But each time I feel really reluctant/uncomfortable/gross afterward. I'm trying to figure out, in my own head, whether I should be angry at myself for caving in (which is weirdish because I cave in because I feel guilty for saying no), or if I'm just overreacting, or what.

I guess my question is, if someone consistently badgers you by asking you to have sex with them over and over, how would you define that experience consent-wise (from a moral, not legal standpoint)? ",11,20140525112449,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

  He's always been creepy, talking about which days you had off that week, what color shirt you were wearing the other day, etceterA. But lately, oh lately he's been stepping up his creep game and pushing his creep boundaries. Standing almost completely on the line asking the new girl when she's getting off, making drinks and asking the cashier girls to try it- walking around the restaurant looking for us on out breaks and touching a coworkers back last night.

   Management has, on several occasions told him he's not allowed to talk to us on our breaks, much less come find us to do so. They're all aware of his recent behavior but do nothing about it other than say ""no Glenn"" our general manager is tired of talking to him and is hardly ever around even if he would do something about it. Glenn doesn't bother the assistant managers and they're apathetic about his behavior.

How can I be more assertive in conveying non-interest?","So, I'll start this off by saying that the reasoning behind this post is that I was browsing r/foreveralonewomen while thinking about my utter lack of previous experience with men. I'm only 20, so of course I'm still hopeful, but I sometimes use that browsing time as a time to reflect upon things I could have done differently - not negatively, just so that I will remember them in the future.

In this context, I remembered a pair of incidents from my fall of my freshman year of college (about a year and a half ago now) which I experienced and have difficulty interpreting.

I was taking a class on communications in the classroom, trying to determine whether or not I wanted to go into teaching, and the class size was fairly small. Over the course of the semester I made a few in-class acquaintances, one of whom was a guy named John. John was nice, slightly nerdy - which I normally don't mind but in his case it was in a bit of a socially awkward way, and displayed some interest in me. The class was in the mid-mornings, and I usually arrived there early because I didn't have a big enough break between this class and the preceding one to walk back to my dorm and rest. So, basically, what happened was that one day after class, as I was leaving, I ended up walking the same way to the one of the food courts - not one I normally used - for lunch as John. Having gotten to know him a bit, we began to talk, and wound up sitting and eating together. No problems so far.

Now, naturally, after lunch was over, I needed to head back to my dorm room to grab a few things before my next class. Normally, this would be enough of an excuse for the lunch to end and for the two parties to go their separate ways, am I correct? (John and I didn't live in the same dorm at all, his was much closer to this food court than where I lived.) Well, basically, not getting the hint that I needed to leave and move on with my afternoon, John basically followed me almost all the way across campus back to my room. Luckily, my roommate was there that afternoon, and I was basically able to make excuses and eventually he got the hint and left with a bit of awkwardness.

After this incident, I stopped really talking to John so much before class and afterwards would make a point to not linger or chat and then head straight back to my dorm room. In this case, I hadn't mentioned explicitly wanting to hang out or invited him, but being my nervous and sometimes overly-accommodating self I guess I didn't really make it clear that I needed to be alone.

But then it happened again. Only I was smarter this time. It was the week before finals the next time it happened, where John basically ended up following me to lunch after class at that same dining hall that I rarely went to but for some reason ate at one day again. Again, I made excuses about needing to leave to work on something, and walked back towards my dorm. Instead of going back to my room however, I had the sense to go straight to one of the heavily-populated study areas outside of a café in my dorm and begin to work on the project for which I had tried to excuse myself after lunch. John did follow me, and he sat with me at the table as I worked and tried to chitchat, though at one point I finally excused myself and put in headphones, after which he got the hint again and got up to leave. Before he left however, he invited me to a Q-and-A type event about sex and relationships in college, with an undertone of ""I'll be there too"" in his voice. Of course, I made a polite excuse and did not attend.

After having a year and a half to mentally cringe at the way I handled these situations, was there anything I could have done differently or better? Am I right to think that John was being creepy or at least a little out of line/awkward? How can I be more assertive in conveying my desire to be left in peace and not followed?

Part of my reasoning at the time - especially the first time this happened - was not wanting to come across as mean or bitchy if I outright rejected him/made it clear I wanted to be alone. Nothing like this has happened since then, in part because I am less outgoing in my classes now than I used to be. I didn't feel particularly threatened at the time in either instance because it was daylight out and in a well-populated area, but after a year I am feeling more creeped out/cringeworthy over the whole ordeal. To be clear, I've never run into John in the 3 semesters since, as my campus is a rather large state school. I am also no longer taking any classes in which I would be likely to see him, and on top of that will be out of the country next year. I just want some advice as to whether or not I'm justified in feeling creeped out by this behavior, as well as to what I can do to avoid or better handle situations like these in the future.

t3_26h68y,"So Frustrated with BFF, need to vent!","I just need to lay this down here before I go to dinner with my best friend and her boyfriend.
My best friend recently got out of a 9 year relationship with an emotionally stunted, controlling man, and their relationship was more of a mommy/son relationship than anything. It was unhealthy for both of them, but you can only point out a train wreck so many times on deaf ears. I know more than I should have because she confided every aspect of their relationship to me.
She broke up with him, it was messy, but she did it. I give her props for recognizing a bad situation and leaving. I know it takes people in an abusive relationship a long journey sometimes before they can find the courage to leave it.
A week after this break up, she tells me that she wants nothing more than to be alone, live alone, be without a man and be a free woman. I encouraged this, since, while I am happily attached, I am a firm believer that everyone should be single for a while in their life to find who they truly are. I don't think you can love someone or have a successful relationship without being confident in yourself. She hasn't been single for the 15 years she's been dating.
Come to find out, she met another guy at a friend's wedding a week prior to breaking up with her LTR and hopped from living with the LTR guy to being in a full time, fully invested relationship with a new guy, whom she had never met before this wedding. They are 3 weeks into this ""relationship"", and already they're referring to each other as ""wifey"" and ""hubby"", and are wearing ""promise"" rings. 

Why am I posting this here?

Because I needed to vent to people that would hopefully understand and give me opinions. It's socially unacceptable to call someone out on their issues, and I am not perfect by any means, but I tried asking her if she should slow down on the new guy, but instead she changed her ringtone to ""will you marry me"" by bruno mars and is planning on moving out of state with this guy. 
I met the guy, and I'm trying to be nice, trying not to be a catty bitch, but he's been married twice before, has 3 kids with both exes, (which isn't necessarily a deal breaker, just seems relevant since they're obviously talking marriage already) and doesn't seem like too much of a catch to me, personality or looks wise. (Stated since someone could say she's only physically attracted to him, not because I'm that shallow)
She's turned into a sports fan because he is one, which is funny since she used to tell me how much she hated baseball, but now she's facebooking stupid photos of how ""real women like baseball"" and the like.
She's basically lost herself and globbed in to this guy, and it's sad and frustrating all at once.
I've kept my mouth shut about the majority of my opinions, since I have managed to learn that what goes on with a relationship isn't always what it seems on the outside, but I needed to vent to some anonymous ladies and gents who may or may not be able to inject some advice or opinion on this.

t3_26hmz4,"a team member gets paid, while I don't, for the same exact position in lab","Hi, guys. I need some advice. I've been working on a project for about two years, and a friend and I are on a team processing data for said project. She started before I did, but we were trained for the processing job at the same time. Here's the thing: I've been doing it as a volunteer position for my entire time there, whereas she has been getting paid since last year. I've been ignoring it since last year, but I just recently realized I've done more work than her, especially because right now I have a huge folder to work on whereas she has nothing. It's really rubbing me the wrong way that I have to work on this outside of the time I am scheduled, without any sort of compensation.
She's worked with more folders because they contain less files, whereas every one I'm assigned has around 100+. I just don't think it's fair, but I'm not sure how to broach the topic, because not only did my friend not tell me about being paid, but I only found out because the file was in the downloads folder on the computer and I was curious when I went in to clean it. 
Like right now, I have work for class due tomorrow that I am putting off to finish this data set, and I just don't think it's right that she gets paid for all the times she is there, while I essentially do more work and get nothing.
Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. Should I bring this up with the supervisor or just ignore it? I plan on leaving soon anyway because I don't think I'm going to be getting anything more out of this project and I'm tired of spending 10+ hours every week for something that essentially just gives me nothing.

I've had issues getting it in perfectly sometimes, and it does shift and poke me slightly sometimes (my cervix sits at an angle or something according to the GNO) but for the most part it's been an amazing and freeing way to deal with my period. 

Right now and last month I've been getting irritation from putting it in and taking it out. It feels like I've nearly teared my vaginal wall, close to the opening and it's extremely uncomfortable. It feels painful and itchy (most likely itching from attempts at healing.) I just got back from camping so it wasn't the ideal situation to be putting it in (it was dry, at home I rinse it when I change it out.) 

Has this happened to any of you ladies? Is it time to replace my cup? The stem has been trimmed quite short since I first got it due to my angle and the slight poking. I could go back to using pads at night but I really don't want to do that either. Perhaps I just need to give my vagina a break or try a different model? How often do you ladies replace yours and how did you know it was time to replace? 

Thanks in advance for any help! 

EDIT: I was reading the Diva Cup website about the sizing yesterday and realized I've been using the smaller one but am about to turn 30, and it says the larger (width, same length) model is meant for those 30+.

Basically, I've been having issues with a friend, and due to a number of factors in my life which have me feeling emotionally off-kilter, it's possible that I'm being a total crazy-pants about this, but also possible that I'm not.  I guess basically I'm looking for a sounding board of sorts because of how ""off"" I've been recently.

So, I have this friend, and we've been friends for about 2 years.   Over the last few weeks, she's started being kind of bitchy to me.  Nothing huge, but talking down to me and making small comments that make me feel like absolute crap, like harshly telling me to ""shush"" when in a group (a few people, including me, were kind of talking over each other, but in a playful way), or making snarky comments about me being ""emo"" after I confided in her about some of the emotionally difficult things that have been going on in my life here lately.

Anyway, over this past weekend, this friend asked me to keep an eye on her garden for her while she was away.  She said that she had picked some veggies and left them in her fridge and that I should take them, which I did.  So, she gets home today, and texts me and says did you take the veggies, and I said yes, and she said that I was only supposed to take some of them and that she had left sticky notes saying what I should take and what I should leave.  Now, I made a mistake, and didn't read the notes carefully because I was in a hurry, so I took all the veggies.  I told her this and apologized, and offered to bring her what was left tomorrow (I can't until then).  She texts back and says her boyfriend will come to my house to pick it up in half an hour, which he did.  She never responded with an ""it's okay"" or a thank you for taking care of her garden or anything. I never wanted to take what's not mine, but it was an honest mistake, and I apologized, and it just feels shitty.  Her reaction has me feeling like I stole from her, rather than it being a genuine misunderstanding, but maybe I'm over-reacting to this in particular/to things in general?  

Anyway, thanks for reading.  I'm doing my best to manage all of the ""stuff"" that is making me so emotionally all over the place, and this is just hitting me really hard right now.   ",1,20140525173650,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

This guy has cheated on her several times, has raged at her for hooking up with guys while they were on an agreed upon break (the break was because he cheated). 

Every time I hear them speak he is treating her like shit, and to top it all off dumped her right before he was shipped off to Korea, where he began to text her that apparently he hadn't had feelings for her for a while (like for most of their relationship...as if that weren't obvious), and that he didn't love her and never wanted to spend the rest of his life with her (she had talked often about them having kids and getting married; they had these conversations and decided together from what I could tell). I'm pretty sure he waited until he was shipped off to tell her these things because he's obviously a huge coward (this way he doesn't have to deal with the damage he caused).

She told him to never contact her again after he texted her those awful things (about never loving her, etc.) and he agreed. But then she started texting him. She apparently sent him a video of their dog (that she kept) and in her text to me about how he wasn't answering she seemed frustrated that he wasn't answering back.

Her mom is over with her right now, who she says is making everything worse. I have been texting her as well, telling her to take all the time she needs, that he was an abusive asshole and that she's better off. She says that her mom is telling her that she's naive for texting him and that she's letting people take advantage of her and apparently her mom has barely said anything to her other than that.


I have been telling her to take her time, start getting out there and doing fun stuff to keep herself distracted, repeating that he is an asshole and she deserves someone who wants the same things she wants. Which she says she can't do yet because he meant so much to her and she just can't let go. I think she's honestly waiting around for him to ""change"" for her. I don't really know.

I don't know what to do, twoX. I can 100% see why her mom is acting that way; her mom has had more exposure to their relationship (she says her mom never liked him) and from the little I saw he was pretty emotionally abusive. I want to be there for her, and I was honest with her and told her that she should definitely delete his number (I made sure to be super supportive of how she deleted him from facebook, so that's a good sign!), but she says that she's ""just not there yet.""

I had my Mirena implanted about two months ago.

I know that not all women will have the lighter or non-existent period side-effect.  However, I've noticed that my periods have a much longer length than they did both on an oral contraceptive and pre-birth control.  (Granted, I've been on oral contraceptives for the last six years before switching to Mirena.)

I've seen some women talk about how they had a few heavier periods before their bodies adjusted, but I'm curious how long that lasted.  I essentially want to know if I should expect my periods to continue to have a longer duration or if that is something that may change over the next few months.

He asked me why she would haves asked him that, and said he wondered if it had ""come up at home."" The woman in question is married. My boyfriend, god bless him, is a bit dense. I gave him a couple of scenarios that might have precipitated this, and mentioned ""she might have been flirting. Did that occur to you?""

He said it had occurred to him, and that about a year ago, at another happy hour, she had drunkenly kissed him, on the lips, briefly. No tongue. He informed a coworker, who found her husband, who took her home.  

Let me be clear. I trust my boyfriend. He wasn't hiding this from me, he just didn't think it was important. I'm not angry at him, and I'm not concerned that he would do anything inappropriate with this woman. Like I said, he's dense, and probably had no idea she was coming on to him, until she kissed him.

I'm not going to do anything about this. His coworkers know he has a girlfriend. I don't go to happy hour cause that's his thing. I'm not jealous, exactly.

t3_26i9e5,"1 (21f) was severely sexually harassed/stalked by my teacher (45+m) in middle school. Advice needed. (Trigger warning) (X-post from /r/sex)","This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 
Also, I (21f) am going to attempt to give a solid background while trying to leave out any identifying info, so I apologize in advance for any vague statements. 

Okay, here it goes.
This all took place over the course of an entire school year in middle school. I was around the age of 12 at the time.  It started with a normal teacher/student relationship. However, he (45+m) began saying things to me both in private and in front of the entire class such as:

-""Efilym has such beautiful (insert color) hair.""

-""You have pretty (insert color) eyes, efilym.""

He would come up to me in the middle of class while working on projects/homework and rub my arm/back/shoulders and say things like ""Thata girl."" or ""You are doing such a great job, efilym.""

After this took place for a month or so, the harassment/stalking got progressively worse. On one occasion he used me and him having a baby together as an example in front of the entire class. He started off by saying ""Well, let's say Efilym and I had a baby together..."" 

On another occasion he slid his hand in the front pocket of my jeans and pulled out my lip gloss. He tried to tell me that he thought that I had a lighter in my pocket and he was trying to keep me from ""picking up a bad habit."" 

I had given him (as well as all of my other teachers) my school picture from that year. Idk if this was just at my school or if other schools did this too, but giving your teachers your school picture was common. He had a bulletin board in his room that he put all of his students pictures up on, except mine. My school picture was found in the drawer of his desk...with a frame of pencils laying around it.

The other kids in my school started bullying me because of this. They said horrible things to me almost on a daily basis such as

-""Is it a boy or a girl?""

-""I bet Mr. Perviwontratout likes that skirt you're wearing today.""

They would also call me a slut, say that I shouldn't get so upset because I flirted with him first, etc.

I told my parents early on what was happening, and I can't thank them enough for being as supportive as they were. My parents called the school, went and talked to the administration, talked to him directly, etc. to no avail. The school district simply gave him a slap on the wrist, and left him to keep harassing me. He admitted to everything he was doing to me over the phone to my mom and said that ""There's nothing you can do about it. It's my word against hers. No one will believe her over me."" 

He also began failing me in his class, despite the fact that I was getting very high scores on all of my assignments/tests. He accused me of cheating on an assignment and called me alone in his office to discuss it, something that, in hindsight, I realized was very intentional. I walked into his office, and he shut the door. I was already very aware and cautious of what he had been doing to me, but when I heard the lock of the door click behind me and I realized that no one could help, little-12-year-old me immediately went into survival mode. He kept trying to coax me into the corner of the room behind his desk so I could ""see the paper"" that he was holding while staring at me with this look on his face that I can only describe as pure sexual desire. I kept refusing to move. Eventually, he very calmly grabbed onto my arm and attempted to pull me to him. After multiple failed attempts, I managed to break free of him and I ran out as fast as I could. 

We filed a lawsuit, which we ended up being forced to settle for some amount of money, I finished the school year at home and only returned to school for final exams, and my parents packed the family up and moved us to a different school district. 

I decided to post this because, after months of lurking, I have had a hard time finding anyone with a relatable story. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience?

Also, the emotional effects that this has had on me seems more relatable to those who are survivors of sexual assault/molestation/rape than those who are survivors of sexual harassment. Does anyone know why?
For example, I have occasional nightmares (which used to be nightly) and flashbacks that often leave me unable to function normally for the rest of the day/week. These nightmares sometimes even include him assaulting me. Discussion of any type of sexual harassment/assault is sometimes a trigger for me. Sometimes, if I have had a nightmare about my teacher recently, encountered a trigger, etc., I'll try to be intimate with my bf and he will look at me with desire or touch me a certain way (like he's supposed to) and I'll panic and start crying. 

I think about all of the men, women, and children who have gone through much more terrifying events, and I feel like I'm overreacting. However, this is the man that introduced me to sexuality. He's the first man that ever lusted over me and I was aware of it...at the age of 12...and he was a middle-aged man. It's all just so confusing. I don't even really know what to call it. I wasn't assaulted, but it doesn't really feel like a harassment either. I feel like my story is pretty atypical, but I could be wrong! So if anyone has any advice or has gone through a similar experience I would love to hear what you have to say!

TL;DR I was severely stalked/sexually harassed by my teacher in middle school. Wondering if my reactions are reasonable and looking for similar stories/advice on how to cope. ",14,20140526025233,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26iikg,"Seeking Breast Augmentation in Asia Pacific","Hi TwoX!

I have a bit of a long and complicated story, but the tl;dr version is that I've lost a whole bunch of weight which has enhanced the asymmetry between my breasts - there's now at least 2 cup sizes difference :(  My boyfriend promised me that when I met my goal size (size 6) that he would get me an augmentation/lift to even the girl back out.  Well, I've hit a size 6 and have maintained it for 2 months now, so it's time to start researching surgeons!

But there's a catch.  We're currently in Canada, but will be moving to India in the next 4 - 6 months for work.  Considering there are a lot of world-class medical facilities in the Asia Pacific region and costs are a lot cheaper, I'm considering getting my surgery done over there (cost of travel is so cheap that even if we're based in India, a flight to Taiwan or Singapore or Vietnam or wherever is super cheap).

So this is kind of a long shot, but can anyone recommend a surgeon or clinic in the Asia Pacific that does fantastic breast augmentations?  Bonus points if the clinic has a doc that does excellent face lifts as well (that one's for the BF, not me :).

If you can't recommend a clinic, any other ideas where to look? Obviously a google search brings up a million clinics, but I can't find any sort of trusted source ranking/reviewing them.",4,20140526061811,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26i04b,"I didn't press charges against my attacker, is it too late to find justice? [Trigger Warning]","Two years ago, on May 12th, 2012, I was raped. My attacker was someone I had known for a long time. At that time, I was only 17 and naive. I trusted him into my home. It is difficult for me to share my experience, not only because of how traumatic it has been, but because I still struggle with accepting that it was not my fault. I hope that sharing on here can help me find my own justice, even if it is small.

[trigger warning]

I had a giant crush on this guy for the longest time. He was the quintessential bad boy, right down to the taste of cigarettes on his breath. He had all the friends. I was a sheltered girl from an overly-religious family, stuck inside her books and obsessed with being on the debate team. He easily pulled me in, his qualities were the exact opposite of mine, and I wanted to explore that difference. It was never an emotional thing, I knew that but ignored all the tell-tale signs. At first, it was just making out. Eventually it led to bruises all over my legs and arms. That wasn't enough to pull me away. On that night, my parents weren't home. As a teenager, that felt like the perfect time to just make out and have some alone time, since there were always parents around. I never wanted to have sex, but there's always that lingering thought that maybe I led him on or gave him some signal by allowing him in. While in my home, it took no time before I was underneath him and in shock. I had absolutely no idea how to stop what was happening. I told him no. My hands beat his chest and I tried to get out of his hold. I couldn't. I laid there, just trying to be strong. He finished and there was blood all over my legs and on my white sheets. He laid down next to me. I will always remember what he said to me, ""Are you going to cry?"" I still cannot believe that those were the last words that came out of his mouth. He stood over me watching as a cleaned my bloody sheets. I told him to go and he left. 

My body was in so much shock. I would wake up in cold sweat, night after night. I could not tell anyone. I did not tell anyone. My period didn't come for two months following that trauma. I was so scared that I was pregnant, but with no support, I continued on as if nothing happened. After my period came and I knew I wasn't pregnant, my mind completely erased the events that happened that night for a full year. 

It took an experience with MDMA a year later for everything to come out. It was during prom weekend and I was around a lot of his friends. I told everyone, but no one believed me. I remember crying and hyperventilating and that became the turning point for me. Admitting to myself that I was raped. Letting it come out of my mouth, even if it meant losing a lot of the people whom I considered my friends. Since then, I've gone through a lot. I suffer from panic attacks and a constant feeling of worthlessness. I go through periods of suicidal thoughts. Sometimes, it felt easier to have erased it from my mind. But I can't erase what happened to me.

I'm starting to feel like the only way I can heal myself is by bringing justice to myself, and to any other woman he has done or will do this to. I found out that he forced another girl to have sex, the way he did with me, and I'm afraid that this has started a trend. A violent one. 

So, I come to TwoXChromosomes to ask: What should I do? I have no evidence to prove that he raped me, but I have an overriding sense that I need to have justice; that he needs to learn his lesson and that he cannot get away. I missed an opportunity to put him to justice, but I don't want to live my life knowing that I never did anything to stop him. Please help me.

t3_26i9bo,"Mo' PMS, mo' problems. [rant]","It has been quite an eventful week for me and my boyfriend.

I've been a long time lurker of this sub, and this is the place I feel most comfortable posting my frustrations to. A little background on my relationship: my boyfriend isn't generally moody, but when anything even halfway dramatic happens, he pretty much shuts down and doesn't say much of anything. 

So last week, when I accidentally got a boot on his car to the tune of $140, he went into shut-down mode. I was already on my way to vacate my old apartment that I had lived in with some friends I had a huge falling out with, so I was already high strung knowing I'd have to deal with the three of them, and then I get a boot on his car and I couldn't pay it at the moment. He gave the guy his card while I sat in the van and bawled my eyes out.

Why was I crying, you ask? 

Well, I have pretty violent PMS.

SO naturally, this freaks my boyfriend out even more so for the next 24 hours, my boyfriend says a total of *maybe* ten words to me, if that. He didn't respond when I said goodbye to him when I left for work the next morning, didn't respond to any of my texts during the day, and wasn't at home when I got back from work. When he comes back from wherever he was, he gives me a deadpan ""hey"" and heads upstairs. That's pretty much boyfriend-speak for ""I'm still not really talking to you."" SO naturally I pretty much sat on the couch and started crying.

Later on in the evening it comes time for WWE Smackdown, which the bf and I are both big fans of. I get it all ready to go and I text him from downstairs that he can come down if he wants to watch it with me. I can see that he read it right away, but he only comes down 45 minutes later, sits on the opposite end of the couch, and doesn't really respond when I say hi. So in my stupidly hormonal state, the only natural reaction is for tears to start streaming down my face. And boy howdy, these were *tears*. Alligator tears. However, they were silent, because I was trying not to freak him out by randomly crying. 

I was dumb. He looked over at me and immediately noticed that something was wrong. And he asked me what was up. All of my wat. You practically ignore me for 24 hours and then don't understand why I'm crying? Okay. Whatever. So we talk it out, and his reasoning is ""I just needed to not say anything after last night."" Even more of my wat. 

Ever since then, he hasn't quite been back to normal. I've done my best to kind of get back into our old routine. So yesterday I asked him if we could go to the beach today, and he said he'd think about it. This morning he told me he didn't wanna go to the beach. So later in the afternoon I see him in his swimsuit and he says he's leaving. 

Turns out his friend asked him to hang out. Where, you ask? 

The beach. 

So I let it slide. I figured he needed some time with his friends to just kind of mellow out. He gets back at eleven thirty and again with the whole deadpan ""hey"" and retreating upstairs. I come upstairs half an hour later and he's on the phone. He promptly goes downstairs when I come upstairs. And when I go back downstairs a few minutes later, he comes back up. And he stays on the phone until two AM. 

So here I am typing up this wall of text to you lovely ladies of 2X with tears in my eyes, wondering if my PMS is getting the better of me or if there's some sort of foundation to my waterworks. I'd post this in /r/relationships but they don't understand PMS and I need this viewed through that lens.

t3_26jcb2,"Re: A way to help women in need","Ok TwoX-ers! This thread is a follow-up to /u/littlelibertine's idea in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/261i1l/i_am_not_ashamed_of_my_abortion_venting/chmw9fv) about women seeking abortions: 

> You know what would be really handy? A network of women offering a bed/couch to other women who need somewhere to stay in that time between the ultrasound/class and the abortion. If there isn't one, we should make it.

I promised that I would talk with my partner, who is a software developer, about creating something that would help. Here's the results of our discussion:

* This should be web-based. An app could come later, but not everyone has a smartphone. 
* It would need to be perfectly safe and anonymous for the women looking for a place to stay (at least until she contacts her potential hostess) and the women doing the hosting. This is the trickiest bit. **HOW do we keep out the creepers?** 
* OPTION 1: We can't do an Airbnb-style layout where you reveal lots of info about yourself in a profile, but we could do mimic the way [housesitting sites](http://www.trustedhousesitters.com/house-and-pet-sitters/9095-SirRied/) are setup. You can upload a police background check, photos of your home, a video and/or anonymous reviews (that are verified behind-the-scenes by the site).
* OPTION 2: We could setup a mostly-offline system that keeps the potential for abuse very low. Think of it like a book club. One TwoX-er volunteers to be the den mama for her city/town/area. If any other ladies want to volunteer to be involved, she can meet with them in-person at a coffee shop and make sure they aren't a blatant creeper, and even check out their references. This obviously involves more legwork, but if you're willing to drive someone to/from appointments, or let them stay in your home, you're probably willing to do a bit of work up front to prove that you're honest. We could put a link to a searchable database in the sidebar; women in need could simply enter their zip code and find their nearest den mother to contact.
* OPTION 3: We here on TwoX have a history of trusting each other. I see women offering rides, couches and beds to other women all the time. We're a fantastic community (with or without the influx of people from r/all). Should we begin by talking to the mods and making it Reddit-based? ~~Maybe the mods could keep a list in the sidebar of users who are willing to be contacted and their general regions? (This could be a problem with us being a default now. Maybe we should make a separate sub for this?)~~ Update: The mods say this is a no-go, but I like u/thisisappropriate's [idea of a private sub.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26jcb2/re_a_way_to_help_women_in_need/chro029)

/u/littlelibertine also said she has a friend who runs a non-profit, and they would be talking to their local Planned Parenthood about it, which I think is a fantastic idea! It seems to me that we either need to go very low-tech, low-visibility, OR high-tech, high-visibility via a partnership with an organization like PP. They could act as the ""den mothers"" in the ""book club"" option I described above.

I'll be letting /u/littlelibertine know about this thread so she can post an update here if she chooses. But I'm also interested in what ideas you other TwoX-ers can come up with! 

Take it away TwoX! Let's do some good!

**TLDR: Let's make a network to help women who need a place to crash when traveling to get an abortion. IDEAS?**


Edit: My partner is extremely busy at the moment, so he probably can't do too much to help out in the next two months. But he's always available to answer programming questions about what is/isn't possible.

Edit 2: Just to be clear, I'm not claiming sole ownership of this idea. I'm self-employed and probably not able to start an entire non-profit from scratch right this second. If anyone wants to take these ideas and run with it, feel free!

**Edit 3: So many good ideas (and concerns), you all ROCK! Here's what I'm currently thinking: we create a searchable database of the existing local resources that so many of you mentioned. We could expand upon this if we create partnerships with local clinics, non-profits or Planned Parenthood. If there are no resources available in the woman's area, she could then request that the clinic set up a fund for her. We could work with the clinic to collect donations to cover her hotel and bus fare or car rental. That way we keep out of *almost* all the privacy and safety concerns, while still giving women an easy way to find help. Thoughts?**

Edit 4: Thanks for the gold, kind Redditor! **Anyone have any good ideas for a name for this site? I thought of ""BackHer"" or ""SupportHer"" but those appear to be taken.**",373,20140526125843,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26jjed,"Someone tried to break into my apartment this morning.","Hi guys. This happened hours ago and I'm still really shaken; I think it could help to share what happened.

I live in a small apartment complex, and I'm on the first floor. It's a  studio, with a big window near my bed. My girlfriend was at work, and I was sleeping in til 11. We leave the window open when we're home, even if asleep, since it's a pretty safe neighborhood, and we're not on a main road or anything.

I wake up around 10, to the sound of rustling blinds. I sleepily call out for my girlfriend, thinking she's home for some reason. A mans voice then says, 'hi,' very shocked, like he wasn't expecting anyone home. I then slur, 'who are you??', still half asleep. I get no answer, and figure it was a dream, so roll over back to sleep.

I wake up shortly after, and just for peace of mind, check the window for signs of tampering. The screen has been pushed over, leaving it open. I panic, push it shut, call my girlfriend and mom, and cry. 

We decided not to call the police, since I doubt they could do anything at this point. It's an hour later, I touched the screen so there won't be any fingerprints, and nothing was stolen. We're calling the apartment managers when the offices open tomorrow, though, to inform them what happened. 

We figure he saw the lights off and the window open, thought no one was home, but scared off. I'm just terrified, since this is a very safe community, and I never thought I'd have to deal with this. I'm very petite, I don't have a gun or anything but a kitchen knife, and I'm home alone a lot. We have to have the windows open if we're home, or else it gets humid and smelly in here. We'll start closing them at night, though.

*The number one thing that pushed me to want them is they're more discreet. Basically my boyfriend (about to turn 22) still lives at home. We usually hang out in his basement because his mother feels that we shouldn't be alone together until we're married. There isn't a bathroom in his basement so I have to go upstairs to use the bathroom. You know girls clothes and pockets. I'm not good at hiding tampons in the waistband of my pants. So if his mom hears or sees me sneaking upstairs she'll ask what I'm doing, if I'm okay, if I'm hungry, and eventually she'll ask me what's in my hand. My boyfriend and I have been together a long time and we're in a very serious relationship and plan on getting married. I'd say I'm close to his mom but I still don't want to talk to her about my period. I know it's a stupid thing to be embarrassed about but I am. And let's not even talk about if his dad saw me! I think I'd run away crying. (I probably should mention I have anxiety. So I probably worry about this a lot more than I should.) My boyfriend is leaving for almost a month and I can't say goodbye because I won't go to his house when I'm on my period. That way probably too much back story. Sorry, I'm really upset that I'm not seeing him.* 

Anyways, on to my menstrual cup related questions! 

*Like I said I'm 19 about to turn 20. I've never had any children. So I'd assume I'd need a small one? But I've also read that ""bigger"" girls need bigger cups. I also heard how much you work out factors into it? I'm over 200lbs, probably over 230 and am around 5 feet 3 inches tall. I'm chubby but not too big. I don't work out much now because I hurt my back but I'm hoping to be able to go to the gym 5 times a week again soon. What size should I get? 

*I know there's multiple brands but the only one I know of that's available in the US is the Diva Cup. Is that a good choice? 

*I have terrible cramps and I heard using the Diva Cup can stop them? Is that true? Could this make cramps worse? 

*I read something somewhere about there being suction. Does it hurt? Because a suction cup sucking my cervix sounds painful. 

*What do you do when you go out and have to change it in a public restroom? Won't you have blood all over your hands when you walk out to the sink? 

*Do I have to change it every time I pee and poop? 

*The little stem you use to pull it out looks sharp and painful. Is it? 

*Can you feel it inside you?

*Honestly, how hard is it to get in and out? 

*I'm thinking about switching from the pill to an IUD. Should I not use a menstrual cup if I have an IUD? (That's what I read about when I read about the whole suction thing!)

What we should be TRULY outraged about is that it is not more of a societal norm; that parents of all sorts, birth parents, foster parents, adoptive parents, do not get much more support, and that Emma is somewhat right - it is hard to be a working parent! We need to recognize that very fact, how hard it us to work and parent and be away from the very people that you are working so hard to support.  

Yes, Emma Thompson makes much more than any of us, I'll wager...it IS hard to be a great parent, working or not, but her reported 50 million net worth* (corrected by /u/plentyofrabbits) can't hurt.

But problems arise if/when the guy find me attractive and expects things from me because of his attraction to me.

I'd love to make new female friends because I feel like this wouldn't be an issue with them. I also love girly things like shopping and gossip and sharing our lives, but...

I feel like my weirdness gets in the way. I was diagnosed on the spectrum a decade ago and that often plays a bigger role than I'd like it to. While I've worked hard and come a long way - most of my boyfriends/friends said they would never have guessed when I tell them. But little things have happened at work (see below).

I work full-time right now, so I'm trying to be friendly with people at work. But they have a life outside work and I'm not really sure about mine. I want to hang out and have conversations, but I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing/things.

What should I talk about? What should I say/do? How friendly is too friendly? Should I work on my listening skills?

Right now, I try to say hello and ask how my co-workers are. If I've heard a story from them, I'll ask for updates about it. I'll give tips to avoid getting people in trouble (i.e. you should put your coat on, the boss will say your shirt is inappropriate) or ask them for their phone number so I can contact them if need be (and vice versa).

Other people seem to have it easy and I'd really like it to be easier for me too. I'm willing to work hard and make the changes necessary to be a more likable person. Any advice or stories would be appreciated!

Little things:
-tried to help a co-worker interact with guests - I could tell by her body language she was uncomfortable - rushed over and interrupted her mid-sentence. humiliated her instead.
-when I space out, I position myself in comfortable ""spots"" - even when there's someone else there!

I had my period like 2 weeks ago, so it's not PMS (I've also never struggled with PMS), and to my knowledge I'm not pregnant (and it should be extremely difficult, since I take my pill religiously and I think I may have fertility issues due to insulin resistance).

What freaks me out the most is that my breast seems to have grown these last few days. I hope it's nothing, but I'm scared. Breast cancer doesn't run in the family, though some relatives have died of other types of cancer.",6,20140526152308,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26ix47,"Need to get something out / could use your womanly wisdom","Lovely ladies I need to get something off my chest and also could use your wisdom, encouragement, knowledge or any other applicable talents. I am 30 and married now just under a year to the man I've been with for nearly 5 years and have been having some serious doubts about our relationship. He's unemotional except for his anger. So, not a lot of happy reactions to things, never sad, but gets very upset at little things like not finding his glasses (might start throwing things, yelling, slamming doors) or he'll get upset with me being emotional. For example, I'll tell him something I'm upset about unrelated to him, and he'll yell at me to stop crying. Obviously this makes it extremely hard to share things with him. A lot of times he just won't respond at all, which isn't any better to me. Anyway, I worry about how I'm going to handle a lifetime of this. He takes it very poorly if I bring it up, and basically thinks he reacts to things just fine. So, anyone else have a similar experience and/or advice?  He's a great provider and takes care of me and of course I do love him or I wouldn't have married him in the first place.  

Now for the more despicable part on my end.  With this all going on I've been working with a man at work who I've become very close to. He's basically the opposite of my husband, and we have much more in common with one another. We've become very close, and while nothing physical has ever happened it wouldn't surprise me if it did, and terrible as it sounds I think I would like that. I've broken all the rules for these sorts of things. We share lots of details of our lives together, we see each other outside of work alone, he's my main champion in helping me with my career, and probably my best friend. We work long hours and spend just about all of it together, so it's all but impossible to separate myself from him unless I were to quit.  So, I feel terrible know that this is a pretty inappropriate relationship and yet being around this other man is incredibly fulfilling.   Any words of wisdom or advice would be much appreciated. A big part of this for me was just getting it off my chest.

I'm not looking to get pregant. Apart from the pill (which I take at the exact same time everyday) we don't practice any other forms of birth control.

What is /r/TwoXChromosomes opinion on male birth control? Do women think that we, as men, should be just as responsible as you in this case?

If she were to get pregnant, it'd be just as much my problem as it would be hers; I still have to raise the kid with her. I don't think staying safe should be a one-sided thing. If you're having sex (which generally involves two parties; in my case, a male and a female) you ought to be responsible about it.

I live in an out lying bourough of NYC. Born in Russia, came to the USA as a child, worked my ass off in school, got an MBA at 23, work in finance. In order to save $, I still live at home.

So I never learned to drive. I took lessons six months ago at a school and met this older guy who is an EMT and works at the school on the side.

He is older than my mom's age. To make matters worse, she dates a (healthy) 78 year old guy (still works, travels, super rich and super active.) who is my grnamother's age but looks and acts younger.

So driving school guy had employment issues years ago as a cop (won't explain) and barely makes enough to pay his bills. However, he is really sweet. He looks younger, is healthy, but has this mild depression thing. He helps my mom and I with chores and errands and little projects (builds our IKEA purchases and escorts us to the car service center).

CURRENTLY: Our relationship is friends but no benefits. I end up paying for things, ostensibly as a reward for doing me favors but I do enjoy his company. He listens. He is calm and patient. He does not go on about himself. He makes me feel safe when we are out in public. And yes, I have Daddy issues so there is that and now I want to have sexual experiences with him. He also knows how to speak russian (it was his thing in college). Charming for my family.

PROBLEM: Aside that he is over 20 years older and a bit paranoid. Example, he never wants to leave his apartment because it is rent stabilized. He never wants to leave nyc because you can get around with no car, etc.

MY CONCERN: We have sex and then I have to end it and he gets clingy or can't handle the break up. When we go places he is always scanning as if we are going to get attacked. When my cousin came to visit with her two year old baby girl, it was heightened to the point where he actually thought the girl was at risk of getting kidnapped in front of us. When were at parks etc. he held her hand and would not let her run off except in an enclosed playground. And even then he did this scanning thing as if some abducter was lurking in the shadows. But he was very sweet to her and every waking moment he was not working he escorted us to child related outdoor activities (which I paid for). 

This sort of annoyed me and made my ovaries gush at the same time.

TL:dr I am seeking techniques from experienced women on how to date an older guy without him getting clingy if it ends. Attentive guy can mean stalker. Ugh I have dealt with that before.

t3_26k3s8,"A few hours after the Santa Barbara shooting, a man in Stockton CA shoots at 3 women for refusing sex. And yet there is still denial about the societal issues involved.","[Link here](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/05/26/3441640/california-man-allegedly-fired-at-girls-for-refusing-to-have-sex/)

When I read something like this or the Santa Barbara shooting or other anti-women crimes (other shootings [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_L%C3%A9pine) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Collier_Township_shooting)) I am aware of a few societal factors that most likely bolstered the likelihood of these events.

-Women are viewed as this unrelatable other. The ""whole men are from mars, women are from venus"" shtick is insidiously pervasive in society. Rather than looking at a woman and thinking ""She is a person, let's interact with her like she's a person,"" it's ""She is a woman, she is different. Let's interact with her like she's different."" 

-Since the woman is less of a person in their eyes, some men put women on a pedestal as some sex trophy to be won. Basically, the woman's capacity to be a person, to have complex emotions, motivations and intelligence are ignored. This is pervasive in much of society (movies, TV, video games, campus culture, marketing...Reddit's front page). Women are presented not as people but as objectives.

-The most illegal thing I've done is shoplifting from Wal-Mart but despite lacking the experience, I'm guessing it's much easier to commit fatal crimes against those you don't value as people. 

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that there is conditioning from the very beginning to see females as completely different, and while it definitely does not always lead up to more extreme misogynistic attitudes like the kinds TRP espouses, it does lay a foundation. And we need to be more aware of this. Elliot Rodger undoubtedly had some sort of mental illness but I'm getting really sick of seeing that used as an excuse while his potent misogyny is disregarded. His kind of mentality comes with years and years of othering women, of viewing them as objects to be won rather than as people. He's not alone in having these kinds of attitudes. 

Most of the men I know (and love) have some of these attitudes, though to a much MUCH lesser degree. 
Guy friends complaining that a girl doesn't sexually reciprocate after being bought dinner/tickets/an iPod, guy friends saying they don't ""understand women"" and that ""bitches are crazy"" as opposed to actually listening to what their girlfriends are trying to communicate to them. These aren't huge issues, but they point to the bigger problem of women still not having the same personhood as men (yes, gasp, even in the Western world). It's a societal problem, and has a heavy influence on the perpetuation of violence against women. But for some reason there's still denial over its existence, which I find incredibly frustrating.

I know this is long and I apologize, I just wanted to rant a little and get the opinions of others on this.

Edit: I've had multiple people tell me that this is also an issue of the expectations of masculinity  (and some tell me that it's *only* that issue, and that the misogyny isn't real or something) and that this needs attention too. Which it does, but I created this thread to vent about the feelings I had in relation to my experiences as a woman. Not to say I haven't glimpsed the issues men face. I've seen my boyfriend, brothers and friends affected by them. But I don't have the personal experience or the necessary depth of knowledge to address these problems, and it wasn't what I was seeking to do anyway. I wanted to voice what my concerns were in relation to my experiences. That's what this subreddit is for.

 Additionally, I am in no way trying to detract from his mental illness. I believe that is also an important point to consider. But I don't believe it's right to say that the mental illness existed in a vacuum, and there weren't societal factors contributing to his view of women. 

Lastly, this kind of blew up (not used to this much responding to people) and I need to finish True Detective so I don't think I'll be responding anymore within the comments. But I do appreciate the efforts of anybody who contributed constructive commentary. Those of you who PM'ed me asking to see my breasts, I hope spiders get in your nose while you sleep tonight. 

Edit 2:
I've gotten so many responses saying that this is not an issue about women and that it was all on his mental illness. So let me tell you a little about how [psychology](http://chekhovsgunman.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/britta-community-basically-a-therapist.png) works. Autism is a developmental disorder. One of the functions it hinders (to varying degrees) is social abilities, yes. But it does not imbue the person with an automatic hate for women. That comes from stimuli the person absorbs from their environment, their society and their culture. What's my point? That we have detrimental views of women present in society. Which someone like Elliot Rodger absorbed and then turned into fuel for his heinous actions. Blaming his autism for his actions is not only inaccurate but also insulting to the many, many people who live with this disorder and function just fine as non-murders. 

Edit 3: 
There are also some replies saying that I basically have no right to bring this issue up because there are worse things happening in the world. Seriously? Please tell me the next time you talk about a problem that's less severe than poverty or world hunger so I can try to dismiss your opinion too.

Edit 4: You have to wonder when all the voices saying that this isn't about misogyny are male.",1061,20140526175107,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26jx4b,"A positive experience reporting rape to the police (obvious trigger warning)","A little over a year ago things with my former live-in boyfriend started to go really bad. We had been living together for nearly a year before there were any signs.

He stopped paying rent and started drinking. At first he would just yell and break things like dishes; at one point he smashed my brand new iPad in a drunken rage. 

Eventually he started doing cocaine. I tried to kick him out a few times but he would come back after a few days or a week very intoxicated and angry. I called the police on occasion, at one point they arrested him and kept him overnight but it didn't keep him away for very long.

The culmination of this violence came when I didn't see him for over a week. He would disappear for up to two weeks at a time so he could drink and do drugs 24/7 without my nagging (and most likely meet other women). I started to think that maybe he was gone for good when he returned at around 4 AM while I was asleep, drunker than I'd ever seen him and smelling worse than I could ever describe. He hadn't showered the whole time he was gone, and he smelled like puke and body odor - like garbage juice.

I was raped violently that night and he tried again on my 21st birthday, but this time my best friend was staying the night. She overheard us and burst in the room and tried to pry him off of me. He injured her very badly, and she went to the hospital. They took pictures and when I saw her a few days later I couldn't believe how bad she looked. She had bruises on her face, her legs, her arms, her side. It was so apparent that she told me her professors reported it when she went into class the next day.

I never intended to report any of this. I grew up in a very violent household and I've called the police many times without much done. I didn't see any point.

My friend thought otherwise. She continued to call the DA nearly every week for the past year to try and get the ball rolling. She never got so much as a single call back no matter how many dozens of voicemail she left. I kept telling her she was wasting her time until she finally got a call. Apparently they had closed her case because the cop who it was assigned to was just plain lazy. The assigned a different cop and she came up to visit me so we could sit down with the officers.

Luckily for us, the new officer is awesome. It wasn't easy to talk about but he was very warm and gentle and just an overall nice guy. He personally apologized for the cop who hadn't taken us seriously. He told my friend ""we're not all like that, me and my partner are going to take care of you."" So far he's been following up on everything and has been wonderful to work with.

I'm not sure why I felt like posting this but I kind of wanted to get it off my chest and also because I hear so much about how reporting rape gets you nowhere, or even worse - the victims receive consequences. If you're thinking about stepping forward, it's up to you but these things shouldn't be forgotten or ignored and people like this shouldn't go unpunished.

TL; DR not all cops are bad, don't be afraid or ashamed to talk about what has happened to you. ",323,20140526163724,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, sorry. I hope it is OK.  

I'm feeling really torn up about this and on one hand I think I'm being a bit sensitive about it and on the other I feel a bit miffed. I'd love some advice.  

I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years. We have lived together for 4 years, we have a child and we have often talked about marriage since that is where we are headed (just we are saving for more important things like a house etc.). We have a pretty great relationship. He is my best friend, we are very open with each other and I trust him 100% that he's not cheating or lying to me or anything.  
The thing is he has never introduced me to his friends. Is that weird? I introduced him to mine. I'm scared that he's ashamed of me. He used to go out with them every weekend and while his friends often invited their partners he never invited me to go out with them (even before our baby). I mean that's fine, we all need time to ourselves but to never ever invite me out with them all? Now we live 200+ miles away from his friends but he still goes away to see them for one weekend every month and he never asks if I want to go with him (my family and his still live there, so I would be taking our child to see grandparents while he is out partying) he always wants me to stay at home.  
Now a few of his friends are getting married and the invites to the ceremonies and the receptions are all addressed to him and only him. I, nor our child, are invited while other people's partners and children are. He says his friends haven't got the money to invite us which is fine if that's the case but I just feel like the baby and I are invisible and don't exist to his friends.  

I don't know, am I being stupid?  

EDIT: Also when he is out with his friends he completely ignores me. I try not to bother him but sometimes I will text him because I'm bored/lonely/the baby did something cute/funny but he never responds, even when he's gone for the entire weekend. One time he was gone I was super scared because someone tried to break in to the house on the Saturday night and I left him a ton of voicemails and texts and he didn't even acknowledge them until he came home on the sunday evening.  

How do I bring it up with him without turning it in to a fight? Should I even bring it up? I'm happy for him to go out and all that, I'm glad he is maintaining his friendships. I guess I just want to be acknowledged. :/",294,20140526171604,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I've been in a really negative place this past semester. Basically, I'm in a Master's program which is made up of 95% women and I feel like I'm constantly comparing my academic and professional success to theirs - even when I try not to. This problem is compounded by the fact that my program (higher education) is extremely incestuous and everyone is competing for career opportunities at the same place (or nearby) where they go to school.

For instance, three weeks ago I applied to a job opportunity in alumni relations at my university (and got an interview). I asked a classmate for advice (since she works in the department) and she told me, ""Oh, X already asked me the same thing!"" Then, I found out via Facebook (and overhearing during a networking event) that she got the job and I didn't. And this week it happened again - a classmate announced they got a job I had also applied to (and everyone congratulated them). What's worse is that I know job opportunities have been intentionally kept from me from classmates who share similar career interests - I know this because I asked someone about opportunities in their office and they told me their weren't any (and it turned out that there was a job opportunity they had applied to but not shared). 

I feel so disheartened by the whole thing - it would be one thing if I could apply to a job and forget about it but my program won't let me. I feel like my failures are in this giant spotlight and every time I go to class or on Facebook I hear about how another person got 'the job of their dreams' when I've been searching for four months and have found nothing. I feel like I can't function in professional settings (like networking event with my classmates) because I completely shut down. I feel like the only thing that is going to get me over this hump is if I can find a job, but all I can seem to do is look at my classmates with anger because I can't get over the feeling that they are stealing what should be my opportunities.

So, sure enough, I got boobs.  The problem is, they haven't stopped being sore, and the BIG problem is they haven't stopped growing.

I looked one day through her drawer, because it would feel weird to ask.  Mom and I aren't ""best friends"". :(

Anyway, that was almost three months ago, and I haven't stopped growing. I'm now like two and a half inches taller than I was at Christmas, and I'm almost completely unable to wear the two 32c bras mom bought.  I brought it up like a month ago and she was pretty snippy about - said the ones she bought were just fine.  What's up with that???   Is she blind?

So, my friends and I were at the mall about a week ago, looking for clothes for the summer.  I said I had to go to the restroom and left them, but instead went up to the third floor of Dillards in the mall, where they have the lingerie. I was scared to death someone would see me or I was followed, so I just grabbed a handful of what looked like HUGE bras in the 32-34 band range, and ran into the dressing area.

Bottom line, the 32dd fit great! Didn't hurt, cut my shoulders, or just sit on the tip with globs of me hanging out. I wanted so much to be able to tell my mom that I had found a bra that fit, but...

I couldn't - 32dd freaked me out! And my mom was so irritable last time we talked about it, when it was a 32c.
Ok, so here's my questions - 

1. How do I talk to my mom?  Why does this irritate her so much? 


2. Now I'm STILL scared about going to high school, but for a different reason. I'm 5'3"", weigh about 100 and wear size 0 or 2 jeans - and I guess a 32dd bra.  How are people going to treat me?  Will they make fun of me? Will guys be rude or hit on me non-stop?  Will my brother be embarrassed??  He already looks at me funny.  Not THAT way, but like he doesn't know me any more. he's 4 years older, and will be a senior next year


3. And I guess I should ask - am I OK?  Is it normal to go from basically nothing to 32DD in 6 months?


If anyone has any experience in this, please offer some advice.  I've basically got three months before I start school. I'm scared :(",6,20140526194218,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26ktim,"Realizing I need new friends...","I met a great group of people earlier this year and while I do think they're awesome, I just don't feel like I fit in or am really part of the group most of the time. It's not a super obvious thing, but little signs pop up every now and then. For example, invites don't always come to me, or they don't keep me updated on plans when they say they will. For the latter, I do check in, but I don't want to have to do that all the time. It's like I'm not really part of their inner circle and just on the fringes so I'm often forgotten. (BTW, I do initiate myself too, and generally get a positive response, but I still notice the things above/below). 

The group is fairly big, but when I'm with certain people, I definitely feel disconnected. They're all nice and everything, but like I said, there are subtle signs. When we walk together, you'll often notice that some of them try to stay together and I'm left on my own walking behind or they specifically speed up to stay with the another person or group versus stay with me. Or one person will go around the group and ask everyone the same question, but will skip me, so it's almost like they don't make a lot of effort to really talk to me or get to know me. These things have happened several times so I'm pretty sure I'm not paranoid.  

It seems like everyone is super outgoing and have all these wild and crazy or fun stories to tell. I feel like they just think I'm a boring person because I never contribute any stories (unfortunately, I don't really have any). My life has been rather boring, particularly compared to them. I haven't traveled as extensively or gone on as many adventures. I just don't feel like I measure up. And while I do enjoy hanging out with them... the little things just remind me how much of an outsider I am. I almost feel like the unpopular kid trying to fit in with the cool group... it's not a good feeling. =/

This is hard because I feel like all I've been doing for the past 3 years is trying to find people I get along with well. The few friends that I've been able to get close with have since moved away and I'm just tired of always having to start over I guess. I had such high hopes for this group, but at the same time I really don't think it's panning out. I don't think our personalities mesh all that well and yeah, I maybe overly thinking things or super self conscious but like I said, the little things I'm noticing are adding up. And that's fine... I mean, you can't get along well with everyone, but it still sucks.

Anyways, I just wanted to vent because I feel like I've done everything I can to try and improve my social life but I always end up at the same place. Things I've tried: organizing and attending meetups, reddit meetups, reddit, picking up new hobbies, etc. 

I'm starting to feel like I'm just destined to be a loner... =( Or all my relationships are just going to be shallow and/or activity based, but I really need/want more than that. ",3,20140526225230,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

In 2008 I was 'sort of' seeing this guy who was a friend of mine. I met him my Freshman year at University (2006) and I had always liked him. I knew that he was interested in me sexually, and he respected my not wanting to do anything. The one night I decided to, I clearly stated that he could ONLY touch me from the waist up, nothing below. 

So we made out for a while, and he just shoved his hand down my pants. I froze. I couldn't really speak. I'm a highly emotional person, and honestly, I just remember crying, and asking him to please take me home. I've told other people my story and they said that I was assaulted, but I'm not entirely sure if it is since it could've been worse. I also find it strange that it's 2014, and it STILL bothers me.

I love this subreddit and think everyone here is just super nice and helpful when it comes to womanly times and just need some feedback and advice. Also apologies now for errors, typing this on my phone.

So about two weeks ago I went and got an IUD put in. I(23) have never had children and have always been on the pill but lets be real, I forgot to take it more times than I actually remember. So I needed something less daily and still be effective. Had some slight cramps the first day and only minimal spotting. But overall couldn't be happier.

Well the next week I had a biopsy scheduled because past pap smears had shown abnormal cells and they wanted to be sure it wasn't cancerous. (It isn't, yay) That was another fun filled day of cramps and spotting. I was informed that it would last a few days and be like a light period and if the bleeding should ever soak through the pad to contact the doctor immediately. 

So fast forward to today and i've got real cramps that are just irritating and the bleeding, although not severe, is no longer the spotting it was a week ago. I am both frustrated and nervous because I wanted the IUD so I wouldnt have to have periods but also concerned something isn't healing right. I was told to not use a tampon the first 24 hours but I still waited 48 just to be safe. I have only used one a couple times when I know I'll be at work for long hours and not have a chance to freely change a pad. (Retail is very demanding :/) and haven't been having sex either since well I'm bleeding and cramping.  The cramping is worse when I wear a tampon so I've invested in a large bottle of 500mg Tylenol (allergic to ib profuen) and take those accordingly. When not on BC I would get mind numbing cramps and would be out of commission for a few days until I could tolerate the pain again. 

So what is going on with my body right now? Has anyone else had the same symptoms after a biopsy or IUD insertion? I'm going to contact my doctor tonight and hopefully schedule an appointment later this week but until then I just need to ease my mind a little. 

TL;DR: Have had an IUD inserted and a biopsy done less than a week apart and am still bleeding and cramping today.",3,20140526171906,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I hate it. I honest to goodness can barely stand to look in the mirror at my angry red stretch marks. I haven't felt this terrible since my ex commented on my weight by telling me I was ""Beautiful, but not as beautiful as I used to be."" It really wrecked me, because I have spent my whole life listening to my mom complain about her weight, and my dad make comments about both of my siblings weights and eating habits. After some holiday dinner with my family and my SO my dad makes some kind of comment about how we're both 'getting chunky'. This was after my SO left so it was clear he wanted to say something but only after my SO left. I was, and still am, angry at him for even mentioning it.


Between my parents and constantly comparing myself to everyone around me I am getting increased feelings of depression and my fear of failure has my anxiety out the roof. I can barely stand to be naked in front of my SO without wanting to cry or want to crawl out of my skin. I know I'm not alone in these feelings and I just really need some help in conquering them and getting myself to look the way I want to look.

Some info about me: I am in my early 20s, a virgin, and have yet to visit the gynecologist. That last bit is changing as soon as school starts again though, my university has a women's clinic on campus and is a lot cheaper, so I'll just wait until then. (Also financially speaking, I have no choice but to wait.)

My problem is, no matter how hard I try and shove those things in there, I can't! It's becomes too painful. The farthest I've had one up there is about half way. I have to admit though, I haven't tried too many different ways to do it. I've only ever tried while sitting on the John. I'm not sure what else to try. I'd be alright with pads for the rest of my life if:

* It didn't feel like a dam broke in my pants every time I got up for my chair

* I couldn't feel the flow and scraps of uterus coming out

* It didn't feel like I was wearing a diaper and worried it looked like I was

* I didn't have to be paranoid that I had leaked on the side (my anxiety level skyrockets during that *special* time of the month)

* If I could play sports comfortably (the major reason I've decided to make the change)

But that isn't the case. I've been cursed to use the mighty pad since everyone's favorite Aunt decided to drop in every month. So! Besides going to see the gyno, any ideas on what's wrong with me or what I can do to shove the cotton rocket where it belongs?

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. During our relationship, he fell into a heavy heroin addiction, and pulled me into it also. We have both gotten help in this area, and it's getting better, but I have other concerns about our relationship. One is sex. I can count on one hand how many times we've had sex in our three year relationship, and for the majority of it we have lived together, so it's not like it was a distance issue. Heroin kinda killed his sex drive, which I can understand, but another thing is he's into something really kinky, and says that the only way he can get off is if I participate in this kink with him. I've given it a try, as I want to feel intimate with him so bad I'd try pretty much everything, but I have a hard time feeling comfortable with it. It doesn't make me feel sexy. When I try to talk to him about it he gets offended, and says it's just a sacrifice I'll have to make if we want a sex life. He'll tell me I'm pretty, but hardly ever initiates sex or any heavy petting. If I'm feeling horny, sometimes he'll get me off, other times (most often), he tells me to just get myself off. It's really frustrating that he doesn't show that he desires me, or that I feel like he's attracted to me. He has no problem watching porn and jacking off. Also, he has been clinically diagnosed as a sociopath. Sometimes he is really sweet, and other times he gets really angry over nothing. The combination of this, and the lack of sex, has me pulling away from him. I still love and care about him, but I don't know if I can deal with this for the rest of my life. But I'm afraid to leave. One night after a fight, I was going to leave, but he tried to kill himself. I literally had to get between him and where the gun is kept to keep him from getting it. He says he has no purpose in life without me, that he can't live without me, and that I am his whole world. I just don't know what to do. ",0,20140526202201,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26lib6,"I was molested by girls. (trigger warning)","My childhood was drastically altered because of a girl. 

I am a girl. I was two years younger than the daughter of a family friend that my mom used to babysit. We were best friends, her the ringleader, me the cheerleader. I would do whatever she told me. The earliest memory I've been able to recover is when I was about five years old. The girl (we'll call her Tina) was very much interested in horses, and I, being the granddaughter of a man with a small farm, showed her around the horse pen, the tack, the trailer. The movie Spirit had just come out, and Tina asked me if I had seen it. I excitedly told her yes, and she asked if I wanted to play pretend. She generously let me be Rain (the girl horse) while she played Spirit (the male horse). We ran around pretending to be horses, and eventually she led me into the horse trailer. The details get fuzzy here, but the next thing I remember, she is humping me like a horse would. Despite my efforts to escape (after growing bored -- I had no idea what was being mimicked), she holds me in place and continues until she collapses and my uncle calls for us outside the trailer.

This, unfortunately, was only the beginning. Her obsession with horses, mating, and using me as her puppet continued to escalate until, for reasons unrelated to the molesting and inappropriate behavior, Tina was no longer allowed at my house. 

I don't remember if she ever directly penetrated me, but I remember always feeling dirty and tainted with her, yet I still longed to be her closest companion. 

My oldest and closest friend (not Tina) is also a victim of her abuse. We have never discussed it. As a kid, I played dirty with her too, although not to the degree as Tina played with me. Mostly just with dolls. I feel so guilty for occasionally reciprocating and then mimicking the behavior. It eats at me. 

When I went through puberty (at age 10-11, 5th grade), I had trouble fitting in. I had boobs but no bras, I stank, and I was new. A girl who wore massive amounts of eyeliner took me in. We'll call her Susan. Susan frequently talked about losing her virginity, having sex, and the benefits of being young and looking older. She had apparently had sex many times. Eventually, talk progressed to her being interested in girls. She grabbed my breasts and butt almost every day, before and after school, complimenting me on both. I don't know why, but I never told any authority figures. 

I hope that there's someone out there who knows that they aren't alone. It took me a long time to talk about any of the abuse I received, let alone indirectly gave. My friend probably would never have been introduced to such grossly perverted things if not for me. Tina recently had a baby, and my mother threw her a shower because Tina's mom died years ago. I didn't attend, but I never said why. I see Tina frequently, but I don't think I'll ever mention what she did to her.

And through all this, I wonder who did something to Tina and Susan. Maybe a guy, maybe a girl like her. Where does it start? I don't know. I just don't feel like there's a lot of support for stories like mine. We're all sisters here, with emotional bonds. Yet, here my sisters were, using my emotional bonds against me.

I just need to get this off my chest. Like the title says, I have ended things with him. This time really for good. I have tried to end things twice before...and got sucked back into the vortex of his manipulations, emotional abuse, and annoyingly great sex. I am feeling really emotional and sad about it because I tried SO HARD to help him, but I know no one can help him but himself. He is a good man and has so much potential. But he has been buried under combined deep depression and serious OCD...basically since I met him and his life fell apart. I met him at such an unfortunate time. It took me far too long to realize how unavailable he was most of the time. Just kind of checked out, or angry.

The straw that broke the camels back was back in November when I found out that not only had he cheated on me with at least one random girl, but he had another girlfriend too. I found out because I had known about her the whole time, but he had lied to me and convincingly told me she was his ex. I actually emailed her almost a year previously telling her about me and him and my suspicions, and when she never wrote back, I asked him about it and he made up some kind of excuse about her not wanting to talk to me.
Anyway, in November when I was with him on a road trip, I drunkenly texted her (got her number from his phone) a picture of us kissing, and because he had me convinced she was a jealous ex who still wanted to be with him, a mean note. I felt bad about it in the morning and texted her an apology, to which I got a phone call reply. Her first question was ""Who ARE you??""... And that's when my stomach dropped through my feet and my heart started pounding in my ears. She had NO IDEA who I was. She didn't know I existed.
We talked on the phone for at least an hour (he was asleep still and I went outside to take the call), and basically her side of it was that they had been together for almost 3 years but things had been increasingly rocky and she had tried to break up with him many times. I had been dating him for the latter 2 years basically. SO MANY THINGS suddenly clicked into place...that ""friend"" he'd go stay with in the city when he had ""work"" for the week or the weekend? Her. Keeping his phone and computer with him at all times and never letting me see his Facebook or email. Never posting pics or statuses about us on Facebook. Not answering texts or phone calls for hours or days at a time. Why he showed up hours late for thanksgiving the year before. Grosser realizations like why I kept getting BV, and we had sex in the same unwashed bedding. Etc etc.

I felt really bad for her. At least I had my suspicions and knew about her. She was completely clueless and thought they were in a rocky but exclusive relationship. She had the same realizations - about the phone being off and not responding to texts; him disappearing for days and weeks at a time; BV infections. She almost couldn't believe me and burst into tears when I said I’d go wake him and she realized I was on a trip with him. I woke him up and held the phone out to him. He saw the number and hung it up. I told him I knew everything, that I had just talked to her for an hour. We talked, he was angry, he calmed down, he cried - I just felt completely numb.

Since we were in the middle of Texas on our way to California, I knew I either had to somehow scrape together money for a ticket home, or ride with him and talk it out over the next few days. I wish I had been able to just break things off with him then and there, but I didn't have much of a choice. I was broke so the decision was pretty much made.

Driving together for 12 hrs a day and staying in the same hotel room each night meant a lot of talking. I got a lot out of him. He admitted to fucking another girl right after a festival we had both been to (he told me he loved me for the first time at that festival), and then again when he went to her town to work another event a month or two later. Again, this was a woman I knew about and had suspicions about, but he convinced me she was just a friend. While on the road, I contacted her on facebook. she had no idea about me either and was convinced she had a special thing with him.

Another HUGE blow was, on the second day of driving after this blew up, he admitted to me that he was an active meth user. I was blown away and immediately more dots were connected - his irrational outbursts, his inability to sleep sometimes for days, disappearing by himself when we were out together and coming back with more energy than when he left, his weird on and off again sex drive. He said he used when he was really depressed so he could be productive and feel better, and had been using on and off for four years. I can still hardly believe I never saw it.

Needless to say, that trip was long and painful. But, after talking for so long on the road, and giving him a few weeks to grovel and apologize and profess his love for me, I fell back into it with him. I was tentative, and was very clear with him that he had broken every shred of trust I ever had with him and I was taking it slow. He was soooo smooth and knew just how to get me back, knew the right things to say and how to say them...

Then, I caught him in another lie at the end of January - I was checking his text messages (something I have never done before with any bf, wtf), and saw some flirty messages and confronted him. He got pissed that I was looking through his phone and vehemently denied there was something going on, made up a story about how she was the married lady next door to the house he was working on and she had a harmless crush on him. Of course I didn't believe him so I took the number and texted it myself. It was a woman he had met on okcupid and gone on a date with literally a few days before. I confronted him again and told him I was done.
Then, he flipped his shit.

That night, he broke into my house through the unlocked kitchen window, stole food out if my fridge and left me terrified. Then, he started threatening me, sending me horrible text messages (I counted one night - he sent me over 90 messages in one afternoon/evening). This went on for 2 days and I was terrified every night that he would break in and every day that he would fuck with my stuff (steal or break things). Finally, I was able to talk to him face to face and make him stop and leave my town. Two weeks later (and tons of long messages from him constantly), he started to get to me again.

Now, the reason I kept in contact was because I was scared he would do something to harm himself. I cared about him a lot (still do), and want him to do well. I was scared and wanted to be there for him. That was my mistake because he sucked me right back in. I was even more trepidatious than before, but I allowed myself to believe him when he said he was sorry and he was doing things right now. We have been slowly working things out and it's been getting better and better, until two weekends ago when we went out to a big weekend party with all my good friends. A lot of them knew him but only a few knew what I have been through with him. It was kind of a test. I wanted to see if he could have a good time and be relaxed and happy and get along with everyone.

He didn't. I mean, mostly he did, but afterward I got a lot of confused feedback from my friends as to why he was so angry and aggressive. I took that feedback, and the comments from my friends who knew the story, to end it for good and proper. No contact. No allowing him to slip into my life and suck me down again.
I am young and have a lot going for me. He needs psychiatric help, a steady job, and a real home. I REALLY hope he gets all that, but unfortunately I can’t wait around to see it. He was a ball and chain I am sad but relieved to be rid of.
(that was long but it felt really good to write. If you made it all the way through thank you for reading.)

EDIT -- I just blocked him on facebook and email. That was surprisingly difficult. The emotion that is bubbling up inside me now is mixture of anxiety and grief. I know that no contact is the only way to be able to move on though. Thank you for your support and kind words, TwoX.

It seems like every time I go for a haircut, and I ask for something soft, feminine, and classic, that translates to asymmetrical 90s mom half-mullet. I say Grace Kelly, I get Kate Gosselin. I ask for a trim and they bust out the razor. The first time I got bangs with long hair, I was told no because it'd be too heavy. (It wound up looking amazing). I had a stylist growing up who bullied me into getting highlights and layers because she hated that I wouldn't let her do anything to my hair other than trim it. It feels like every time I go, they just know how to cut what's trendy rather than what looks good on me. What's the best way to find the right fit?

But for many of the men I've been with, not so much. When I am honest about never having a g-spot orgasm, many are convinced that ""I can ALWAYS get a girl off, you just havent been with a man like me."" Others dont have as much pleasure from the experience, because they enjoyed 'making me feel good' and dont understand that I could still enjoy the process without the orgasm at the end. Either way, I have just learned to fake it and everyone is happier.

So my current partner started out the same way, but turns out we fell in love and have been together for a little over a year now. We have moved in together, started sharing finances, etc. But I have never told him that I fake it when we have sex.

Now of course the clitoris gets lots of attention which is great! He does a damn fine job. I know I am being dishonest, but it seems like a bit of a white lie - it makes him feel good about the sex and about himself. And there is nothing he could do 'better' even if I did tell him, since my vag is just a bit numb and doesnt orgasm. 

So do I tell him? And how? I am just anticipating a bit of a dramatic reveal, where he yells ""how could you lie to meeeee""

I'm also known among my friends that I'm a person that likes to get around. Anyways my friend started kissing me and I was really drunk and it was just kissing so I was kind of like whatever.

Anyways I walked away and joined the rest of the party and talked to my other friend I'd been crushing on and forgot about the friend I made out with. I continued drinking and at by the end of the night I needed help to my room. My roommates dumped me in my bed and left me there for the night. A few minutes later someone came into my room and locked the door behind them. I thought it was my crush ( It was dark and I was drunk )and we started making out. Then I realized it wasnt my crush but the person from the basement , and I kinda just stopped making out with them ( but i didnt say no). When they realized I wasnt kissing back they undid my pants and went down on me for a bit. I kind of just layed there while this happened.

From about puberty to about the end of high school, a person used threats of sexual humiliation against me as a control mechanism.

t3_26l4kt,"Need to vent about a 'discussion' I had with my brother.","I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I really need to vent.

Before I continue let me mention a few things about my brother. He's 25 and I'm 23. We both live at home and work for our parents and dependent on them financially. He is currently finishing his junior year of college since he took two years off after the first semester of college due to an appendectomy. During those two years he didn't do much, from what I know. He would wake up and sleep late. He would spend his time playing poker or some computer game day and night. Currently, both of us work for our parents in a small shop. He works once a week, whereas I work six times a week. Every time he 's done with his shift I spend nine cleaning his mess. Honestly, if he wasn't my brother I would have him fired. He leaves the place a mess, and even after working for more than a year at the same place he still doesn't bother to learn about the things we sell.

So, tonight after watching a movie we went to have dinner. I mentioned how I enjoy a certain friends company because of the discussions we have. He said that the only reason why I enjoy it because she agrees with me. I disagreed with him saying that we disagree with each other but we accept each other's opinion. He said 'you're right.' And I joked 'like always'.
He said 'not really'. I said that it's just him agreeing with my opinion but it isn't right or wrong. He then mentioned something about how he's right most of the time since he thinks a lot more than me. I was offended. He doesn't know how often I think and how I think, and I told him that. He said he does by the way I do things. I told him that unless he's inside of my head and knows my thought process he can't know how I think. I told him that just because I have a certain behavior doesn't mean I think a certain way. 

He kept saying that he knew me and he knew people. I felt that was very condescending of him to think that way. He brought up our age difference and how he's wiser and smarter because of those years. I disagreed. I told him that I don't know if he is or isn't wiser than me and he shouldn't be so confident in knowing me. I also said that sometimes age isn't a factor in being wise but rather experiences. We argued the entire way and he was very adamant on changing my opinion. I told him that I wouldn't change it because it's what I think. I made sure to mention that I'm listening to what he has to say but I disagree and my point as to why I disagree. The whole thing ended when I got home and said, 'it's not about winning or losing but rather you accepting that I think different. I'm not gonna say you're right or I'm right.' He said, 'Exactly you won't say that because you don't want to think about it. We can discuss this for hours if you want but you can't since you don't want to think deeper.' I didn't reply and went to my room.

The reason I'm venting is because I feel like I was put down. I live in an household where they take my thoughts very lightly and believe that my brother is smarter than me. I don't voice my opinions too often because every time I do there is always someone trying to disprove me and I get emotional. What was worse was that we had my cousin sleeping over and every time I mentioned something I believe my brother would laugh and my cousin would laugh with him. It's really hard to hold your ground when they laugh at your opinions.

Saturday night I went out for a night on the town with a few coworkers. I got back around 2 am, was pretty intoxicated, and managed to lock my keys in my car. The drive from the bar to the complex was short as the bar was literally down the street, but I shouldn't have been driving.

Either way, I ran upstairs and got my sleepy roommate to unlock the door so I could grab a wire hanger. I changed out of my dress and into a loose t-shirt and shorts and went back downstairs. After a while of fumbling with my door, my keys were successfully back in my hands and I was ready for bed. 

A car pulled up behind my car. I stood at the passenger side and as the man got out and asked me if I needed help I just smiled and told him ""no thanks! I locked me keys in my car but I've gotten them back, so I'm good now!""

He kept walking towards me. I stood there, staring at him. He was talking as he walked. 

""Look, I know exactly how things work. Women are inferior to men, men are superior to women, and every women in this works wants and needs to get raped."" He grabbed my left arm and held it against the car. I popped off with ""is this some red pill bullshit?!"" Because A. I was drunk and didn't want to make any sudden moves and B. I had to mask the loud clicking noise that my 5.5 inch Smith and Wesson knife makes when it's opened. Having been born and raised in the deep South, I religiously keep it in the hollow of my right hip. 

He went on to talk about all of the extremely vulgar things he was *going* to do to me and pressed himself against me, flattening me against my car. 

He was shorter than me and I work out and lift weights every day. That and pure adrenaline made me capable of pushing off my car and spinning around with my knife plunging down towards his jugular. I stopped with the tip at his neck. I got in his face and put on my best crazy eye. It was then that I realized that he had super ""buggy"" eyes, like your typical meth head.

""Do you really wanna do this with ME OF ALL PEOPLE?"" Drunk me was pissed more than scared at this point. 

He stumbled backwards, screaming obscenities the whole time with his hands in the air. As soon as he got a good distance away, I bolted. Thankfully, my apartment is around a corner and he didn't see where I went. 

Drunk me is quite the problem solver. You see, when I don't know what to do, my solution is PASS OUT. I woke up the next day and my eyes shot open. My memories seemed like a dream. I ran outside and found my window on the drivers side smashed. Lovely. At this point I called the cops. 

The police officer was amazing. After about an hour of communication between me and his PD, and find out that a guy with the exact same car, physical description, and clothing got the cops called on him about an hour before for domestic abuse with his girlfriend, who has the *same exact physical description as me*. He has been quite the trouble maker for a while now and they needed something to get him off the streets. I would be contacted by a detective and will eventually go to a lineup. 

The officer also told me that he had a gun. It wasn't on him when he pressed up against me. I would have felt it. But, the officer told me multiple times that I should have stabbed him in the neck. My dad also said the same thing. ""He couldn't have shot at you if you had sliced him open"". Drunk me was worried about liability and just plain not wanting to kill someone. 

I would love to say that I feel all badass and confident, but I spend every second in this complex  looking over my shoulder. I have nightmares and spend my time pacing in this apartment when I'm not at work. I am moving in 4 days. It was going to be a month from now, but I can't take it.

I have 3 more days of work. Then I'm gone. 

Edit: It's not a true reddit post without someone messaging me and telling me that the most traumatic thing to ever happen to me didn't really happen. If mods want proof, I have the officers business card with the case number and pictures of my window.",165,20140527095611,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

My mom is incomprehensibly lazy.  She is a narcissist and her selfishness knows no bounds.  She lives in a fantasy world in which she  is never accountable and everyone else is to blame.  She cannot handle the truth.  She also believes everything is about her and nobody could possibly be more sick, more tired, more stressed, or more overworked than she.

Apologies for the mess that follows.

So, my SO and I have been together for nearly 2 years now. We're planning on getting married at some point when we are more financially independent and then start a family. At the moment, I'm mostly a stay-at-home girlfriend. I cook, I clean, I do all the laundry, and I'm here to do other things that must be done during ""banking hours"" that could not, otherwise, be done.

However... I feel like I don't do enough for the household. I've expressed this to my SO and he's repeatedly told me ""I don't care whether or not you get a job, I just want you to be happy."" I'm paranoid and depressed (with depression, not like sad all the time) and so sometimes that feels like... not enough. I'm sure I am being judged by basically everyone because he works 40+ hours a week at a job he loves and I probably do about 10 hours of ""work"" at home when it comes to household work.

I know my family thinks I'm a worthless piece of shit because I don't work. This is mostly because, in my family, your value is determined by how much you do and how much money you make.

To be fair, I guess, I am kinda, sorta work-working. I bring home enough money with my highly sparse and variable job as a transcriptionist a month to pay for 1/2 the groceries and all bills I incur by myself (cell, credit cards, etc), but...

I dunno. I guess I want support? I don't really want to work (edit, I phrased this poorly in that the work I am qualified to do is something that doesn't make me happy), and I have very little energy to really do anything. Going to school 15+ hours a week is extremely exhausting and leaves me stressed and whatnot, but during the times I don't I school, I feel that same exhaustion even though I don't do nearly as much.

I feel like she's moved her girlfriend into the house without really discussing it with me. The girlfriend spends every night over here. She's got her own key. She comes in of her own volition. She stays when the roommate leaves. I like the girlfriend, but I didn't agree to a third roommate and now I feel like it's a done deal and anything I say is going to sound like jealously or some sort of sour grapes or something and I'm going to be a giant bitch.

So to sum up - I think my roomie moved her girlfriend in without really discussing it and I'm a friggin' doormat.",23,20140527110820,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26me5e,"(Update) [Support] Standing up for myself","OK, I'm a bit nervous posting here cause of the new default and everything I saw, but the last time I posted 4 months ago I got some good comments and pms so I wanted to update everyone/ maybe provide a good story for someone in similar shoes who can't find the strength to stand up for themselves.

About four months ago I posted this... http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1vvl0p/standing_up_for_myself_trigger_warning/

At that time I was lost at what I could do. I was scared and felt like I was reverting back to the younger girl I used to be who got abused several times and did nothing about it.

So the turning point with these feelings was getting back into school. My new school has been so helpful with picturing my future and helping me get everything set up for trying to get into grad school that I started getting my self confidence back. When the semester was almost over I was ranting to a few classmates over the situation and they gave me some good advice on tasers and pepper sprays to look for.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to find a place to work that will work around my school schedule so it was back to the farm for me this year.   I have been talking to the owner of the farm and she and I thought it was best to not discuss the situation where I called the cops until we could meet face to face. Well due to our schedules that day wasn't until today.

The owner was very nice about everything. She made sure before we talked that we went into her office where it would be private. I explained the situation to her and she immediately felt bad. She informed me that he was at the farm right now in the fields. She then said, ""We were already trying to find a replacement for him but we will be speeding the process up and the second we find someone he's gone."" She then said he will only be in the fields and at all times be kept so far away from me (kinda like a farm restraining order which I liked). If A so much as comes near me or tries to talk to me unless it's 100% necessary for the farm operations he will be fired immediately. They will be sitting him down and discussing all of this with him before I come back to the farm.

I told her that I will be carrying mace/pepper spray/ or a taser with me just in case since he's not stable and if he does approach me there might not be enough time to warn anyone. She was completely ok with that which makes me feel a lot better about all of that.

All in all I feel like I got my control back on the situation. If he tries to approach me, I know what I need to do and I will not be holding back. He will be fired from the farm which will make things better. It will also be good records for the police for just in case he tries anything. While I couldn't get any protection from him legally yet, my boss has been more than willing to implement her own form of a restraining order of sorts which will keep him away from me and always a field away from where I will be. Also, I will be taking on more responsibility on the farm and might be heading the busiest farmer's market we do this year which means more time and money for me before the next semester begins.

So I just wanted to thank the people who replied to the first post I made and who sent me pms. Everyone here gave me the right amount of support and stories to help keep me on the path I of sticking up for myself and taking control of the situation. I do admit I am still a bit nervous because he is so big compared to me, but I also know that I have a support group behind me that takes away any of the control and overpowering nature he had.",11,20140527123615,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26mvqk,"Feminism IS NOT about elevating women above men and why we need feminism. (WARNING: May Contain Extreme Sexism)","[My previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/24oyzs/so_i_got_a_lot_of_shit_for_being_a_feminist_and/) about my experience as an Asian woman and a feminist had garnered much attention. I’ve decided to make a relevant post but this time about Western women, specifically white women. The following are based on my encounter with western white expats I had met while doing volunteer works in Asia. Let me first say this is just SOME of the expats I’ve met and by no means am I trying to stereotype.  The purpose of this post is to illustrate how SOME men still subscribed to these awful misogynist attitudes, and let me warn you, it ain’t pretty. 

1.	Some of the vitriol they spilled against western white women is just palpable. They think that western women are “ruined” by feminism. That they have turned into man hating femnazis, and they don’t know how to appreciate a “nice guy”. Unlike their eastern counterparts whom are demure and knows how to take care of a man.  

2.	Slut shaming western women.  Saying how the sex-positive aspect of feminism has turned them into sluts. They ride the “cock carousel” in their younger years and as they get older they desperately seek a schmuck to settle down. This is damn hypocritical coming from people who flew half way across the world to get laid. The gross part is a lot of them are English teachers who are there to teach little kids. 

3.	Apparently if you are a woman and when you get fat and old you ain’t worth shit. They say that Western women do not age well and a lot them are fat, while Asian women age better and are slimmer. I explained to them that is partly due to eastern society being very heavy on fat shaming and that puts a lot of pressure on young Asian girls. The response I got is all sort of excuses and mansplaining about why this fat shaming is actually good. I agree for health reasons people should stay fit, but it just reeks of hypocrisy seeing how a lot of them aren’t in the best shape and they want a slim woman. 

4.	They seem to have no empathy for sexism and other issues that women experience. You know how sometimes when there is a post decrying sexism and some dudes would comes in trying to marginalized the conversation and turn it into “what about the menz!”, or they would say that we are just overreacting? Well, that happens a lot in subs like AsianTwoX. Whenever we have posts about yellow fever creepers and microagressions we had experienced as Asian women, creepy dudes and expats would come in trying to derail the conversation, saying that we are just overreacting. Apparently if you have an Asian gf or wife that makes you the authority on dictating what Asian women should or should not find offensive. They would even take our posts and cross-post them to subs like /Chinacirclejerk (full of sexpats) to mock us and call us whiny cunts. I guess it hurts their ego that the “submissive and demure” Asian women are speaking out against them. 

What’s worse is they actually think they are the victim. They think feminism have turned women against them. Oh no not because of their backward-ass misogynist thinking /s. 

Some of you may probably still feel feminism threatens your masculinity, but consider this; would you want your daughter or niece or your love ones to be with any of these men?

Where a girl and a guy are friends and continue to generally be good friends, until the guy ends up asking the girl out, the girl says no and then the friendship breaks apart. I guess I just wanted to say that if two people spend a lot of time together and even if they didn't view each other as prospective boyfriend/girlfriend material then they can end up getting attached to one another. Now the level of attachment will likely never be the same and there is a large possibility that it could be very one sided.

she had been a victim of sexual abuse and when we got to sex she was
really shaky and scared and i could not understand why (we were already in a relationship 
and she wanted this but obviously could not handle it) i did not force anything
but i felt really bad when she told me what happened to her a couple of days after we had our first time together. I can only say i understand it but i cannot say i know what it is like.
I'm not sure if the world is more open now or if i'm openning my eyes to the cruelty that goes around but the fact is i know a lot of women who had suffered abused and i feel terrible about it being a man. i do what i can being respectful regardless of genre as i expect from everyone. The fact is that i'm in love with a girl who i have much in common with, we play music together, discuss world views, drinki together etc... and she recently told me she also had suffered sexual abuse in the past but did not detail it
and obviously i did not ask it. I don't ever want to cause discomfort or pain or any kind of negative impact on this woman. How am i supposed to act regarding this? i dont ever want her to get me wrong, we see each other a lot like 3 times a week (we're just friends) and i end up flirting sometimes but i don't ever want to cross the line.

t3_26mtm8,"Mixed information on how often to get pap smears...","So I am 26 and had a pap in 2011-3 years ago, and by most information I am finding, I am reading that it would mean I am due for one. When I went to Planned Parenthood a year ago, they said that I was due for one even though it had only been two years...and then when I did get my pap smear that doctor told me it was every 3, which is why last year, it didn't make sense to me. 

Last week, I went to a different doctor in urgent care because I was afraid I had strep throat (I didn't) and the doctor mentioned pap smears and she just outright asked if I get pap smears and I said yes and she said, ""Every three years OR every five if it's normal."" I had a normal pap in 2011, have not changed sexual partners (have only ever had one) so I'm wondering if what the most recent doctor said is correct. I'm only reading every 5 years for women over the age of 30. 

Does anyone know if every 5 years if it's normal for women my age is a new thing? I have an appointment for a birth control consult to get my rx refilled, but not to get a pap or exam and when I made the appointment, no one told me that I was due for it. If it truly is 3 years then I might want to change my appointment so I can take care of everything all at once and not have to come back, but if its every 5 years now with normal paps, I'd really like to not have to go in yet, because no one likes pap smears!!! 

If they tell me at my appointment that I am due for one, I suppose I could just ask them about the 5 year thing, and if I am in fact due for one then I guess I'll just come back sometime this summer. ",2,20140527150415,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26moii,"Sertraline decreasing my sex drive... need advice that doesn't involve adjusting my medication.","Throwaway because boyfriend is on reddit. 

So, a little background, ever since I hit the sexual part of puberty I've had a very high sex drive all throughout high school. This of course continued into college when I met my current boyfriend. He was a virgin, so basically I was his first sexual experience. Since my sex drive was so high we had sex as often as possible, practically every day of the week. 

This continued until a sebaceous cyst on my vaginal entrance (I know, nasty) burst, then my high sex drive lowered a little bit. Then this year was particularly dramatic and I was having a ton of issues with anxiety and depression so I started taking zoloft/sertraline. I started at 20mg in January and now I'm on to 100mg. It's improved my mood a great deal, so I don't plan on taking a break at the moment. 

A common side effect of it, however, is a lowered sex drive. So instead of having sex 6-7 times a week, it's gone down to 2-3, sometimes less if I'm busy.

Now of course this hasn't gone well for my boyfriend. Since I practically trained him to having sex so much, I can understand that suddenly cutting down is difficult. However it saddens me to see him so disappointed when I say no. He appears to take it personally even though he understands I am on this medication. I am still indeed attracted to him, and no one else, but I just don't feel like having sex most of the time anymore. 

I've gone to two people about this, my mother and my therapist. Generally I see them as very supportive and loving people but their solutions to the problem have been frustrating. My mom suggested I skip a day or two of it and my therapist mentioned different SSRI's. 

While I'm pretty sure they would help I'm a little annoyed that **I'm** being seen as the one with the problem that needs fixing. I honestly don't think that sex 2-3 times a week is that unhealthy!

However, based on guessing (my dog has had one before) I *think* I might have a UTI? I really don't want to bring it up unless it's a serious possibility and I feel like I might be blowing it out of proportion. With that said, I've had the following symptoms without progressively getting any worse, for maybe the last 5 days or so.

- I feel like I've been having to pee a lot more than usual (5-7 times a day now maybe? normally in my life I only go to the bathroom 2-3 times)
- I've been getting like super super mild period cramps that last for 20 seconds maybe once an hour, but not on my period.
- I've been feeling really dehydrated despite drinking about the same I usually do in my life.

I feel like this is just nothing since my urine looks normal, no major cramping, no vomiting or nausea, I'm not peeing like *a lot* or anything, etc. But I also read somewhere that some people have had really really mild UTIs that they could barely tell they even noticed symptoms.",0,20140527101641,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

My revelation was a more intimate encounter with what a woman can go through. I was getting groceries and i went to the check out that had a very shy nerdy looking girl at the register. first I thought she was kind of cute. nothing wrong so far. Then I had a sexual fantasy pop in my head. I would rather not say what it was but it was not a non-consensual fantasy. anyone have a theme of fantasy when you see a person of a certain type?
