20140423121830,Major---deCoverley,"I have to disagree with portions of what you said. It's true, there's never been a complete episode devoted to her changing her appearance, but I believe it's brought up that her weight is a defining part of her personality.

Hannah's character is unarguably insecure, and she specifically tells Marnie that shes overweight and it has ruined her whole life/is ruining her life. That's.... a big deal. 
When we are introduced to Hannah, she gets weighed by a doctor, Adam pinches her fat (and CALLS her fat), and there IS an episode where Adam takes her running in an effort to lose weight. What I'm saying is that Hannah's weight is one of the ways her character is defined (her sloppiness, her insecurity, her awkwardness, her lack of social cues). Even the way she dresses seems to highlight her body -- her wardrobe is specifically revolved around making her seem bigger and unflattering. 

That being said, I don't disagree about her being a body positive icon. I think Lena Dunham's use of her body is superb and admirable, but I think it is incorrect to say that Hannah, as a character, is not defined by her weight because she definitely is. ",2,t3_23pplb
20140423014618,ErynSMA,"I cannot imagine anyone, guy or girl, dressing like Hannah does in Girls and being taken seriously in the professional world.

I'm overweight myself and all about loving yourself and your body, but I really don't think Lena Dunham's Hannah is an exemplary  role model for the real world just for that reason.",13,t3_23pplb

It also seems worth mentioning that a lot of the clothes she wears are actually pretty fashionable and expensive. I've recognised brands like APC, Marc Jacobs and Dusen Dusen. I'd love to own her wardrobe. She wears unconventional clothing, and she dresses down when she hangs around home. ",1,t3_23pplb
20140423055858,small_havoc,"I think that's part of the point though. Hannah really doesn't dress well, she doesn't dress in the most flattering outfits for her body - she just dresses like Hannah dresses. I'm not overweight myself, but I find her choices refreshingly gutsy. It changed the way I think about how I dress too. I want that dress that makes my butt look a bit big? I will wear that dress. I like the rest of the dress, I like how I feel in it. That's all that matters. 

Now, having said that, I agree that it's not always in your own best interests to dress like Hannah for work environments and stuff. That's just common sense - but again, Hannah doesn't have a shit tonne of that either. She is just a character at the end of the day - I'm not sure how Lena herself dresses as an actual person.",18,t3_23pplb

20140423075323,small_havoc,"That *is* very clever. Slightly off point, I see a lot of people confusing Lena for Hannah, and I think it's important to remember that there's always a reason for a way a *scripted* character acts and behaves - it's part of their character, and not dependent on the actor. Hannah's also a wee bit of a bitch (and a horrifying mirror for a lot of us), and is so self involved that it would take someone who is very much able to look outside herself to create her. We're not meant to 100% support any of the characters, or their decisions, and that's what make a good script (in my opinion anyway - I'm not one for ideal role models). Love the spanx thing.

Absolutely! Just like most sitcoms (I'm thinking of Friends specifically though), the characters all together sort of make up the full personality of one person - we all fluctuate, we all reach some extremes sometimes, but it takes a plethora of different characters dominated by more overt traits to make us see that reflection in ourselves. Personally, I feel Girls does this in a realer way too me than any show I've watched. I feel like I'm perceived like Hannah, I identify a little too much with Shosh's anxiety and desire to control it, I'm terrified I come across like Marnie all the time, and I wish I could embrace anything I see of Jessa in myself.

Childcare can be devastating for career/artistic/relationship growth, since babies require intensive care for first 3 years; and the annual cost of quality childcare in the US can be more than college tuition, and then they go home with you. Be a mother when you are ready to love it.

I love my kids, and we paid particular care during the first 3 years, because of our interest in early childhood psychology and neurobiology, and in learning to be a different parent than those that raised us, bringing in our life experiences.

20140422214755,icarusocean,"I was in a similar position to yours about two months ago.  A little worse off maybe, but close enough to understand the distress.  Even though I knew I could not take care of a child, it was still sad, simply because of what could have been.  One day, you will love your children, if you choose to have any.  You will love them with all your heart, and you know that.  It's hard to close the door to someone you know you will feel that way about, even if it's far too early.  Once the pregnancy hormones start to wear off, the burden gets lighter, and its easier to accept that you made the choice that you needed to in order to be the best parent you can be when the time is right.

I really regret that I had to arrange my abortion by myself and sit alone in the clinic, and endure the event itself in secrecy.  If you can, bring someone with you for support.  The staff should be kind and very gentle and help you make sure you are certain about your choice, but the quiet time waiting before your appointment is a little sad and scary and pretty lonely.

Now for the nitty-gritty of a medical abortion.  If you don't want to think about the actual process too hard, or are easily upset by semi-gory explanations, I'd stop here.  Personally, I really appreciated what straightforward information I could find beforehand, as not knowing what to expect was one of the worst parts.

I had virtually no protesters at my location.  The most I saw was a protest van parked across the street on my way out of the clinic, so I have no advice about this part one way or the other. 

I don't know how far along you are: I also had a medical abortion, at about 8 weeks (right at the limit for age for that procedure).  For me, it hurt quite a bit.  You are essentially condensing your period, a process that takes about a week normally, into the space of two hours.  There's going to be quite a lot of blood for the first few hours (and tissue for the very beginning part), even after the lining of your womb expels itself, so try not to panic, just keep an eye out to make sure you don't start bleeding TOO much (the doctors will tell you how much that is).  Leave yourself some space before you plan to go to bed or you will either be exhausted lying in the bathroom late into the night or be staining most of the things in, on, and around your bed.  For the first few hours, you will NOT want to have to move anywhere.  Make sure to bring a pillow, some distracting entertainment you don't need to focus on (TV, music, the like), WATER (thirsty business), and some snacks.  Heat pads are your friend.

If your doctor gives you painkillers, TAKE THEM.  They don't do much for the contractions themselves (Lord, will you be grateful for anything that takes the edge of those), but they help numb the muscle aches and milder spasms later on.  Just try to take deep breaths and keep calm until the rough patch is over.

Don't put anything into your vagina for a while (infection, and the cervix is dilated so things could get up in there just as easily as come out), but after the first 24 hours or so, you may want to check your cervix to see if there's any tissue caught, which you should be able to ease out very gently.  If you can't don't stress out too much.  You don't want to hurt yourself trying to pull anything out, and you shouldn't be at too high of a risk for infection before your check up appointment.  In my case, the embryonic tissue itself was caught in my cervix and had to be removed by the doctors, and then I had to do another course of the abortion drug.  The second round is a cakewalk compared to the first: half the intensity of a normal period, no severe contractions to speak of.  This round of drugs, along with the followup checkups were covered under the original cost of the procedure (Thank God for Planned Parenthood).  You are going to start to smell before your checkup.  A lot of old blood draining for two weeks makes everything smell like a slaughterhouse, but this doesn't mean you have a horrible infection and are going to die (Unless it's REALLY bad and your blood turns a color it shouldn't.  In that case, I'm a stranger on the internet, I don't know everything.)

You're probably going to feel pretty sad for a few days, even if you truly believe in your choice.  I think this is pretty normal: it's an immense issue to have to deal with for just one person.  If you have anyone to lean on during this time, definitely go to them for their support.  This is a hard thing to have to do, and it's good to reach out to people to try and cope with the overwhelming, confusing waves of emotions you might have about this.  Just knowing you are loved is so important.

I believe you are making the right choice for the family that you may someday have, and for yourself.  But the only one who will ever have the final say here is you.  Good luck tomorrow.  You are very brave, and deserve a great deal of respect.",7,t3_23psjo

There were no protesters where I went, but it was very crowded. I waited a long time. The people who work there were very matter-of-fact with me - not super supportive but not unsupportive either. They told me what I needed to know. I asked questions. If you have them, ask! It's okay! 

You will want to take your painkillers - it was recommended to me that I take mine about 20 minutes before taking my second pill, but follow your doctor's advice since they might put you on different meds. They might talk to you about birth control options depending on your state. They might have to give you an ultrasound - they did for me. I chose to view the ultrasound but not listen for the heartbeat. If you're early enough along to be able to have a medical, the pregnancy just looks like a bean. 

The cramps for me, with massive amounts of painkillers, were like period cramps. But, I bled a lot, so make sure you have lots of the super diapery overnight pads. You'll be changing them about every 30 minutes or less. In hindsight, I think a pack of adult diapers might not have been a bad idea. I watched musicals on my couch with a heating pad. I was a little dopey from the painkillers so I just sort of sat there being high. I remember feeling very tired for the next day or so. 

The bleeding will subside in a day or so, but take it easy for the next couple of weeks. My stupid self had to move apartments, and I kept trying to help out which meant I kept starting to bleed and cramp again even though I knew better. No lifting heavy things.

I felt very bland. I wasn't particularly sad because I knew I was doing the right thing. I wasn't happy either. I just...was...for a little bit.

But, I'll tell you this: this was the second pregnancy I terminated, and neither haunts me. Sometimes I get a little wisty, like, what-if.

20140505200703,sadbun,"Update:
I am going to write down my exact experience in case others are thinking of going the route I went.

I decided to have an abortion very very early in the pregnancy. The most helpful thing was that I have been using an app on my phone for almost a year where I mark down when my period comes, when I have sex, and keep notes in general. So when I checked the app (it's called Clue) and saw that I was 4 days late which is very unusual for me, and I could also see that I had sex when I was ovulating, I was pretty sure I was pregnant and also knew exactly how far along I was.

When I had my medical abortion, I was only 23 days pregnant. The fetus could not even be detected in the ultrasound, and they only knew that I was pregnant because of my urine and blood test.

I had been warned on reddit and by the doctor at the clinic that the process would be very painful with a lot of blood. 
When I took the first dose of misoprostol on Friday, nothing happened for the entire day. 24 hours later on Saturday I took the next dose of miso and again, nothing happened. Then on Sunday I started light bleeding. Over the next 7 days I bled roughly the same amount as a period, with mild cramping for one day. I didn't have to take any painkillers, and was able to go about my normal daily routine. I took a blood test a week after my first dose of misoprostol and it showed that I was no longer pregnant.

My case is pretty rare. I think most wait a couple weeks more than I did to have the abortion. From the time I found out I was pregnant to the time I found out I was no longer pregnant was 12 days. 

I feel relieved and I am confident that I made the right decision. I'm still a bit emotionally up and down, but I'm ultimately glad that I did it. Thanks so much to everyone who left comments and advice. Your support was really encouraging.",1,t3_23psjo

But there will be breaks, there will be surprise days and the right thing said at the right time, and ... well, and it's spring, Easter to be more exact, time for renewal. Time for beauty to emerge, time for the soul to arise, time for life to meet the sun.

I know it's tough, but stay strong, reach out to some great people here, I am not part of your community, just an admirer, but I've met some great people here and they offer a lot of help.

Or just go with your friends? I promise you'll still have fun, you just have to let go of how you expected it to be and allow yourself to have a different, but equally fun, experience. People will say that prom isn't important, and that's true, but it's still a great experience that you should have if you want to! I can think of tons of things that I wouldn't care much about now but I'm glad I did at the time, because it was a great experience! :) 

Beyond that, if you feel really burned by all this (which you have every right to feel) then definitely keep going with it and do your best to settle it. It seems like more than anything, you're bothered that he went back on his word to you without a second thought - and it's made worse by him going to prom with that girl before. If you allow yourself to simply continue feeling like your boyfriend wasn't considerate of your feelings, you will resent him and always go back to it. 

 I had a very similar situation happen to me with my long term boyfriend in high school, and I never really hashed it out with him. As a result, I resented him and always questioned how he felt about me because of it. It ended up being a huge factor in us breaking up.

As a two year old most of his games involve imitating what he sees in his day to day life - especially cooking, cleaning, drinking tea (I'm British - he sees a lot of tea drinking). This is all firmly categorised under girl toys and usually come in a lurid shade of pink (not a problem to have a bit of pink about but I'd prefer some variety). Meanwhile toys that involve construction or building are filed under boys (and come in all the colours of the rainbow apart from pink).


I find this especially irritating for toddlers who have very little interest in whether they're boys or girls anyway. Playing is actually how they learn at this age. Pretend play (imitating cooking or playing with a tea set) is very important stage in development (they're developing concentration the ability to observe and imitate appropriate behaviour and also to understand that one object can represent another which paves the way for maths). The fine motor control and physical understanding from building toys is also really important as it sets the stage for learning to write and just generally understand the world.

I do suggest trying to find the closest help to you, if you can not get access to a therapist, or counselor, see if there are public mental health buildings or services in your community. 

If you try CBT, it is there to get you re-acclimated to situations that you typically would not panic at. It sounds like you are very frustrated with your situation and understandably so. 

Trust me, when you've been dealing with something as horribly traumatizing as this, you need a helping hand to get you to where you want to be. Try to remember that EVERYONE needs to get assistance at one time or another, and it sounds like you would really benefit from outside help.

This man will not leave his wife for you.  Do not expect that.

If you decide to get divorced, accept that you just may be single for the rest of your life.  If that is preferable to being married to your husband, than maybe divorce is the best option.  but get counseling first to determine that it's logical thinking and not emotional catastrophizing.

It's hard in non-agency environments, because they want you do go so far beyond your original role. It takes a special type of person to work in-house positions and you sort of have to just roll with the punches. The only time I'd say no is if I had a male co-worker in the same position who did not get invited.

20140423133157,CaitCat,"Any titles in particular you would recommend? I regret not taking a Native American history course, and I would love to do more reading on the subject. ",3,t3_23rqfw
20140426153902,sassXcore,"Sorry, I forgot to respond to this! I tried to pick out books that are fairly accessible & not loaded with anthropological jargon or the like. 

* If you want a really concise overview of Native American history, I recommend [North American Indians: A Very Short Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/North-American-Indians-Short-Introduction/dp/0195307542). Theda Purdue and Michael Green are/were (Green recently passed away) very important historians in Native American history. (Plus it's adorable that they're married.)

* One of my favorites is Tiya Miles's [Ties That Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom](http://www.amazon.com/Ties-That-Bind-Afro-Cherokee-Slavery/dp/0520250028). I like how it shows how race played out in the South in much more complicated ways if we include Native Americans. It reads like a story more than a history book.

* Tiya Miles also wrote [The House on Diamond Hill: A Cherokee Plantation Story](http://www.amazon.com/The-House-Diamond-Hill-Plantation/dp/0807872679). I haven't read it, but I've heard it's good.

* Nancy Shoemaker's [A Strange Likeness: Becoming Red and White in Eighteenth-Century North America](http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Likeness-Becoming-Eighteenth-Century-America/dp/0195307100/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398543382&sr=8-1&keywords=nancy+shoemaker+a+strange+likeness+becoming+red+and+white+in+18th-century+north+america) is an undergraduate-level analysis of the ways that both Europeans and Natives constructed their identities in opposition to each other. Each chapter covers a specific topic. 

* While I haven't read it, Daniel K. Richter's [Facing East From Indian Country: A Native History of Early America](http://www.amazon.com/Facing-East-Indian-Country-History/dp/0674011171) is a commonly assigned book in undergrad classes. It places Native Americans at the center of American history, rather than focusing on Europeans.

* Another commonly assigned book for undergrads that I haven't read: [Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee](http://www.amazon.com/Bury-My-Heart-Wounded-Knee/dp/0805086846).

* Linford D. Fisher's [The Indian Great Awakening: Religion and the SHaping of Native Cultures in Early America](http://www.amazon.com/The-Indian-Great-Awakening-Religion/dp/0199376441/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398543560&sr=8-1&keywords=linford+fisher+the+indian+great+awakening) is a bit more academic due to the topic, but I think it's still pretty accessible. If you're interested in learning about how Native American religions adapted & blended with Christianity, it's a good account. 

* A really important book is Kathleen DuVal's [The Native Ground:  Indians and Colonists in the Heart of the Continent](http://www.amazon.com/The-Native-Ground-Colonists-Continent/dp/0812219392). Like Fisher's book, it's a little more academic, but it talks about how Native Americans controlled interactions with Europeans in the Mississippi/Arkansas River Valley areas. Instead of Europeans destroying Native cultures, there was a period when Europeans had to adapt to Natives' demands. 

* I find the Red Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s fascinating, but the books & articles I've read are organizational histories and wouldn't be that appealing to a non-specialist. [Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee](http://www.amazon.com/Like-Hurricane-Movement-Alcatraz-Wounded/dp/1565844025/ref=pd_cp_b_2) is the most popular book about that movement, but I've never read it. 

Sorry for so many suggestions, but I thought I would give a bunch so that you can see what might appeal to you based on your own interests. All the above books are important because they help change our understandings of Native American and American history. Natives are not passive subjects in the books but are active in shaping their own lives. ",2,t3_23rqfw

I'm not saying that people should be down on themselves all the time if their love life isn't working out. But I'm saying that it is good to ask ""what can I do better to achieve better results.""

This woman's post didn't really explain much about what she's like as a person, aside from saying that she is obviously very independent and has her life together. 

One thing that I did pick up on though is that she gets into relationships with guys who pursue HER hard and then gets sad when that pursuit fades away. 

Maybe it is time for her to initiate some of the dating and find a guy that she can pursue. 

Also, she doesn't really say where she is meeting these guys. If she is meeting them all at the club, then of course it's going to be hook up central. If she's looking for a solid long term relationship she needs to look elsewhere. 

It sounds like many of the guys she ends up with are looking for a fuck buddy, or a ""way stop"" on the way to where they want to be. She needs to find a way to weed out the guys looking for fuck buddies from guys looking for LTR. Maybe in the beginning of the relationship she can try communicating her needs. She can flat out say, ""I'm not looking for a fuck buddy"" or whatever.

You should identify what you wanted to achieve and what's no longer possible first off. Clearly, you feel as if your career is stalling and that's pretty scary stuff. Think about what aspects of your job you were supposed to be doing while abroad and then get in touch with your boss. You want to get a situation where even if you're not exactly where you want to be you're still searching for opportunities within your job to exercise your skills and learn new ones. Without knowing the ins and outs of your job I can't be more specific, but I'm sure you can do this. 

Second, identify all the things that being in Italy enables. Naturally language skills - you're probably not going to be at the specialist professional proficiency in a few months but you can certainly improve from where you are now. How? By getting out. Sure you're working from home but honestly could you do that work in a public space? Flexitime? Get out and engage with locals and other expats. Try meetup.com and other networking sites to see if there are others around who you have the faintest thing in common with and then get out and meet them. Do things. Hire an italian housekeeper for a few hours a week and get her to teach you how to make a killer dish. 

Third, this is only temporary. The absolute worse case is that you spend until September working on your tan. You'll soon be home, so if you really feel that your job is not working for you then start searching for a new one. Might as well if you're logged on waiting for emails, right?

I have been thinking about learning a new programming language or other skill so I could do it there.  I occassionally go to coffeeshops to work but I always feel so awkward- its not like starbucks where I can sit for hours with other students, I stick out like a sore thumb for being there so long with my computer.  At least at the coworking space I might be able to make some friends.

I feel better admitting this, haha.  I suppose looking for second hand stores or bargin shopping is one thing I can do to leave the house. When I look good my self esteem is almost double.

20140423122852,boulverser,"Blergh that sucks, lady. We moved overseas for my job last year and my husband works from home; while his work has gone better than yours has I know it's been a big adjustment for him as we went from a pedestrian-friendly, greenspace-filled North American city to a hot, dusty, traffic-filled, sidewalk-less city in the Middle East. 

I agree with other posters that your best bet is probably to do some heavy-duty ""silver lining"" action. It'll feel hokey, but just go for it. Eat gelato! Learn some Italian! Use meetup.com to plug in to other expats, check out hash house harriers if you run and/or drink, take a class in something. Living in other countries is never without challenges but it's also an amazing opportunity. Since this hasn't been a great year for your job, figure out what you can get out of your experience so that it's still a worthwhile year for you - whether that's learning a new skill, starting a blog, or just wandering around soaking up your host country's atmosphere.

It's also important to talk to your husband about this. When we were preparing to move, we took some courses through my work about adjusting to overseas life, and a common issue is that the working spouse adjusts much more quickly than a spouse who's at home, because when you're working your day is often very similar to how it was at home. You need to flag to your husband that you're struggling, because he should recognize that you've made a big sacrifice for him and he needs to support you - whether it's by just making sure you guys get some high-quality couple time in the evenings or making an effort to introduce you to people, or whatever. 

I'd also recommend checking out the [US State Department's blogroll](http://www.afsa.org/foreign_service_blogs.aspx) as there are a lot of spouses who blog and what you're feeling is definitely a common theme - it can help to see that others are in the same boat and vent to people who know what you're going through, instead of people who think you're being ungrateful (because of course, living overseas usually sounds dreamy to our friends and families at home!).

Get outside, meet some people, find people to talk to. A lot of Italians speak English so if you can just get a few phrases under your belt many people will be happy to switch to English to talk to you.

So vent your little heart out! 

To me, it doesn't seem like a divorce/career change is necessary, but something needs to change for you to be happy.

SO many people say that they would loveeeee to work from home. I did it for 4 months and hated it. I chose to be unemployed rather than make bunches of money (for my age). My work involved many confidential documents that meant I had to work from home on my secured network. Is your job something you can do from a cafe with a laptop? Maybe even a public library? That way you can kill two birds with one stone-get out and get work done. I've also heard of groups for people that work from home and get together for lunches perhaps you could find something like that? 

Being an expat is hard, but you don't have to do it alone. Try your cities subreddit/meetup groups and try to connect with people who are going through something similar. 

I'm currently an expat SO, following my boyfriend. His company offers tons of stuff for the husbands and wives that are displaced because of their spouses. They do events for all sorts of interest groups and there are always interesting people there. Maybe your husband could talk to his boss/HR and see of there is something you can get involved in there. 

Most importantly talk to your husband! Let him know you love him, support him, and am trying to be there for him but it's very hard for you at the moment. Try to work out a game plan for how you can both make things improve for you. 

Ask him to reach out to his colleagues and see if they have any spouses that wouldn't mind meeting up with you (expat or native Italian , either work). I rolled my eyes the first few times my SO suggested it because it felt like he was setting me up on play dates, but in the end I was so grateful to meet a lot of intelligent, talented, beautiful women.

One of them said, ""Oh... really... what kind of games do you play then?"" My standard answer to this is, ""Well, I play a lot of genres! I don't really have a favorite,"" which is true. I mean, how can you answer such a broad question? He asked, ""Do you like first-person shooters?"" I said, ""No. I like third-person shooters and shoot-em-ups, though!"" which is also true since I get heavily motion-sick when playing first-person games. He then asked, ""Do you like sports games?""

Reading the questions asked in the survey I would say that I used to be the type of person that silenced myself.  I was this way since I was a child.  In fact, my siblings would call themselves the ""partners in crime"" while I was labeled the ""dream child.""  

I think that all that has changed for me because I resented having to hold so much in.  I say no more now.  I bring up difficult, uncomfortable topics with my fiance rather than just avoid confrontation.  That being said, I'm silencing myself less, but there are times when I still bite my tongue, so to speak.  

I can't tell you how to change, but in my case I learned to speak up more because I know that that's the only way my relationship is going to work (my fiance is a self silencer too).  If I don't speak up, I know he won't and then it just grows into resentment on both our parts.  Be willing to say no too.  You can't do everything.  Sometimes you do have to put yourself first, especially if you're in school.  Ask people to help if you think you need it.  For example, while in my PhD program my older sister, who is very assertive, called my parents (who were going through a divorce) and basically told them to chill out and leave me alone, especially during finals.

Well I got out of that relationship, was messed up for a few years, did some counselling, thought about things- and realised that I don't really believe it. I don't believe that bullshit I was taught. I can see why my parents cling to it, but it's not true in all cases- and I don't have to be with someone, if they're not right for me. And I realised that I would rather be on my own, than be with the wrong person. That was SO FREEING for me to realise. I just could not be arsed anymore, worrying myself over the other person, twisting myself to be what I thought they wanted. It just seemed so much more relaxing to be on my own, and be my own self.

So I feel like you wanted help, you asked about the steps people took. So, I went to counselling. I got the right meds for my depression and anxiety. I did a lot of CBT and thought about WHY I put my own needs last. And CBT teaches you to challenge those thoughts. So now when I read that list, I would read 'I need to put my own desires last to not be selfish' and I think 'no, I need to look after myself otherwise I will be miserable, looking after myself is a basic prerequisite for allowing me to have good relationships with other people.' So now I automatically have helpful, healthy thoughts about things- because I have sat down and asked myself questions like 'why do I think it's okay for people to mistreat me? What am I scared of if I say no? What am I scared of if I am myself?' So I would recommend CBT to everyone, it really helped me.",2,t3_23rpna

They can be bulky. Less bulk and you'll probably need to change them more often. Soaking them in oxy-clean like cleaners helps stop staining.

20140423123001,Bitterposer,"Look, abusive relationships are not as simple as people make them seem.  People want to act like they are a battle between good and evil, with one person being the monster and the other the victim. 

That's not what really happens in most cases.  In most cases, the parties still have strong feelings for each other, and the reason people stay in abusive relationships is that there is still a lot of ""good"" and the good oftentimes outweighs the bad, at least in their minds.  It seems like in your relationship there was still a lot of ""good"" that was irrationally clouding your emotions and making you ignore the bad.  That feeling of ""love"" is a powerful fucking drug. 

And your ex sounds like he's a guy going through some terrible mental problems.  He obviously has some serious issues but he also does seem to feel some remorse and care about you. 

But here's the thing: you need to just leave and not look back.  From an emotional standpoint, it makes sense for you to still long for it, but rationally you just can't have this person in your life.  It is wrecking your self esteem and inflicting physical damage on your body.  You need to cut all contact and move on.  This guy has problems and hopefully he will get them solved one day, but that's not your responsibility right now.  You can't waste your time trying to figure out what he's thinking because to be honest crazy people are complicated and you will never figure it out. ",15,t3_23s25l

On the other hand though, I just thought it would be a little comforting to have other people weigh in on this and give their own point of view. See if anyone can give me some things to think about and throw around in my head.

Believe me, hes not in my life. He hasn't been since I pressed charges and I plan on keeping it that way. We have a no-contact order which is practically a court-issued PPO. The only contact we have is the couple times we make eye contact in court. I have no plans of interacting with him for the rest of my life. Like I said, he is dead to me, and I think it should stay that way.

20140423152127,what_a_cat_astrophe,"Maybe I can shed some light to why you're feeling this way. 

What your ex did to you was horrible beyond words and you did not deserve it one bit.  He was supposed to love you and be on your team, but he beat you instead.  Yet you still love him to pieces and despite your bruises, you wished he would stay.  Of course, this is where a lot of people would tell you to walk away, but it isn't so easy, is it?  

The fact your ex realizes what he has done is a good thing.  He's clearly going through some issues right now due to a rough upbringing and it's good he can address his anger.  That doesn't make what he did OK though.

**Why I think a lot of us end up staying**

In the beginning of your relationship, all was well.  And over time, there was a slow drip of emotional abuse.  Such a slow drip, in fact, you hardly notice it coming on and things proceed to feel pretty normal.  You still regard and respect him as your lover because of the ""good times"" you have had, and the ones you still have.  So you find yourself holding out for the good days.  Waiting around for things to get better - the day when things will be back to normal again, because they weren't always like this.  

**Why I think we sometimes blame ourselves, and make up excuses**

Perhaps you might even blame yourself a bit too and wonder if a part of you deserved that treatment, because the man who used to treat you like a princess in the beginning now treats you like scum.  So you make up excuses as to why it's OK to stay with someone who makes us feel so bad.

**Having the last word**

I know that you feel like *you* should have had the last word.  You deserved to, after all - he was a total pig.  Sometimes having the last word feels a lot like justice.  It's one part of the closure process, and for some of us it can be a big one!  The fact he left you makes you feel cheated.  He's the asshole, not you, and he deserves to be the one who is walked away from because you want him to feel the pain he deserves.  You want him to know that he screwed up and that you were the one who was strong enough to walk away from it.  It's entirely understandable, but you need to remember that that is all it is: having the last word, and walking away feeling empowered from what made you feel powerless.  In short, he humiliated you.

-----

My emotionally abusive ex (also had an abusive childhood) left me the second he found a good reason to.  He cheated on me, but I blamed myself and made excuses as to why his behavior was OK because I figured if things were good in the beginning, there was a specific reason why they weren't anymore.  He abused me emotionally so often that it crushed my ego.  I couldn't stand up for myself because he would find a way to break my confidence whenever I did.  I refused to let him just cheat on me without a fight.  I wanted to prove that I could be an awesome girlfriend and make him feel sorry for what he did.  All I wanted him to do was realize I was a good person, so I stayed with him for five long months until he came up with some dumb reason to break up with me.

And of course he was sorry.  After some time, he realized what he'd lost and understood he fucked up.  But most men do after a while, and some of them may even try to come back to the ones they hurt.  Because when an abuser starts to miss the person they hurt, they think they can be better because RIGHT then and there, they want to be.  But fact of the matter is, if they have found a reason to go that far with you once before, they'll do it again.  It took my girl friend THREE times over four years to figure this out with her physically abusive boyfriend until she finally was able to walk away forever.

It's a long road, but eventually you will learn to get past all the humiliation he left you with and start to understand that what's important is that you're OUT.  It doesn't matter who left who - what matters is you're safe now.  And someday, you're going to find ""the one"".  He will love and respect you like crazy and you'll wonder why you ever settled for a life with someone who made you feel scared or miserable.

20140423152018,La_Fee_Verte,"Have you wondered about why you stayed with him for so long and what are your mental and emotional issues that made him so irresistible to you in the first place?  

The history of abusive relationships likes to repeat itself.  

What helped me was the book - 'women who love too much ' by Robin Norwood. Maybe you could have a read and see if it's any helpful!? ",1,t3_23s25l
20140423201347,mcrfreak78,"I do think about that too. I was scared to be alone and frankly I just fell hard for him. He made me feel important and I had never felt loved before. He was my best friend, my first boyfriend. We lived together and talked about our future. When he hurt me he would apologize, sweet-talk me, cry, comfort me, buy me stuff, tell me he was going to change so much etc. 

When things got worse I was still clinging on to the little bit of hope it  would get better. I was more in love with the memories and feelings of infatuation I had with this person more than him himself. He was the first person I fell in love with. 

By the times things got so bad I didn't want to leave because I couldn't imagine being so alone. I cut ties with a lot of friends because I thought he was all I needed. I depended on him to help pay rent and bills. When they say ""love is a hell of a drug"" they arent lieing. I was completely addicted to the feeling of being in a relationship (no matter how miserable I was) Despite everything I was scared of the thought of having no one to talk to. Coming home to nobody. Sleeping by myself. It was overwhelming to consider at the time because of how weak I was. 

The thought of going from being someones everything everyday to being alone terrified me. By that point I was too emotionally invested in the relationship. I felt him growing away and becoming distant so I tried pulling him closer, only to have him pull away harder and so on. In a way, at the end it wasn't even a relationship. We were on opposite teams. He was putting down to build himself up. It was almost a parasitic  relationship, & extremely emotionally exhausting to say the least.

But I digress, Ive had time take a long hard look at myself and why I did everything I thought I wouldn't. Anyways I will look into that book you suggested. Thank you so much.",1,t3_23s25l
20140423140953,Celarcade,"My abusive ex was never physically abusive to this level, but he abused me all the time mentally, physically, sexually... One of the ways that abusers do this is by making you believe you 100% need them and by scraping away your confidence and self-esteem. He's probably been subtly (or not so subtly) manipulating you and making you dependent on him for a while now. I used to spend hours in guilty feelings, considering all the things I had done to supposedly deserve my abuse. Our relationship was very volatile, and having said somethings I wasn't proud of either in the heat of arguments made things more confusing. He'd ""apologize"", but always blamed me for his outbursts. He always twisted things to relieve himself of ANY and ALL responsibility. Does any of this sound familiar? 

When this ex of mine split up with me, I struggled with the same thoughts: Shouldn't I, the injured party, have been the one to break it off? Why did I beg him to stay after everything? 

Truth is, being abused by someone doesn't mean there's no love in the relationship. It means that between all the good times, there's terrible times of fear and anguish. When you're ""in it"", you always see both the good and bad times. You don't just see the man who hits you, you see the man who brought you flowers and sang you songs.

I don't know if it's always like that, but I was only able to really gain perspective on my abusive relationship after it had been over for a while. From a more distant perspective than yours, I'm just glad he's away from you. This man is dangerous and I'd keep my distance, if anything, to let yourself heal emotionally and gain some perspective.

You're right, I do feel stupid and beat myself up. I still have feelings of guilt, regret & doubts even now, three months later. I need to stop constantly wondering whether it was my fault & if I could have prevented it. Or constantly asking myself if I turned him this way.

Its comforting to hear someone has been in the same situation(not that I don't feel for you, of course)- with the whole him leaving you. I was always told they will beg for your mercy and youd take them back and the abuse would continue, so I was so hurt and confused when he left me because I always thought it didn't go that way. & always wondering ""if he left because he cared, why did he hurt me so bad""

Thats so true, I was so blinded when I was in it. I would always tell myself & him ""the day you punch me will be the day its done forever"" and he'd say ""Id never do that to you."" Then when the situation arises and the heart gets involved, all logic & reasoning completely fly out the window to make room for feeling & emotion. Hindsight IS 20/20. When I reminisce I cannot believe how long I let myself be miserable. I'd always give my best friend shit for dating a guy who was rude to her, without in a million years thinking I'd let a guy doing everything he did to me.

Assuming the sex that resulted in a pregnancy was a consensual act, I believe an argument would be that by choosing to have sex, you assume the responsibility of anything that results from that. This would include pregnancy and any complications.

I guess that's not how it works, though.  Maybe I'm just wired differently.

I think that pregnancy and your example of the foreskin ripping during intercourse are more comparable to each other.

You would also have no way to prove the pregnancy resulted from sex with your significant other from a legal stand point. 

You can ask him to contribute and it would be nice for him to do so but he is in no way obligated to. You can try to sue him if you feel it's necessary but odds are all this is going to do is end your relationship.

My advice is to go to the hospital, apply for charity care, and work out a payment plan with them.

Tonight my SO and I are writing out a contract that states 2 things: 1) if i were to get pregnant, we would terminate it unless we BOTH agree to follow through with the pregnancy.  And 2) in the event of a termination or health complication due to the pregnancy, we would both be financially responsible for the medical expenses.

It may not be conventional- and i dont know if it would even hold up in court if either of us tried to go against it... but it makes me glad that we are together on this.  At this point in our lives, i think we trust each other not to need a contract.. but who knows what will happen in the future.

Regardless of that, my SO and I were on the same page on what to do if the pregnancy was viable.  We had a verbal agreement before we starting having sex.

I really view everything pregnancy related to be a partnership, though- even if the law disagrees.  There's a lot of grey area, obviously.  Do I think it's fair that a woman can get an abortion if the father really wants the child? No.  But honestly there isn't really a good solution in a situation like that.

If you haven't signed a contract with someone (not married), then as far as the law is concerned, you're just two strangers. I think having the kind of relationship where both people are on the same page is extremely important and valuable. But it gets dangerous if you try to bring the law in between two people who do not have that legally-binding contract with one another. A father can be anything from a committed partner in a LTR, to a man who only met the mother one time, at conception. If a father is required to cover an abortion, for example, then wouldn't it be reasonable to require a woman to provide a written consent form before having the procedure? But of course we do not want to live in a world like that. We do not want to require a man's legal consent for a woman to do *anything.* The necessary consequence is that men are not held to any of the responsibilities/privileges concerning parenthood. Unless, once again, there is a marriage contract, which is entered into purposefully and willingly.

For instance, a man who suspects he has fathered a child but was not married to the mother or named on the birth certificate can apply for a declarator which, if granted, gives him the same legal rights as the mother. Similarly if both mother and father agree that the father is the father and he is named on the certificate then he has the same rights as the mother. In terms of cohabiting couples, if you are to all outward appearances married (ie having a sexual relationship, paying bills together and living together) then you do in essence have all the same rights as a married couple.

Also, I could be enjoying the wine a little too much, but did your post mention your telling your SO about the pregnancy? If so, what was his reaction to it, how did he feel? Did he run screaming for the hills?

You would be surprised how many men, especially the good ones, demand to be able to pay for the bill. Don't let them, not as a controlling method but if you want to say you are equal to him, you should pay for half or whatever portion you can muster up as compared to their income. ",1,t3_23sam9

I realize that might not make a ton of sense, but grieving for someone can change the way you respond and react to a lot of things, so being bothered by what he did is something I can empathize with. However, I can also sympathize with him... sometimes you just flat out don't want to go to work, and if it requires an excuse, well, that sucks. 

He may not have wanted to tell his boss that he was taking a day to deal with personal stuff -- instead of making himself look weak, he sort of transferred that aspect to you instead and said he needed to take care of you. A bit odd, but I can kind of see where he might have been coming from.

My opinion is that using another person's comparatively much larger misfortune (death of relative) to make a personal petty non-issue (not wanting to go to work) much better is disrespectful and dishonorable. IMO sympathy is not benefitting from someone else's misfortune.

I meant to say in the OP that I'm thousands of miles away, or I would be teaching her to drive. It's hard for me to even imagine not being able to drive or having someone able to teach you. 

Nannying does sound like the best idea in terms of skills she has. Maybe she could even become a live-in nanny later on. 

I've mentioned getting out/getting exercise to her, having been depressed myself I know how hard it can be to get going.

Plus, because it doesn't get the root (obviously) it grows back quick. I've found hair to grow back quicker with a removal cream than shaving actually.

At the moment I really don't remove my hair in that area, I just trim all over and shave the bikini line and any other bits to make everything look neat and even. I used to wax professionally but stopped because I couldn't really afford to keep going. Waxing was 100% the best way. It doesn't hurt professionally in my opinion (that was me removing everything) but my pain tolerance is high. I have (and do) also epilated down there. I use one that can go in the shower. This CAN be very painful. But, after I did it once or twice I got used to it and it's just not that painful anymore (I also epilate my underarms). After waxing and epilating so much the stubble from just shaving was a lot softer, but still gets to the point where it feels like sandpaper to the touch. It just didn't hurt/irritate me growing through.

I decided to just stop removing everything though because I've not seen myself with a bush in years. I actually prefer myself with it than without it as long as I keep it neat and trimmed.",2,t3_23u24q

Boric acid is poisonous to eat, but I've heard great anecdotal reports of it working well for BV and it is safe to use vaginally.  You have to make your own capsules, get size zero gel caps, try asking at a pharmacy or health food store.  Fill them with boric acid (aka ""Borax"" in the laundry aisle) then put one inside your vagina every night for five days at least.  I don't know if it kills the bad over growing bacteria or just acidifies the environment to support growth of the good bacteria.  It certainly isn't harmful.  

Bacteria love dark, wet, warm places.  So try to air out the vulva all you can!  It might be hard to go commando during the day with the discharge, but try to do that at night or around the house.  And DEFINITELY avoid scented hygiene products- soap, tampons, pantiliners.  Try only washing your genitals with water- no soap- while things are trying to clear up.  The fragrances just make the good bacteria crap out more easily.  Douching can make the problem worse because it washes all good bacteria away as well.

For fucks sake. I am sorry, this is the 10th time I have seen this mistake made this this week and it really bothers me, so I'm about to get passive agressive/rude. ""Homoeopathic"" is not the word you are looking for.

Homoeopathic â  Herbal medicine. Homoeopathic â  Alternative medicine. Homoeopathic â  Holistic medicine. Homoeopathic= tap water and a waste of money.

Boric acid, Apple cider vinegar and Probiotics will help treat BV. A vaginal gel like [acijel](http://www.acijel.com.au/) can offer great releif. These are Alternative, Natural remedies, they are not homoeopathic. These are available OTC. You can ask your chemist if they sell antibiotic creams safe for vaginal use, we don't have these in Australia because we don't tend to use anti-biotics quite as much, but I hear creams like that can be OTC at some pharmacies.

If yoghurt soaked tampons help, but not as much as you'd like, Buy some pro biotic tablets from the chemist (Like Inner Health Plus), and take them vaginally.

What you need though, is anti-biotics. I'm so sorry America is a third world country when it comes to basic health care for its citizens. This will be a daft comment, but being a foreigner I must ask, Isn't this sort of thing what Planned Parenthood normally helps with? affordable sexual healthcare.

OP, make sure you are taking good care of your genitals, as it will help speed up recovery, [this fact sheet](http://mshc.org.au/Portals/_default/uploads/fact_sheets/genital_skin_care_a4.pdf) is my bible. Be aware that BV makes you more susceptible to PID, which can cause infertility.",8,t3_23tgw6

20140424100401,intirb,"So.. my first impulse was to agree with some other commenters that this isn't sexism.  But then I tried a thought experiment:

Let's switch this scenario to a T-shirt that makes negative comments (""jokingly"") about black people.  And the company *also* offers the same exact T-shirt, but about white people instead.

If someone were walking around wearing that first shirt, the one with negative comments about black people, would you find it racist?  If the person then tried to justify that shirt by saying ""well, a white version exists too"", would that be an acceptable excuse?  Does the answer depend on who the wearer of the shirt is (e.g. on their race)?  

My general feeling is that if a white person chooses to wear a shirt with negative comments about black people, that's racist regardless of the existence of another similar shirt about white people.  I'm not sure if the mere existence of these shirts is racism necessarily, but in this context it's at least very problematic, since it very easily allows for people to express hurtful and racist views while using the existence of the second shirt as an excuse.

So.. can we apply the same logic to the fangirl shirt, or is there something about sexism that is fundamentally different than racism?  Maybe the problem is that there's no ungendered way to refer to a fan-person, and this shirt is just exposing how our needlessly gendered terms are problematic in and of themselves.

I think now I'm inclined to think that while the existence of this shirt is merely problematic, any male wearing it is probably being sexist.  The problem isn't the shirt, exactly (free speech and all that), but the people choosing to wear it.",136,t3_23uoad

I agree that the two forms of oppression often manifest very differently, and I openly questioned the comparison specifically because I realized in my thought process that the analogy might not apply directly.  The prevalence of gendered language was the main difference I thought was applicable to this particular scenario, but I'm happy to discuss others that you have in mind.  

I don't think that sexism and racism are equivalent or that the experiences of one are similar to the other.  I do generally believe movements against all forms of oppression can learn from one another, *but I agree that this must be done carefully*.  In my analogy above, I tried to make sure that the target of negativity and scrutiny in this case was directed at a person of privilege (a white man wearing a racist shirt) and avoided using any actual ""negative comments about black people"" merely to make a point.  

You might rightfully note that simply avoiding saying bad things about black people doesn't mean I can use the example of racism to aid in my understanding of sexism and other forms of oppression, and you could be right.  Maybe I could have made my point just as effectively (or less effectively but more appropriately) without making an analogy to racism at all, or maybe comparisons to racism are best left to those who actually experience it.

To clarify, I was saying that if the term was ""fanperson"", this shirt would probably not be sexist.  I was suggesting a way that sexism differs at least slightly from racism, in that it is typically more culturally acceptable to refer to people in gendered terms (""policewoman"", ""fanboy"") than in racialized ones.  This cultural practice is, however, in itself problematic, because it means that if you want to express your opinion about (e.g.) fanpeople in general, you now also have to pick a gender for the term or use something cumbersome like ""fanboys and fangirls"".",8,t3_23uoad
20140424113805,MeloJelo,"Except the example you used was ""black person,"" which would mean the shirt says you hate someone for a characteristic that they cannot control instead of for their behaviors (i.e., being obnoxious and saying X-BOX IS HITLER).

If you had a shirt that said, ""I hate rude people"" I think that would be more in-line with the reason for hatred.",11,t3_23uoad
20140424114422,intirb,"The example I used was ""negative comments about black people"".  So to extend your ""rude people"" example, it would be like making a shirt that said: ""I hate rude black people"" or ""I hate rude women"".

",9,t3_23uoad
20140424140008,MeloJelo,"But the term ""fangirl/boy"" specifically mentions gender. Just calling them ""fans"" means something different. ""Fanperson"" isn't a widely used term. ",10,t3_23uoad
20140424141039,intirb,"Right.  I think we're agreeing but somehow still misunderstanding each other.  Fanperson isn't a term at all - I just made it up to illustrate a point.  I wouldn't expect anyone to use that term or call anyone a sexist for not using it.  But I would still call a man sexist for using ""fangirl"" disparagingly without mentioning ""fanboys"" in a similar way - just because our language is (inappropriately and problematically, in my opinion) gendered, it doesn't mean you can use that as an excuse to single out one (already discriminated) group.

I'm a huge horror fan. One day, at a party, my friend introduced me to a friend of hers who is also a huge horror fan.

No greeting, no pleasantries, just - bam - 'prove yourself'!

It struck me as odd because I highly doubt his first reaction to meeting another male horror fan would be to quiz him to confirm his status as a 'true horror fan' by his definition.

It also had a real 'gate keeper' aspect to it. As though it was already well established that his fandom was legitimate - that should've gone without saying - and that he was some sort of authority to judge whether I would be considered a 'true horror fan' or not.

>Q: Do I need permission from my parents, husband or partner to have an abortion? Will the clinic contact anyone else?
>A: No. You may decide to discuss your decision with others, but the clinic will not contact anyone without your permission.

>Q: Is there a point at which I can no longer have an abortion?

In Ontario, a valid Ontario Health Insurance Plan card (OHIP) will cover 100% of the cost of service in hospitals or in a licensed clinic. Non-licensed clinics charge a fee. For a breakdown of coverage in Canada, please click here: Access to Abortion in Canada.

It's tough to be young and deal with this. You're going to have to advocate for your health care, and you'll have to be very careful about your privacy.  Teenagers are vicious when it comes to pregnancy rumors. If you're in over your head, get in contact with your school's counselor. They'll have to keep your information private. And be sure to ask and make sure if the counselor is legally required to keep your conversations private. (I don't know what the laws are in Canada)

When you visit the doctor: ALWAYS write down the questions you have for the doctor and your expectations for the visit. Having a written copy always helps make sure all your questions are answered and all your issues are assessed.

You're not alone. I'm a person who thinks when you want to a baby is a choice every woman should be able to make. If you're not ready to have a child, then don't have a child. Go and get an abortion ASAP. If you're ready to have a child, but not ready to raise it, then adoption is an excellent path to take. It can offset the cost of prenatal care.

The choice is yours and yours alone.  Whatever you do choose please, please consider your birth control practices. It appears that you're quite fertile, so maybe your current method (no method, pulling out, condoms, or not absolutely perfect pill use) is just not cutting it for your lifestyle.

I also fainted a lot the first few months, and morning sickness was hell (had to take a break to go to the bathroom every hour or so, and puked in class a few times).

That's just what I went through, some people have it better and some have it worse. There are a lot of possible complications that can arise during pregnancy. There's also the social part of it: I was shunned and made fun of by many kids at school. The ones that didn't make fun of me were happy that I was having a baby and touched my belly all the time... strangers touching my belly made me very uncomfortable. Also teachers sucked, some didn't let me go to the bathroom when I needed to because even though I was pregnant ""I brought it upon myself"" (because both my bc methods failed?) and other ""fun stuff"" like that.

She faces social ostracism and then, if she chooses to adopt, there's a whole host of emotional troubles that often come with that. It's not an easy process, and she'll be left with a pretty torn up body (that will heal) and hormones telling her she's supposed to have a baby to care for but no child, and a lot of conflicting emotions. It's a great option for those who choose it, but it's not an option everyone can face. 

Neither is raising a child at 15. If she does that, she's facing all of the above plus the responsibility to care for a baby at the age of 15 and she's basically in a position where if she wants a university education, that's out of the question for a while anyway.

20140425012030,roomtorun,"I'm really sorry you're going through this - I've been there, it's a tough place to be.  I've had my share of interviews over the years (I've been on Wall St for ~10 years now), and there have been some down right traumatic ones, especially around 2008 when it seemed like I had to interview and re-interview with my current boss, or just hired replacement boss, constantly, just to justify holding down my current job.  But in the end, I've found a few tricks that have really helped me, since, anytime I am looking for a job change, I've been able to find myself in a multiple offer scenario, often jumping my income enormously in the process.  I hope they help you too.

First, it's been my experience that those doing the interviewing often make up their mind over whether or not to hire you within minutes of first meeting you to talk.  Whether it's an introduction, or a quick background, they are often looking for someone articulate, engaging and confident.  For me, it took quite a few interviews to be able to come up with a 2 liner of sorts of who I was, what I wanted, and where I saw myself in 5 years.  This helped to get out in front of the questions, and control the direction of the interview somewhat.  And you can obviously tailor this spiel to whatever position you're applying for, depending on what your end goal is.

I would second the advice here, that needing extra time to answer a question is perfectly normal, and often times seen as a great strength.  No one likes a know it all, so showing some humanity and needing a second to think on the spot isn't a huge ask in the least.  I've even used this to show some extra thought when I feel like a particular question was lobbed that is extra sensitive to the hiring process, such as when handling conflict comes up, or when a ""what is your biggest challenge"" type surfaces, even if I instantaneously had an answer ready.

Approach, in my experience, has made a world of difference.  If I go into an interview nervous, it is because I feel like I need to beg for the hiring manager's mercy, I am not in control of the situation, and the anxiety is all consuming, borderline suffocating.  Instead, if I prepare, plan out my intro spiel in advance, brainstorm a main message to circle back to, to ""close the loop"" so to speak, on why I would be the best hire for a job, I find things go much better.  I'm not saying this is easy, we women, by nature, do not like to be, or even appear to be, boastful.  But look at it as listing the facts, if you had to verbally jot down 3 things you've done recently at your current job, what would they be?  

As an example: often I am able to tie back my past performance/experience in dollar/time terms (and again this is something that would have to be tailored to the job for which you are interviewing), so I can illustrate value.  ""Describe for me your responsibilities in your last position, why are you looking to leave?""  ""Well, I was responsible for xx% of work flow regarding to a, b, and c projects for d, e, f clients.  While I was not the lead on all, I was behind the scenes, making sure those in the driver's seat had the most accurate information, to not only engage with the client, but to under promise on deliverables, so that expectations could be exceeded, time and again.  This resulted in our team being awarded $xxxxx amount of additional business over the span of x months.  And while this team is very strong, the people are great to work with, and I've even found myself with a few new role models, I have this plan to be in this place in 5 years, as we talked about earlier, and I want to make sure I am continually advancing in expanding my skill set.  Your team here is doing this abc project which is of great interest to me, I think I could particulary help in regards to xyz component, would you mind elaborating a little on that component, if you have time?""  This approach has worked time and again for me, and I make sure to mention whatever component we discussed in my thank you letters to underscore what I'm bringing to the table.  

My main take away though has been this: interviewers are people too, they want to feel like they are making a difference in the world, and that they are important.  In circling back to how you phrase things to close the loop on why you would be a great hire, try to think of the report this interviewer has to give back to his/her boss later in the day.  ""Oh, you met with this person?  How was she?  Where was she at her last job?  What could she do for us?""  Think of it as a mad lib, if you can give the interviewer snippets he/she can automatically file away mentally to use later on without any extra effort on his/her part, you are already adding value to the firm, and will stand out later when decisions for 2nd/3rd/4th round interviews are made.

And even if you don't get this job, think of it as practice, as others have said.  To be real, it took me ~30 interviews to nail my pitch.  20 to get my initial spiel down and cut down on nerves, but those last 10 were the secret.  Once I found what I wanted my main message to a potential employer to be, it became less of a script, and more of a guideline as to how I presented myself, internalizing it.  And that alone calmed anxiety and allowed me to walk in knowing I could show my best chops.  Think of interviewing less as a random event in life that you may only do a handful of times, say like going to the circus, who really goes to the circus every year?  And instead, look at it as internalizing what your plan for your future is.  Once you have your spiel down, you'll be surprised at where you can drop snippets of it at, especially when it comes to networking.

My most recent example of this was late last summer, I interviewed at 5 different firms over the span of 2 months, going through round after round on each (some went as high as 5 rounds), and at the end of it, literally had 5 offers to choose from, which was an amazing place to be.  When you can demonstrate value up front, and can tie to real data points hiring managers can use, it creates an aura of excitement around you that is infectious.  Word gets around to others involved, so each subsequent round, the interviews become less onerous, as the gates come down one by one.  And in the end, I've often found, salary then becomes a passing discussion point, but that could be another lengthy post in its entirety, and this is already long, so apologies.

If you ever want someone to bounce a practice session or two off of, I'm happy to help.  It may sound corny, but practice does make perfect!  Best of luck!",6,t3_23u4s4

If I get asked something I don't have a ready answer for, I usually start by saying that it's a really good question, and it's the first time I've been asked that. That gives me a bit of time to work out whether I can tweak any of the answers I have prepped to fit that question.

20140424091905,UglyFriend,"I've just been through a period of several months of applications and interviews, and screwed up plenty myself. The best advice I can think of is - don't just apply for the jobs that you really want. If you can afford the time, apply to anything and everything that's even remotely relevant to your skill set, and use them all as practice for improving yourself.

With every job I applied for, I realised more skills I had based on each ad's desirable qualities, and could therefore improve my resume and interview techniques with each following round. Not every application led to an interview, and not every interview progressed past the first round. But some did, and this gave me the confidence to keep going and helped me reflect on what I did better this time than last time.

Plus, some of the jobs I applied for looked great on paper, but didn't sound great after the first interview (remember that you're interviewing them, too). Others sounded average on paper, but I had a great rapport with the interviewer and liked more about the company as I heard more.

20140424021524,mariekeap,"Hi OP, welcome to the great white north! Have you considered working through your traumas with a social worker/psychologist/psychiatrist? Your innate fear of doctors is understandable, but unfortunately it sounds like it is also damaging. I wouldn't want to give you any trouble for not going, because that would just be counterproductive and cruel. 

However, I do urge you to keep looking and start working on your mental health. I wouldn't be worrying that there's anything wrong with you, but when you do feel ready you should go. Start setting small goals for yourself. You don't have to jump right in with a full physical either. You could go and meet the doctor, get your blood pressure taken and all that first and then decide if you're ready to continue at another appointment. It's great that you don't have a family history but unfortunately the vast majority of cancers (90%) are spontaneous. With that said, they also mostly happen in the elderly so don't freak out. Catching things early is key though! 

Something else that might help you is that a lot of male GPs are now hiring female nurse practitioners who can perform physicals. That's what I do with my doctor! I see him to talk about my overall health, prescriptions and my mental health progress. I then make an appointment with the NP for physicals (about every two years I think they recommend, or whenever you're concerned obviously). It made me much more comfortable for my first 'big girl' checkup. ",8,t3_23u62w
20140424022537,Ayaas,"My problem with a social worker is that social services once took us (my brothers and I) away from my father and we were assigned to a shrink with my father. A family therapist or something of that sort. 

She told the court that my father, who beat my brothers mercilessly up until that point and then after we were returned to him among other numerous abuses, was a stable parent and that his children were lying. 

I'd rather spread my legs for a doctor than I would open my mouth for a therapist! 


That all being said, I know my health is at risk because of all this. But between my legs is me. No one's seen that but those I've given consent to. 

And I know the psychological defenses in that statement (not being able to consult a therapist due to my problems I started researching to improve stability) but darned it.  

It's a war that wages inside of me. On the one hand there's no family history of anything (we're absolutely bonkers but physically fit as a fiddle) but on the other hand history develops from folk who thought they couldn't get sick. ",2,t3_23u62w

That person should be imprisoned for her lies, but she is *not* representative of therapists as a whole. Why does one bad person mean all people who are in the same job are bad? 

The only way for you to truly be healthy is to start working through your past and those fears. Physically, you are probably just fine. It's understandable why your brain has put up these walls and generalizations, and common in cases of childhood abuse (that's the only way it can come up with to protect itself). There are people that specialize in this area of abuse. It's hard to imagine how you could ever be comfortable giving that consent to a doctor unless you can learn to disassociate the bad doctor you saw as a child from all doctors. ",8,t3_23u62w

STI testing can often be done with a specific urine sample or blood sample, that's a good way to start. Work your way up to the pap smear later, and bring your partner with you to it. Inform your doctor about your issues, so that you can avoid having a terrifying experience, and book a longer appointment, so you can go over everything slowly. Any doctor you call will understand completely if you feel more comfortable with a female doctor, too.

You also need to get up-to-date on all childhood vaccinations that you might not have received, especially rubella if you are planning to have children. If you've had all of them, about at your age, you're due another diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus/polio booster :) Think about it: Preventative medicine means you don't have to go to the doctor a lot, which is always great.

20140424123515,mariekeap,"First of all, breast cancer is only one of many many illnesses in the world. ""Over treatment"" is ridiculous sounding because no doctor would prescribe chemo and/or radiation without a positive biopsy. Why is ""over screening"" a huge problem? It's free and there are no risks in going to your doctor every couple of years to get thinks checked out. By the time most people notice anything is wrong it's usually much later than it could have been had they gone to their doctor. ",2,t3_23u62w
20140424125902,mariekeap,"All those articles really pointed out is that doctors need to improve their informed consent (which I fully agree with). I suspect that fully informed, many people would still choose to go through with screening because the risks associated with cancer are generally higher than the risks associated with it not being cancer. It also supported some cancers like colorectal and cervical, the latter having  the common STD HPV associated with it. 

Let me phrase it another way. You have two options, both of which are at zero cost to you thanks to the country OP lives in.

1) get a routine check up, a small pre-cancerous skin lesion is found and removed a few weeks later. Doctors can never be sure if it would develop into full-blown melanoma. The procedure was a little painful, but overall you only missed half a day of work.

2) you finally go to the doctor after several months of terrible headaches and abdominal pain - cancer that started out as a simple removable skin lesion has metastasized to the brain and liver. 

My point here is that when you have the option to go and get looked over - why wouldn't you? General physicians also look for and help with far more things than just deadly illnesses. At OP's age the only cancer they'd be keeping an eye out for is cervical anyway, which is one of the cancers that benefits very highly from early screening. They're someone who keeps up-to-date with your medical history and observes any patterns that may start to crop up. They're someone who (at least at my doctor's office) screens for any new mental health symptoms that should be addressed. There is no downside to going into see a GP once every couple years. There are many downsides with never going.

Of course it is OP's decision and if you look at my other comments you'll see that I have stated that more than once.

You'll likely be very nervous when you go (since you haven't been since you were a kid) and that's ok.  Tell them.  Tell the nurse, tell the doctor - it will help you relax and you're not the first person who has ever come in after years and years of not having a check up.  A whole physical, start to finish, even including the pap smear will be over in 10-15 minutes.  And then you can go back to your day!  Odds are if everything is in the clear, you won't have to go back for a few years.

It's also good to get a baseline idea of what your blood pressure, cholesterol, liver enzymes, and so on are doing, because getting a more long-term look at it can help doctors treat the things that tend to come up as people age more effectively. 

I saw that you don't want a Pap smear, and that's ok. I'm not going to try to pressure you into it, because you're young and pretty low-risk anyway. That said, getting comfortable enough with a doctor that you would allow them to do a pelvic exam or Pap smear is a very good idea because several conditions require them to give you an exam, and it would be better if you don't ever have to choose between being in a very emotionally distressful position and a physically dangerous one. As you get older, your risk of things like fibroids will increase, so it will eventually become important that you are able to allow doctors to do what they need to do.

I think if you have something you know is not right make yourself go.  If you are healthy, well, it's your body do as you please.  ",1,t3_23u62w

You can get away to some extent if you frame it in the positive I.e. ' I've really enjoyed hanging out with you, but I have found it harder recently because of...       ..  Is something up?

Cuz it also would help me suss out whether I'm wrong and she DOES have some deeper issue that's causing her to act this way - I would hate to have assumed that she's ""just unreliable"" and it turns out she actually does have some issue. She did once talk to a counselor about separation anxiety from being an only child... But I would think that would make her WANT to hang out with people rather than cancel on them all the time.

Thanks for the advice! I take your point about people not reacting well to measured criticism - I do tend to agree with you and I'm also not particularly aggressive, so it's not in my nature to confront people with criticisms that aren't immediately pressing. ",1,t3_23uky7
20140424100526,Bitterposer,"Some people are just selfish.  They grow up around lax parents, and they date people who put up with their shit, and they have forgiving friends, so .... they just never learn how to behave. 

The only advice I've learned in dealing with these people is to draw strict boundaries.  If you are scheduled to do something at 8:00, and she's not there by like 8:15, just leave without her.  She can't be mad at you for that, and she'll shape up next time.  Also, don't make plans where you have to rely on her. ",4,t3_23uky7
20140424185540,howmanytimess,"Yeah - for the past few months I've been using these tactics to preserve my sanity. I don't plan to hang out with her alone if I can help it so that when she bails I'm not totally ditched; we've pulled the pretend-event-starts-an-hour-earlier thing once when we really had to (I don't like the dishonesty/treating her like a child but it worked and we would've apparently been an hour late otherwise); etc. Thing is she has no shame, and what happens is the group makes plans, she's invited so if she shows up it's a bonus, and because it's relaxed there's no consequence when she shows up really late because we're just all here hanging out not depending on her anyway. So yeah like you said - forgiving friends etc. 

You are SPOT on with the lax parents and dating people who put up with their shit! ",1,t3_23uky7
20140424121403,Incomprehensibilitea,"Eh, I find the best way to deal with flakey people is to acknowledge what they are like and find ways to deal with it in my own mind. If you expect this girl to behave like you would (or a normal person) you are going to be disappointed, so continuing to have these expectations is only hurting you. So I would assume from now on that your friend is going to be late or bail on you. I would use that when I'm deciding whether to hang out with her. Say she wants to meet at a certain place for coffee, I would think, ""Well is there anything to do around there that I would like to do if she doesn't show up?"" If the answer is no, don't go. If well, you know there's a theater right there and a movie is playing and that could be fun...I'd go for coffee, drink a coffee, and if she doesn't show up in 10-15 minutes, I'd go do my own thing. If that's too much work, I'd say fuck her and just stop making plans. I would not however have some kind of come-to-Jesus conversation about her character flaws. She knows already. 

I guess part of it depends on what kind of relationship you want to have. This girl isn't ever going to be good best friend material. But if she's fun and you do have a good time when you hang out with her, think of her kind of as like a fuck buddy sans fucking. You don't have obligations to one another and that can be liberating for you too. ",2,t3_23uky7
20140424185636,howmanytimess,"I like your fuck buddy sans fucking analogy. You're right that letting go will probably help me just enjoy her company more when I do have it. She's pretty much downgraded to happy-to-see-her-at-parties friend at this point. ",1,t3_23uky7

That doesn't feel great in terms of our friendship... and I know sometimes this can make me feel really frustrated. Is it something we can work on?"" It may be something she's aware of - or not - and it may or may not be a thing she can change (or is willing to change). For me - I chose to let the friend like this stop ruining things for me... spending time waiting for her, or having her command attention on my birthday outings by calling my friends to talk about why she was late and on & on. She was late and missed my birthday brunch because she decided to stop for breakfast on the way... (Seriously.)

20140424190350,howmanytimess,"Oh my GOD that sounds like my friend. Always stopping for food on the way to food and she thinks it'll make a funny, charming story and therefore we'll forgive her. She has derailed so many plans by pulling over for food or whatever and just thinks it's funny! 

I like your last sentence very much and it encapsulates where I'm trying to get to with her. I do appreciate the times we've had :) Going to have a think about whether it warrants a talk-talk. She's fully aware that she's the unreliable one but I don't think she gets that it's not funny any more or cool/respectful in an adult world, and her elementary school friends who used to put up with her being late for english class because she was getting extra food from the cafeteria during recess, aren't helping her with her adult relationships. 

I think it may be a good idea to talk to her because there may be a chance she can change - I'm not going to wait around for it but it could happen and that would benefit the other people in her life. She doesn't pull this kind of shit on her boyfriend, she's not chronically late to work, when her boyfriend's family invites her to dinner she's there on time (often cancels on us BECAUSE of such invites) - so she clearly knows how to show respect to certain people. I guess I'm just not high on that list.

She may (benefit of the doubt) just assume that folks know she's eternally a ""maybe"" to outings, and that this is fine with everyone. 
I was totally not amused by waiting around for this friend to call and tell us where she was (late) or ask for directions from wherever she was coming from (late), leaving us standing around places waiting so we wouldn't start the process again by having her find us somewhere else. We also spent a half hour looking for her one night when she did show up, because she had decided people were too much and had gone to sit outside the bar reading manga (sat night, in the city) - did not communicate this to anyone. Sigh. I opted out of dealing with this lack of consideration sooner than some mutual friends, who continued to deal with the same thing - and were permanently frustrated or let down.  It is possible in your situation that if you stop putting in the effort, that will sort of be the end of it... because it doesn't sound like she's doing much on her end.

20140428092747,foxes722,"My friend and I talked about it a little. There was some anxiety/depression stuff playing into this on her end - which I actually understand pretty well. So I had asked her to just be honest about what was going on - not to make up excuses or say that she was going to come out if she wasn't. (A lot of the time, it was really weird excuses for canceling and it was clear something else was going on.)
This stuff is not really easy to change and it wasn't really something she was working on - and because it made things really stressful trying to include her, I stopped asking her to things. She was never someone who initiated spending time or planned anything on her own, so as soon as the effort stopped on my end - that was pretty much it. But one person can't carry a friendship!

""Huh?"", you might say (I know I did) ""How can telling more people about the dangers of smoking make more people smoke?"" and the psychology was explained to me that, for a certain segment of the population, the more you explained, the more attractive you made smoking for them.  I guess they think ""Hey, smoking is scary and dangerous?  I want to be scary and dangerous, so I should smoke""

1.  Many women active online (whether in games, by blogging, commenting on social media sites, writing for major media outlets, etc.) receive absurdly abusive messages from (male) users attacking them and their arguments on the basis of their gender and using gendered statements (""get back in the kitchen,"" ""tits or gtfo,"" ""you must be on the rag"") and threats (""rape"") to attack women.  There are no statistics simply because it's impossible to quantify such a massive amount of data, particularly when it can't be tracked.

2.  Investors simply aren't as willing to put their money into start-ups owned/run by women than they are by companies owned and run by men.  It takes a LOT of money to begin a successful start-up on a major scale; basically, investors are paying the salaries of 5 or more people (who usually make about $50,000 a year and more in some states like CA) to code, manage, and network a site for a year or more before the site/app/service begins earning a positive revenue stream.  That's simply how long it takes.  Your average webdev doesn't have the money set aside to take a year in order to pursue their own interests and begin a business, nor do they have the funds to support several other developers through that same period of time.  Investors are vital to start-ups.  If investors are less willing to invest in women's start-ups, less women are actually able to become entrepreneurs.

I'm not saying he didn't do this, but I can completely see why the university isn't just decided to expel him. I'm not sure if maybe she just decided not to pursue it criminally or if there just wasn't enough evidence, but the best thing would have been to pursue it that way.

He violated 4 terms of conduct (put quickly: physical harm, non-consensual sexual touching, rape or violent non-consensual sexual acts, and illegal possession of drugs or alcohol, but you can read the specific rhetoric in the link.) They have the right to rule how they see fit in whether they would like to reprimand, suspend or expel the student based on these infractions as they were laid out to him at matriculation.

***

Along the same line, it's perfectly reasonable for the victim, and others, to be shocked at the leniency of the ruling in this instance. Even in Brown's history specifically (again, as stated in the article) instances of rape have resulted in expulsion. The board recommended *two years* suspension, but ""senior associate dean of student life, reduced the sentence to a one-year suspension.""",2,t3_23vyyb
20140425110501,misseff,"I did read the article, and a couple of other ones to get a better understanding of why it wasn't pursued criminally. The point is that if we accept the university as having authority to ""rule"" on these issues, then we can't just expect them to turn around and cater to public opinion once their decision has been made. Doing so undermines the legitimacy of the system. To be clear, *I* don't think it should be this way, but that is how it is when we allow universities to have authority on these matters. In another article I read that the victim said she was encouraged to go through the university *instead of* the police and consequently only filed a report months later. To me, that is way more outrageous than hearing that people that are probably not competent to make a decision made a shitty decision. It shouldn't have been up to them in the first place.

Either way, let's say they fold under pressure and go with what people are asking for -- they expel this guy who was already punished according to their code(regardless of whether we think that was sufficient, it's what happened). What if next time they find that the guy is a rapist and expel him, and then there are protests saying he should be let back in, that there wasn't enough evidence, etc.?  Then the precedent has already been set that the university's decision isn't final. 

I don't even think that's the most damaging thing, the worst part to me is that someone could be found to be a rapist under these processes and their only/worst consequence is getting expelled, because the completely incompetent and irresponsible people at the university are *encouraging* victims to not go to the police.",2,t3_23vyyb

I think overturning his sentence is a small drop in the bucket in order to make this woman feel safer, but I think what really needs to happen is that this case should field enough outrage to get a reform started on their policies of dealing with violent crimes.

To put it into perspective I knew a boy who was a student at BYU. He got caught stealing a dvd from the university book store and what happened to him? Two semester suspension along with mandated sessions with a school counselor, watching a series of videos on theft, and writing an essay about why his actions were wrong and how he feels he can change in the future. So his University literally has a stiffer penalty for petty theft than Brown has for *violent rape*.

Odd side note: He went to court for it as well, but wasn't convicted (he's a bit lucky that his parents are both lawyers.) I actually might ask him about because I'm curious of how it was handled. It might be more clear cut in the case of theft however, because it was the school itself levying criminal charges against him. Whereas in rape it's two private parties.",2,t3_23vyyb

If someone is stealing from the campus bookstore, the school CAN refer it to the police, but they do not HAVE to. The school can just punish him. Even though the kid has not been found guilty of a crime in a criminal court, that is irrelevant. The internal school policies are found to be sufficient due process. 
    
You may disagree that the school's internal policies are sufficient due process. But the law says that it is. The school is not jailing anyone, the school is just amending its relationship, so there is a lower due process standard. You can argue that a school's internal due process measures are inherently insufficient and all discipline should be sent to a court of law, but that is a completely different point than is being made here.

Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. If we're going to let universities handle these kinds of things(which I don't think we should), this is what happens. If you're saying that their processes are sufficient due process, then what is the issue? Their process has been completed, they've made a decision and punished the accused as they saw fit and then notified the victim of that punishment. That's what we're accepting if we accept that they can be trusted to handle these cases.

They are saying that being suspended for just over one semester is not proportionate to what the school found him guilty of. There is no call for him to go to jail or to have to register as a sex offender. There is a call for the victim to be able to finish her education without having to worry about running into her attacker on campus.
    
I agree that issues like this should not be handled by schools. Personally, I think victims often choose this route because they want to minimize damage to the attacker. If there were more ""criminal"" options besides having to testify in a court of law and the attacker being labeled a rapist for the rest of his life, then-I think-more victims would take that approach. Instead, the victim chooses the school route so that the punishment to the attacker is minimized but the victim does not have to be ""re-victimized"" by the court or by having to see her attacker regularly.
    
In a sense, getting rid of the school option before generating other options may be ""worse"" for attackers in that it will encourage the victims to bring criminal charges even when all the victim really wants is to finish her schooling without fear.

However, I don't know what the victim honestly expected to happen.  The school can't renig on their punishment of the rapist.

Practice saying no and just leaving it at that. It'll make you feel empowered.

Third, practice ""outs"" for if something like this happens again. ""Hey, it was great talking but I really have to get to class"" (even if you're not going to class). This kind of out is good if you want to keep things friendly (like if you don't want to mess up networking opportunities, etc.) In the case of this guy, with his insistent ""Why?"" line of questioning, it's ok to be more forceful. Do you really want this guy as a networking contact if he's this creepy? If you keep it super friendly with the ""out"" above, and ever see him again, he will continue to be creepy. So give it to him straight, doc. His ""Why?"" can be shot down with a curt ""I don't think that's necessary. Give me your info and I'll look you up."" Or ""I really need to get going."" Or ""I'm busy.""

He was like fifty years old and pretty sketch but somehow I ended up chilling near a pond chatting with this guy for like two hours. He told me lots of stories about his life and his plans and how he had been run out of some town after a girl made accusations about him...?? Like I said, he was sketch.

It probably wasn't a great idea to hang out in the woods with this guy, but I had been having a pretty shit day, and talking to a stranger was actually rather nice. After a while though (around when he told me about being run out of town), I got uncomfortable and wanted to leave. I was like: oh I'm gonna be walking over here now, and he decided to walk along with me. I picked up my pace a bit, he kept pace. I was pretty skeeved out at this point. Got to the bus stop and hopped on a bus going opposite the direction I wanted to go, then after a few stops hopped off and grabbed a bus in the correct direction. Never saw the guy again.

Anyway. During this whole interesting/unpleasant situation I maintained an air of relative calm due to a few key facts:

1. I kept the guy talking about himself. People like to talk about themselves, so I asked him lots of questions and he unloaded a frankly fascinating story about his life wandering the country. This kept him happy (he got to share his story!) but it also means that I didn't share anything about myself. He came out of that interaction with zero information about me.
2. Though I spent two hours talking with the guy, being polite and humoring him at times, I was ready to be absolutely, embarrassingly rude if the need came. Though I generally prefer to be friendly and polite, I would never trade assurance of my own well-being for being *nice*. You shouldn't either! If you're feeling threatened, by all means get out of there, even if you have to step on some toes/embarrass somebody/be a raging bitch/etc.
3. I have taken self defense classes, and as soon as I began to feel uncomfortable I ""planned my escape""- I knew exactly which physical actions I would take if something bad happened. I also planned the convoluted thing with the bus, because I didn't want the guy to know where I lived.

Anyway. I'm not suggesting you get yourself into a sketchy situation like that one. But maybe keep those things in mind for the next time. Asking people about themselves is a good tactic for any conversation, and the other two tips you can keep in your back pocket just in case (and both should increase your confidence when chatting with strangers!)

Two things: The generic of Seasonique (apparently) does the same thing for your endometriosis. If your doctor does not believe that to be the case, they will need to write your insurance a letter of medical necessity for them to specifically cover Seasonique for your birth control instead of the generic.

If that is not the case but you simply prefer Seasonique to the generic (but your doctor would be fine with you taking the generic too), then unfortunately you will not find ANY insurance that will cover the brand-name for free. Switching insurance won't help here, because they are not legally required to cover it if there is a generic alternative unless your doctor specifically states it as necessary. (Typically, doctors will not write these as the generic active ingredient will function the same unless there is an outlying issue - for example, if you were allergic to gluten and the generic version used gluten as a filler, they might write a letter to your insurance for the brand name).

First thing you have to do is get away from the ex that you're living with. That is never going to get any easier...
Second, distance yourself from T and W too.

T is moving on, and #2 is abusive... you have no reason to keep either of them in your life.

If finding a job at home is hard, why not look further afield? You've pretty much said you have zero ties... this could be a whole new start.

It may be a childish way to put it, but the logic is sound... every princess is going to kiss a few frogs before finding her prince. ",5,t3_23v5ub
20140424110909,damnthisshitstorm,"Honestly, in some ways I am grateful for how awful T and W have been to me because it's affirmed that I made the right choice. They're definitely out of my life, other than a lunch on the day I graduated I haven't seen or spoken to W much since she and T started dating, and #2 didn't like that I was still friendly with T when our relationship began so I had cut of contact with him a long time ago.

There are a couple of reasons I am trying to keep my job searching local to what I call ""home"" which is really both my home town where I'll be moving in with my parents, as well as my university town that's about an hour away from home town. One is that I did reach out to an old friend who I wasn't allowed to talk to while dating #2 and found out that the group of friends I stopped hanging out with after splitting with T were totally on my side in regards to all of that, and I want to force myself to be more social and get back into the group that I was, if nothing else, able to really have a good time with. Two is because I have no savings whatsoever. Three is because I do have some long term plans to apply to graduate programs quite far away from home that I would hopefully be starting Fall of next year, if I were to get accepted. 

It's like I'm teetering on the brink of not giving a fuck and living my life, but I can't get over the last bit. The competitive feelings of knowing that W just defended her thesis for her masters and is already accepted into a terminal degree program of the same sort I want to apply for soon, plus is engaged to marry the dude I married already and is all set up to have her perfect happy life. Getting over the fact that none of that matters to me is hard. ",2,t3_23v5ub

Pretty much the same rhetoric as OPs parents. Being inexperienced with the subject, I learned later I was being an ass and apologized, but at the time I really thought that if I could get him to come out, he would be happier. He always seemed so out of place and depressed.

I was an asshole unintentionally. It really came from a loving place. He did eventually come out, and is now a gay radio personality, last I heard from him.

I don't think this goes do deep as white guilt. And I don't think it's fair to call them idiots. Insensitive, sure. This also seems like territory they have never been in.

OP is very young (who actually knows themselves at 21?), admits to being outside the normal stereotype, and her parents are misinterpreting her differences as being gay and in the closet.

I'm saying that it might not come down to privilege at all, it could be that, like in my example, that they just want to make their daughter happy and SINCERELY believe she is gay.

A lot of parents say the thing that was so hard for them about their child coming out was the fear about how they would be treated.
I get that. My dad sat me down when I was 16 and he assumed I was dating my best friend -- I'm a white girl, BFF is a black man. Dad wanted me to know he absolutely, positively had no problem with it -- but he wanted to be sure I understood that other people might, and wanted me to be prepared to deal with it. That wasn't guilt of any kind on his part -- it was life experience that showed him I might get hurt. He was trying to be proactive. I think OP's mom may have been acting from that same fear and desire to protect her kid.

Doesn't make it less frustrating for this 21 year old, but it will get better, OP. I hope it turns out to be a story you and your family can laugh about eventually. You have a very loving family -- that is acting kind of bone-headed right now. ",4,t3_23wroa

His parents were like, why do you care, it'll never affect you. (He's white, as am I.) So?! He's a high school teacher in one of the poorest places in the country, his students are exactly those who would be stopped. Even if he wasn't - stop and frisk was majorly racist and terrible. It's bizarre how some parents in older generations can't fathom why you'd care about other people. Lucky for me, my mom is 64 and I'm only 23, but my compassion doesn't confuse her. If anything she's proud of me for it. 

(She was also totally cool when I came out as a lesbian, of course I've since realized I'm pansexual. I don't think she realized my attraction to women, but my asshole dad used to say ""your future boyfriend... or girlfriend"" in an uncomfortable, accusatory way.

I would tell your mom that, although you know she means well, assuming someone is gay because they don't fit the feminine mold is stereotyping and hurtful.

I'm currently a law student financing my entire legal education through student loans (~250K when it's all said and done). I know that number looks terrifying, but hear me out. The government currently has a program where your student loans are forgiven after ten years if you work for the government or a 501c3. There are many law schools, including several in the T-14 that will pay all or part of what you owe for those ten years, depending on how much you earn. You can do income-based loan repayment, where your maximum yearly loan amount is based on how much you make. 

If you have really good grades, a really good LSAT score, or ideally both, schools are handing out merit-based scholarships left and right. Application numbers are down, so to keep enrollment up, schools are working really hard to convince their best applicants to attend. And I'm not talking about some tier-3 school. Tier-1 schools, including those in the T-20, are throwing money at qualified applicants. 

If you want to be a lawyer, and I mean really want it, then nothing should stop you from pursuing your dreams. Feel free to PM if you have any questions at all related to any aspect of law school.  ",25,t3_23x33m

You can still register for the June LSAT, which I totally recommend if you're planning on applying for Fall 2015. The deadline is May 6th, and the late registration deadline is May 16th, so you have some time to think about it. As I'm sure you know, most schools do rolling admissions, so the sooner you apply, the better shot you have of getting in (though I applied in January, and it wasn't a problem). I suggest you take the June exam if you feel at-all ready, because then you can re-take it in October if you don't like your score, and still apply fairly early in the cycle.

Now every day, it will get better. 

I don't think you need to cut yourself off from your Mom and your brother unless you want to or you feel that contact with them compromises your safety.  If being in touch with them eventually feels comforting to you on some level (however flawed) that might be right for later on. If you don't want to hear from then now, good for you for just refusing their calls.  Trust your instincts to protect yourself. don't divulge your location. But you don't have to imagine ""forever."" 

I agree with the others who suggest that you bring a male friend or 2 when you go back to get your things.   

And start to think about makings your own brighter future.  LSAT studies-- you can make that happen.  You are strong and you know how to focus.

Self care-- exercise, good nutrition, getting enough sleep, spend time with people who know your circumstances and care for you.  That's more important than usual right now.

Keep making those steps in the right direction: your own apartment, securing your income stream  (need a new job since you were working with your dad? ) explore law school scholarships as you mentioned above... It's all good. You're doing great.

And consider making some time each day to enhance your mental well being.  Maybe write in a journal (have you heard about gratitude journals?) You could take up meditation for even just 10 minutes a day.  Start a habit of daily deliberate self-talk about how capable and strong you are and how you are going to create a successful life on your own. Spend time with a friend who has a pet.  Get outside when the weather is good.  Listen to your favorite music. 

 Consider cognitive therapy to interrupt yourself when you go down that path of worrying that you caused your dad's outrageous behavior, or your mom is now a target because of what you did.  You know it's not true and yet you allow yourself to think that way (understandably) but dwelling on that thinking is not good for you. When those thoughts pop into your head imagine a loud voice calling out ""stop it,"" and get your thought train back on track.

Please, whatever you take away from this, don't think for a moment that YOU tore the family apart.  Your dad did that all by himself, with some help from your mother who is acting as an enabler.  This may not mean much to you right now, and it probably even shouldn't because you've got a lot of more immediate needs to deal with, but often when someone is caught between two people they love they will take the side of the stronger, or less dependent, or the one they are most dependent upon, and victim-blame the other.  Even if the victim is their own child.  This is an enabler's way of coping with stress and conflict because they're unable to stand up to the person they're in a co-dependent relationship with.

Always my mom's (for working too late/not cooking/not doing enough chores-despite her working 60 hours a week with him retired) or mine for being a little shit (which I really was not). He fully agreed with Alec Baldwin when he called his daughter a 'little pig' and said the same about me. 

He's still never taken responsibility for it. He's only been sober for half of my life (I'm 28 now); I know he's only sober right now because after his last horrid bender, he took himself to a shitty hospital where he contracted pneumonia and almost died (this was 4 years ago). He's also completely in denial about anything he did while under the influence (such as crashing the car right through the back of the freakin' garage). He may be sober, but he'll never change. He's never once apologized for it either. Doesn't think he did anything wrong. Never will.

And I hate to say this because I know how you feel and I know you want/need your dad to change, but he won't. There is, unfortunately, nothing you can do about it. Even if he stopped being physically abusive, it wouldn't be because he really changed, it would be because he got in trouble for it. That is the problem with being raised by a narcissist.

As far as your mom's concerned, she has to do her own thing. Unfortunately, you can't really help her either. No amount of abuse from my dad (mental, not physical) could get my mom to leave him-though she claimed at one point she was saving up for a divorce.  I know you're worried about her. Mine is still trying to make up for that half of my childhood/adulthood that he messed up so badly. You can't change your mom either-she needs to realize on her own how terrible he is and then make her own break.

They can not arbitrarily drop you from health insurance. There must be a qualifying event to allow this.

The other time they can drop you is during open enrollment. Typically most heath insurance open enrollment starts the plan year at January 1. My employer is different in our plan year behind July 1. 

If they do drop you, you would have coverage through the end of the month of whatever the qualifying event date is. Due to new health care law, if they do drop you, you will receive information to sign up for COBRA. (www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/cobra.htm) You should contact the health insurance company to see if you can update your address, however the employer may be the one responsible for sending out cobra paperwork in which case it will still go to your parents address.

I had a similar issue with my ex's family.  I didn't lose weight, but was much thinner than they were when we got married.  Unfortunately, I didn't stick to my guns about not eating dessert and taking seconds when pushed on me (they were really insistent!  I grew up in a house where it would have been rude to decline after so much urging.  Although one where so much urging wouldn't have occurred.).  

Anyway, I ended up gaining quite a bit of weight when we lived by them, then losing it when we moved away.  It doesn't sound like you're going to let it change your diet and your new-found healthiness.  But just in case you were tempted... it doesn't work out well. :)

I do agree that perhaps you can just have a small portion of whatever dessert is offered.  I'm not typically that good with small portions so it didn't work for me, but if it works for you, it's probably less offensive than outright refusal.  ",4,t3_23xc9u

I like iatemysocks advice a lot.Maybe explain BMR to them a bit?Usually once you are smaller you need a smaller amount of food.The amount of food they are eating is probably ""normal"" for their body weight according to BMR and it can be pretty hard to break out of that once your body is used to that (say especially past 30 years of age),since it will do all it can to drive you nuts to eat to stay that size,for most people anyways.They should be proud you were able to turn it around at a young age.

",6,t3_23xc9u
20140424235747,iatemysocks,"I find that in general, people get more offended if you refuse things, than if you just eat a little of things. Surely you can fit a small amount of dessert into your diet, right? You won't balloon up by having half a slice of cake every few months when you visit your family, and I think it's worth it if it brings social peace. 

As for their concern about your portion sizes, I'd probably go with a white lie and tell them you just had a really huge breakfast/lunch (depending on what meal this is). Talk about how you just ate a *ton*, so you're really not very hungry yet, you could only possibly eat this much. That sort of thing. Usually that works.

If it wouldn't offend them, it might also work to just explain to them that now that you're much smaller, your appetite is just smaller as well? If there's a clear visual difference, that might work. I had to have that talk with some people when I was thinner, because I'm very short as well, and didn't need to eat that much. When I pointed out to people that I was half a foot (or more) shorter than them, let alone half their weight, it made sense why I was eating ""so little"". But on the other hand, if they're at all sensitive about their weights (or about their size difference with you), that might just sound like you're accusing them of being fat gluttons. So, you know, approach with caution.",8,t3_23xc9u
20140425014503,itsbecca,"I see your line of reasoning; however, I really really dislike the white lie approach for a few different reasons. First, those sort of justifications are really common rhetoric for individuals with eating disorders (I feel like I've said literally the EXACT thing you give as an example many times before when I was younger and dealing with anorexia.) This could have the effect of either her family either starting to read into it and taking it as proof that she IS eating disordered, when she actually isn't. It also isn't psychologically a good place to put OP in, a hiding mentality is a bad thing to start associating with your diet.

Additionally, I think in most cases lying just makes a problem worse. Obviously, there are exceptions when the truth could put your in harms way, etc, but just to ""make things easier"" generally doesn't actually make things easier in the long run. Dealing with the problem head on may be difficult, but is so much nicer for your long term psyche. ",35,t3_23xc9u

Some people I know have wonderful families they can tell anything in the entire world to, but that is not most people I know! 

When the issue is super important to you, sure, but at the same time... not everything is the most important thing to be 100% honest about. I don't tell my family loads of things, because we're all happier that way. Politics, things that might offend them needlessly, that sort of thing. If it's super important to OP that she explain to her parents how she lives a new lifestyle now, how it's different from theirs, how this means that she eats less, and how it's not unhealthy because of X, Y and Z evidence... she can.

[Check](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070616191154AABdnym) this out.  Here are some people's interpretation of that song.  

Here's the quote from Martina McBride about her thoughts:  ""And if anybody asks, you can tell them that no, she didn't jump out the window!! That thought never crossed my mind until someone asked me that after they had heard the song... **to me the song is about this woman's unbreakable spirit**, and I always thought she just left, and the window and the curtains were symbolic of her ""flying away"" and finding her freedom. I talked with the writers and that's definitely what they had in mind when they wrote the song.""

20140424203508,plainblue,"It's weird that I can't find much about it on the internet, but I remember reading the term ""Perseus complex"" years ago; it's supposed to describe men who fall for women whom they hope to somehow ""save"" with their love, like Perseus in Greek mythology rescuing Andromeda from a sea monster. I read about it in a biography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. She was a very successful poet but a complete shut-in when Robert Browning sought her out and convinced her to elope with him.  Anyway, even if a relationship begins that way--one person romantically objectifies some aspect of the other--with time together, people who are good partners together develop deeper, richer profiles of one another and transcend that initial label.  
  
For another example of a fetish turned into complex affection, there's a new documentary making the rounds called ""[Seeking Asian Female](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/seeking-asian-female/film.html).""  It's about a white guy who spends years approaching Asian women on-line. When he finally finds a Chinese woman willing to come to the States and marry him, he discovers that in order to make their relationship viable, he has to completely change his ideas about the role he expects her to play because his stereotyped fantasies did not prepare him for interacting meaningfully with a real woman.  
  
So I think you're totally right that this model of your identity and experience is reductive to the point of falsehood. It does you an offensive disservice. Whether he can move past his attachment to that branding and take you on your own terms--or whether you even want to let him try--is something you guys may have to figure out.

20140424214550,plainblue,"OP's question was, ""Is this a thing?"" and whether she should mistrust her reaction. I was just noting that it is ""a thing"" and that her instincts may well be good. I don't think trying to love someone into a new identity is ever a good plan for anyone. And for someone who wants to be a caretaker, succeeding could end his or her attraction.    
  
If this guy gets extra aroused by the notion that she's broken, and she doesn't feel like that's a fair or adequate portrait of herself, then she's stuck feeling disconnected from whatever it is he thinks he loves. Also, neither of the qualities you mention as possible fetishes are likely to make a person to whom they are attributed feel diminished or disrespected. She mentioned that she thinks of herself as pretty cool and rebuilt despite being ""damaged,"" so that this description was dismaying.  
  
Anyway, those were the points I to which I was responding. Maybe there's a ratio between significance of a fetish as a cause for attraction versus degree of independent attraction to a whole person that different people mind or accept in different measures.

This wasn't known to me until after we started dating for any of the three (2 were on the thinner side, but the third I never would have guessed it looking at her, so I woudln't say it was a physical attraction to a specific body type).

After the third one told me about it, I began to question whether there is something specific personality-wise about people who have been in that situation that makes me attracted to them. Certainly their experience has shaped them as a person, so one cannot say that it isn't always something they carry. I never really figured out an answer for myself on that one, but the pattern seemed to have broke itself, so I stopped looking for one.

It's all in the details I've found, in terms of attracting additional attention.  I also don't change my hair, keeping the same hairstyle for consistency. Secondly, it took me years to learn the locker room lingo, despite growing up with a brother.  I'm sure you have an idea of what the guys around you are into by now, pick up on it, join the conversation.  That way, the next time taunts come up, you can direct their bs to topics they actually have an opinion on, shifting the focus from you to them.  And let's face it, guys love to talk about what they're into. :)  And when it comes to division of labor type stuff, all the ""make me a sandwich!"" type crap?  I let it roll off my back.

Seriously, *seriously,* this is not an issue. In fact, the only issues I see in this post are 1) how sad it is that you're so upset that you have pubic hair, and 2) how miserable you are trying to keep it shaved and exfoliated. 

We all have something different about us! Me, after having kids, I ended up with starburst stretch marks all over my stomach. I'm sure I could see 100 women's tummies, and mine would be the only one with stretch marks *all over.* But, you know what? It doesn't change who I am! My husband has never been like, ""Hmm, you know what? I think we'd better keep the light off during sex because I don't want to see your stomach."" The only purpose hating my stretch marks would serve is to make myself stressed miserable. 

There are women who come on here who are upset because they have large clits or puffy labia or dark buttholes. Come on. We are human beings--animals! Should we spend our lives hating every animalistic trait about ourselves? 

Flip the situation in reverse. If you met a man you were attracted to who was upset because his chest was hairier than other men's, would you use that as a reason not to date him? Or what if you liked a guy who was worried because he didn't have any body hair, and most men do? Would you use that as a reason to not go out with him? People are people, and everyone has different characteristics. Get over your own abnormalities, just like I'm sure you get over everyone else's. It sounds like you are a med student.

And there are a lot of men out there who are either indifferent, or who are going to put your physical comfort way, way, way above their preferences for how your pubes look. 

I too am incapable of shaving or waxing. I met a new guy over Christmas and asked him what his preferences were. He wanted cleaned up and trimmed down, which I figured was only fair since I was asking him to go bald (for oral purposes). I just recovered from the last ingrown hair a few days ago. He has been more than understanding, and we have both agreed that just keeping things trimmed is okie dokie. 

I am also never waxing again.

So you can do one of two things - work on being more at peace with your body, or try electrolysis/laser hair removal.  Accepting and becoming more comfortable with yourself is obviously the cheaper choice, but if you really don't think you can manage it, then there's no point in not investigating permanent hair removal further. 

P.S. FWIW I'm still working on accepting my appearance - there's a lot of things I don't like. But having partners who compliment you and take the time to make sure you enjoy yourself has sure helped me make progress. Just something to consider :)

20140425045949,redlucy07,"Dude seriously don't worry about it! As someone with Mediterranean heritage and a greater than I'd like allotment of body hair I totally sympathize. But there are a few things to remember:

1) Ultimately, if potential sexual partners have a problem with it, they are not worth sleeping with. Yes, others are entitled to have their own *preferences* about their partner's body hair. But that is just that: a preference. You are the one who ultimately gets to decide what to do with your bush.

2) There are lots of people out their who like a full bush. Although I am fairly sure that this was not my current partner's original preference due to his fondness for performing cunnilingus, and because he loves me, he thinks I am sexy as with a hairy bush and now doesn't even want me to wax. This also stems from an understanding of point #1 above - empathetic people will understand the kind of work, time, and pain required to keep hairless, and understand that for some people, it's just not worth going through.

3) Related to the end of number 2 - when trying to keep your pubic hair ""under control"" uses up a large amount of your resources (money and time) and ends up being painful, is it really worth it? Is that really something you need to invest in in your life?

Sounds like you keep it trim and groomed. I think that is the best compromise. If it is something that is really affecting your self esteem I would look into a more permanent solution like laser hair removal. But just remember that porn-star hairlessness is not the be-all end all of genital appearance - and as someone mentioned - people often groom before going to the OBGYN and the sample of vaginas you've seen is not an accurate representation of the general population.",2,t3_23wb8m

Its important to make yourself heard, when you see a GYN, even one you have seen before.

But then my mother developed depression, and I saw first hand how mentally devastating it is, that yes, you can pretend to be ok for short periods of time in public, but I fully realized how difficult it is just to go through the motions. I see it with my friends now, many of them had the same attitude and when somebody close to them started to suffer similarly, it was an eye-opener. What I'm trying to say - it is difficult to fully comprehend it when you don't have an experience with depression. I am sure they don't mean it in a bad way, they're just happily ignorant, as I was. Do what you think is best for you. It IS valid. Everybody has experience with physical pain, so it is easy to empathize with a broken leg, but unless one has a closer experience with depression, it is difficult to imagine what it truly entails.

Without going on a long and protracted rant, I COMPLETELY support the use of anti-depressants AS LONG AS they are complimented with effective non-medication therapies. They serve an important purpose (whether through actual effects or as placebos, that's a debate in itself as to their chemical effect) in that they enable an individual to function. However, they are not intended for long-term use and to rely on them beyond that initial ""getting up"" phase without learning to cope with the thoughts and handle difficult situations and emotions is a big mistake, and one that big pharma are very happy to encourage. 

My view (both as a patient and with contacts in pharma and research) is simply that they are a short term tool to help patients begin to learn how to be happy, and should not be seen as a pill you pop to solve all your mental health problems (which is absolutely not what I'm suggesting you are thinking, but it's a common assumption particularly among those not affected by depression)... much the same as you couldn't just take painkillers for what turns out to be a heart attack - you have to fix the underlying cause of the pain.

After that, if the patient and practitioner feel confident, the patient can slowly come off them. If their depression worsens or returns, then they need to be returned to the anti-depressant.

I learned this myself after going to the nude beach, and the swingers' club, and getting involved in shibari rope bondage. Bodies are amazing, and even more beautiful when the people inhabiting them are enjoying themselves.

I'm 5'2"", 40, and have two kids (both of which were 10lb newborns). I weigh between 125-130, depending on the time of the month. I wish I could get back down to my pre-baby weight of 115, but I would be happy stabilizing at 120.

I have felt homely, or plain at best, my entire life. After kids, and gaining weight (and an emotionally abusive marriage) I couldn't even bear to look at myself in a mirror longer than I needed to brush my hair.

These days (post-marriage, but still fighting a divorce) guys tell me I'm beautiful, I'm hot. I turn heads at the swingers club, and I still don't know what they are seeing. I'm not conventionally attractive, a big reason I always thought of myself as homely. I don't wear makeup (except eyeliner sometimes), I don't shave my legs, I don't style my hair (I just wash and brush and air dry), and I don't wear fancy clothes (I have very little sense of style). And yes, I have stretch marks and loose skin and I try to ignore that. I hope that if I continue to lose weight and do pilates the skin will eventually go away or at least be less noticeable if I have better-toned abs.

I can't deny that people see *something*, so I've learned to stop fighting a stupid battle inside me (after all, who wins if I manage to convince people that no, I'm really nothing special??), and learn to accept that I just might be wrong about myself. I'm intelligent, friendly, accepting of other people, and enthusiastic about enjoying time with them. I suppose it's the entire package they are drawn to, and maybe my unconventional looks just kind of tie it all together. I don't know. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, I guess :)

What doesn't sit completely well with me about your post is the phrase ""people who actually have reason to struggle with body image.""

20140425115902,RampagingKittens,"I think you're blowing their comment out of proportion. The bottom line is that the more you look conventionally attractive, the more likely you are to be, well, found attractive, be treated better, have more opportunities, etc. So, yes, you have your insecurities and that's fine, everyone does, but that doesn't make your problems equal to someone else's. It's like a millionaire complaining about the expense of replacing a car compared to a single mum on welfare needing a new car. Both are problems, but let's be honest about whose situation we'd rather be in. 

I realize insecurities aren't the same as money (the former being less rational and thus tougher to conquer) but I'm making this point to illustrate that there are obvious differences in the struggles if you consider how society also perceives you and not just how you feel about yourself. It's not as shocking of an accomplishment if we see a conventionally attractive person, who is supported by society, feel good about themselves. And we see that measure of accomplishment imposed on all sorts of things (eg accomplishing X task in spite of a disability - their accomplishments are even more ""special"" and provide more motivation because there was more to overcome). 

It seems like there's a competition among people to make their problems seem equal or worse to those of their peers and it's nuts. No, some have it worse. I have some privileges and some disadvantages in my life and I don't always need to feel like I have it just as tough as everyone else.

If your answer is 'what arrow?' go take a look.

The point he makes is that we look at ourselves, every day. We have a catalog of our flaws, and whether we want to or not, society tells us in a variety of ways whats 'good' or 'bad' and we compare ourselves to it, consciously or unconsciously. Many of the things we're self conscious about or dislike, most people don't notice, or don't even care about. Confidence is more attractice than anything else, poise and grace will get my attention faster than a 'thigh gap' or a boob job.  It's like people getting depressed when they see someone's awesome 'Facebook life' and don't realize they're looking at a high light reel.

THIS. A million times this. I have purposely stopped buying fashion magazines for precisely this reason, because I could hear myself thinking, ""Oh, I wish I was just a tiny bit skinnier so I could wear that dress."" Or it would be ""Oh, I wish I didn't have black hair and brown skin so that highlights would look natural on me."" Or ""I wish my face was just a little bit longer so I could wear sunglasses like that actress."" Magazines became this endless litany of what I didn't have, from clothes to physical traits. Not having them around has drastically reduced my negative internal voice.

Not to say I don't have one! I still do, unfortunately. But I can at least appreciate the attention I get when I dress up, wear a tight pair of jeans, or hell, just put on a new bit of makeup.

You can't give it pumped milk or formula to keep it happy because the point of cluster feeding is that it signals your body to make more milk to meet the baby's demands.

As you decompose your body nourishes the tree. I was making my will a while ago and I couldn't find a cemetery like that anywhere in my province (Ontario Canada). I'm not sure where you're based (though with that username...) but I'd love to see this idea become more popular.

Any wrap or container/casket is made of biodegradable material such as wood, wicker, or natural fiber.""

My point was that reading the FDA statement, they still have to take a sample of cervical cells to do the DNA test (in fact they can take a sample and do the DNA test and a Pap smear with the same sample). 

It is not a blood draw or vulva swab. So it's still a pelvic exam with speculum - probably not much different experience from the traditional Pap. The advantage is that it gives information about the HPV strain present (if any are), and might mean fewer colposcopies for women who don't need them, and more immediate colposcopies in cases where the HPV is high risk.",2,t3_23yvqa

Looking back on my college days, I was way more stressed than I am now, and probably more so than I needed to be simply due to being a pessimist and a worrier. My life changed dramatically a few months after graduation after I finally ended up getting a good job and moving away from my hometown. Things have gotten increasingly more stable since I've become financially independent.

Does your school offer any counseling services or do you have insurance to seek out a therapist to talk to? Even if there's nothing ""wrong"" with you and you're just dealing with a lot in life, it's good to have someone to talk to.

Reach out to your department head or graduation counselor. They might be able to help you lighten your class load or take a few more manageable classes next semester without compromising your graduation date or major.

You can also talk to your school's employment center--they are pretty good at helping with resumes and interview skills (there are lots of subtle things to both that even very smart, educated people aren't aware of.

Do you have to have a good job immediately after graduation? Or do you have family or friends who could help you out for a while or could you get by with a lower-paying job until you get where you want to be?

Try to focus on the good things in your life, even when things feel overwhelming. 21 can be a really tough place to be if you're studying something challenging and working and dealing with life without being financially independent.

20140425130810,Dargok,"As a socially awkward male who is friends with other socially awkward males, I can definitely see some of us acting like this. It seems like its possible he is avoiding these things because he is uncomfortable / afraid of it.

That being said, there will never be ""the right time"" to talk to him about it, just sit him down and have a heart to heart. Because if he doesn't learn to deal with it and learn to reciprocate the feelings / actions you show him, then you have every right to be unhappy. However, there is also the chance that he is showing you how he feels in his mind as people express things differently. There are people out there that don't really like to touch people but do other things to show that they care (not saying this is necessarily his deal, just an example.)

So just go into the talk with an open mind and try to not attack him and rather position what your concerns in a non-aggressive way. Us awkward guys are like approaching animals, easy to spook and cause undesired results when we enter our uncharted territory.

I also agree with some of what /u/qagmyr says, as I have once made the mistake of 100% immediate response / involvement with the people it can detract from the overall attraction from that person.

20140425142344,ThePolemicist,"Honestly, your relationship sounds very much like a sister relationship to me: always fighting & competing, everyone telling you to make up & appreciate each other & not throw the relationship away.

Because she's been in your life for as long as you can remember, I think it's likely she'll be at least a small figure in your life in the future. You'll have mutual friends. You might be invited to the same weddings & events. 

That doesn't mean you have to work at the friendship and try to make it thrive. Sometimes, two people just don't get along very well. I think you should do what you've always done: be civil to her, but leave it at that. In my opinion, you need to work at not being so emotionally invested here. I think we all have friends who are super shitty drivers, especially around high school age. The solution is not to ride with her when she's driving, not seethe in anger about it. You can give her advice once or twice, like, ""Hey, I'm worried about you hiking in these remote places yourself,"" but she's an adult (I think... based on the timeline of your story), and you can't *make* her listen. So, after you speak your peace, let it go. 

By the way, I'd be frustrated with having this young woman in my friendship circle, too. Who wants to have a ""friend"" gossip about you behind your back? The problem here is that you can't make your other friends ditch her. If she's part of that circle of friends, then you either need to accept her as part of that circle or establish a new group of friends to spend your time with. I don't think it would be fair to say, ""I don't like person X, all of our friends are mutual, so I don't want person X to hang out with all of our friends.""

The latter is an unbiased question because it doesn't include an assumption as to the truth. Keeping questions unbiased helps facilitate discussion and information sharing, if that's what you're interested in. Obviously, if you want to put forth an opinion, bias is fine.

If you still want more information now, I suggest Google scholar, as it's a good resource to find interesting research. There's lots of papers related to mathematical ability and its relation to gender.",7,t3_23zna8
20140427052458,QueenBeeYacht,"Lets address three issues. First, the wording of question. Second, the ""we're sick of hearing that stuff."" And third, the actual issue of ""is there any difference between the genders in innate maths ability?""

First. I worded it that way because the subtext of the whole post *is* that society often says ""girls aren't good at math."" So my question was based on a thought process along the same lines. I was really saying ""hang on, haven't male brains actually been shown to be better at maths on average?"" I do now apologise for the wording, as I see that the language I used may have included an ""assumption as to the truth,"" but that *was* my assumption (given to me by society I guess). One that I am more than eagerly willing to change.

Second. ""We're sick of hearing that stuff"" isn't (in my opinion) a good reason to quash the discussion with someone genuinely looking to find out the truth. Everybody has bullshit thrown at them by society, and trying to shut people up when they open a conversation about that bullshit is really counter-intuitive.

Third. I went to google scholar, and found an absolute mess. Plenty of studies *do* show differences between the genders in all kinds of cognitive abilities, and the most common is males are better at systemizing/spatial tasks, females better at empathizing/language tasks. This is discussed as the default in most meta-studies. But there are also studies showing that these relationships are probably non-significant. Others highlight that males show much more variance, at both ends of the distribution. More say that it's probably all just a result of gender-roles being fulfilled.

20140426070416,1fish10fish,"No, the point is to show the first two bins have about the same number of men and women. You can get the 'most women are doing really well' because the distribution is skewed left and the center is higher for the women than for the men.

20140426071953,QueenBeeYacht,"I think the strength of the skew would have been shown more vividly by using proportions. As it currently stands the initial visual impression is that red is being dominated by blue in almost every category.

I was using a catch-all term, within reason I think. Your diagnosis of Dunning Kruger is actually a pretty mean dig at my intelligence, which is both offensive and beside the point.",0,t3_23zna8
20140426094028,1fish10fish,"No, there are a few things to get out of this graph:

1) there are more men than women. 

2) most of the people in the class are men with average scores. This is important because they are the ones who tend to make jokes about women (and minorities) not being able to hack it, and most of the class agrees, because most of the class is like them.

3) at the very top of the class, the number of men and women are about the same. Most of the women are doing better than most of the men, despite 1 and 2. 

4) the average women are practically missing

If I had scaled by number of people within each category, 1 could arguably be shown with a separate pie chart, but it's much easier to see 2 using this type of histogram, rather than having viewers use information from the pie chart and the histogram. This histogram does not prevent the viewer from seeing 3, and places 3 in the context of 1 and 2. 4 is shown in extra contrast compared to the number of average men.  

If you had actually read the comment I made describing the main points of the plot and the comment I made about attrition, you would have seen that 'more women are doing better than men' was not the only point I was getting across. Your strong statements:

> ironic

implying I'm bad at math. Even if this is a bad graph, making bad graphs != bad at math, especially the type of math covered in that class.

> terrible

She needs to know you are willing to do it because you love her, but that there is effort needed on her part to make it work. We did not have the right tools to deal with E's problems and it made so many things so much worse. My suggestion is to speak with a family counselor before a decision is made to see they can help you come to a decision about this, and so you have the tools to make it successful if it happens.

We didn't have time to mull it over it literally had to be made in that moment. So of course I said yes. The agreement was for approx 6 months while the parents went through rehab and counseling. It's now been 5 years parents still don't have all their shit together. 

What I can say is this, if you want this, know it won't be easy. Don't be afraid to ask for government assistance. A lot of programs can get your sister free or discounted counseling. Shes 14 and that's not an easy age for anyone, it will be even worse for her since she has had no real guidance and terrible role models on how to act as an adult. 

The eldest niece was 12 when she came to me, by 14 she was a nightmare. She physically attacked me, constantly threatened suicide etc. most of these things are because she unfortunately still has frequent contact with her parents (court ordered). 

So have him sign away rights. Do your best to ensure she has little to no exposure to your mom and her dad which will be triggers to bad behavior. Establish a routine and try not to deviate from it. Establish firm guidelines children from situations like this need structure even if the resist at first, it's important to stick to it. Take a parenting/foster course. Most are free and are given to kinship care/foster parents. 

Know this will be a long, difficult and sometimes unrewarding road. Know that she won't be happy and well overnight. Know that you can do everything right and it still might not change a thing right away. Know that you keeping a child safe and providing for them is making a small difference and hopefully she recognizes it down the road. Make sure you have several people you can vent to, even if you have to sign up for free counseling yourself.

It's absolutely worth it because they would be in an awful situation without me, but it is NOT an easy undertaking. One of them had residential treatment after our mom died and it helped immensely - I highly recommend you and your dad do whatever you can to get her in. 

That said, how terrible is your father really? It sounds like she was willingly living with him up until now, and while he's certainly not winning father of the year here, it IS trying. It sounds like he genuinely cares for her and wants to help, but has a poor/no support system for himself. If he lost his job he I would think he would now qualify more for financial assistance. Can she get on state healthcare? Do the research, make the calls, be an advocate for her. 

Obviously there are many details you didn't cover, but based on what you've said, here's what I would do: Depending on what financially, logistically, and in your sisters best interests, either move to where your dad is, or have him move to where you are. It sounds like he would be cooperative in anything that would make his life easier. Don't let him get out of caring for her, but do everything you can to be his support system. Take her on weekends, take her to appointments, help out financially where you can, teach her to drive, etc. Be that second parent, but don't let him give up his responsibilities unless you absolutely have to. Talk to an attorney and get the paperwork for giving you limited guardianship rights (depends on your state, could be called ""power of attorney"". Check out resources on ""kinship caregivers"" like this - https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/f_kinshi/ , or google it with your state. I make decent money, but it doesn't count to the state, so I am getting benefits for the kids, and child support from our father. Check out low cost and pro bono legal help. If social services is already involved, have a meeting with them and your father, hash out your best options. 

Ideally he could have a separate place that is very close to yours, but if necessary get a place large enough for both of them. This could help with finances as they may count as your dependents. 

If you do have to take her 100%, make sure you get legal guardianship and go through the state system so you can get the financial and emotion resources you need. Consider your own mental health, get a therapist for yourself as well. If you have other relatives available, live close to them so they can help out when necessary. Be prepared to have to present legal guardianship paperwork everywhere, and have people not respect you like a parent because you're so much younger than other parents of teenagers. Consider what your sister wants. Do you have a partner, if so what involvement do they want?

Where she is now is a mess. Each time she visits the hospital she is there for 2 days then they release her. At one of these two night stays one hospital tried to diagnose her with schizophrenia!! I could not believe that they could come up with that conclusion in two days. 

Her issues were very small here and have stemmed since she has moved with her father. I don't know if they would get better with me, but I think with my understanding of our home life and her trust in me, we could both try to get somewhere. Her father thinks this is something she is making up, and she can stop if she wants. ",3,t3_2409tv
20140426155359,SpaceFrostbite,"For my part, it definitely helped that my brother and I shared that experience of living in a toxic environment, because it did foster a sense of shared understanding between us on that basic level. So even when other people were asking me why he wasn't able to finish school or maintain a job, I knew that he had to do it in his own time, and he has told me that this approach helped him the most. The time to heal in a healthy place was very good to him.

It's great that your sister is reaching out to professional help as there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but two days in one hospital and another one the next isn't going to provide for her the continuity and consistency of care she needs right now... Especially with hospitals throwing out diagnoses in every direction. That doesn't seem accurate, either. I would suggest looking at some places both where she is and where you currently are for recovery and care, or outpatient treatment, and involving her in choosing her place of healing. This may help motivate her to keep trying or look forward to her recovery, it could give her hope! And it also provides her with options when she feels she currently has none, which will help her regain control over her life.


Whatever you choose to do from here on out, if you feel in your heart it is the best for both of you, then tackle it straight on. I wish you two all the peace and happiness in the world!

Call the closest one and ask about what kind of emergency funding might be available (some states have it, some states have better funded PP's and may be able to help.

Most of their services are provided on a sliding scale commensurate with stated income but I don't believe abortion falls in that category.

I don't think you necessarily need to label yourself before going after this girl, but you really should spend a little time deciding if you really want to try something, or leave it as a crush. 
Normally, I'd say, ""go for it and figure it out on the way,"" but you mentioned this girl was a co-worker, which adds another level of complexity to the situation.

As far as figuring out if she'd be interested, my love life would be way more exciting if I had an answer for you there.  I'd suggest a 'friend-date' to put the feelers out.

I know a *lot* of other mothers (clubs and play groups and such), and I can tell you that this is a common theme among parents (or at least moms).  You try so hard to do what needs to be done, and, at the end of the day, you feel like you didn't do enough. Like you need to be better. Give more. Be kinder. It's so easy to beat yourself up.

Here's what you need to know. Your child has a loving mom who works to support him and reads to him and plays with him when she gets home. He also has a father and grandparents who live with him, so he has more loving adults in his life daily than most kids. He's a very loved little guy, and you're making it work! 

Everyone deserves time to step away. I think it's best to talk to the adults you live with to figure out some good boundaries here. Do the grandparents care for your son all day? When you go out after work, does that mean they continue to care for him? Is the dad capable of caring for your son, or not? If he is capable, then I think it's reasonable for you & him to be able to work out evenings when you can each get time away, guilt-free. If he's not capable, then I'm afraid you're going to need to work things out with the child's grandparents. If they watch the child all day and are too tired to watch him in the evenings, too, could your son go to day care once or twice a week to lighten the load? Find a solution that works for everyone so you can get some healthy time away and so the grandparents aren't overburdened.",4,t3_23zk8x

20140425191318,1fish10fish,"Cool, thanks for sharing! For anyone else interested, Amy Sue Bix wrote a book called [Girls Coming to Tech! A History of American Engineering Education for Women](http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Coming-Tech-Engineering-Education/dp/026201954X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398471065&sr=8-1&keywords=Girls+Coming+to+Tech!%3A+A+History+of+American+Engineering+Education+for+Women)

> Book description: 

> Engineering education in the United States was long regarded as masculine territory. For decades, women who studied or worked in engineering were popularly perceived as oddities, outcasts, unfeminine (or inappropriately feminine in a male world). In Girls Coming to Tech!, Amy Bix tells the story of how women gained entrance to the traditionally male field of engineering in American higher education.

> As Bix explains, a few women breached the gender-reinforced boundaries of engineering education before World War II. During World War II, government, employers, and colleges actively recruited women to train as engineering aides, channeling them directly into defense work. These wartime training programs set the stage for more engineering schools to open their doors to women. Bix offers three detailed case studies of postwar engineering coeducation. Georgia Tech admitted women in 1952 to avoid a court case, over objections by traditionalists. In 1968, Caltech male students argued that nerds needed a civilizing female presence. At MIT, which had admitted women since the 1870s but treated them as a minor afterthought, feminist-era activists pushed the school to welcome more women and take their talent seriously.

> In the 1950s, women made up less than one percent of students in American engineering programs; in 2010 and 2011, women earned 18.4% of bachelor's degrees, 22.6% of master's degrees, and 21.8% of doctorates in engineering. Bix's account shows why these gains were hard won.

I'm especially interested in the different methods and justification by which the three schools (MIT, Georgia Tech, and Caltech) became coed. 

One thing that stood out about Caltech versus the other schools (which I got into, but decided not to attend) was that although there are more males than females, it never felt that way at all. I chalk it up to most of the women there being incredibly outgoing and personable, which I guess made the proportions seem different. ",1,t3_23zld2

Day 1 of your period is day 1 of your cycle. Let's say your period lasts 5 days. You had sex 4 days after that, so that would be day 9 of your cycle. Sperm can live in you for up to 5-7 days. So, you could have had sperm in you from day 9 through day 16 of your cycle. Most women ovulate around day 14, give or take a couple of days... so, it's certainly possible you ovulated while there was still sperm present.

The insertion process for both IUDs were uncomfortable and a bit painful but of course both times I didn't take as much ibuprofen beforehand as I was supposed to. It helps to learn some muscle relaxing and breathing techniques beforehand. if you can relax your PC muscles while they're doing the insertion, you wont cramp as much.

the Mirena IUD also has really low hormones and lasts for five years.

If you decide you want to have kids sooner or just plain don't like it and want to try something else, you can have it removed at any time.The biggest difference between copper and hormonal IUDs, besides how long they last, is that the copper IUD tends to make your periods heavier while many women with the hormonal IUD stop having periods or find that they lighten considerably.Skyla is being marketed towards younger women as I believe it may be slightly smaller, but putting something through your cervix isn't going to be super fun regardless of what you choose. I preferred the 5 year period of the Mirena and went with that in my early 20s. I'm very glad I did!For insertion, your doctor can prescribe a medication that helps make your cervix easier to dilate, and some doctors will even numb it for the procedure.

20140426081407,sabtacular," > wanted some advice from real women rather than listen to someone who perhaps may have never personally had the device fitted

While it's likely that your GP has never personally had an IUD fitted (I'm assuming your GP is female), she has more than likely fitted many other patients with them. Also, she if she is an MD, she should know plenty to answer any of the questions you might have. She didn't go through at least 7-8 years of medical training just to have you get individual opinions from untrained people on the internet.

I'm not saying it's wrong to ask everyone's opinion on here, but take their advice with a grain of salt for sure because with stuff like IUDs, individual results may vary! If you want more ""tailored"" advice for what you're looking for, you might even want to check out /r/xxfitness as there are probably more of them who can answer your question better. However, still ask your GP about it because they will likely have a good answer for you.

 > I have recently started weightlifting and am frightened that squats and deadlifts might dislodge the IUD as I've heard they do move tampons!

As far as my opinion goes, are you saying that squats and deadlifts move tampons? That's how I took it... Tampons are placed in the vagina and the IUD is (obviously) in the uterus. The external os of the cervix should not open wide enough to actually *dislodge* the IUD, but there might be a chance of it shifting. That is, unless you're going to be squatting over 200 lbs (which I'm just assuming is unlikely since you said you recently started weightlifting). With the tampon, however, you may contract the pelvic floor muscles surrounding the vagina enough and in such a way that it very well could dislodge the tampon.",3,t3_240rbx

Federal law defacto prohibits description on marital status through Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 1964 prohibitions on discrimination based on sex and pregnancy, as interpreted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  

Many states expressly prohibit discrimination on marital status.  

Because the courts and the EEOC and state fair employment practices agencies which enforce these laws *aren't psychic*, they determine the evidence of discrimination based on a protected category by the employers statements and conduct.

Asking for marital status in a pre-employment interview is interpreted by the EEOC as betraying the intent to discriminate.

It is in effect a prohibited practice even though it isn't specifically listed in title VII (though it may be in some state laws).  

>And FYI, the reasoning behind asking marital status is because a young married woman is more likely to get pregnant and ask for time off of work to raise kids.

20140426131901,kafkalover,"I don't think that's accurate. See [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/11-illegal-interview-questions-2013-7?op=1) article from Business Insider - emphasis mine:

""State and federal laws make discrimination based on certain protected categories, such as national origin, citizenship, age, marital status, disabilities, arrest and conviction record, military discharge status, race, gender, or pregnancy status, illegal. 
**Any question that asks a candidate to reveal information about such topics without the question having a job related basis will violate the various state and federal discrimination laws**,"" Lori Adelson, a labor and employment attorney and partner with law firm Arnstein & Lehr, tells Business Insider.""

[EDIT] Not only that, but a blanket ""everyone is wrong"" also doesn't recognize that protections of inquiring about marital status in an interview vary by state. For example: 

* In [Illinois,](http://www.lasorsalaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1738395.html) ""it is a violation of the Illinois Human Rights Act **to ask about** or discriminate against an employee based on their marital status."" 

* In [California](http://www.topemploymentattorneys.com/marital-status-discrimination/), ""marital status discrimination begins **even from the time that you are interviewing for work**. In an interview, if you are asked if you are married, plan to get married, pregnant or plan to have kids, your prospective employer may have already committed family status discrimination against you."" 

* In [New York](http://www.employmentlawyernewyork.com/marital-discrimination-and-harassment.html), ""during a job interview the employer should not ask any direct or indirect questions related to the applicant's marital status, otherwise they would be **violating the New York State law which may lead to a lawsuit**.""

* In [Connecticut](http://www1.ctdol.state.ct.us/viewarticle.asp?intArticle=21), your employer may not ask **any questions** regarding marital status in an interview. 

* In [Michigan](http://www.hr.msu.edu/documents/facacadhandbooks/aa_searches/questions.htm), ""**you may not ask questions** about marital status, (e.g., spouse's name, spouse's employment status, whether the candidate is single, married, divorced, separated, engaged, or widowed), pregnancy, ability to reproduce, advocacy of any form of birth control, plans for a family, or child care issues.""

* In [Washington](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tVt4t-oKvqYJ:blog.nwjobs.com/careercenter/can_they_ask_that_questionable_interview_topics.html+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a), employers **can't inquire** about marital status during an interview.

This is obviously not an exhaustive list.

Without looking at the finer points of state law (which is why this top comment is particularly unhelpful, because OP's situation is undoubtedly state-sensitive), marital status *discrimination* is unquestionably illegal under federal law. Therefore, if you are asked about your marital status in an interview and subsequently not hired, you may bring a discrimination claim against the employer, and the burden is then on the employer to prove that you were not discriminated against because of your marital status. 

TL;DR: If you are faced with a situation in which you are asked about marital status in your interview, the answer (if you are in the United States) depends on the individual protections *in your state*. If you are not hired, you may also - in any state - sue under federal protections (particularly The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)) for marital status discrimination.

The CSRA prohibits any employee who has authority to take certain personnel actions from discriminating for or against employees or applicants for employment on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age or disability.  It also provides that certain personnel actions can not be based on attributes or conduct that do not adversely affect employee performance, such as marital status and political affiliation. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has interpreted the prohibition of discrimination based on conduct to include discrimination based on sexual orientation. The CSRA also prohibits reprisal against federal employees or applicants for whistle-blowing, or for exercising an appeal, complaint, or grievance right. The CSRA is enforced by both the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).

This was an excellent opportunity for me to discover myself as a person, reflect on my life and choices, and just personally better myself as a human being. I'd read the same advice as you just gave only in different words, over and over from different people all over reddit. I was determined to make the best of my situation, learn as much as I could, and most importantly, learn to love myself and being by myself. The relationship I was in was the one, or so I thought. So there was a fair bit of a task cut out for me - and I was ready for it!

So off I went with my backpack, really proud of myself for undertaking such an activity. I was as excited about discovering myself as I was about discovering the world. However, every place I went to I felt like something was missing. However much hard I tried to enjoy the landscape or the meal, I felt an indescribable feeling in the hollow of my chest.

I didn't want to accept it, not even to myself, but I had the same feeling as OP did - that it would be better if I had someone to share this with. Not necessarily an SO, but only maybe just a friend, just someone. I felt like maybe something was wrong with me, that I was somehow broken because I couldn't enjoy completely by my only self. I still haven't shared this with anyone IRL. 

I've tried taking up hobbies, I love reading, and I just generally am really comfortable being alone. But there's always a small nagging feeling somewhere down in the pits that this could somehow be better if I could share it with another person. 

I'm not trying to discredit what you said, it might work wonderfully for many people. But it hasn't worked for me. And I just don't know what to do.

20140426122651,vermontermonster,"Try volunteering! I've found that it's one of the best ways to meet good people, and make yourself feel better. Everyone has a skill that can be of help. You might feel better, because you're proud of yourself for helping someone else or because you'll see how much worse off you could be.

Since you can't have a dog of your own, go to an animal shelter and see if they need someone to walk the dogs, or brush the cats, or whatever. Or, go to a women's shelter. They use volunteers to check women in, do small maintenance, help women study for GED programs or apply to jobs and colleges. Maybe volunteer at a charity kitchen if you can cook (or just serve). If you know how, you could give haircuts or interview makeovers at a homeless shelter.",6,t3_241abo

20140426111954,meepmeepboopbeep,"We are social creatures, we're not meant to be alone, but it is good to be a little comfortable with it.  Also, you're probably still adjusting to the loss of the relationship, even if it wasn't a good one, and that magnifies the feelings of loneliness. It will get easier!  If you're working on meeting new people, that's great! Keep doing that.  It will get you out of your head a little and I think the hope of meeting new people that we really click with while we're alone, can make the lonely times a little more bearable.  Also telling yourself that you won't be alone forever and this is just a temporary time can keep things from hitting you too hard.  Practice being alone while you read, watch movies, listen to music, pick up a new hobby/skill/language etc. and talk to your family on the phone.  Balancing the alone time with socializing makes both easier. Remember that you're going through a lot of stress right now, but it sounds like you're moving in the right direction.   ",11,t3_241abo
20140426144402,Penguin_Dreams,"Getting out of an abusive relationship can be extremely disorienting.  When you're in the middle of one there's a focal point for all the all the negative feelings and the highs and lows, and even the positive things.  Even abusive relationships have moments of good times and positive emotions.  That's how an abuser keeps someone around; they isolate and utilize both carrot and stick to keep you unbalanced and focused on them.  They become both the storm and shelter from the storm.  When they're not there anymore you lose that focal point and there's nothing concrete and definitive to point to anymore when you're feeling down or lonely or angry and know that that's the problem.  You're being forced to find a new center and sense of self and you're doing it while grieving over the loss of a relationship and the recognition that it wasn't even a healthy one.

Be patient with yourself.  It takes a while to come to terms with this and sometimes it's overwhelming.  Being alone and being comfortable with it takes time but it will happen with practice.  And you sort of have to practice because right now you're very isolated.  Volunteering somewhere is a great idea.  Check out meet-ups in your area, become a regular at a coffee shop or other local hang out.  Take a walk around your neighborhood and smile and wave at people you pass.  Stop by a dog park and strike up a conversation with someone who has a dog.  You may not be able to keep your own but other people generally love talking about their pets and you can get in a little doggy loving.  

Also allow yourself to be sad and mourn.  Sometimes it's good to have a bit of a wallow in those feelings and acknowledge their existence.  Ignoring it won't make them go away.  Just try not to stay there too long.  It's also good to pick yourself up and force yourself to go out and get some fresh air and find something to smile about.  It gets easier the more you practice.  Best wishes to you. :)",3,t3_241abo

You described that perfectly. I spent almost 4 years putting all my energy into trying to make him happy, trying to be a better girlfriend, trying not to upset him. At first when he was gone I felt an amazing sense of freedom, like a weight lifted from my shoulders, but that gradually turned into feeling lost, like I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing with myself at all anymore.

He was my best friend and someone who I had such a close connection with. We had so much in common. Despite the violence. I try not to, but if I'm being honest I miss him so, so much.",2,t3_241abo

Of course you miss him.  That's normal.  It's okay to miss him and miss the good parts of the relationship and miss the guy who was so charming, especially at the beginning, and shared stuff in common with you and that you poured so much of yourself into.  

It took me about a 6 months after my last relationship to stop missing him and stop being depressed and mopey.  The 6 months after that was a lot of anger and bitterness.  It was really a good year or so before I was able to start letting that go and stop having this ghost take up space in my mind.  You'll get there too.  It just takes time.",1,t3_241abo

Most people have suggested taking up a hobby. I'm going for bird watching and volunteering at a local rescue.

20140426165429,WANKINGAMA,"Being able to be happy by yourself means you need to love yourself and feel confident with yourself. One of the reasons a lot of people (especially the one still emotionally involved) post breakup feel down and stumble a lot forward is because their SO was their main or only source of validation, the sense of worth and possitivity they should feel in themselves. Post breakup that source of validation is gone and you are left trying to refind something that should already be in yourself.

So you should honestly work on your core confidence and self image. Not only external factors, but preferably internal. Find things you enjoy to do. Find something you want to learn, the sense of accomplishment from mastering something is a great confidence boost. Try affirmations aswell and self help techniques like saying good things about yourself in the mirror and writing down things about yourself you are proud of and like. If you do some great, get a compliment, anything positive, don't disregard it, internalize it as something positive.

Try to always see the positive in things, force yourself into trying things you've wanted. Start to appreciate the little things like the smile of a child you walk by, or when you see someone help the elderly, the song of a bird, the tranquility of water. If you feel tired, lonely, angry or any ""negative"" emotion, accept it, see why, take steps to turn it around and enjoy the situation instead.

The solution is to fall madly crazily in love with yourself. Take extra interest in dressing up everyday just to look great, it makes you feel great. Cook a delicious dinner for yourself. Enjoy it while reading or watching your favorite show on tv. Take up exercising or yoga, join a class, as a result, look and feel fab cs of endorphins. I couldn't dance properly even if my life depended on it, so i am thinking of taking dance classes.One more thing, be super polite with everybody you meet, listen to their stories. Sometimes listening to other people, helping them in tiniest ways even, helps us a lot. Plan your day, fun activities included. Take out your bucket list, try to cross off things. Write a gratitude journal every night. Tl;dr start doing more of whatever you enjoyed doing when you were single.

You can not rely on someone who is so unreliable in love. If he does this all the time, you should be questioning that he is not so much the one.

Having seen it multiple times now, the demon guy gives a very solid performance, Tara's voice and her song is amazing, Anya is incredibly talented, Giles is great but sadly, he didn't get a real cameo.

Spike (or James Marsters) actually has his own band and is no slouch when it comes to singing and playing guitar, but somehow it didn't translate very well to the show.

Gilmore Girls is an awesome feel-good show. The characters are a little quirky, the drama isn't too big, and you get a lot of mother-daughter bonding time. Plus the dialogue is super fast and funny.

One Tree Hill is a kind of soapy teen drama, but it's one of my favorite guilty pleasures. It's also a bit more well done (at least in the earlier seasons) than some of the other similar shows out there. You've got love triangles, angst, parties, and a lot of people who are way too old and attractive to be playing high school students.

I most recently finished One Tree Hill - I refused to watch it in high school on principle alone. I thought it was just another ""dumb teenage drama"" but after I watched the entire series at the age of 22 I realized why it was so popular, it really did hit home with me about the lifestyle of high school and the entire culture of the episode really reminded me of how difficult high school could be.

Gilmore Girls is just a great feel good show - it also hits on real life story lines such as a difficult family, but it reminds you of how bittersweet life is. The songs are awesome in the show and you will seriously see so many actors that you never realized acted on the show!

The West Wing is just a must see in my opinion. I love this show - it is my favoritest show ever. If you have a taste for politics at all I would highly recommend it.

20140426155613,alexandroid0,"Head over to /r/LadiesofScience, it's a great community that addresses a lot of these things!

I'm similar to you in that I never really noticed being treated differently growing up female and interested in science. In high school, my teachers and classmates treated me like a normal person, and this let me ignore the fact that I was one of three girls (out of ~30 students) in my physics class. When I got to college (I'm going to a school that, similar to RIT, is an engineering college and we're about 30% women, worse in my major) I gradually started to notice more and more little things, I think largely for two reasons:

1. I started learning more about feminism / women's movements and thinking critically about the way gender and society interact, and 
2. I started to be really challenged by my coursework and the resulting insecure voices in my head started to say things like, ""maybe it's true that girls are no good at math.""

To answer your concerns about being treated differently - I've experienced very little to no direct sexism in school, especially from professors. From my peers, things are a little different, being that women are such a minority here - people would use my gender as the basis of jokes, make comments about how I was the only woman in the room that made me feel isolated and uncomfortable, etc. Your peers will be a lot of young people, many of whom haven't thought very much about gender roles or how their actions affect other people. But, the great thing about college is that you can be friends with whoever you want to, so surround yourself with people who don't make jokes about trading blowjobs for homework help. [This is a good article](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/psysociety/2013/04/02/benevolent-sexism/) about ""benevolent sexism,"" which is something I have run into a bit - things like, ""Hey, you should do the report, because girls are better at writing, and the boys will do the experiment!""

The best thing to do is work hard and make lots of friends who treat you like a human being. Like you said, biology is one of the best STEM fields in terms of the ratio, so that will help. Work on getting organized, and don't worry if you don't get things as quickly as other people seem to - odds are they have either seen it before, or they're putting their best face forward. Everyone struggles in STEM at times, it's hard! Look up things like [imposter syndrome](https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor) and talk to people about it, I promise you'll be surprised at how many people (male and female) feel like they're not smart enough, or that they don't belong.

Last piece of advice - don't let this stuff get you down. Yes, inequality still exists, yes, there are still assholes who think women don't belong in science. But they're rare, they're disappearing, and the best way to fight it is to just do whatever the fuck you want to do. Time that you spend worrying about whether people are looking down on you is time that you're not spending learning bio and math. ",12,t3_241stk
20140426160654,NervousPreggo,"Well I'm a lady who did my degree and PhD in physics at Oxford and never experienced any negative reaction to being a woman. Although you'll be in the minority it's not so rare for a woman to be studying a mathematical subject for it to be a novelty or even particularly noteworthy.

The only issue I found is that the women, myself included tended to be less assertive than the men (this is obviously just in general - not true universally) so you have to make more of an effort to make yourself heard in a male dominated environment.

In general though I think you're getting yourself anxious unnecessarily. The people who really seemed to fall apart as undergrads (both men and women) were the ones who had always got by and even been top of the class without really trying. It was often a massive shock to the system when this was no longer the case.

Go to office hours (yes, this is intentionally written twice; no matter where your scores put you in the class having a working relationship with your professor will show them that you care about the material and improving your understanding of the subject.....also, you may need a reference in the future) If you feel yourself slipping, make sure to ask for help because no one is going to throw you a rope. If you want your classmates to respect your knowledge, be active in discussions or join study groups so that your peers know that you know your stuff.

Most of all:  NO EXCUSES!  It's college and no one is going to hand anything to you.  You've got to earn it.  There is no reason why you can't be the best of the best.  Don't go in with the mentality that your not capable of being top of the class, because then you'll start settling. And that's on you, no one else.

Most people are faking it. I'm teaching some basic classes and everyone always seems to know everything - except they don't, which becomes apparent when they hand in their assignments. Good on you for being honest with yourself. Also, remember that not knowing something is not the same as being stupid. Many, many times basic courses simplify things to the point where a couple of relevant points get lost - hence many smart students feel like they can't get it while more average students just absorb the info but have not reflected upon it. So, the fact that you don't seem to get everything at once may in fact speak for you.

> But I'm worried that once I get into college I will be considered as someone who is less than everyone else because I am a girl, and I am not close enough to ""the best of the best"" to be deemed an exception to the rule. 

It depends. I have not had any major problems and felt like I got lots of support. I feel like inequality starts to appear much later, at post doc stage and after. However, very subtle things here and there may have occurred but I do think it is less frequent within science than in ""normal"" every day life.

I would, however, like to advice you to pay attention to how to talk. I noticed that a lot of women speak in self-minimizing way. So don't ever start a question or comment with a ""this may be a stupid question.."" or ""I don't understand..."". Instead, ask your questions like ""Since x1 leads to y and that causes z, x2 is very similar to x1, why does x2 not cause z too?"". This will show that you picked up on the information available and shows critical thinking and tends to give you much more respect than simply saying ""I don't understand why x2 does not work like x1"".

Watch out for subconscious gender roles. For instance, during first year of my PhD I ended up in a group with one other girl - the remaining 10 were males. All the guys were asking her about how to fill in forms, where to go for xyz, when that-and-that lecture was etc. When she graduated, they started doing that for me. I realized that looking up and explaining things for them would take time from my research, so I simply started replying with ""the info you need is on the HR website, look there"" and soon I wasn't expected to mommy everyone anymore.

You can overcome this feeling by diving into your studies and connect (as fellow-student to fellow-student) with your classmates...you gotta tell yourself that you are just as smart as any of them and apply yourself so that you can hold your own as a valuable teammate/classmate. Though I will say that there are small things that isn't all that fair, where you get penalized somewhat for being a girl: for example if you decide to wear a cute dress or anything trendy you will look quite out of place and get judged, also if you try to ask too many questions/help from your male classmates people might not take you seriously because they assume you are there to steal answers/be useless.

Most sexually active adults will contract at least one strain of HPV.

The Nurse Practitioner who diagnosed me told me that all the current science shows that the strains that cause warts do not cause cancer. Subsequent OB/Gyn's have affirmed this for me, as has my research.  We may learn otherwise, but this is what the data show at present.

HPV is nothing really to be worried about it. I tested positive for HPV last time I had a pap but the only physical sign to tip off the doctor was a tiny bump on my cervix. (I've had normal paps my whole life up until this point) the doctor said it was a low-risk strain, and that my body will fight it off naturally. there's nothing really that can be done about it. the vaccine only protects you from the handful of strains that can develop into cancer - most strains of HPV are just a lil virus that your body has to build up an immunity to. You may never know who you got it from, since it can apparently be dormant in your body for a long time before it ""flares up"".

I'm having way more fun now, since I turned 28 than I did ever before. My aunt is almost 50 and has finally managed to fullfill one of her all time dreams. My other aunt is travelling abroad for the first time ever with a small choir she's a member in. My mum is in her mid 50s and she's probably her happiest now. My grandmother is in her mid 90s and she never complains and is always so positive and in good mood. Happiness is a choice.

>  Also, I am not convinced that everyone has an ideal life in the first place - it's just that the media only portrays young people being glamorous and over achieving etc.

It's movies. Ever noticed how people in tv shows spend a looooot of time dating, run every day, spend lots of time with friends and still work 60h weeks? Yeah, that's not doable in real life. Tv shows and movies are adult fairytales and just like there aren't fairy good mothers and happily ever afters there aren't 48h 24h:s for anyone. In real life you choose, sacrifice and prioritize.

Many of the departments I applied to have maybe one female faculty member - some had none. The department I am entering is at a very progressive research university and has 40% women!

During my interview, no one brought up the family questions, so I actually didn't know the family statuses of the faculty in the department until after I accepted the position - then I found out that there are ~15 kids in the department! 

I think there must be a link between the progressive policies and attracting an outstanding and diverse group of faculty members. In fact, with my hire, old, white men are now the minority in the department, which is certainly unique from all other departments in my field that I know of! They are attracting not only women but also minority men and women. That is incredibly exciting to me as I believe scientific advancement is greatly enhanced by bringing together teams of people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

Anyway, it's very exciting to see where things are going and it gives me a lot of hope for the future of my field and STEM fields in general.

20140427132615,PluckyLeopard,"I think that saying is very true too! In academics it seems like your letters of recommendation are incredibly critical. I didn't realize how important they were until going through the process this year. Most of the positions I applied for had 100-120 applicants and in many cases they can only interview 3-5 people. The top 10-15 candidates all have very similar CVs (with maybe a few exceptions) so having outstanding recommendations can push your application to the top of the pile. Interestingly, it helps even more if people on the search committee know your letter writers. It's less of an impact come highly recommended from someone they have never met, than to come highly recommended from someone they know.

I definitely have a new found understanding and respect for how important things like networking and having the right connections are. ",2,t3_242rlj

20140427111607,PluckyLeopard,"I think the lukewarm letter was a huge problem. There many other factors at play this year, including there finally being a critical mass of job openings. 

In terms of the family situation, most of the departments I applied to had maybe one woman on the faculty. A couple of locations didn't have any women on the faculty within the department I was applying to. One of the institutions with only one female faculty member asked me point blank in my pre-interview what my family situation is and whether that will be a problem for committing to the stress and challenge of the tenure track. Needless to say, I did not end up at that institution. 

Interestingly, I ended up accepting a position at the most progressive R1 I applied to. My new department is 40% women, the highest percentage of anywhere I applied (and perhaps the highest percentage in the country! I need/want to check this). Also, this was the only department that did not find some way to beat around the bush and ask me about my family situation during my interview. The university has such progressive family leave policies (paternity and maternity) that they are trying to make it a non-issue.

One thing that really struck me from this year of interviews and applications is how subjective ""the best candidate"" is. There is no such thing as ""the best candidate"". Each department is looking for ""the best fit candidate"" and that is much more nebulous than numbers of papers, grant dollars, and potential. In departments that were predominantly male, I felt at a disadvantage. I think that there is an inherent bias to assume that ""the best"" is what you know. Especially, if there is already a ""token female"" on the faculty. Also, I was told by one department that they were under tremendous pressure from higher-ups to hire a woman since they have had 4 women leave in the past ~5 years because they failed to get tenure. o_O So, no matter what that person will be at a disadvantage because even if they were the top candidate.

I'll leave it there because I am starting to soap box...

I certainly don't think a Nature paper is necessary for an R1 job in every field, but in my field they are a bit more common among R1 faculty. Most of my colleagues at my new institution have at least one Nature or a Science first authored paper, if not multiple ones. I think the best way to tell what is considered standard is too look at the CVs and publication records of faculty at schools you are interested in. That actually was a real eye-opener to me. Look for typical number of grants, where those grants are from, typical numbers of papers, where the papers are published, typical numbers of graduate students. If you look at those faculty and think ""That is the level I strive for"", then R1 is likely a great fit for you.",7,t3_242rlj
20140427144519,PluckyLeopard,"I'm in physical sciences, and yes there are still many departments that are 100% male. It's crazy considering the latest statistics show that only ~60% of those getting PhDs in my field are white men. In some cases there will be an adjunct faculty member or lecturer who is female, but then every tenure-track/tenured faculty member is male.

In the case of the department that has seen 4 women fail to get tenure in the past few years, it seemed that this department has unrealistic tenure expectations given the level of research time and support they give their faculty. The course loads are very high, the startup support is low, and the TA support for graduate students is low so they are not attracting great students. They have no faculty mentoring programs in place. When I asked about mentoring, they said that they feel that is best left up to faculty as they don't want to force anything on anyone. If the entire department is male, and there is no formal program for mentoring junior faculty, who is more likely to get mentored, an incoming male or an incoming female faculty member? It was not lost on me that 2 men have gained tenure during the time that 4 women were denied tenure.

Of course there are likely a number of other issues at play and these are just some of my observations from two days visiting their department.

I think those of us who have been at R1s in each step of our matriculation are at a disadvantage because we don't know what the other academic paths look like. When applying to jobs this year, I looked at SLAC and smaller state school options, but ended up only applying to R1s for the exactly that reason. I know what it takes at an R1 and it's what I've been trained and prepared for...",2,t3_242rlj

20140427141120,PluckyLeopard,"I have not seen my letters of recommendation. However, I found out confidentially that one of my letter writers was not writing a very strong letter. One thing you can ask after receiving a rejection is ""is there anything I can do to improve my application?"" Sometimes search committee chairs will be very honest, other times they may not. Many schools ask you to sign a waver to make your letters closed, but some actually have policies that you can request to see a copy of your letters.

In my case, my mentor asked a colleague this question on my behalf and was told in confidence that one of my letters made me sound more like a technician than a scientist. The language this letter writer used killed any chance I had in that round of applications. Unfortunately, at that time, I was collaborating fairly extensively with this colleague so his letter carried a lot of weight. I do not think that this former letter writer even knows what he did and I think he believes he wrote me very strong letters.

There is a huge double standard for how female scientists are perceived and language in letters is critical. My letter writers this year were much more cognizant of this. In fact, when I approached each of them to be my write letters, I asked them if they felt confident that they could speak positively to my abilities as a scientist and potential to become a leader in my field. I told them, if not, that I completely understood and would find another letter writer. Fortunately, I have four colleagues (including my PhD advisor) who are very supportive and completely understand the situation.

Another thing I did this year was provide my letter writers with detailed information for each position I applied to. This helped them to write letters that were tailored to the schools. I pointed them to specific items in my CV as well as ways I fit the job advertisement. I also provided them with copies of each of the applications and highlighted important points they could address. I have no idea how much they adapted their letters, but they all said that this detailed information helped them out immensely as they wrote letters for me. It is a tremendous undertaking to write letters and I owe them big.",2,t3_242rlj

So, I searched for similar threads and finally came across this great video: [http://youtu.be/k7X7sZzSXYs]
Which inspired me to re-explore what I like to do. It helped to reflect on what I enjoyed doing as a teenager, before college and before a string of boyfriends. I went back to painting (which I always felt embaressed to do in front of my ""artist"" ex) I listen to all sorts of music and dance around a lot. I'm putting effort into creating a beautiful space to live in. Other than that, I'm super busy at the moment with school and my internship but I make time to exercise because it's my personal anti-depressant. I also created a night routine of stretching, lighting incense and journaling. I have plans to buy a sewing machine and start working on projects in the summer... 

One last thing worth noting that I discovered. During my relationship, I would really only get ""dressed up"" for exciting dates and events with my boyfriend. One night, I realized that I hadn't really gotten dressed up for anything in a while... Why should I when I had no one in particular to impress right? (No boyfriend) Anyways, I decided to take myself on a ""date"" which was awesome! It was the first time in a while that I tried on different outfits/did my hair/ did my make-up. (my normal routine is very minimalist so when I do, it's sort of an occasion) Then I went out to an art gallery, met a bunch of people, went home alone. What am I saying?

I'm in a relationship but my boyfriend and I are both very busy people. During the week we basically catch up in the car when picking each other up, and spend dinner together. The rest of the time is our own time. My activities after work during the week include making jewelry in a local studio and working out at the gym. That leaves me just enough time to cook dinner when it's my turn, play with the cat, clean up the house occasionally during the week, sometimes watch an episode of a tv show.

On Fridays we meet up with friends at a local pub after work to talk about our weeks and make weekend plans if possible. These plans usually include poker, hiking, canoeing, camping, target shooting, movie night, or whatever cool event is happening in town that weekend.

20140426175538,Penguin_Dreams,"Whiskey clit is a thing and is a completely different issue from his size.  Personally, I hate drunk or even slightly tipsy sex and strongly recommend against it.  Sure it lowers inhibitions, but if you can't do it completely sober it probably shouldn't be happening at all.  Half the fun of that first time and maybe even the next two or three times is the nerves and uncertainty and fumbling around and taking the time to get comfortable with one another and know each others' bodies and things that give pleasure.

However, alcohol impaired or sober does not change his size and I know this is an unpopular opinion, but it does kind of matter and makes a difference.  At least for some of us.  Fortunately there are many ways to have an orgasm that have little or nothing to do with penetration.  Try having him finger you inside and on your clit, go down on you, get on top and grind, have him tease you and stimulate other erogenous zones until you can't take it anymore, use toys (dildos, vibrators, wrap his dick up in a string of beads [seriously, this is awesome], whatever else might turn you on and get you off), then have him get off with penetration, a blow job, a hand job, or whatever turns him on.

Sex is not a performance or a competition and an orgasm isn't even necessarily the end goal (though it's very nice when that happens).  It's about establishing a connection with someone else and sharing pleasure.  It doesn't really matter how that happens, it just matters that it does.

Women should not be penalized for having bad stuff happen to them (see rape, traveling in exotic countries, walking home, being robbed etc). Men choose to do or not do risky stuff all the time and they are allowed to risk themselves.

My husband and I have a brand-spanking new car turning up in 3 or 4 weeks. I can't wait, for all that it's technically his.  
    
We needed a station wagon. No SUV/4x4 big monstrosities. It was shocking how few manufacturers make an actual station wagon any more. That narrowed it down to Ford, Holden, Mazda, Subaru. I told him to check out Skoda as well. I'd spent 10 months working for Europcar here, and we had the Octavia. It surprised me when I got into one to move it to the proper car park just how much room it had and the build quality. Having watched Top Gear, I'd heard little good about them.  
  
The Ford and Holden websites were atrocious for working out what the engines were and so on, so we ruled them out (I hate Fords anyway).  
  
So we went out to look at Skoda's Octavia, the Subaru Outback and Mazda 6.  
  
The Mazda, for all that it was a large car on the outside, had little room inside. For the price and that, we ruled it out. The Outback was similar. I had to scrunch up my knees just to get my feet out of the back seat.  
  
The Octavia, on the other hand... is spacious. A huge boot (trunk), and all the tech gadgets my husband and I (both total geeks) could want.  
  
So my husband test-drove the Outback and the Octavia. We both then re-test drove the Octavia, and put in an order for the top-of-the-line Elegance with everything except the automatic-opening tailgate, sunroof and headlight washers. Blue.  
  
The salesman didn't seem to so much as bat an eyelid when I asked about parts and how easy they are to obtain. Skoda's relatively new around here, but they, VW and Audi are all part of the Volkswagon Auto Group, and share many parts.

It does puzzle me, though as 1) I am obviously dressed for work and 2) sometimes these men (who I don't know) are in far worse condition than I am and have more trouble doing what needs to be done (e.g. trouble moving, shaky hands) and 3) I'd imagine I don't look like I'm suffering as I really do enjoy doing that kind of stuff with my SO.

I usually let my confusion show but act as if I don't realise it has to do with gender. And maybe sometimes it hasn't. Perhaps it's a habit, learnt from society without reflection. So when they look at my SO instead of me, I don't try to hide my ""eh, why you no looking at me? something going on there? no? wtf?""-face. When they ask if I know how to drill I say ""Yeah, duh?"" with a look as if they just asked me if I know how to eat - but with friendly smile. 

He also gets addressed more when we are out eating, travelling etc. However, when we are buying furniture or carpets people talk to me and ignore him. And dat surprise when he says something like ""I'd rather have the sofa with *insert color*"".

I started masturbating at a very young age, like 8 or 9. So all the guilt and self conscious stuff never really got into the equation because I was too young to realize what I was doing and that it was sexual in nature. It was just fun! 

By the time I learned about sex and how stifled discussion is on female sexuality, I was so comfortable getting to orgasm that it was too late to have any effect on my habits. For about a week I wondered ""Is this wrong? Am I being slutty?"", but then quickly those ideas were gone and I was back at it.

I wish every girl could discover masturbation like I did. By myself with no pressure, but, that ain't gonna happen. Just know you are normal and the only judgement that really matters, is your own.

BTW Feel free to ask any questions. I *have* been masturbating almost 20 years now",67,t3_243fuj
20140427155305,dramine13,"Yay! Another person who started at the same age as me! 

On the flip side, while you said you did it because it was ""fun"" and didn't know it was sexual, I tried it at first because I'd read a book that had female masturbation and wanted to know HOW that could possibly be nice... Needless to say, I didn't wonder long and quickly started doing it regularly.

But when I got to the age when I finally learned from my peers that it wasn't normal, I had the same thoughts and doubts as you did, but I gave in to them and stopped for a while. Thankfully, though, I just gave up on being ""acceptable"" after a few months and continued my habits without regret. 

I agree so much with the wish that every girl could discover it like that, because it really does help in relieving what society teaches about masturbation. I'm not ashamed to talk about sex and masturbation now because I learned that it was natural and it's been integrated into my life for so long. ",6,t3_243fuj

20140427080136,Inksplotter,"First, figure out what sort of external stimulus works to get you in the mood. Maybe it's erotic fiction, maybe it's regular old porn, maybe it's softcore still pictures, maybe it's detailed remembrances of past experiences. Whatever, just begin by getting your mind along for the ride.

Science fact- it's harder to feel disgusted when you're horny. I also think it's harder to feel embarrassed or anxious. So start by getting horny.

Get yourself a nice little unintimidating vibrator. (You can always pick up a hitachi later if you like it.) Go for one that advertises a lower frequency 'thrum' rather than 'buzz' if you can. At the moment, you're looking for an exterior-play toy, (not shaped like a penis, because it's not meant to be inside you) so you don't need to worry about a flared base or anything like that, but you should still look for something phthalate free.

Take your laptop to bed. Look/read stuff to get you in the mood. At some point, try out the vibrator in the vicinity of your clit (not right on it to start- you'll want to get the lay of the land first) and try to just keep that feeling good while your mind is still engaged in whatever it is you like. Don't rush. And don't be disappointed if all you get out of it is good feelings the first time, it may take a little practice to get an actual orgasm.

For the physical aspect, it definitely takes a couple tries to figure out what works for you because maybe direct clit stimulation is too sensitive or you need to build up anticipation by stroking your fingers over your skin.

That being said I consider myself a little bit of a connoisseur when it comes to toys. My general advice is go with something rechargeable and something that is waterproof for two reasons
1. You're not limited to just one setting. I know a lot of women enjoy masturbating in the shower or tub and a waterproof toy gives you that freedom. 
2. Generally if you have a toy that is rechargeable you're going to be dealing with a higher quality product. And conveniently,  many of the higher end toys while they cost a little bit more have a pretty great warranty program that comes with them.

My absolute favorite toy I've ever owned is the Jimmy Jane Form 2. Their website www.jimmyjane.com would be a great place to start as they have a lot of different models to choose from as well. And if you're worried about the price point on the toys I recommend going to a website like Adam and Eve to buy. They'll have the same vibrators and toys for sale but usually have some pretty kickin discounts that you can apply to help bring the cost down.

I will raise my kids teaching them not to do things that negatively affect their physical and emotional well being. There's been a lot of studies done on the psychological impact of casual sex and I believe that the conclusions are mixed. So while I wait for more studies to come out I'll be teaching my kids to be extremely honest with themselves, to educate themselves about the repercussions of their actions (all actions) and to take care of themselves. People are different. I've seen some people have casual sex and it's no big deal. I've seen others engage in casual sex and it fucks with them. Sex is complicated.

As in they didn't really *want* to have casual sex, they just did it because they thought it was what they were ""supposed"" to do or for approval. I would hazard to guess they already had some emotional issues to begin with, and having sex when they weren't really comfortable with it just worsened them. That and/or the stigma attached to casual sex. Perhaps if that stigma didn't exist it wouldn't mess with them. Obviously I'm just speculating here, I'm no psychologist. Personally I had a good amount of casual sex in between my committed relationships and the only problems I've had are rolling my eyes at people who judged me for it. Ultimately I much, much prefer sex in a committed monogamous relationship, but if I'm unattached (god forbid, I'm married :D) it can be exciting to have a good ol' fashion roll in the sheets with a casual hookup/fuck buddy. Always using protection, of course. Never had an STI aside from HPV, and I got that from a dude who raped me :(

Right on.  I would like to see this message emphasised more.

Many of the young people I study with now are all falling over themselves to prove to themselves and others that they are 'totally fine with casual sex.'

The reality is - some are absolutely fine with it, and it works well for them.  Others are finding out it doesn't work for them, but unfortunately they (both young men and women) actually have to defend themselves in conversation for why they're not kicking a fresh conquest out of their dorm every weekend.

Some are getting quite upset when they 'fail to enjoy' casual sex.  They do not have 'emotional issues', or 'low self esteem', or 'unsatisfactory partners', or histories of sexual abuse (as important as those things are to consider).  Casual sex just doesn't do it for these people and they should have the social freedom to do their own thing, same as anyone enjoying a hook-up.",22,t3_244elk

I think the idea that it's wrong or disrespectful to have casual sex stems from a confusion based on assuming that sex, inherently, communicates that you're in love or want a relationship.  If you make that assumption, then casual sex is inherently disrespectful because you're doing what I described in the first paragraph, merely through the act of having sex.

Ironically, though, it's this assumption that leads to people doing that very thing.  Because if you hold this view that sex is only legit if you have those feelings, you may try to fool yourself or the other person in this way, when actually all you want is sex and that's all they might want too.

To be honest, I was really excited. I believe that I want to have children some day but I am so young still, so the very idea of having my own child is just baffling to me. During the whole donation process I continually thought about the fact that I was, in some sense, going to be a mother--a biological and genetic mother. This is something so incredible to me, and the fact that I would be giving another woman the chance of raising a child by, in a very general sense, giving her a part of myself...woah. Just woah.

One thing I did not mention in my post was an encounter that I had when I was at one of my blood draw/ultrasound appointments. The clinic is spatially divided in half: one side for donors and the other side for recipients. The only time that the patients on either side will meet is in the central lobby where the elevators are. After this particular appointment, I left the donor side of the clinic and was waiting in the lobby for the elevator, at which time, a young and beautiful couple existed the recipient side of the clinic and stood near me to wait for the elevator as well. Once we were in that 6-foot by 6-foot cube, I tried so hard not to stare at them. I could not help but think ""Is this woman receiving my ova? Is she going to be the mother of my child?"" In that moment, I wanted to know everything about them. We ended up walking to the same Starbucks outside of the building, and the entire time, I wished that I knew who they were. 
I signed a waiver at my final appointment stating that the child has the right to contact me when he/she turns eighteen. I hope that he/she does. I would like to know, I can't deny it.",4,t3_244mj4

From my knowledge, there is no statistically significant risk of complications on future pregnancies if you donate your ova. The general recommendation is to limit yourself to five-six donations, however.

I am doing a special program that provides low cost embryos to couples so I am not chosen by one couple, I am matched with several couples by the clinic.

I was given informal training during my initial interview (where they give all the details of what donation involves and my options for donating like the low cost program or ""normal"" donation).

I get an initial ultrasound before injections start and some FDA lab work.  next I go off estrogen and start injections for three weeks. No sex during that time as I get SUPER fertile apparently. then two more ultrasounds and retrieval.

I had to provide family medical history in my initial application and have never given pictures of anyone but myself. Honestly that would be a dealbreaker if I was asked to. I think it would be a loss of privacy to my family. I also never gave their names, just a list of medical issues.

> I have my reasons for never wanting to know my father. Anyone who willingly degrades women to sexual objectification in pornography, willingly disowns the children he doesn't personally want, willingly impregnates multiple strangers, has these people raise his biological children, and never once in his life checks in to see if his kids are healthy, happy, alive, is not worth my time looking for. This person is the most atrocious and loathing human male on the planet, and the issue is that he thinks he has just done a service to humanity. We have enough men who abandon and disown their children, it's called 'deadbeat fatherhood'. Just because you were paid doesn't mean you're a hero. You're still a monster.

If you're curious about why men are arrested on DUI in those numbers, there are studies and data in addition to this one out there.

I do my entire routine in the shower. Venus Embrace razors are great. They are expensive, but worth it.

I change mine once a week - I shave everywhere almost every day, but I have trichotillomania/dermatillomania/OCD so if I don't shave I go crazy with the tweezers and it ends poorly - you may be able to get 10+ days out of one razor head depending on how frequently you shave.

Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel is the best shaving cream/gel/whatever I've found so far. I apply copious amounts of mineral oil to the area I'm about to shave before the shave gel, shave, and then follow up with mineral oil after shaving. This has made my eczema-prone, very dry skin a lot happier than it usually is. I also apply a small amount of mineral oil to my armpits and bikini area after I shave, and it significantly reduces any razor burn or ingrown hair issues.

Do you have insurance? If not, birth control can be pricy and I'd begin my search with one on a discount drug list. Walmart has several for $9/month http://www.walmart.com/cp/4-Prescriptions/1078664 and most  retailers with discount drug lists have around the same offerings. 

How responsible are you? All birth control takes discipline but some are more forgiving than others. Progestin-only mini pills have fewer side effects for many girls but take longer to take effect and are much more likely to lead to accidental pregnancy if instructions aren't followed exactly or if something happens (like throwing up soon after taking). I take a combined pill that's ""heavy duty"" enough that I can actually miss an entire day and not need backup at all assuming I follow the directions. 

Are there any other symptoms that you're looking to decrease? Some pills help more than others with acne, unwanted hair, etc. 

One more thing to keep in mind is that there's a growing body of evidence that the progestin-only pills may not be nearly as effective in overweight women. Scary stuff.

Bf wears condoms every time but we've started into a not so good habit of feeling it out without one. So I figured getting on bc just in case would make it a better experience for both of us so we wouldn't have to worry.

As for other symptoms, no.

It sounds like the mini pill might be a good option for you, depending on a few things. Your obgyn will know more but some studies suggest that it's less effective if you weigh over 175 lb and much less effective if you're over 200 lb. And again, you have to be very good about taking it. For my pills, I keep them in my purse and have an alarm on my cell that goes off every day to remind me. I'd suggest the same to you. You might also want to look into the Nuvaring, which is more localized and might have fewer side effects

Doc felt the cysts on my pelvic exam, told me to come back in three months and put me on the pill. I have a family history if fluid cysts and I told him about that (my sister had surgery at 14, she had a grapefruit-sized cyst). Anyway, three months later, he says we might want to talk about surgery but not much else. 

It was almost Christmas, so I went back home and had the doc who did my sister's surgeries take a look. He suggested that I find a new doctor back here in IL, was mad the guy didn't do surgery ASAP or at least schedule an ultrasound, based on what I told him about my family history.

Went back, found new doctor, and had surgery in early February. Even after the ultrasound, she assumed it would by a fluid cyst, didn't know what they had until they got in there. Had two on the left side that none of the three doctors recognized, and she didn't see it on the ultrasound either.

I never had an symptoms! No pain, no weird periods that I was aware of.

But back to your original question ... if you are on the pill, there is no reason to get a period. The ""period"" that you get on the pill is just there for marketing -- because it feels ""natural"" but it's really unnecessary. HOWEVER if that is what you want, go for it :)

It's a complete PITA to figure what which pill or other device works for you. I had a friend who loved her patch, but then that is being blamed for blood clots, as is Yaz. Other's love their Nuva Ring, or their IUD. Someone suggested I look at a diaphragm. Personally not a fan of something I have to put in pre-sexy times.

I lost mine because it lost too much blood. If you look at my post history I put up pictures a few months ago.

YES! This is her main issue! She's tall, very athletic, and strong. Damn near Amazonian. She will never be ""dainty"", but she wants to be. It pisses me off that she gets that kind of pressure at her age. I know it hits everyone...but still. It pisses me off. She should revel in what makes her unique....but she's 13.

She is heavily involved in sports that use her size to an advantage; horseback riding, volleyball, long distance running. She's expressed an interest in martial arts, but one of the other activities has to go before we add more. Family rule.

I think this is a big part of it. It wasn't a huge deal until the past few years, and I think some of her crushes have been put off by her height. She hasn't said anything and shrugs it off if I ask....but I'm pretty sure that's a big part of it.

20140428074919,princessdevitt,"I am 5'10"" and I have always been tall. Not only that, but I was a late bloomer so I was completely lanky. It always made me self conscious because I stood out from all my friends. However, in college, I grew into my body. Where people used to make fun of me, I started getting compliments and jealous whines from my friends about how tall and thin I am. My mother was constantly telling me that I'd love my height as an adult, and it never really made me feel better. But she was right. Here are some of my favorite things about being tall:

-Even though it sucks having to buy bigger clothes, people are shocked when they find out my size. ""But you're so thin!"" It's the best feeling ever when people react like that. Plus, being tall makes it easier to carry extra weight.

-Even though my current boyfriend is 6'5"", the shorter guys I've dated have never been turned off by my height. Guys love legs, and it makes me stand out. Plus, normal clothes look shorter on me, which sucked in school (I got dress code violations all the time) but is pretty great now. Sorry, as her father I know you don't want to hear that :P

-When people literally have to look up to you, they tend to take you more seriously. Even though I have a round and young looking face, no one mistakes me for a little girl. This helps with everything from job interviews to arguments.

-I work in a library and I don't have to worry about moving those annoying metal stools around the bookshelves.

There are some disadvantages, of course. Sometimes I look awkward in pictures with my short friends, but if you practice posing you can get it right and look fabulous. My other job is working for a professional wrestling company. I do backstage interviews and that sort of thing, but the promoter is hesitant to use me in the actual show because I make the wrestlers look short and less threatening. It's kind of cool to have that effect though. :)

But the absolute worst thing is bowling. All my friends get the cute neon shoes, and my size 11s usually look like something a clown died in. Plus it's always awkward to follow a chorus of ""Size 6 please"" with ""What's the biggest you got?"" But if she can get over little embarrassing things like that, she can handle anything. Confidence is key!

**Edit:** Speaking of confidence, nag her about her posture as much as possible. She'll thank you later. I was always slouching, trying to make myself look shorter. I'm 23 and I already have back problems. Tell her to embrace her height and rock it, head held high!",10,t3_245i6w

20140428040751,crapulencecurator,"6ft tall female here.   Being tall can be really hard when you're a teenager.  You want to fit in, but your height makes that physically impossible.  Plus people (mostly adults who should know better) make silly observations about your height 'Gee you're tall!' (cue eyeroll).  Those kinds of comments just end up making you feel more awkward. It does get better, however.  I have some witty comebacks to comments about my height, e.g.: 'Do you play basketball?' My reply: 'Do you play mini golf?'.  If I'm at a concert and someone behind me makes snarky comments about my height within my earshot, then I make a point of ignoring that person. If that person can't be bothered treating me with respect and asking me politely if I can move, then that person is not worthy of my attention. I refuse to apologise for my height. I've found that those comments about height do become less as you get older, thankfully. 

Other things that have helped me build my confidence: sport.  Playing sports where height is an asset (basketball!) really helps with maintaining/improving coordination when you're having growth spurts.  Buying clothes that actually *fit* from shops that have a tall section, or specialty tall shops helps with confidence. It's a wonderful feeling, putting on a piece of clothing that fits the way it should! If shoe shops don't stock her size, complain. Your daughter should not be forced to buy men's shoes. 

Your daughter will probably be tempted to slouch in an attempt to minimize her body.  Don't let her do it, tell her to stand up straight.  Yes, she'll probably hate being told that, but it will pay off when she's older. My mother nagged me about standing straight constantly, but now I'm so glad she did. I have a tall cousin in her forties who slouches, and it looks terrible.  Being tall really is an asset and something to be proud of, not something to apologise for.

I'm taller than most women, sure, but I rarely think about it in social situations. Sometimes with guys I do feel a bit...off? My last partner was shorter than me and to start with I felt incredibly awkward until it finally sank in that he didn't care and my being awkward about it was much more awkward than my not caring. 

Here's where it's useful: I can walk fast, I can take the stairs 2 or 3 at a time, I can climb trees super well (and get over fences!), and in my time I was a first class lacrosse goalie (taller than the goal!) I get significantly less street hassle and pestering in general than my shorter lady friends get, and I can reach things on high shelves. 

The shoe thing is still a pain in the ass. I wear men's trainers and casual shoes - converse, running shoes, etc. For women's shoes I shop at tall lady stores - long tall sally (UK), I just discovered tallgirls.co.uk, and my favourite heels and boots have all been Hush Puppies who go up to a size 11. It's difficult because they're more expensive and usually only available online but they tend to be good quality and leather and because I have so few pairs of heels I tend to be happier spending more so they last a really long time.

It does intimidate people at times, but I just don't give a crap and they tend to relax about it eventually. All my boyfriends have been a bit shorter but really the whole idea that the woman should be shorter than the man is biased nonsense anyway. 

My advice would be to encourage her to feel proud of her height and view it as a positive asset. Disencourage her from trying to hide it. Try never to make remarks that even slightly suggest she is too tall for something or she looks funny with shorter friends etc. Finally, long flared trousers with a tucked in shirt and a sleeveless cardigan is one look that I find works really well with my height.

20140428084635,lisq,"5'9"" here.  It's hard to be a tall girl because there is so much social pressure to be small and meek and acted-upon. Really really. A survey of teenage girls shows that they think that sex is something that happens to them, not something they participate in.  Your daughter might be dealing with a lot of ""coming of age"" realizations before her peers because being small and meek teenager (only to bloom in later years) just isn't a practical option.  She's being confronted with being an individual head on rather than exploring the desires to be an individual like so many of her peers... that being said, it's tough as hell to grow up a teenage girl... no matter what you look like, it's just not what you're friggin supposed to look like.

If she's having a lot of trouble fitting in a school or feeling confident then you really need to get her into extra curricular activities. Swimming and venture crew (co ed boy scouts for 14+ year olds) is where I made friends. I struggled with body confidence, too... I think swimming really really helped with that.  Sports have a way of making you appreciate your body for what it can do rather than what it looks like.

That's all the advice I can give you. Make sure your daughter has an outlet for stress (exercise being the best) and make sure that she has enough opportunity to make quality friendships (extra curricular activities).

Leather shoes will stretch, if needs must. Always research before you go shopping to avoid disappointment/embarrassment/wasted time, know where you can and cannot go and don't bother with the places which don't stock the right size. Also - heels are wonderful, heels are good, anyone who doesn't like her wearing heels is not worth her time. 

I also stopped growing at about fourteen/fifteen, so it's likely she won't get much taller now! She's pretty much done, probably.

In 8th grade, I had to go to the high school to take math, and the first day I walked in, I was hit with such relief when  realized that everyone was taller than me or around my height.

My mom is six feet tall, with naturally crimped, curly, dirty blond hair that looks wild (i got her hair, but curlier and a few shades darker). She wears size eleven shoes (her feet are long and flat, like skis). I don't know what her parents did for her self-confidence growing up, but, as her daughter, I always pictured her as this awesome, strong, powerful Amazon woman. She used her height to intimidate people who were trying to mistreat her (or my sister and I). When she walks into a room people can't not notice - she is so clearly *present*. She still had body-image issues - she is not very curvy, and laments a lack of booty - but she generally seemed to feel attractive and confident. When I was a kid, I wanted nothing so bad as to be tall like my mom.

One thing:: tall women tend to try to shrink from their tallness. A common tendency is to roll one's shoulders in, and kind of hunch around, like you're trying to hold a basketball with your stomach and chest. I'm not sure how to correct that behavior in a positive way (it's a coping mechanism, so people get defensive of it), but it's not super great for your back and shoulders.",2,t3_245i6w

Just showing her that you can be whatever you want, no matter how tall you are, might be helpful.

One thing that helped me was something that my dad told me when I was in high school. We were in Mongolia and I was feeling awful because I was like a tripleXL in their clothing. I felt so out of place. He told me that it wasn't fair to compare myself to them because we were different species. That they were gazelles and I was an elk, and an elk can want to be a gazelle all she wants, but it won't ever happen.  And yes it doesn't get to the issues that society thinks that gazelles are prettier than elks, but it helped me in some weird way.

Could you involve her in crew? Volleyball might serve the same function, but there was something about being in a boathouse where I was on the short end, where the doorknobs and counters and chairs are all at a ""proper"" height, that felt amazing.

My height was something that people noticed immediately, and I was regularly notified that I was tall, which I found incredibly annoying, but it did mean that they noticed me straight away, which was something unique I grew to like.

There are some negative things about it, but there are lots of positives too. This is really a thing she's going to have to discover for herself though. I've been bullied, harassed, and made fun of for my height all my life. Yes, even as an adult. A couple of guys in a restaurant called me a freak because I was taller than them. It hurts, it always will. It's hard to find clothes that fit properly too. I have to shell out extra cash to buy jeans that are long enough for my legs and shirts that fit my frame better. I'm not one of those tall people that is super skinny. I have broad shoulders and long arms. And huge feet too! I wear a 12 in women's shoes.

Those are the negatives. Thev positives are pretty awesome. Long legs are beautiful and look awesome in the right clothes. You will never have to use a foot stool to reach stuff on the top shelf.

Regardless of perceptions, there is something almost disturbingly empowering about looming over people.  However, it can also be uncomfortable because it breeds competition (particularly among other females).  I would suggest that you tell your daughter that her height will actually be very beneficial to her in her future by endowing her with an interpersonal advantage from the very start.  But I do agree that there's no quick fix to how she's feeling--she'll have to navigate it over time and will realize the advantages once the heights of people around her stabilize.

Yes, humans are relatively small. No, I don't know what it all means. Those are some facts you know, and most of the time they don't mean that much to you.

But have you ever been entranced by the stars? You lie there feeling how big it all is. How small we all are. How miraculous, how terrifying life is? 

When you find yourself alone at night with the universe you don't just know those facts anymore, you begin to understand them in a much different way. You feel those truths in a way that is impossible to maintain in the day-to-day.

For many of us education is a similar experience.

You know for a fact that you have to go to school to get the job you want, but you don't feel in your soul the thrill of progressing towards your goal. How can anyone, really, when they're locked in a library? I certainly couldn't when I was in your shoes.

The struggles of everyday life may wear you down, down, down, down and you forget in your heart why you are doing all of this. Maybe you never knew that truth in your heart to begin with. You don't feel that there's life after this. But there is. I promise.

There will be interviews, first days, exciting new projects, and big promotions. There will be coworkers who will make you laugh until you cry, opportunities you never dreamed of, and life changing decisions to be made.

There will be hard things too, of course. Some very hard things. But you will be out in the world, at the helm of your life, making decisions and feeling the consequences, and you will be doing it all for you. 

It's just for you. So you can be everything you want to be, and do everything you want to do in your time on this planet.

Try looking up some listings for dream jobs that get you excited about your future. Consider finding a small volunteer position for something that sparks your passion, or maybe start your own small, independent project. I did this when I was in your position, and getting myself excited and reminding myself that I was building the career I wanted made all the difference to me.

Take care of yourself as best you can. See a counselor. Consider medication again. Try mindfulness meditation to help you gain perspective in everyday situations. Practice your faith if you have one that is meaningful to you. Exercise, eat well, stay in touch with friends. You know the drill.

Understand that what you're experiencing is very normal, but not trivial. Don't kick yourself when you are down. Some of the greatest people of human history have grappled with depression; it is a monumental task and you should be proud of yourself for enduring it. You must be a very strong woman. Not everyone will understand that, but I do.

Finally know that whoever you are, wherever you are, my love and respect are with you.

I've seen some derogatory comments from other gamers about women, but honestly not as much as I expected. 

The majority of my negative experience as a woman who games has been IRL. Guys find out I play video games and suddenly it becomes a test for me to ""prove"" that I play and I find myself defending the games I play.

It's 5 years later, and the bunch of us still very regularly end up back at somebody's place to game after going out to dinner, and although I'm the only lady of the bunch, I never feel treated any differently for it, and have a great time playing, win, lose, or draw.

Online is another story. I always play female toons, when given the option of character creation, and I still remember the first time in WoW that a random male player followed me around and showered gold and items on me in hopes that there was a real lady behind the screen - it weirded me out in a BIG way. Going on-mic always results in shenanigans: I have what my friends describe as a voice made for radio, so even my most deadpan or casual statements apparently bring the dudes a'running. I've had dudes follow my character around a multiplayer map like sad puppies (because proximity to my character was gonna make me pay more attention, apparently?) and fuck up my sniping because they kept blocking my shot. I don't go on mic anymore, and I often avoid online multiplayer on 360 as my username has a feminine honorific in it (I didn't know any better when I made the profile) and immediately draws attention to me. 

The only times I've not been targeted/hassled online is when I'm on with guys I either know IRL or have gamed with for years who'll vouch for me, and that makes me tetchy that a dude has to give me the say-so for me to be respected in that virtual space. UGH.

Pardon the rant. It's a thing.

tldr; It's, regrettably, a common thing in many online gaming communities, and one I don't anticipate changing anytime soon; there are dudes who are the exception and not the rule, but it always seems to be the assholes who make the biggest, most lasting impression.

Also, you should stop and think about what is important.  I know it seems like you are young and you have lots of time, but people asking about this may be thinking about you.  Having kids does ""cost a lot of money"", if you are concerned about living a certain lifestyle.

Saving money for a house, a wedding, etc may seem like something very important to you.  It may seem like the most important thing ever.

Put it this way, if you decide to wait another 3 years before you start thinking about kids, you'll be 27.  If you start immediately, at 27, and go off birthcontrol, chances are you can get pregnant right away and have a health baby.

But if you put it off, and put off, by the time you get to age 30, and decide to start trying your odds will take a deep dive.  If you've still not had your first in 8 years, chances are you never will.

So, work on your plan, but do put kids on the plan, whether or not all your hopes and ideals are realized.  There may never be a perfect time to have a baby.  But if you wait too long, you may miss the opportunity.",-8,t3_245rm7

And then you you get into high rates of birth defects and infant mortality.  

If you want kids, 27 is at the tail end of the optimal time to have them.  From here on out, it starts looking scarier and scarier.

I repeat: stick the plan, save, get your life in order, but quickly.  Kids are expensive, but not prohibitively.  It's better to cancel cable, scale back the internet, bike to work, cook at home, and live very frugally, then to wait a few more years until you are more secure financially.

Injuries like these could go either way: could be pretty shallow or small and heal up, or it could be deeper/bigger and require treatment to help with the pain, healing process, and prevent infections that may be vision-threatening.

Bleeding during sex is because the hymen (a membrane in your vagina) is tearing, and it is a bad thing. It means there wasn't enough lube, which usually means you weren't turned on. That you didn't bleed the first time means you were relaxed, turned on, and using enough lube. The second time, well, you said you were tense. The pain you felt the first time may have been from expecting it to hurt or him being large.

So give that a try. If you're using condoms, stick to water or silicone based lube. If you're not, coconut oil is a popular choice on /r/sex.

If that doesn't help, you probably need to get at least some stimulation if not an actual orgasm before moving to PIV. A lot of folks abide by a ""she comes first"" rule, for a number of reasons, a prominent one being that statistically speaking women find it easier to start again than men.

- depending on your budget, pay for a handful of 30 minute or hour-long personal training sessions. Once you make that appointment with your trainer, it's hard to back out.

Competitive sports. Specifically, roller derby.

In late summer-fall of 2009, I did a whole couch-to-5k program, in preparation for a 5k that fall. It was hard work, but somehow I stuck with it, and completed the 5k without walking - though barely.

Spring of 2010, from a desire to just try something new, I found a beginner group for learning the basics of roller derby. I could skate without holding on to the wall, which was enough to get started. It was so much fun that I was able to push through the sore muscles and 2 hours of skating twice a week, and even started doing 1-2 nights of open skate a week during it. By summer, I had signed up for the local league's summer 6-week skating camp. Come fall, I tried out for the league and made it.

But the league required 3 practices a week, minimum. 2 hour practices, all which were tougher than anything I had done yet. I'd often do four, as I needed it to learn, and now had more incentive for the gym.

I just finished my fourth season. Four years of 3+/week practices, gym workouts, and so on. I've done personal training sessions after running a 5k as a warmup. 

All it took was making the exercise part of and necessary for something I really enjoyed. And that I had made a commitment to my 15+ coaches and teammates that I would make my required practices and improve my skills so that I could play and be effective.

I wasted every single day basically doing this. I was lazy and overweight. I wasn't really all that messy that I can remember, but I wasn't at all productive.

Then I had a goal. A friend/coworker of mine who is in her late 50s (as well as her 80 year old mother) were still completing triathlons. Triathlons! I thought, that's something I'd like to accomplish! So, I started riding my bike. At first, just a few miles, maybe 20 minutes worth, and I was proud of myself. I wanted to see how much further I could do, how much more I could push myself. Triathlon was still in the back of my mind but it wasn't necessarily my driving force. 

I LOVED biking (hint: find something you enjoy and love). As soon as I got off work I was rushing home to change my clothes and get on my bike. It was almost meditative for me to be on the bike. I started to need it. It gave me time to think and reflect and to just BE.  

Soon, I was going on 1-1.5 hour long bike rides. Add in time for rests, cool down, etc. I was spending 2 hours after work worth of biking. I'd get home and cool down and before I knew it, it was 8pm and I needed to shower, eat, and soon go to bed. I didn't even have time or energy to be lazy!

This past year, I trained for and completed not just one but TWO triathlons (sprint distance)! I scheduled my time and went to the pool and for a run and even though I had to cut back on biking, it was worth it. Crossing that finish line (of whatever it is your goal may be!) is ALWAYS worth it. Otherwise, your life becomes a mundane task and you'll soon realize you're the same person you were years ago.... That just wasn't enough for me.

20140428135054,jmk816,"I feel ya. I have that problem too (depression and used negativity to motivate myself). I'm working on both things and here are some of my ways of getting myself to do stuff. 

- Plan stuff for right after work, so that you don't have time to go home. Once I get home during the week it's much harder to go out again. If you do have to stop home, no sitting or taking off your shoes. 

- You don't need a gym to workout. I workout at home because then I can do it whenever I want, I don't have to wear pants and no one is watching me huff and puff and get sweaty. I do body weight exercises, using a pull up bar but I can't remember the link for that (I'll try to find it when I am home):

www.hulu.com/gaiam-wellness

http://www.myomytv.com/archive/

/r/xxfitness has some good suggestions as well

- If you spend a lot of time thinking about all these things; when the thought first crosses your mind, ask yourself, can I do something about this right now? If you can't do your best to push it aside. If you can, doing it right now with no more thinking. The putting it off mentality takes time and stress. This sort of thinking change doesn't happen overnight but sometimes getting the ball rolling leads to more action.

- Energy and mood can change a lot. So if you have one good week, where you are getting stuff done and the next one is more meh and your own habits, that's normal. Give yourself space to have off days. If you can, do small maintaining stuff that doesn't take up as much energy. 

- Right now you see all your problems as this huge pile that seems connected. Try to seperate the distinct problems you are facing and then set a couple managable goals so as not to overwhelm yourself. I have a lot of trouble with this, because there is a lot of waiting around at my job, so I do a lot of planning but then when I get home, I don't have nearly enough energy to do everything on my list. 

- See the small things you are doing in terms of something you completed instead of comparing it to what still needs to be done. 

Lastly, you have already taken a big step in the right direction. Recognizing the problem and searching for strategies is a big step. A lot of people would rather stay in stasis and not confront these things at all. Good luck with everything!",2,t3_246jqw

HOWEVER, I feel that over time I learned to trick myself into being slightly more productive than I was a few years ago. I assume everyone is different so you have to start recognizing you're own avoidance tactics and start learning how to take advantage of or derail them. Here's some examples

* I love music. When it was very important to me that I go to the gym I would ONLY listen to music while at or going to/from the gym. It turned it into a very positive experience and I would actively feel bad if I didn't do it
* If I am on a computer it is impossible for me to focus. There is no force on this earth that can give me that willpower. If I can work on something with just pad/paper I will. When I need to use my computer I will turn on an extension like ""Strict Workflow"" or ""Stayfocused"" that literally blocks me from going to websites for a given amount of time. I will simply not work without it.
* No eating when bored (both for health and procrastination reasons) I realized on day when I'm busy and content it takes me about 5 hours after a meal before I feel hungry again. So on days when I'm lazing about I will not eat until 5 hours have passed since I last ate.
* I totally use to do planning as a form of procrastination. I've realized it and I no longer get satisfaction of ""job well done"" for spending an hour on a too do list.

20140429102453,arbitraryarchivist,"I used to be the laziest of asses, oh man. I'd come home from work and just kind of vegg on the internet until bed. The source? I was depressed - primarily because I hated my job/had a lousy BF, and didn't realize either of those things. I didn't want to clean my apartment, or cook dinner, or exercise, or even really do the things I enjoyed, like read or write or play video games; I came home without two brain cells to rub together.

And then I got a better job, one I love. And when my lousy BF was dismissive of my job as ""not 'real' work,"" I dumped him. And now, when I get home from work, I go to the gym for a bit, or do yoga in the living room; I cook dinner or reheat leftovers, and rinse my dishes instead of piling them in the sink; I keep my place tidy, and do a big clean on the weekend; I spend at least a couple evenings a week out with friends. And I am so, so much happier than I ever was before.

Something in your life could be draining you, the way my job and relationship were a drain on me. If you can pinpoint the source of that and change or remove it, you may find you have the energy you need to live the active lifestyle you want.

20140428231837,jammbin,"Absolutely you can change! But you need to start simple, don't overwhelm yourself or you will just give up quickly and go back to your bad habits. Here are the keys:

1.) You are a product of your thoughts - if your thoughts are positive and loving and motivating, you will become that.

2.) This kind of goes along with #1, but stop with the excuses. Best thing my mom ever said to me, was that when you decide to not do something, don't say ""I can't"" when what you really mean is ""I won't"". Seriously, try it next time you decide not to tidy up your room or take a walk around the block. Say to yourself ""I am choosing not to do this because ________."" Usually you find that you are prioritizing something else, which is fine in some instances, but it is that constant realization of what you are prioritizing that will help you see your behavior.

3.) Seek motivating help. Read '7 Habits', talk to a therapist, etc. Forming new life habits is not easy, but really it just comes down to practice. 

4.) Ditch the tv and technology. (yes, I know the irony as I am in bed on reddit - but I am very serious about this). This stuff is an addictive time sink. You can spend hours on facebook, reddit, watching tv, etc. and you have accomplished nothing. Try turning it all off for a week (it is ok to check your e-mail, etc, but set limits. Let people know you are turning your phone off between 6-9pm, unplug your tv for the week, etc. You will get bored. When you get bored go do something productive or something new that you might enjoy. 

5.) Figure out what is driving your laziness. Is it a lack of motivation, are you prioritizing activities that help you escape, are you bored, are you depressed, are you overwhelmed by the amount of things that you will need to take care of if you start, are you worried that it will be too hard? Once you are really honest with yourself about what is driving this you can handle it a lot better. Having depression is an entirely different situation than being overwhelmed by having to do stuff and they will require very separate approaches.

There is probably a lot of other stuff I can add, but I hope this is helpful. I know how you feel, but just the fact that you are posting this shows that somewhere deep down you want to change. You aren't the only one. Every person is struggling with something and we are all working harder to grow and understand and to be better people. It is not in any way a failure that things are in disarray for you right now. You are human. But if you feel that your life would be more fulfilling or more peaceful or you would find greater happiness with organization/activity, etc. then by all means, practice that life.",1,t3_246jqw

**Last Wednesday** I had to take an Anatomy and Physiology exam.  This exam directly reflects on my grade and my grades are under scrutiny because I just applied for the Nursing program at my Community College.  There were 200 applicants for 100 slots.  If I don't get an education and a career in a certain number of years *I won't be able to feed and house my children.*

**Last Friday** I had my milk ducts removed from my right breast.  I had a discharge months ago that showed I might have cancer cells in my breast and a mammogram, sonogram and a MRI just couldn't rule this out.  Since my insurance runs out when my marriage does I chose to have them removed now rather than monitor them because I didn't know if I could afford treatment in the future.  The procedure is more involved than originally thought and my breast specialist thinks it's likely that the blood supply to my nipple will not reestablish it'self and *my nipple will turn black and fall off.*

**BUT**

I got everything I wanted out of mediation and all money and custody issues are resolved.  I'll have time to go to school so I can support myself and my children.

Similarly, I'm not going to bash movies like Saving Private Ryan because its setting and its themes don't lend themselves to woman-woman conversation. And that's fine! Not every movie needs to pass!

The point of the Bechdel test is to point how how crazy it is that, overall, on a large scale, so few movies actually do accomplish this relatively small feat.

As some who also experienced violent sexual assault. 
Yes. Rape is a major theme in game of thrones. I think it's a good thing the show portrays rape in a variety of forms because it sparks awareness and discussion. I would be more upset if they only portrayed rape in the burn-the-village-and-pillage-the-townsfolk sort of one dimensional way. Rape isn't just one thing, it occurs in wedlock, in ""loving"" relationships, in consensually incestuous relationships, and with paid sex workers. Also its a world where women don't typically get to give consent, marriage is a business consideration.

Yes it is pornographic... it's an HBO show with dragons. Shaming people for enjoying pornography is slut shaming. 

There has been a lot of uproar about the episode last weeks episode with the Jamie/Cersei rape scene. But considering the extremely screwed up nature of their relationship is the question of consent even possible? 

I mean for context they were doing it almost on the corpse of their murdered, inbred, asshole, son. The son who Cersei tacitly encourages to psychologically torment a teenage girl with her fathers death and head on a stick, and encourages that girls non-consensual wedding to her brother, and then encourages him to rape her to secure the legitimacy of the marriage. They attempted to murder a young boy by pushing him out a window mid coitus. They planned the murder or Cersei's husband (Who would also rape her semi-regularly, nobody said a thing about that). Not to mention that the main reason she rejects Jamie is because he's crippled now and that revolts her (which if we want to get all PC is at best shallow or at worst discrimination). 


It just blows my mind that in a show where just moments before they were HUNTING PEOPLE FOR SPORT, the question of consent between a murdering incestuous pair of fundamentally not good people is THE THING that turns people off about the show. 

Whats the solution? Censorship? Never portraying or discussing uncomfortable topics in popular culture? If Game of Thrones causes people to rape, it should also cause an spike in flaying humans and murdering people at weddings.

20140428114527,pokethepig,"Never once did I say that watching rape scenes in game of thrones causes people to rape.  

And I understand your point that flaying and burning people to death and such is just as fucked up.  I wonder though, how many real life people in the modern word in the US are confronted with that, daily, or have ever dealt with it.  I wonder how much psychological affect something so removed from their reality can have.  A lot of fucking people have been raped, and when they're trying to watch an otherwise amazing show, it fucking sucks to be thrown into a PTSD spiral every fifteen minutes.  Did I say they should censor all rape scenes?  No, quite the opposite; I said that a well-done show, movie, or book can deal with rape in a great and respectful way.  But when it gets to the point of gratuity, when it's all the fucking time and the plot could go on just dandy without it, and you have cameras panning in on jiggling breasts and whatnot, that's when rape is being treated as another thing to get viewers off, which is fucked up, or to simply shock them, which is lazy.  I don't have a problem with sexuality and nudity in the show (although I feel like the nudity could be more fairly gender-balanced, but that's another matter).  But I think it is in poor taste to treat it as pornographic.  And yes, not every rape scene they do is that way.  And yes, it is interesting and perhaps important to see all of the different forms rape can take.  (SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER AHEAD) But good damn, that scene last night was deplorable and did nothing to facilitate the plot.  Licking that skull-head and having a bruised woman cowering beside some big asshole did just fine in communicating to the viewer that crowley's house had indeed turned even further into a debaucherous, rapey snake pit.  It did nothing for the plot having a woman raped from behind with her tits bouncing every which way.  And if you can't see how a scene depicting something that one in five women have experienced and even more people have had someone they care about deal with (i.e. Rape) if you can't see how that can have a deeper psychological affect than seeing someone getting their throat slit with a sword (something not even remotely common or something that many have survived through) then I don't know what to tell you. And If what happened last night is the tune of the rape scenes that are going
to be continuing in the show, they can fuck right off.  And, by the way, I did include in my comment that I will not be watching the show anymore, so your preface was pretty unnecessary.  I was simply stating my disappointment with the show and how I will not be able to continue to watch it, because otherwise the show is amazing.


Edit: and I absolutely do not see how having a problem with making rape scenes to be pornographic is slut-shaming.  I don't have a problem with pornography, I have a problem with rape (things that are not consensual rape play/fantasy, etc.) being turned into porn for the viewer.  It's fucked up. You would probably feel the same way if they had a scene where an adult was raping a child in gratuitous detail with the child's body parts offered to the viewer in a seductive way.  I don't see why this is any different.

Its what bothers me about Game of Thrones. That the cruelty and violence in the show has gotten so egregious that it ceases to be  psychologically realistic. No one in the show has a moral compass and the sexual violence is only one facet of that. It leaves the audience desensitized and nihilistic.

1. Observation without judgment. Describing the behavior. 
2. Name the emotion. State what it is evoking in you, or guess what the other person is feeling and ask them. http://www.cnvc.org/Training/feelings-inventory
3. State the need connected to that emotion, or guess the need of the other person and ask. http://www.cnvc.org/Training/needs-inventory
4. Request a concrete and positive action. This is not a demand.

I think you're correct here on both counts. No one likes to have their self-concept challenged. Ironically, I think the more rabid ""social justice warriors"" suffer the exact same problem, at least in the context of online debates. When you've styled yourself as morally superior, it can be difficult to empathize with anyone who disagrees with you because clearly your arguments are more virtuous because they're yours.

20140428204254,Ratling,"There are a few problems with the ""not all men"" response to feminism (obviously this depends on the context - from your comment it is difficult to tell if the comments people were making were feminist and promoting gender equality or not.  If not, then this doesn't really apply as the article and rhetorique about the ""not all men"" reponse is in regards to its usage as a response to feminism).

1. (Which the article raises) It can be and often is used to derail or delegitimize the substance of the argument, when the substance of the argument is not that all men do that thing. If the writing is about someone's personal experience or a phenomena (male privilege, rape culture, the patriarchy, etc...) the fact that not all men are like that is totally irrelevant to the conversation.  For example, if someone is discussing the fact that men take less responsibility for caregiving of the elderly, saying that some men do holds the same weight as anecdotal evidence and paints the feminist as the bigot.

2. It shows that the person raising this as a counter point is not versed with the issue at hand.  I read a lot of feminist writing and rarely, if ever, have I seen anything saying that every single man on earth is a certain way.   That, simply speaking, is not the issue feminists are attempting to address.  

3. It allows for a man to feel no social responsibility towards the issue of gender inequality. (I don't objectify women; therefore, I'm not a part of the problem and my job is done.)  This ignores the fact that men, whether they are active sexists or not, benefit from the patriarchy.

But, in general, I would say that this response is so often non sequitur in nature.

No. It shouldn't matter if somebody's comments are ""feminist"" or ""promote gender equality."" If somebody makes a comment that is true, it should be accepted.  If a person says ""not all men rape"" that statement is true and should be accepted, even if that person is not a feminist. 

> If the writing is about someone's personal experience or a phenomena (male privilege, rape culture, the patriarchy, etc...) the fact that not all men are like that is totally irrelevant to the conversation. 

No it's actually extremely relevant.  If a person says ""I was robbed by a black guy, so therefore all black guys are muggers"" that statement should be condemned as wrong and bigoted. It makes no difference if men do something.  Even if 99% of men rape (which they do not), it is still unfair and sexist to say ""men rape.""  Because ""men"" do not rape.  A certain percentage of men rape.  And if feminists are serious about spreading their message (as opposed to just yelling at people), they should be very careful about their language. 

> For example, if someone is discussing the fact that men take less responsibility for caregiving of the elderly, saying that some men do holds the same weight as anecdotal evidence and paints the feminist as the bigot.

Once again, men should not be generalized.  It's wrong to say ""men take less responsibility for caregiving of the elderly.""  Some men do, some men don't.  Even if men overall were less likely to take care of the elderly, saying that ""men take less responsibility"" is a bigoted and sexist thing to say.

> I read a lot of feminist writing and rarely, if ever, have I seen anything saying that every single man on earth is a certain way. 

There are a lot of blogs and other forums, written by lesser-educated feminists, that regularly use terms like ""men"" or ""white men"" in a broad, general sense. If you ignore that this happens a lot, you are being disingenuous.

The article is about ""not all men"" **as a response to feminist expression**.  So if the comments made were not about feminism then my response, and the article is irrelevant.  That is why it's important, in this context, to know if the comments in question were feminist.

If the person was robbed by a black guy, and the response is ""Not all black guys are robbers"", then that is not relevant to that person's personal experience, nor does is change the fact that the individual is question was robbed by a black guy.  I think you would be hard-pressed to find feminist writing which says ""I was raped by a man; therefore, all men rape.""

This is a perfect example of my point.  Saying ""some men do, some don't"" ignores the fact that overall, [men take less responsibility for caregiving of the elderly](http://jag.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/10/29/0733464813508649.abstract).  The ""overall"" is implied.  It's how people talk.  Just like, if I ask ""Why do dogs have tails?"" the ""overall"" is implied.  Responding with ""Well, not all dogs have tails. Some dogs do; some dogs don't.  Don't go painting all dogs with the same brush."" is ridiculous and is a intentional manipulation of the issue.  

> There are a lot of blogs and other forums, written by lesser-educated feminists, that regularly use terms like ""men"" or ""white men"" in a broad, general sense. If you ignore that this happens a lot, you are being disingenuous.

I do see that  lot, in the context of talking about phenomena.  In those same article, I see women discussed in broad strokes as well, again, in teh context of talking about phenomena.  What I don't see frequently is ""all men"" or ""all white men"". 

> This goes back to ""I won't talk to you unless you're a feminist"" thing.

That's much more polite and PC than saying ""Men take much less responsibility for the care of the elderly."" The former might be met with ""Well I volunteer at the old folks' home, I'm not like that! Not all men are like that!"" to which you respond ""That's great, how can we get more men involved in helping the elderly?"" and the two of you proceed to have a great, productive discussion, even though someone responded with ""not all x are like that."" However, if you word it like the latter, you're much more likely to raise someone's emotions and shut them out from the conversation.

If someone feels the need to say ""not all ___ are like that"" then that's generally a direct response to bigoted speech. ""I got ripped off at the store the other day, Jews really need to stop charging exorbitant prices for their products"" is bigoted hate speech and you rightfully would respond with, among other things, a comment saying that not all Jews are like that.

Similarly, if someone says ""I was sexually assaulted when I was 15, we really need to get men to stop doing such heinous things,"" it is also bigoted, hateful speech.

It might be derailing in that it is pointing out the author is using bigoted, hateful language without realizing it, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be discussed. Hate speech and stereotypes never come from a rational place, and it does discredit someone's argument if that's their source - in the same way you won't listen to a neo-Nazi's arguments about Jews ruling the world even if a disproportionately large % of the ruling class happens to be Jewish.

And speaking of wacko conspiracy theories born out of hatred, I don't believe in the patriarchy myth despite a disproportionately large % of the ruling class being male, so I don't agree with point #3 as written. For the record, I believe we live in a oligarchic kyriarchy where class privilege is far and away the most advantageous form of privilege, followed by attractive privilege, cis privilege, white privilege, hetero privilege, able bodied privilege, neurotypical privilege, and then maybe you have male privilege and female privilege, both with their respective areas they have advantages (ie economic vs social) and disadvantages. Patriarchy theory's notion that the predominant, main form of societal privilege is male privilege and not class privilege is hilariously wrong, and seems to be a great form of misdirection by the ruling class to get us to squabble over minor gender issues instead of banding together to fight the ridiculous class divide.

I do believe there is plenty of sex and gender based discrimination that all sexes and genders have to deal with, though, and do agree with the general point of your #3: anybody who claims to be ""fighting for gender equality"" without actively trying to help ALL genders (men, women, and everyone else) in areas they are disenfranchised  - only by passively not being a bigot or only focusing on the issues one gender faces - is kidding themselves.

This becomes especially likely if you keep lumping me in with men who do by saying ""men"" when you mean ""men who catcall."" Even if 75% of all men catcall, it is still wrong to assume that because any particular man catcalls in the same way it is wrong to assume that all women gossip or all black people like fried chicken. People should be judged on their own merits, not their external characteristics.

While this might seem academic, I don't think it is. Because, on a personal level, I know that feminists don't mean *all men* when they make their arguments. But I still get a little annoyed when I see it done.

1. Sexism is a fake idea invented by feminists

2. Sexism happens, but the effect of âreverse sexismâ on men is as bad or worse
3. Sexism happens, but the important part is that I personally am not sexist
4. Sexism happens, and I benefit from that whether or not I personally am sexist
5. Sexism happens, I benefit from it, I am unavoidably sexist sometimes because I was socialized that way, and if I want to be anti-sexist I have to be actively working against that socialization",4,t3_2479a4

1. What is the appropriate feminist response to a feminist encountering a man at each of these stages?

2. Which level does a man have to be at, before feminists should be willing to let him participate actively in the debate without being mocked or 'downvoted'?

I can certainly see why inviting someone at any level below 5 to your debate would run the risk of derailing or slowing down the discussion, and why it's therefore tempting to mock or exclude them.  However, if 95% of men are somewhere in stages 1-4, is this really the best long-term strategy?  And if not, where does the responsibility fall to change it?",7,t3_2479a4

It's based on a Steve Harvey book, and I don't think most people here would agree with his views on gender issues (or his views on atheists, among other things).

Anyway, if someone said that sort of thing to me I'd have no problem protesting.

There was just an article posted in /r/TrueReddit about how women suffer from low confidence in job interviews and the top five or ten comments were things like ""men suffer from confidence issues too!"" and ""sorry to not talk directly about the article, but men suffer as well"". Maybe this is a step in a better direction, but it's still frustrating.

20140428154324,darwin2500,"I think that 'men also' and 'not all men' are very different responses, as the author points out in the second half.  I see 'not all men' as (in some cases at least) a sincere attempt to join the *actual* discussion, albeit in one of two problematic ways:

1. As an attempt by a man to establish his own bonafides as 'not part of the problem,' so that he feels he has the right to participate in the discussion, rather than being the problem being discussed and therefore being *de facto* excluded.  As the author points out, this is problematic because it still doesn't acknowledge that person's privilege or their subconscious contributions to the larger social problem; but at least it acknowledges the problem (at least partially) and is an attempt to participate.

2. As an attempt to clarify and specify the problem by pointing out that only a subset of men offend in this way, in a pragmatic attempt to move the discussion towards attacking those offenders specifically and coming up with direct actions against them, rather than bemoaning a universal trait about the evils of 'men.'  In some cases this can actually be a useful clarification, but it's often problematic in situation where a specific problem is a consequence of a more universal cultural trend which can't really be reduced this way, or in discussions which are about  expressing and exploring women's experiences, not about finding and agreeing on pragmatic policy approaches to address a specific problem.

So while the 'not all men' response is problematic and often ends up being derailing, I think that it often at least signals a person who is interested in discussing the actual topic (in a way that a 'men also' response does not), who might be able to participate meaningfully with more education and clarification... if anyone has the time and energy to do that.",-1,t3_2479a4

I see how this attitude can be used by someone to distance themselves from the problem and avoid thinking about it. Nobody likes being labelled *part of the problem,* especially when the implication is that they're ""not a good person"" because of it. Deflection is a very human reaction.

And, while I don't want to drift into the area of ""tone arguments,"" maybe women's advocates could consider a tactical change? Because the way a lot of debates are structured now, being ""sexist"" feels like an indelible black mark to a lot of people. Once you're labelled, you're done for life. Whereas, realistically, sexism is bad behaviour that can be consciously changed. A person who did something sexist yesterday can think about their actions and be less sexist today. And, let's be honest here, there's not a man or women on the planet who has not perpetuated or taken advantage of privilege at some point in their lives. It's a culture, it's pervasive.

20140428143524,Nailpolished,"Honestly, if you get a cat, his nose clogs up so he snores, and you can't sleep, it seems the best solution is to get rid of the cat in a responsible way, try to find someone who really wants it. It seems silly you have a cat when he's allergic. You know the solution you just don't want to face it. 
And he's offering you the solution as well, getting rid of the cat, he can't be on allergy medicine 24/7.
BUT, as a test maybe you can let someone have the cat for a month or so to see if he gets better?

20140428151427,greenfrustrated,"getting the cat was his idea, not mine. It was a birthday surprise gift, which I addressed by telling him that though I appreciate the gesture, an animal really should not be a ""surprise gift"" but a discussion we should have before getting one. It wasn't a shelter cat either. It was a purebred that costs a few hundred dollars. 


He's not offering me a ""solution"". It may not come across from my post but it was a ""deal with my snoring or you can get rid of this precious cat that we both love and spent tons of money on."" Putting aside the fact that's it really wasn't much of a rational discussion, it frustrates me because we are only at this point because he didn't think twice before getting a pet that he's allergic to, then threatens me with the exact issue I was worried about - an animal is not something you get and pass around for whatever reason, it too needs a stable environment.

20140429135119,greenfrustrated,"I feel like you didn't really read my post :X


I wasn't blaming him. I suggested that we explore further options but he wasn't willing to, which is what's frustrating. I mean yes, the snoring is frustrating but I am willing to work through it, as long as we explore all of our options. 


Why do you think he's done all he can? After our argument he did go see the doctor again and was given more advice and was referred to an allergist. A specialist would definitely have more insight into his allergies and have better treatment plans. He was also advised to keep the cat out of the bedroom - which is something I can definitely do. But all these, which is further exploring solutions and us ""working together"", is what should've happened. An allergist is not some crazy idea I just created in my head. It's actually a pretty common solution family doctors provide. (in Canada). 


He gave me plenty of attitude and anger while saying all that he said, while I started the conversation rather calmly and diplomatically. I kept pleading with that I don't want this to turn into an argument, I simply would like to re engage the doctor given neither of us know much about allergies. But hey, fuck me because I'm not a pushover and refuse to take attitudes?


Unfortunately for us, there is no ""separate room"" that I can sleep in. I left to sleep at my mom's is 1) I need a good night's sleep after 3 nights of crappy ones, especially on a work week. 2) I'm ""fed up"" with his attitude, not just on this issue, but every single time I want to talk about something, it's always a ""negative"". Him saying ""I'm doing all I can"" is a pretty regular saying he says, which is pretty much a shut down that he refuses to discuss further despite obvious solutions. Like I indicated in the post, we've had significant problems so me ""leaving"" is actually not something I've done, but this is it for me. 


I'm not here to seek advice about this issue or other issues but I guess it was the last thing happened so I wrote it down.

20140428152642,foxes722,"Snoring is actually a major cause of discord in relationships - there are some studies on this. My boyfriend snores intensely - like if you heard this noise coming out of a cave in the woods, you would RUN. I've gotten good at sleeping through it on a normal night - on bad nights, I will wake up 4 or more times in the night and am so tired that I am just frustrated and angry and exhausted in the morning. He was frustrated with how upset I was - he's not doing it on purpose (obviously) and he doesn't know when he's doing it. So there was some tension there. He was not really looking into options, so I bought nose strips - which didn't work. And then finally found mouth guards for snoring - which he doesn't love but are pretty effective and he wears pretty regularly. (Definitely some give and take here - I wore mouth guards when I was on meds that made grind my teeth.)

So some of this may be that he feels like you're criticizing him for something he can't control - which is frustrating all around. (My bf didn't want to go to the doctor either.) See if you can talk to him about it emphasizing that it's not an issue of blame, you just want to be able to actually SLEEP with him.  And if he's willing to try it - the mouthguard my boyfriend uses is called Puresleep, but there's a bunch of different brands of these.

The only legitimate reasons a doctor won't let you have one should be if he/she thinks it will cause you harm, if there is a better option for you, if it goes against that doctor's religious/cultural beliefs (totally valid, but find a new doctor for a Mirena).


I got one because I'd had the pill (combined pill- estradiol and levonorgestrel), and then switched to the implant (Implanon- levonorgestrel) when the pill gave me headaches and increased my appetite, leading to weight gain. I had Implanon for 18 months but for all of that time I had either irregular bleeding or constant bleeding (the last 12 months). So I was fed up and went to the doctor and we decided that Mirena was a valid option. 


Plus, the doctor does need to consider your wishes. I tried 2 doctors before I found one who would insert it. It's been over 2 years now and Mirena hasn't given me any adverse effects. But (DISCLAIMER) that doesn't mean it's the same for everyone!",6,t3_24903q

20140429175020,shafonfa,"When taken out of context it can seem that way. The societies in biblical times were extremely sexist, and it's important to separate culture from the commands of God. 

The verse you cited is interesting. It is only because of Jesus that women were allowed in the temple to learn and worship alongside men... Prior to this, they were not allowed to do so. I believe, and so do many biblical scholars, that this verse is a snapshot of a culture in transition. Women who were previously uneducated were suddenly allowed in! But, they were still lacking in knowledge due to their previous oppression. Therefore the women were expected to learn, and to receive-- not to try to control or to run the show when they were the newcomers. 

I don't believe this standard applies in modern times, similar to other verses that command women to have their heads covered, and men to greet each other with a kiss. Not everything in the bible is a command for all people in all cultures to follow forever and ever. Some of it is historical documentation. Some of it is poetry. And all of it is heavily influenced by culture, which was sexist and patriarchal. But when Jesus came, women were respected and given opportunities they had never seen before. They prophecied along with men. They learned and worshiped along with men. They preached and evangelized. They led house churches. Its all recorded in the new testament... Because in Christ, there is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female. We are one in him! 

That was longer than I intended... Sorry. As a woman and an elder in my church, this is something I'm pretty passionate about. The bible can be used to condone sexism, sure, but I think that in order to do so, one must ignore context and misinterpret scripture.",2,t3_249rre

I believe that what anyone, Christian or atheist or otherwise, chooses to do sexually is between them, their partner(s), and their god. I don't believe that parents should be involved in their children's purity pledges or should be placed in the role of significant other. Parents certainly can teach their own view of sexual morality and what is and is not acceptable, but this whole requiring a public vow and having a purity ring from a parent and all of the sexualizing around it is just creepy and over the top. I also don't think that anyone should feel pressured to share their sexual choices with anyone they aren't having sex with, including their fathers and the other people at the purity ball. I think that if your goal is to teach your children to value sex and reserve it for marriage, that is ok, but good parenting doesn't require a pledge from your kid and it doesn't require you to act as a substitute for a sexual partner for you child (obviously without sex, but the idea is still creepy). 

If that's what you want to do, it should be a value instilled over a lifetime with the understanding that at some point, your child won't be a child anymore and will be making their own decisions that are none of your business. Making them promise to behave a certain way, especially when it's something that harms no one besides maybe themselves, isn't going to help, and telling a 12 year old that ""hey, we know you could have sex right now even though you probably aren't really thinking about that seriously yet and we just want to tell you that you can't because your sexuality that you almost definitely weren't going to use for at least a couple more years even if you don't want to remain ""pure"" doesn't belong to you"" is downright creepy.

I know I always loved making things ""official"" whether it was by being ""blood sisters"" with my best friends or signing a covenant and wearing a purity ring. I like those declarations of commitment... But not everyone does and that's fine.

I don't think 12 is too young though, especially nowadays. When I was in middle school, there were kids who were already sexuallt active. And now, with the prevalance of smart phones and the like, I'm sure that at the very least, a good portion of them have been exposed to blatant pornography even if they aren't sexually active yet.

The whole concept of ""virginity = purity"" needs to go away anyways... Any Christian who considers themself ""pure"" simply because they haven't had a penis in their vagina (or vice versa, etc) needs to re-read their bible.",-4,t3_249rre

But I think a ceremony that closely resembles a wedding to your father is a little much and a little creepy. Father-daughter dances, great, purity rings, ok, but the type of ceremony involved? Way too close to a wedding and way too involved in all their future sexual decisions.

When you're 12, you don't really have much of an option when your parents suggest something like this, and even though it isn't designed to be something they're pressured into, I would be surprised if a large portion of the girls don't feel like they have a choice. I also knew some people who were sexually active one way or another, but for most of my school, kissing and making out with clothes on was as far as it went. Most of us were very curious about sex and our sexuality was developing, but we weren't anywhere near ready to have it even by our own standards. And based on what I've heard from a younger cousin, that hasn't changed much. Sure, most of them know about porn and how to find it, but porn is not sex.

In any case, I don't think this is really appropriate at any age because it will always have creepy connotations. I do agree that this whole emphasis on sex, and only PIV sex for many people, as the measure of ""purity"" and ""goodness"" needs to end. No one wins this way.",10,t3_249rre

If your body doesn't generate a ton of HCG a blood test will still come back positive even when a urine test may  not; and if you're not pregnant then the doctor can talk to you about options for getting things going again.  

Stress over things like potential pregnancy can also delay your period, so, try to relax if you can.",2,t3_249b0m

Once a guy hit my butt with a cue stick when we were playing pool and I hit him in the face. It was unacceptable of him to do it. Confrontation is a shock for many creeps and even for people who don't mean to be creepy and are ignorant as to why they are being inappropriate. But your uncle definitely knows what he is doing and he needs to be stopped. 

Are there any young family members that should be looked after in case he has been molesting them or doing the same to them? Warn any younger cousins and their parents!!

I am a Youth/Community Educator at a DV agency (been at the agency for 2 yrs, this job since Dec 2012) and also had to do a presentation for the interview and nailed it...Hell, I'm still staring at my interview presentation board as I type this.



First thing's first:  You **DO NOT** want to talk about anything other than COMMUNITY AND YOUTH EDUCATION.  You don't want to go in there and talk about how to improve any service OTHER THAN THE ONE YOU ARE APPLYING FOR.  This comes off as rude and disorganized.  Your presentation should focus solely on what your job is going to be.



>conduct public information and educational activities



THIS is what *you should* focus on because that will be your position.  



What I would recommend is creating a mini education presentation, and give it as if you are giving it to a community group or youth classroom.  For a DV non-profit you will most likely be interviewed by a number of people, so make sure you ask questions; make the presentation a dialogue rather than a one-way conversation.  Demonstrate your knowledge of domestic violence (Intimate Partner Violence vs other forms of DV - YOU MUST KNOW THIS!!!), myths and facts, respect for group disclosures of abuse (they WILL happen, they WILL happen in BIG GROUPS), and be comfortable and prepared to be challenged by people that don't believe what you are saying.

Just having someone to sit with her and listen might really help.  And reassure her that it's okay for her to feel whatever she's feeling, and there are no wrong emotions.

At the time it was because of my issues, but since then I've realized while I care about her a lot, I'm not attracted to her physically.


It was awkward for a while after we tried dating but now we're pretty much as close, or closer, than we ever were.

20140429161454,Dee_Buttersnaps,"I've had a few intense friendships with other girls/women.  One was with a girl in college who lived in the same dorm as me so we were basically up each others' asses 24/7 for like four years (metaphorically speaking, of course).  We graduated over ten years ago but when we see each other, which is not very often, it's like no time has passed at all.  

I'm trying to imagine how I would have felt if my college friend or one of the other girls I was that close with had tried to take the relationship somewhere sexual/romantic.  I don't think it would have been good.  As much as I loved them, I was not attracted to them in that way.  I think something like that would have resulted in me pulling away from them because I would feel like, I don't know, that my presence, or my affection would hurt them.  Like, me hugging them or touching them would just be a reminder of what they want and what I can't give them.    I think I would always be second guessing their emotions and it wouldn't be good for either of us.  

All that is to say that I think you might be a little infatuated at the moment so perhaps now is not a good time to act on your feelings.  Also, I wouldn't act on them at all unless you are 100% sure that she is open to a relationship with a woman.

20140429124958,ThePolemicist,"Fuck, it's starting already. Every year on Reddit, there are posts all over the front page from people complaining about their mother or asking why we celebrate people for pooping out a baby. The women's subreddits are no better, with everyone talking about how there is no joy in Mother's Day because of miscarriage or the death of their own mothers. It's endless posts of people complaining about the holiday and how shitty it is. Father's Day? No one has a problem with that one. 

I normally try to be really sympathetic to people who have undergone loss. The thing is, there is an infant loss remembrance day in October. Many people light candles on that day to recognize parents who are grieving. We don't need to tell mothers that they can't have one day to be recognized for what they do. They don't need to be guilted. It's OK to have one fucking day out there for moms. Celebrate your mom. Celebrate your grandma. Celebrate being a mom or a pet mommy. If you don't have any of those things, it's OK to be sad, but, FFS, don't tell everyone else why they should be guilt-ridden instead of celebrated. How would you feel if, on our birthday, people kept telling you how much they hate birthdays because the people they loved who died no longer get to celebrate birthdays? Wouldn't you think, ""Well, thanks for pissing on my parade."" There is a time and a place to discuss loss, but guilting moms for Mother's Day isn't the right time or place.",-3,t3_24a2lz

20140429125722,twistedfork,"I disagree with this statement. I don't think people who have suffered the loss of their moms are trying to guilt moms. I can tell you it SUCKS to be a mom-less child in May. You see mother's day commercials and ads and you take like a whole day in school to make your mom something. Saying ""Well just celebrate your grandma"" isn't the same. The worst part is very much other kids in school saying, ""But Twistedfork doesn't have a mom, what is she supposed to make?"" 

I DID make things for my grandma or my dad or anyone else, but this SUCKS so much and people are completely unaware of it. The best time to raise awareness is mother's day.

On top of that my grandma died on my birthday, so every year all of my family says, ""RIP MOM, also Happy Birthday Twistedfork!"" and it is not at all as shitty as not having a mom on mother's day.",4,t3_24a2lz

20140429132757,ThePolemicist,"I did a Reddit search on /r/all for ""Mother's Day"" and ""Father's Day."" 

Here are the top 11/12 search results for each:

[Top results for ""Mother's Day""](http://imgur.com/JESdda8)

and

[Top results for ""Father's Day""](http://imgur.com/jqUuEFR)

There's a big difference between the two. On the Mother's Day one, many of those top posts are ""Why I hate Mother's Day,"" and, ""I hate Mother's Day."" Some aren't mean, but are still about loss & grief, like, ""What do I get for my wife who just lost a pregnancy for Mother's Day?"" or, ""I accidentally said 'Happy Mother's Day' to someone who recently had an abortion."" There's one griping about a mother at a Mother's Day work event. A couple of the top posts are reminders, but do you notice that basically none of them are celebratory *at all?*

Look at those top posts for Father's Day. It's people talking about what they learned since becoming a father. It's people talking about the best advice their dads ever gave them. One of the top posts is just someone saying, ""Happy Father's Day!"" One is a dad saying his Father's Day was awesome! 

There's a huge dichotomy there. I just think it sucks because, even on Mother's Day, it seems like moms can't be celebrated. Just guilted.

Edit: I just did a search for ""mom"" and ""dad"" on Reddit and found the same thing. Do the search yourself if you're interested. The top posts for ""mom"" are things like ""Would you date a single mom?"" and ""My mom is moving away to be with her internet boyfriend whom she's never met,"" and ""My mom told me this really stupid thing. What's the stupidest thing your parent ever told you?"" and ""What batshit things have you seen helicopter moms do?"" I think there is 1 positive post on moms when you do a search for ""Mom."" Do a search for ""Dad."" Almost all of the top posts are about dad jokes. There's ""What's the coolest thing your dad has ever done?"" and ""What's your best troll dad story?"" and ""What's the most badass thing your dad has done?"" They're overwhelmingly positive posts. I'm just over the whole idea that moms should be punished and made to feel guilty all the time. Moms get that enough. They don't need it on Mother's Day.

20140429160858,bananapajama,"Hmm they were probably already accepting of a certain amount of risk, since they were having sex anyways (presumably). Re: child choice, they may have planned on doing IVF (as said in the first paragraph of the article) or adopting, but when they found out they could have a child, they decided to do it the old-fashioned way.

Assuming the parents were soliciting questions to share their experiences, I might ask: 

* what kind of questions did you have for your doctor when you found out the old fashioned way way possible?

* What kind of monitoring did you have to go through during your TTC period? Weekly check-ups on viral load?

* Does being HIV+ still impact life expectancy? Do you face judgement for bringing a child into the world while one of you lives with a potentially life-threatening disease.

* Had you always been planning on having a child.

* How did it feel to have sex w/o a condom for a change ;)

If you are wondering about children vs childfree, you should start a new thread about that - or do a google search for a previous thread.
