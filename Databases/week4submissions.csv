t3_25hh6t,"Lately, I've been feeling a little alone here in TwoX.","Hi ladies of TwoX, I'm not putting blame on anyone for feelings this way, but lately, I haven't felt very connected to one of my favorite reddit communities. Please read this with an open heart and know that it doesn't come from a place of anger, I'm just expressing something that bothers me, and I wonder if anyone feels the same.

When reading posts, it bothers me that it seems to be one brand of feminism here. I don't want to go into specifics really, but lately while reading through posts and comments, it's felt like if you're not this way or you don't think this way, then you're doing it wrong. If you don't agree with this point of view, then you're a misogynist, a rape apologist, you're doing women an injustice. For example, I got downvoted pretty hard here once for just expressing my want to take my husband's last name some day, why is that a negative? Traditional values are not equivalent to wrong in the same way that a lifestyle that is more modern is not equivalent to wrong. I don't want to turn this into a rant, because I really do respect different points of views, I just haven't felt the love here as a welcoming community for all women lately. Has anyone else felt this way? I would really appreciate some insight and healthy discussion here.

Edit: Wow, such an outpour of support and respectful discussion. There are beautiful, intelligent women in this sub, we should share in and celebrate our differences. Thank you all so much for responding, I thought I would have at most ten comments. Many hugs and much love to all of you.",304,20140513165047,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Good news, apparently this post was messaged to the fellow in question, and he recognized it as being him.  Turns out, while we were smashed, he was black out drunk. As everyone knows that does not ok what happened, but I also know many of us have been there, where we wake up the next day and are completely appalled at something we've done.  I for one, have thrown up no less than three times on my bf, poor man.  Long story short he apologized very sincerely and has said it will *not* happen again, and took it very seriously.   I'm still kind of reeling that he saw the post, since I had planned on only addressing it *IF* it came up.  Thanks for your support TwoX.

Throwaway, for fairly obvious reasons.  

I very recently moved to a new city with my boyfriend (for work) and neither of us knew anyone here.  We're both quiet, introverted, and are not very social.  But since we moved away from all our friends we decided to explore the very active Reddit scene in our new city.  Last weekend was the third meetup event, and we had a great time doing a pub crawl with people we were becoming friends with. About four bars, six drinks in, my boyfriend and I are well toasted, as is everyone else in the group.  People start to head home.  Five of us are all walking in the same direction to a major street where our cars are parked.  My boyfriend was not ten feet in front of me talking to two of the guys, and I was sort of drunk shuffling (not quite stumbling) behind with the guy who sets up most, if not all of the Reddit meetups.  We had spoken to him at other meetups and he seemed like a friendly sociable person.


 We were speaking pleasantly (slurring?) until lo and behold I feel his hand on my ass.  I know I registered it was there but I was so stunned, and so taken aback that I couldn't for the life of me say a thing.  I don't remember if he was as drunk as I was.  He might have only been buzzed, he might have been wasted, Or maybe he was completely sober.  I know that that doesn't change what he did but I also know that alcohol can make people do *incredibly* stupid things.  His hand stays there moving around for what seemed like 3 blocks. He chatted lightly but his hand keeps going back and fourth on my rear and again, I couldn't muster any words.  I was just in shock.

I have told my boyfriend about it and he's adamant on not meeting up with these people again.  I agreed, but reminded him this really limits us in terms of socializing, since his co workers are almost all settled with families and I have not yet found work/co workers.  I almost want to go to another meetup to call the guy out, and see if I can somehow work past it.   If he were to apologize sincerely I can see us *maybe* going to smaller meetups that are in the daytime, that don't revolve around getting shitfaced.

t3_25hmgx,"Need advice: confronting sexism from a professor?","I am a PhD student at a large university. This most recent semester, I was enrolled in a small physiology course with an older (65+) male professor who made several remarks that I found very upsetting. When referencing the ovaries, he would often make remarks such as ""this is where progesterone is made - which is why women are so crazy,"" and when referencing the uterus, he once said ""we can tell by the immune infiltration here that most women must be lying about menstrual pain."" He would frequently make remarks along the lines of ""this discovery was actually made by a woman!"" and ""some women don't like my class because they say it's too early, and disrupts their beauty sleep."" 

I was going to write all of these things in his course evaluation, but I became intimidated because the evaluations were due before we got our final grades, and it is a VERY small class. However, all of the things he said (those listed above are just a few examples) have really been bothering me lately. The lab I work in is on the same floor as this professor, so I'm not sure if it's worth confronting at all. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Or have any advice?

UPDATE: thank you everyone for the advice and discussion! It's validating to hear (especially from other professors!) that the situation is not ok. I like the idea of going to the department's chair to have a discussion about it. I am also actually considering starting off with an honest conversation with the professor himself to address a few of the comments.

Could you share your experiences/give advice/encouragement?","My girlfriend has endo at a pretty young age (she was diagnosed in her teens), and lately has been having some pretty horrible pain. Apparently she had been developing some large ovarian cysts and a couple had ruptured. 

About 6 years ago, she went on birth control to treat it and had many problems with that route. She didn't like how her body changed, she didn't like that she ""turned into a bitch"" (her words), and she hated that she lost her sex drive. Birth control is still the best treatment according to her doctor, but she is afraid that it'll take her down the same path. 

She is also not sure that her doctor is aware of a gall bladder problem, and warnings on birth control pretty commonly advise against it under those circumstances. She's planning on calling her doctor tomorrow to address all of this. 

She is against going on birth control, and I'm trying to support her and remind her that her doctor knows what she's talking about, but I think it would come better from people who have actually experienced these issues.

Sometimes, I read the forums over at the red pill, and I want to believe that they're all misogynistic jerks....but there's part of me....that thinks that they're right.  That men only want young women.  That I'm never going to find anyone because I'm over the hill (even though I'm still attractive and in shape).  Here's the thing, though-I'm not the 30 year old who was *so focused on degrees and career* (I have my master's, but it's not my life), nor have I slept around tons a la sex and the city.  I feel like there's this animosity towards us 30 plus single women...like all of us rejected tons of good guys.  Not true in my case.  It just hasn't worked out for me.  My philosophy has sort of been, it'll happen when it's supposed to happen...most of the happy couples that I know met naturally, not when they were trying...but now I'm torturing myself and wondering if I should have made more of a concerted effort when I was younger? Also, I'm 6'3""; maybe that has something to do with it? I just feel like, at this age, I'm never going to meet anyone.  And being in love with someone who loves me back has been the one thing that I've desperately wanted in life.

t3_25i4ow,"Self-conscious about something I know doesn't matter.","Hi TwoX, I'm feeling very self conscious about something that I know shouldn't matter, and just need to pour out feelings, rant, get advice, etc. 

I am 17 years old and am currently dating my first-ever boyfriend. I have had absolutely no previous sexual experience except for kissing. We have been together for about seven months, although we were friends for a while before that. We have a really great relationship, and he always does his best to make me happy and comfortable. I am fully confident that he loves me for who I am and not my appearance, however I've been super nervous about progressing sexually due to the appearance of my vulva. Stupid, I know. I have basically the opposite of the ""ideal porn vagina"" in that I have SUPER LONG labia (like really really long) and they're also very brown at the ends (although I have very light skin). I know experienced guys know that women's anatomy can differ greatly and it's all normal, etc, but my boyfriend has had close to no previous sexual experience and I'm pretty sure he probably watches porn, being a 17 year old guy (the fact that he might watch porn doesn't bother me in the slightest, but it just means he's only been exposed to perfect labia-less porn vaginas). Anyways, I have yet to remove my underwear. He has gently suggested we take things a step further sexually a couple times before, but being the nice guy he is, when I said I wasn't ready he totally respected that. However it's getting to the point where I really want to move forward, and I'm sure he does too. It's just that one insecurity that is really holding me back. I look in the mirror and think it just looks weird/gross, even though I know that's not logical.
I know that if a guy cares that much about your vulva he really isn't worth it, and I agree. I'm about 99% sure that even if he did find my vulva unattractive he definitely wouldn't say anything. So I'm not worried about him being a jerk about it. Just for some reason the idea of him finding me unattractive in any way, or being disappointed in some way about how I look REALLY bothers me. I know that some men love long labia, but I'm worried he doesn't. Especially since what I'm worried about is so private and intimate. If I had what I considered an unattractive nose or something I wouldn't care so much because there are no surprises and he would know from the beginning. It's weird because I'm not self conscious about pretty much anything else but this one particular part of me. 
This has created a really big fear of taking off my underwear and letting him see my vulva/vagina. I think we're both silently getting more and more impatient, and I'm totally ready to move forward if it weren't for this huge irrational fear.
Can anyone give me any advice on how to get over this? I really want this relationship to last and everything is so perfect except for this one thing.

Thanks so much for any advice you can give me.

PS: I want to stress that I do not want to offend any women on here with large labia. I am not saying there is anything wrong with you, or that you should be insecure about it or anything. I really wish that I could be like a lot of you and get over being so worried about it.

t3_25htyv,"Validation from strangers [a rant]","I've been with my boyfriend for 8 months. We're good together because we communicate effectively: if something bothers me, I bring it up with him and we work through it. I have told him to do the same, and he does. There is one thing I keep thinking about and while it doesn't bother me enough to keep me up at night, it just reinforces my shaky self-esteem. 

I'm 21 years old and I've never had a proper relationship until now because of my high standards/pickiness. Objectively, I don't think I'm unappealing lookswise but I feel that I crush on guys 'outside my league'. I go for a very specific 'type' of guy (I'm Asian; my type resembles a Kpop idol so conventionally good looking, nice hair, good dress sense, thin). My boyfriend is my type exactly and the first guy I've both crushed on and asked me out, so naturally I was over the moon and said yes. 

In the course of our relationship, I've witnessed my boyfriend get hit on so many times. It usually happens at work, where he's a barista so he's nice to customers in general and I don't take that to heart even though it's unsettling to watch when I'm having my drink and I see girls try to flirt. The worst is when we were at a beach once, and my boyfriend asked this stranger to take a photo of us. They have a short convo - mind you I'm right next to him but I don't speak because I'm shy and I don't like talking to strangers and after taking it, she looks at me and asks me directly, ""Are you his girlfriend or friend?"" Ouch and wow, so inappropriate. 

It just crushes my self-esteem because no one ever hits on me when I'm with my boyfriend or very much in general. I don't know if it's the gendered thought of 'guys don't hit on girls who are with other guys but girls can hit on guys whether the guy is with a girl or not' or if my boyfriend is just so much better looking than me. I know it's not a game either, but it still annoys me to a point. 

To be clear, this is not affecting our relationship, it's just something I think about from time to time and get bothered by it. I've also been to counselling before for my self-esteem issues. This is just something I want to get off my chest, gah! ",5,20140513190540,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I'm a very sexual person, sarcastically or not. My major (engineering) is basically all men except me so I'm pretty good with the sexual innuendos and laughing at penis jokes. I'm not discriminated socially at all; the guys accept me as an honorary guy and things just go swimmingly in public.

In private, I'm also very sexual. I enjoy masturbating and having sex (monogamously). I've never had sex with a guy I'm not dating, nor have I kissed or hold hands or flirted with anyone I'm not dating. Not that it's bad, it's just the guilt I feel when I get horny around males. Just recently I broke up with a guy and now I feel guilty when I hang out with anyone. I think everyone's attractive and I get aroused easily. It just happens, especially when sexual jokes are thrown around 24/7.

I like sex, I like masturbating. I like pornos of all sorts. It's just when I start to think about anyone sexually, I'm overridden with guilt. Enough so that I don't want to hang out with that guy or even look at him. I don't want to be a whore, but I sort of am, aren't I? I think about it often enough and isn't thinking half the doing? I think sex is good, and if I know the guy well and we're both into each other I don't see why we shouldn't have sex. So why do I feel guilty thinking about these things? How do I stop it? Should I be guilty about it?

Ladies, please help me out here. I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling guilty about sex, but how can I deal with it? Is it bad or good to have? Should I be having sex with anyone or should I only have sex with one guy that I'm serious about? I mean, it is college so shouldn't I have a bit of fun? Or is that uncouth? So much conflict!

t3_25iq52,"Recent surgical abortion","So I'll admit, I have been a lurker on Reddit for awhile. I was looking for advice for my recent surgical abortion, and I can't say enough how grateful I am to have this wonderful community in supporting me through this unsure moment in my life. I wanted to give back by giving my own recent experience.

I first found out with my SO about the pregnancy within maybe 2 weeks of conception. I felt sick to my stomach and my boobs hurt like hell. I had all the signs, so i took a pregnancy test. Obviously, it was positive. We finally came to a decision to go through with the procedure do to financial issues and recent events in our lives.

The harder part was the wait I think. In the process of making the appointment and getting an ultrasound, made it feel like forever. I had to wait 2 weeks before I had a set appointment for the procedure. I will say nothing makes the process harder than making you wait all the while your hormones are having a crazy party.

By the time I was scheduled for the procedure, I was 7 weeks. I walked into the clinic and sat down. There was some random plane crash movie on, so I sat there and read some game of thrones all the while secretly freaking out. I think my SO knew, so he just tried to make me laugh about the shitty movie.

We ended up waiting 3 hours until they finally brought me into an office, gave me antibiotics, I paid for the procedure, and gave me sedatives. After that, I went back into the waiting room and waited another hour. When I was finally called into the doctors office, I was sat on a table ( like at any gyno exam) and given an IV. I think after they put the IV in, it became a bit fuzzy. I do remember a little sharp pain at first (5-6 level), but by the time I finished processing that pain, the procedure was done. I think the entire procedure was maybe 5 minutes. 

Afterwards, I was instructed to put my clothes back on ( they had put a pad in my underwear for me before hand). They helped me walk into a waiting room with a recliner and heating pad. I stayed there for 30 minutes and had minimal bleeding, so they let me go home.

Afterwards, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I went home and watched some anime, had some pizza, and slept for 12+ hours. I will say though (as they will tell you), in the recovery process the worst happens after day 3. 

I had minimal bleeding for 3 days and wasn't having any problems until i started feeling bloated and having crazy cramps. The pain level was at a 5 or 6. I was prescribed vicodin, so I took the recommended amounts, which seemed to do fine. Then on day 5 (night of day 4), I had extreme cramps at levels 9 or 10. I decided to take an extra half of vicodin, and eventually the pain went away. The next morning, I called the clinic and they said it was normal and almost immediately after, I passed a few medium sized clots and the bloating seemed to disappear.

For the next couple of days I had light spotting, and I am now 1 week and a few days past the procedure and back to feeling great. I have no spotting and able to do light workouts again. 

Nothing can take away the emotional experience, because even now I do question the ""what ifs"",  but what I do know is that I made the right decision for me, right now. 

I wasn't able to tell anyone or talk about it, so I understand how hard it is when you feel alone. I hope that maybe this can comfort someone and help them through their decision. I just want them to know that people do care and understand what they are going through.

t3_25iu5z,"hooked up with an asshole, now i feel shitty about myself. kind of a rant, i just need some love from you right now","hooked up with this guy from tinder and it was so disappointing because 1) the sex was bad and he was so inconsiderate 2) he was sleazy and an asshole. he was the first and definitely the last tinder hook up, i deleted the app like four days ago

i feel really terrible about it, and i realized lately that maybe i'm really lonely deep down, even though i have great friends and go to a great college. there's this void that i didn't realize i had, and i don't know why i have it or what can fill that void. but i feel like a slut, which is awful and fucked up that i think that bc i slept with an asshole that i just met and i don't think i should think of myself as a slut just for wanting to be sexually liberated but after this instance i do. i really regret it and i feel like this is a low point for me but i don't know what to do with this overwhelming feeling of loneliness. i don't even want a serious committed relationship, so i have no idea where this is coming from.

in addition, every time i hook up with a guy, i always think about and wish it was this particular guy i hooked up twice with, even though 1) the age difference is really big//he lives in a different city and 2) he's probably not even interested in me anymore or doesn't even value me as anything more than some girl who's 8 years younger and hooked up with twice

i don't know, i guess i'm just posting in hopes that someone relates or feels the way i do 

EDIT: the point that there wasn't enough information to warrant me thinking he was an asshole was brought up, so somewhere in the comments I have more detail. I had the intuition that there was something not quite exactly nice about him, but if you disagree that's fine too. Also, thank you for taking the time to read as well!

edit2: okay well the thread was hidden but here is more information for those who want it to make a more accurate judgement --

If you want other information, I guess I should've listened to my intuition when he texted me (as we were planning to hang out): ""This better be worth it"". I replied, ""And what if it's not?"" and he said, ""Then I'd waste a ton of gas"". I was like, ""well if you think you'd waste a ton of gas/want more than to hook up and smoke weed then maybe you should play it safe and not come"". He ended up coming, obviously but when we were fooling around, he asked for head which I did, because I do like it/the response it gets but he started pushing my head faster even though I was gagging and it was clearly uncomfortable for me. He came after like 45 seconds and went to put another condom on because I guess he was embarrassed for finishing early but then he said, ""I can't get hard with a condom on"" and implied sex without condoms. At that point I was like noooooooo way. But I don't know, those things to me make me think someone is kind of an ass but if you don't think so, that's okay too. I just didn't particularly enjoy it
I say he's sleazy, because even in conversation and etc I realized afterwards he, and his personality, was just like the type of guy that I would avoid in general--sleazy and looking for cheap fucks. I'm not saying I'm above that, clearly I was just looking to hook up too, but I guess I expected better behavior/more intelligence from guys in general. Which is my fault too.
But you're right, I think because of my previous mostly positive experiences with hook ups (all of them were with older guys who were more my type) I expected this to be a positive experience and the lousy sex was definitely something I didn't think would happen. At the same time, I don't think lousy sex is the end of the world. I realized something bigger was happening here, the fact that I did this signaled to me that I was at a pretty low point in how I was feeling, so no I'm not whining about some lousy sex.",3,20140514031823,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25khlk,"After nearly a year of transition, I am amazed at the difference between life lived as a man vs. as a woman","I am 11 months on HRT this month, and I have got to say that transition is by far the most fascinating and continuously surprising journey I have ever been on.  I am posting this with a throw away since this sub has gone default and I want to minimize my possible exposure to harassment, etc, but many of my cis gender friends are always interested to hear about my experiences with transition, and I thought it would be interesting to put this out on this sub to see what you ladies had to say.

I'd like to put a couple of caveats to this post: none of this is really me complaining about anything. I'm very happy now, happier than I've ever been in my life. I love myself, my appearance, and just the simple feeling of being more than I ever thought possible. It's just that sometimes it's really freaky to think about how different my life is now.  

The thing is, absolutely none of these things are things that, at any point, I thought I would have to do or experience to be a ""real woman"".  None of these changes do I feel I purposefully tried to make in order to adhere to any sort of standard ""necessary"" to be seen as a woman.  They all just kind of...happened.  How much of them can be attributed to hormones, and how many can be attributed to living as a woman and truly experiencing the social pressure, etc, of that role?  I can't be sure.  Certainly, I feel like hormones had a large effect on many of them, specifically those that deal with my own interior experiences and reactions to things.  

But I don't like to say it was *all* hormones, if for no other reason than I know plenty of cis women who have had estrogen-driven bodies all of their lives who don't necessarily have many of these going on in their lives.  But, for whatever reason, they are a part of me now, and a part of my experience of the world.  It changed far more than I anticipated.  

Also, in this post I am speaking in very broad strokes, *very* generally. There are many exceptions to every thing I list here. Please don't think I am being absolute or saying this is the way for every woman (or man) every where, all the time.  Nor am I attempting to speak for all trans folk.  This is definitely a ""your mileage may vary"" kind of thing.  This is just me, and my experience.

The changes I am most interested in aren't physical, necessarily, but more mentally and personality-wise.  I suppose, before starting, I was much more focused on the physical aspect of transition. I'd heard, of course, of attitudes and whatnot changing, but I suppose that kind of change is a much harder one to observe in others or anticipate in yourself.

And, while of course I had heard from women all my life about subtle (and not so subtle) misogyny -- and I believed them, I never really thought they were exaggerating -- it's very much a different thing to experience something than to just hear tell about it.

For myself, I very much thought I would end up being a huge tomboy-type girl. And, truth be told, I do still have some hobbies that are more masculine oriented...but damn did I get ""girly"". Friends comment on it sometimes, women and men, cis and trans.  I can be more than a bit giggly, and I just love being held. I absolutely melt when I receive loving attention, and am generally much more submissive in my attitudes and behaviors. It's a very weird thing to experience, though by no means unpleasant. It just feels so good to feel safe and ""protected"" by someone, physically and emotionally. I also realized the other day that, at some point, the state of my hair gained the ability to practically dictate my enjoyment of a whole day.

Though I am still very much attracted to women, their sex appeal is no longer the first thing I see when I look at another woman. I'm much more tuned in to how she is dressed, and what I think that says about how she felt that morning or what she was trying to put across to others that day. I ""feel"" different in more subtle ways as well. I feel calmer, more grounded and practical in my mindset. As one example, due to circumstances I have a decent chunk of money coming my way this year that I've known about for many years. I used to have all sorts of plans of things I was going to buy when I got it. But, more and more, I want stability and the ability to plan in my life. My plans for that money have changed almost completely over the last 3-4 months especially. I feel like having it in the bank and/or properly invested will give me a sense of safety that will be worth far, far more to me than any thing I could possibly buy with it. Under the influence of testosterone, I never had that kind of ""need"" to have stability in my life. I was far more ""good times"" oriented, even at pretty considerable possible future cost.

At gatherings, now more than ever I find myself gravitating to the women because the behavior and typical topics of conversation among men just doesn't really interest me, unless it is a definite shared hobby. I'm coming to really understand how little I ever understood men. I may have matched their behavior at times, but I'm finding that my reasons for acting that way were more like ""well, this is what guys do, and I don't want people to know I want to be a girl, so I want them to have no reason to question me, so I better act this way as well"". But men seem to have different reasons for acting the way they do, reasons I can't really understand. So often, I'll see or hear about a guy doing something, and just be like, ""WHY would do you that?!"" When I hear guys talking crudely about women, or when they make crude jokes amongst themselves or to me, I actually cringe.

Speaking of men and their behavior, I'm getting to where I generally blend in these days -- and the more men see me as a woman, the more they tend to kind of talk over me and/or listen in a placating sort of manner before they go back to talking to each other. If a conversation has 2 or more men involved, it becomes hard to really even get a word in edgewise. They'll just talk away while I sit there, and if I venture to add to the conversation very often everyone looks at me while I'm talking, gives a sort of ""oh yeah, I know what you mean"" or ""uh huh, that's interesting""...and then they turn back to each other and continue on almost as if I didn't say anything, like my participation in the group conversation was almost an interruption of a talk they were having. Again, like they are more humoring me by listening than actually taking anything I say.

Now that I exist in this new social atmosphere, I look around and see them doing exactly the same thing to other women in the conversation. As often as not, the girls and I end up having our own little conversation that spins off the main conversation, because we are the only ones actually listening and responding to one another. The guys just want to talk to themselves. It's really a little startling to realize this is probably been going on my whole life, but I didn't notice because I was previously accepted by the men as one of them, and so what I had to say was given more weight. I totally think this is a subconscious thing on their part, the vast majority of the time. I don't think they do it purposefully. But it does happen, and it's really uncanny (and more than a little annoying).

I also didn't quite properly anticipate what a difference the loss of strength would make to my life. I've now reached a point where, sometimes, I literally have to wait for my boyfriend to get home to do some things. I physically cannot do them myself. I can't help but think back to times that girlfriends of mine would do the same thing (wait till I got home to get my help with something) that I couldn't help but think, ""You really could have done this yourself if you'd really tried."" Simply because, when I would do it, it wasn't that hard. I couldn't fathom that the difference in strength was so great that it wouldn't be possible for them.

Well, now my boyfriend does the same thing. He'll come home, and I'll have spent time trying to do something without him and found it to be literally not possible. He'll come along and just be like, ""Oh, you need help with this? This isn't that hard. Look."" And, voila! He does it and makes it look like it was little effort, typically making fun of me the whole time. =P

Much more of my previous affectation was a facade, it seems, than I'd ever guessed. I'm getting to know the ""real me"" in a profound way now. And speaking of profound, I am finding that being a woman is a much more profound thing than I'd known. Being forced to watch from the outside, of course it isn't surprising that my initial thoughts about what it would mean to live as a woman were very superficial and surface-level.

But nevertheless, it is surprising to discover what a deep ocean womanhood is. If that sounds cliche, so be it. That's how it is, for me.",346,20140514154520,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25jhs8,"Women of Reddit: What did you feel ashamed of as a young girl that you realize now was not shameful at all?","Seriously ladies, our society needs to stop pressuring young girls into feeling shame about their bodies, their thoughts, their womanhood. What shame memories do you have that you realize now are utter bullshit? 

Edit: as per the suggestion of a commenter, i've added a pared-down version of my comment below:

Somewhere around the age of 12, I realized that if i touched myself a certain way, an AMAZING thing would happen. My mom had this little vibrating accupressure tool (and yes, I really think she used it for this because she is a serious, old school, east asian immigrant) and I would...well you get the picture. It was FUCKING AWESOME. It felt great and it was also incredibly relaxing and for a high-strung kid like me, it was a total godsend. Then my little sister found out what I was doing and told my mom...which is when I learned what the word ""masturbation"" meant, well, sort of. I was told that what I was doing was disgusting and wrong, and that girls should never, ever masturbate. Being the defiant little shit I was, I basically said fuck the man and kept on doing it. I got ratted out a couple more times but eventually I got too old for my mom to keep having that talk with me. 


Im so glad I didn't let the temporary shame surrounding my first adventures in masturbation to turn me off to it permanently. It was one of the most important things I ever learned to do because I learned to explore my sexuality on my own terms and internalize the fact that I didn't need a man, or any other person for that matter, to experience pleasure. All I needed was something that buzzed a little, and a nice, soft surface upon which to lay (not a fan of the showerhead technique, just doesn't work for me).  I think all young women should be given a vibrator and a basic anatomical diagram from a woman in their life that they trust. 

TL;DR: I was ashamed (for like..a month) about masturbating, but then I got over it and realized how important it was in the development of my sexuality. ",20,20140514095122,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

My partner is moving to another country in a week and we have made our peace with the looming end of our relationship just to find out last night that I'm about 6 weeks pregnant. Keeping this baby is off the cards for us as it's something his family would never accept and he wouldn't be able to be a part of the baby's life.

So I met a guy like 4 years older than me (I'm 18) back in January, right after my boyfriend and I had broken up. I told him right away that I only wanted to be friends and while I didn't really pursue the friendship, he did. 

He was constantly pestering me to hang out and the few times we did, he would get all touchy feely and insist on paying for my coffee or whatever, which really was not necessary. 

After a few times of him making me uncomfortable like that, I started to answer his texts less and less. Now once every two weeks or so he'll text me a long version of ""I miss you, did I do something wrong? Let's hang out!"" And I never know what to say, so I'll usually say I'm just busy, but I know that's not a solution.

I don't really want anything to do with him at this point, not only for the reasons I stated above but because I honestly don't enjoy his company. Also, I know this isn't his fault but he reminds me of a really unhappy time in which I was really hurting because of the breakup. 

He texted me again two days ago and I still haven't answered because I don't want to be mean. I know how shitty it is to be ignored and I don't want to make him feel bad, but I really would be happy to never see him or hear from him again. How do I make this happen in the nicest way possible?

t3_25k0iu,"I went to get tested for STDs/STIs today for the first time...","...and it went *okay*. Throwaway 'cause I can. I'll try and make a long story short. I'm 21 and have been sexually active on and off since 16. Been on the pill, used condoms, and recently got an IUD, so I've been protected and smart about my sexual encounters. I've had pelvic exams where they've tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia, which have come back negative every single time.

Anyways, my appointment - they did a urine test (test for pregnancy - negative! wooh!), vaginal swab, rectal swab, throat swab, and blood draw. Yup, the whole nine yards. I spoke with the first nurse about my sexual history. She asks how many partners I've had and I reply 14. Am I proud of that? Meh, kinda. A large majority of which were only one time things and never at the same time as others. I had dated the same guy all through high school and when we broke up before college, I went a little crazy with the boys during my freshman and sophomore years. At the end of our conversation, she hands me a pamphlet on abstinence. She showed me a chart heavy on ""if you've slept with X amount of people, you've slept with everyone they've slept with."" Chart showed that if you've slept with 12 different partners, you've actually slept with more than 4,000 people. She's like ""yup, and you're off the chart."" Despite me telling her that the people I've slept with used condoms and had been tested themselves, she was pretty persistent about the whole ""it only takes one time"" ordeal regarding pregnancy and diseases (I'm not dumb, I know this). Not to mention that I told her that I'm in a monogamous relationship now so that number will not be getting any larger any time soon.

At any rate, I have my results appointment next week. Even though I'm well aware that some diseases show no symptoms, I am feeling A okay with zero symptoms of things that can show (HIV, etc.). Despite this, I'm a nervous wreck about getting my results back. I have a feeling that this fear was instilled by the nurse handing me the pamphlet on abstinence and maybe the concern I thought she was showing towards me was actually judgement. They had an optional survey to take at the end of the appointment and I wrote down that I wasn't sure I would recommend this place if the person going has had a lot of sexual partners.

I am really stressed right now because of a conversation I had last night with my mom. My mom and I don't talk very much. I live in a city about 3 hours away from her. She lives in a small town. She has been going through a divorce with my dad since last September that I don't really know much about. I could say a lot about the divorce (though I don't know much about the details), but I won't because I want to get to the most distressing part.
In her text messages to me she tells me prety much that she has given up on life. She says the cats are her only reason for living, and that she can't find a place to live with them. It seems obvious that she should give up the cats so she can survive. She works a decent job, but she commutes 40 minutes by car from her house, and it would be difficult for her to lie closer to work (small towns). But she says she has given up. After my dads mother kicks her out of the house she had been letting her stay in, she says she won't even look for a place. she will live in her car and then she is done... It makes me so sad to hear this. She told me that something in the last 3 weeks has made things so difficult she doesn't want to go on living. I asked what and she said ""it's not the right time"" and that soon I will know. She doesn't have much money and wants to buy me things to help me out all of the time. I'm barely, barely scarping by in the city and taking loans to pay rent while in college.

while in the middle of writing this I had a realization and understanding that the cats are very vvery important to her because her kids have fled. All of us are very distant with her, and the cats are the only things she has. Maybe she's like me and wants to talk to someone but doesn't know where to look. At least I know of the internet where possibly someone will read this (and possibly no one will).

My mom seems close to suicidal, she is definitely close to homelessness. I am going to try to be close with her.

Since this ambiguity leads to strange outcomes like women themselves saying they no longer identify as feminists (and keep in mind they're not driven away by the fringe I just cited since that fringe makes up a fairly small population), I was wondering if people here see this uncertainty as a problem or just the realities of ambiguous language.

Basically, ""girl bikes"" have a lower bar so that you can get your legs over the bike without making a large, swooping motion.  Whatever.  I thought the bike looked weird and I wanted the standard bike...which has now apparently become a ""boy bike.""

My dad pretty much insisted I take the girl bike.  When I asked why, he said it's easier to ride, as well as lighter.  So I proved to him I could lift the boy bike.  Then he said ""no, take the girl bike.  You're a girl.""  

We had a pretty loud debate about it in the middle of the bike aisle, and I eventually won out, insisting that I had a human body shape, two arms, and two legs, and could therefore ride either bike (they were the same price to, so I don't get the big fuss!).  

Now my dad keeps saying I'm going to regret my choice, and that the girl bike was made for riding with a skirt.  But I don't wear skirts!  And even if I did, why would I wear a skirt when I want to work out?

I have two possible ideas for how this could work:
(1) People could recommend 1 book per reply they make, and maybe give a sentence or two telling us what it is or why they like it. People upvote books they think they would want to read and discuss. And then the person with the most upvoted post makes a thread in which we discuss the book for the next month or so, depending on reading speeds, size of the book, etc.
(2) We could just start making more posts talking about our experience with women in books we read, author recommendations, etc.

I don't know how well a formal-ish book club would work with a large (and rapidly growing) community, but I wanted to gauge interest nonetheless.

For what it's worth, I would be very interested in hearing it if anyone had recommendations for where to start in reading Octavia Butler or George Eliot.

t3_25li9o,"I donated my hair for wigs. This is my experience.","Hey Twox, I've been having a bad day so I thought I'd share something I feel... mostly good about.

I have been trying to grow my hair out to donate it for wigs for cancer patients (and other treatments that can cause hair loss). I spent about five years growing out my hair. In that five years someone close to me was affected by breast cancer (she had a double mastectomy). She was my babysitter growing up but had at one time been like my big sister. When I found this out this mission became a personal one for me. I hated having hair past shoulder length, it's unwieldy and gets in the way (its windy where I live, it gets in my face and is tangled too easily).

[Here are my before and after shots](http://imgur.com/a/uaGwD) of what I went from and to. I raised 60 dollars. Unfortunately I also heartbroken to find out that it takes 4-6 donations to make a single wig.

Anyway, here is my experience, in a nutshell.

I didn't cry when I lost it. I'd heard lots of women tell me it felt wonderful and that everyone should shave their head at least once in their lifetime. It came off, it was fun. And then the self-consciousness crept in. As someone who colours their hair (I kept all of my length virgin hair, I just dyed the bangs which were too short to donate anyway) I shouldn't have been surprised that much of my identity was caught up in my hair.

I haven't had sex with my boyfriend in the two weeks since I shaved my head, every time I feel the urge to initiate I feel ugly. I know I'm not, I know I'm probably above average in attractiveness for a bald girl. People tell me I rock the look. But inside I feel so hideous and sexless. Sure it feels cool to pet and I'm getting more confident with the look as the hair grows back (I had it shaved right down to the scalp). I just can't easily get past the fact that I have no freaking hair.

When I go out and people stare I assume it's because of my hair and not because I look good. It's nice to not have guys leering at me, but it's still weird that when a cute guy is on the till at work and I know he's not thinking I'm pretty because of my hair. I feel unfeminine and awful.

And this is the best decision of my life. I feel no regret about this choice. Living like this has helped me realise how much a cancer patient has to go through. I can't imagine feeling sexless and unattractive on top of having a life-threatening illness. At least for me this was a choice.

I can't leave the house without a full face of makeup for fear someone will see my scars. I'm also working my way through sobriety after many years of drinking just to be able to talk to people and overcome my social anxiety, stemming from childhood and increased exponentially after I was raped at 19. All of this she knows. I pretend to be confident when I'm in the outside world, but I cry all the time at home about how I'm failing life. And she tells me to get a boyfriend. The idea terrifies me, both because I have an incredibly hard time trusting men and because I can't let any man see what I really look like- I know they'll be cruel.

t3_25kztt,"I guess I'm just looking for some advice","Right now, I'm just really upset and I really need to vent. I'm so fucking done with creeps and guys who seem to take friendliness as a sign of interest - despite the fact that I'm happily in a 3-year relationship with an amazing man. I know not all guys are like this, it's just some recent interactions that kind of make me upset with these certain types of people.  
  
Last night, a guy who I *thought* was just a friend texted me, asking me if 'hypothetically' I would have sex with him if I didn't have a boyfriend. Obviously, I shot him down immediately and told him that, despite it being a hypothetical question, I have absolutely **no** interest in even considering sleeping with anyone other than my boyfriend. Then he revealed to me that he's depressed and that ""some feelings are hard to kill"" as well as self-deprecating texts like  ""I'm not really the person that most people think of having sex with."" FML.   
  
I knew this guy liked me in high school, but I figured that after *three* years and only seeing him *once* during this time, he was over it (I *know* he's had girlfriends in between). We don't even keep in constant contact (we just text each other once in a while and, often, our conversations have day, if not month, long lapses in between). Even in high school, I always made it clear that I had absolutely *no* interest in dating him and that all I was interested in was a friendship. 
  
I feel sort of...betrayed...? I mean, he's suddenly putting me in this awkward position and I sort of feel like maybe he's trying to make me feel guilty for not being interested in him (hence the ""I'm not good enough"" texts). It's not the first time I've been in this position either...  
  
My cousin's best friend who's 10 years older (kind of borderline creepy, in my opinion) developed feelings for me in January and started getting *super* clingy. I tried being nice, but he just would *not* take no for an answer - despite the fact that he knew I had a boyfriend. Every time I blew up at him, he would bitch to my cousin about how mean I was being and, of course, my cousin takes his side because, *despite his creepiness (my cousin is aware he's a douche and a total creep), he stood by my cousin when no one else would.* It got to the point where he would blow up at me for 'ignoring' him despite the fact I'm currently balancing work, university, and a social life. He **told** me that there were sparks between us (we *literally* only met 4 times...). When I told him that I was not going to talk to him if he kept bringing shit like that up, he got mad and told me not to ""threaten our relationship."" WTTFFFFFF....   
  
Of course, my boyfriend got pissed and intervened, telling him that he was a fucking creep and to stop contacting me, he *again* went to my cousin and I had to *apologize,* while listening to this fucking asshole talk shit about my boyfriend and him going on about how immature my boyfriend is (right...**he's** immature).   
  
I *only* got out of the situation when he got mad that I was 'ignoring' him (no shit) again and told me, ""Fine, I guess I won't bother you again!"" and I called him on his bluff, but in a nice way so he can't bitch about it (""Ok, thanks for understanding!""). So far, there has been 2 months of peaceful silence on all social media fronts, but it still makes me so fucking mad when I think about it.

I'm not currently sexually active, but have an LDR, so sometimes I am. I didn't lose my virginity till I was 22, and had an STD test a year ago saying that I was clean. I just had another test during my yearly physical, which came back normal. My primary doc also tested my blood, cholesterol, kidneys etc and they came back normal.

So, today (May 14, a week and a half later) my doc leaves me a voicemail saying that my results came back abnormal and she wants to discuss them with me. Of course, I immediately start crying and get anxiety. My mom told me she'd had one before, along with her sisters, and that they had this freeze thing and cleared off the bad cells, and all was good.

From what I'm reading, abnormal results aren't uncommon, especially in younger girls. Many said they had another test done, some a biopsy, the freeze test etc, and had checkups every 6 months until all was normal. The problem is I'm leaving for an 11-month teaching job in Colombia in about 6 weeks. I will have health insurance down there, so if anything I could see a Colombian doctor to have the test done, or fly back home during my school break which is around the 6-month time...

I'll be able to call her tomorrow. But until then, who else has had an abnormal result, especially in your 20s? What happened?

t3_25l65q,"Terrible Communication. Please Advise?","I'm having a terrible time communicating with my roommate and best friend of many years and I'm at the end of my rope for what to do. I'm hoping if I can explain what's been happening, someone will know what to tell me.

So, I've known the aforementioned friend basically since puberty. We'll call her Sam. Sam and I have been through a lot of shit together. Her parents are both emotionally and physically manipulative. Mine are emotionally distant and cold. We've done high school, college, all that stuff. So it's a pretty invested friendship, just for background.

The problem (and it's been a problem for a long time) is that I would say 98% of the time, I'm the one initiating communication with her. Maybe even more often than that. I'm not just talking about making big plans for outings either. I'm talking about stuff like knocking on her door to have a chat, sending links and things to make her smile, running across each other in the kitchen... Really any kind of contact at all, I'm the one coming to her. 

It's to the point where if I want to even talk with her casually, I feel like I am practically stalking her, waiting until I hear her out in the common area of the apartment and then ""casually"" walking out there myself with the excuse that I'm getting food or water or whatever just so I can see how she is.

She's also extremely weird about stuff like gift giving holidays. Now, I have to admit that I'm pretty good at presents. Like, I try really hard to put together something to make the recipient smile. I know that I'm in a somewhat privileged position in that I have a little extra money to throw around, but I don't expect presents to be big and flashy. Hell, a really cool drawing of a thing I like would make me smile. And Sam has gotten me some presents I have liked over time. But here's the weird part. She's really odd about letting me have them. I'll give her hers whenever and then sometimes I'll have to wait for months to get mine, even though she says she's had it since before the holiday/birthday. I've had multiple times where I've opened birthday and Christmas presents on the same day (when they would be half a year apart) because that's how long it took to convince her to give it to me. That's weird, right?

And because she never communicates with me, I always get super insecure that I'm bothering her, only she assures me that I'm not. She claims that her brain ""just doesn't work that way"" and that when people don't make plans with her, she just doesn't think about doing it. Yet, when I asked her if that meant she was forgetting about me (because I sometimes think of her during my day), she says that's not what she means. It's almost like she wants me to just let her get away with never showing me any friend-affection unless I sort of prompt her to.

Am I wrong to be confused? Saddened? Frustrated? Sometimes angry? Am I missing something that's going on here?

She claims that part of it is stress from a new job and I would understand that if her behavior had materially changed recently, but it's been at the same level for what seems like years now. She'll seem enthusiastic about interacting with me when we already are, but it's like I have to prompt her or pry it out of her. Last time we talked about it, she said she could work harder on it, but that's exactly what she's said every other time this has come up and I don't really trust her. She also seems baffled by just how upset this makes me, which is rather...

TL;DR Long-time friend who I really care about and have amazing times with when we're communicating never initiates and always seems confused that I'm upset about it because I should just accept that it's how she is.

I'm freaking out at 6 AM and you're the ones I'm turning to (at least until I can get a doctor on the phone!)

This month, I switched to a new birth control pill because Yasim was giving me mood swings. I started this pill-- Qlairista-- one week after finishing the active pills in my last packet (so like 4 days into my period).

So with the new pills-- took the first 3 weeks, skipped the last week of placebo, bingo bango all set, right?

Turns out, this BC pill is a 26-day cycle (which I had never even heard of). I live abroad and all the instructions are in a foreign language which I didn't bother to parse through as I just assumed it was like every other pill I'd taken (I know, I'm stupid, I didn't think anything of the color change in the pills).

So. Basically I missed the last 5 days in my packet.

I took my last pill on this past Saturday. I had unprotected sex the day before that, and on Tuesday (two days ago-- it's Thursday morning here). I would normally have gotten my period around Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, but nada.

So, my question to you all is....help?! Should I take Plan B? Is it too late for that because I didn't finish the last 5 pills anyway? Or maybe I even started the packet too late? If I do take Plan B, will it make pregnancy tests not work and leave me in limbo for weeks? And, how do I go about getting back on the pill through this sea of hormones and medication?

Oh and-- took a pregnancy test last night and it was negative. I know it's pretty early for that, though.

I almost always take it within an hour or two hour window, and am aiming to be even more precise with the time by now setting an alarm. I've never had any sort of pregnancy scare or pregnancy.

My previous partner had always pulled out to be safe, however my current partner (monogamous, not worried about STDs) was the first that had come inside and I really enjoy not pulling out. We have been having sex 2-3 times a week for the past 6 months and he has always came inside.

However, his dad recently gave the lecture about being extra safe since neither one of us wants me to get pregnant and his dad strongly recommended using a condom, pulling out, AND having me stay on the pill. Neither of us like condoms but he is considering whether or not we should start pulling out as well.

I don't disagree that it would be even more safe but if I use the pill perfectly is it really necessary to pull out as well or should I be pretty much covered? I've read that perfect use for the first year is 99.7% effective, so does that mean 3 out of every 1,000 women who use the pill perfectly get pregnant a year? Also, all the studies I've read only use the first year of use. Since I've been on the pill for so long does that change the effectiveness for the better?

A little background: My boyfriend is successful, handsome and kind. He's got a great job, a great apartment just outside the city and we've been dating for just under half a year. I love everything about him, and he's been my saving grace through a rough year at college.

When I first met Jake he was a really, really boisterous guy. Large gestures, large jokes, large laughs - everything. I loved him for that and I was glad to spend time with him because he was like a big light in this little suburb outside the city. He used to make jokes at his own expense when people would be down on themselves and I *always* caught him cheering other people up or offering to help one of his friends. I once saw him drive six hours at the drop of the hat to help his cousin talk out relationship issues with his wife. Not a lot of people noticed when he did stuff like that but I did, and it's really what made me fall in love with him.

But lately I've noticed that he is so hard on himself. Too much. He considers himself short and he's 5'8"". He thinks that he's a ""smaller guy"" but he's more built than anyone I've dated (and he spends more time at the gym than even his ""gym"" friends). He calls himself stupid for mistakes he's made - stuff that happened over *three years ago* - and I can't help him move on. Sometimes he says he doesn't deserve me and then goes into this odd ""confession mode"" where we start talking about all the terrible things he did when he wasn't the man he is today. Stuff that I've come to terms with. Stuff that really, he never needed to tell me.

I don't know how to help him. He came from a family where his dad wanted him to be independent and I think relying on me for his emotional support is making it even worse.

I'm lucky enough to be getting married in a month to my favorite person on the planet, but I'm still having relationship issues in my life... they're just someone else's. 

My best friend is engaged to someone who is on academic probation and refuses to work because he doesn't like the only jobs he's able to get with his education level- physical labor or service work. He says his anxiety and depression keep him from holding these jobs, and has been fired or left several in the past few years. 

He pulls horrible shit that's just gotten worse over the years. This last time she called me up in the middle of the night, sobbing, is when she took him to the grocery store at night and he suddenly cannot handle her complaining about work when he doesn't even have a job, so he bolts from the car off in the dark, he won't answer her calls and she can't find him. His friends pick him up and refuse to tell her anything besides that.

I was staying in town at my parents that week to watch my little bro while they went on vacation, and I got her to stay with me for a few days. Every night she’s sobbing and freaking out, trying to get ahold of this fucknut who continues to hang up on her because if she speaks too fast she's interrupting him, and he’s suddenly decided he ""doesn't give her permission to interrupt him.""

I want her to be happy. I've told her so many times she doesn't deserve to be miserable, and this just takes the cake- this is not how someone that loves and respects you treats you. This is horrifying. He ran off into the middle of the street at night, he could have been hit by a car or gotten lost, he needs HELP, and she is not a professional who can give it. And she *knows* all of this, she's the one explaining what's wrong with him to me half of the time. She's brought up moving out on her own dozens of times, but it always comes back to all the obstacles that would make it too hard to leave on her own- not enough money, can't room with someone she doesn't know, ect. We live too far apart for her to move in with me and my fiancé.

After a two days of me staying up half the night with her while she freaks out (for completely valid reasons!) trying to get him to talk to her, my kid brother hasn’t been able to sleep well, and I’ve had to seriously consider that he might show up at the house and I would have to call the police because I cannot take the chance of someone so unstable being around my family. When she goes back home and talks to him, suddenly ""they both have things to work on,” and the absolutely imperative couples therapy she was going to demand as his last chance before leaving ""might happen I guess, it couldn't hurt."" Now everything is peachy keen again and hooray his friends will room with them so they can afford to move out of his parents’ house! I'm tired of being expected to be happy for her making decisions that I know, and she knows, will make life more difficult when things get bad again. I'm tired of being forthright with her about how it's just going to be another cycle and she should look out for herself, and her agreeing, but then not even doing the bare minimum of improving a relationship that continually makes her miserable. 

I want her to not feel judged and have a safe place to come to. I want to be there for her. I'm always trying to pump her up, telling her she deserves to be happy, telling her her feelings matter and that she wouldn't feel them for no reason. Things are “okay” now, but I'm running low on the capacity to handle this when it isn’t. After what happened with my brother, I realize I can't keep giving like this if it's going to hurt other people-- and me. My work suffers and my fiance falls on the wayside when I'm stressing over trying to help her, trying to find the right things to say that will be truthful because I want to show her I care and know this isn't making her happy, but not sound judgmental. And to be honest, I’m getting frustrated with her. I’m sure you can tell I am, and I really, *really* don’t want to be, but I am. What happened was horrifying, especially that I had to consider her fiancé jeopardizing the safety of me and my young brother alone in the house. I hate him, more than anyone. She’s my maid of honor and I don’t want her bringing him to our events, I don’t want to look at him, I don’t want him drinking with us, I don’t want her pretending everything is a-ok and being hurt when I don’t want to play along anymore because it’s all I can do not to just slug him for what he's done. 

I’m venting by this point. I just want to get all these negative feelings out because this is such a delicate situation and I don’t want to hurt her, I want to be there for her. I just need to find the right balance for what that means now.

t3_25n6hm,"What do you all do when you get cat-called? Is there anything I *can* do?","Up until last week, I had never been cat called (that I was aware of, at least). I've heard stories from friends about how awful it feels, and I was very grateful to never have personally experienced it. Then, last week, I was yelled at TWICE (in two different towns) by men in cars as I walked past.

The first was just a pretty standard ""Hey baby"" and some leers. I was very put off, but it didn't really mess up my day or anything. The second really got to me, though. I was walking alone at night in not-the-safest college neighborhood, and a taxi drove past. A man stuck his head out of the window and screamed at me ""Hey sweetheart, nice legs. What time do they open?"" The taxi never slowed down. 

It just took me so off-guard. I didn't really know how to react. I just felt violated, scared, and hurt. I was so angry that another human being would feel entitled to look at me and decide that my feelings of personal safety and autonomy are worthless. To think that his ""fun"" or ""jokes"" or whatever he would consider that comment to be, are more important than my right to not feel objectified, humiliated, and afraid. 

I didn't say anything the first time it happened. I did scream ""Fuck you"" after the taxi, but it had already driven away and I doubt they heard me.  I hear all the time about the shitty way women are treated on the street, and I've always found it deplorable and deeply upsetting, but this was my first personal experience, and I can't stop thinking about how awful it made me feel.

What do you all do in these situations? Is there anything I *can* do? I felt like marching over and screaming at these men, but I know that could put me in a dangerous position, and I know it wouldn't really change their minds or get them to reconsider the mysognistic roots of this behavior. But I don't just want to stand there and take it. It seems like there's no solution.

I've been told in the past to just ignore them. But to me, that doesn't feel like ""being the bigger person."" It just feels like acceptance of their abuse.",23,20140515130135,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I have a disability. It's not life-threatening, and it barely affects my day-to-day life... ever, but it could maybe get worse if I became pregnant. There's no real proof either way--no major studies, even--just anecdotal evidence and enough concern from one doctor that I became really worried about becoming further disabled just as my husband and I were thinking about trying for a baby. 

We decided that we should adopt instead, and we've committed a lottt of money to the idea. But some days, I just don't want to do it. I'm afraid that the baby we might one day end up with won't love me or will always feel lacking because I'm not his or her ""real"" mom. I know I would love the kid, but I worry about society (since it's still ok to make adoption jokes on tv) and I worry about peers and I worry about... I don't know. Raising someone who will drift away from me one day? I know a biological child could do the same, and I know that a lot of adopted kids have amazing relationships with their parents. I just don't know of any positive examples in my own real life--only negative.

On top of this, my ""biological clock"" is screaming. Throughout the month, I have a few days where I'm ok with adopting and a few excruciating days where I'm just filled with regret at the decision because I just want ""MY OWN"" baby. I've never felt such a drive before.

It was in a pretty good neighborhood, mostly bars frequented by late 20s/early 30s working people. As usual when I walk alone, I was completely lost in my own thoughts, and didn't even notice the car slowing down as it approached me. I was walking in a crosswalk at this point. 

The car had four, maybe five young men in it. As it was ahead of me and slightly to my right, I did not need to turn my head or acknolwedge them in any way in order to watch them. They were making me nervous, of course. Then one of them rolled down the window and, in a voice that carried far too much aggression and vitriol warranted by the situaion, yelled, 

""Get out of the street!!"" I didn't move or speed up or physically react in any way. So he tried again, louder, angrier, ""Get out of the street, *bitch!!*"" I still did not react in any way. I find ignoring loud people is the best way to make them feel small. The car, in response, suddenly sped away in the opposite direction that I was walking.

I have no idea why that happened. The car did not wish to turn, I was not in their way, and even if I was...I was a pedestrian in a crosswalk, I had the right. And why would this person feel the need to try to intimidate me in this fashion? Why was he so angry, so threatened and mean? 

I think...I *think*, that since I was walking confidently and alone, that he felt I needed to be put in my place. Perhaps he knows that women walking alone at night always feel a tad insecure, and are therefore ""easy targets"". I don't know. This was months ago, and I am still baffled by the actions of those young men.

I'm going to give you a little context on what's happening right now. I recently applied for an illustration workshop located in Bali, and got accepted!! It's going to be a 5-day workshop with artists that I only ever dreamt of meeting. They're just. SO KICKASS. Here's the link in case you're curious. http://baliillustrationworkshop.com/

This is the part where the second-guessing comes in. I live in Costa Rica. Right now I work three jobs, one as a graphic designer and two others as a teacher at two different institutions. All combined my monthly salary doesn't exceed $1500. I'm 24. I don't have children or any other financial liabilities other than helping with the food and rent for my family.

I have never attended art school, and where I live there just aren't these types of art workshops. Everything I have learned, I've learned online. But something feels odd about travelling to the OTHER side of the world for an art class. I almost... feel guilty that I'm chasing a dream all the way over there. Something inside me is telling me this is stupid, and that I should stick around for my family. That I could use that money to pay for a post-degree in computer science or whatever shit.

I have never been able to do what I want. I have been working since I have memory, awful jobs cleaning tables, call centers. I studied computer science because I wanted to make my family proud and wanted to ensure a career that would feed me and them in the future. I have always loved drawing and it is through it that I haven't lost touch with the passions that keep me going day to day. I made some decisions which landed me in graphic design, and I'm happy, but I'd love to be a full time illustrator.

I feel this is the first step I'm taking toward realizing a goal that was nothing but a dream. Maybe it's just one other workshop but it means so much to me. I want to meet all the artists who will be teachers there and I want them to remember me.

But this is totally something new for me so I'm scared. I feel irresponsible and guilty. I want to stop hearing that voice that's trying to stop me. Girls, what do I do?

Around 25, I started getting weepy the week before, and easily angry. The first night of my period, I'm usually woken up with cramps, take a couple Pamprin, then back to bed. The first day is usually fairly uncomfortable, but I remembered how easy my periods were when I was on Nuvaring. Since its now covered under my insurance, I stated it almost a month ago. 

I took it out Sunday, and I've had some spotting, nothing serious. And I thought ""AWESOME this is a piece of cake!"" Last night, I had some twinges of cramps, but went back to sleep.

I come once again to your doors for advice (via a throwaway)!  If there’s another similar post elsewhere please link me to it – on a quick scan, I can’t find anything.  It’s not an exceptional situation by any means.

I am a woman in my early thirties.  Last year I took up acrobatics – this wasn’t completely new territory to me, as I’ve been doing competitive pole dancing and aerial hoop for several years (competed and won nationally), I used to be a gymnast and contortionist, I’m a weightlifter and involved in numerous competitive sports.  In short – I am very fit, very strong and very capable.  This is important later.
	
In short, I’m pretty sure the acrobatics instructor has taken a massive dislike to me, and I cannot understand why.  I’ve ruled out constructive criticism, motivation, hidden jealousy or whatever the initial thoughts are.  As she runs the acrobatics school and it’s the only one I can travel to, she has the potential to make my life very difficult and there’s nowhere else I can go, and there’s no one more senior I can report her to.  I could understand her dislike of me if I was mouthy or loud in class, but I’m really quiet, I listen carefully, keep myself to myself, do what I’m told and rarely speak unless I’m spoken to.  I’m also in the middle of the batch when it comes to ability – I’m not the best but I’m far from the worst.  Generally unremarkable.  I’m there to learn new skills.    

Some examples of her treatment:
Every week she criticises me in warm up.  Very often it’s ONLY me that gets picked on.  It’s usually very minor stuff…one week she said I wasn’t pointing my toes enough, then when I pointed them, she said they were too pointed.  I looked round and the majority of the class were also not pointing their toes.  In fact, there could be 20 people there, and most of them are making the exact same small “mistakes” as me, and often many are doing things a lot worse.  She’s not helpful when she offers her criticism….she might snap “….I’ve told you before to point your toes, Jesus”, or just plain “…you’re doing this wrong.  Again.  STOP IT.”    

I asked her to show me a move again as I wanted to be sure of the positions etc.  This is a common request, and in the interests of safety, we’re encouraged to ask. She generally does things as many times as people ask.  When I asked, she stood up facing me, near nose to nose and said “Why should I?  Were you not paying attention?”  I opened my mouth to answer and she replied “look, just shup up, ok?  I’ll do it again.” 

After teaching me for several months AND performing in several shows she attended, she randomly decided one week that “I wasn’t strong enough for her class”.  This would be fine, bar the fact that I’m more than strong enough (see piece above about history in sport etc), I had already demonstrated these moves to her plenty of times and to add confusion, there are people in her class who genuinely aren’t strong enough.  This is an all abilities class, there are some absolute beginners there who can’t even tumble and she said because I couldn’t hold a split handstand for 30s that I “just wasn’t capable”.  She actually sent me home in front of everyone.  Another instructor (who I’ve competed with in pole comps) was horrified and demanded I come back the next week.  This nice instructor has now left.  

Most recently, she told me to “stop talking, you always over explain everything” when I mentioned that I was off last week and she had ASKED US if we’d be present in the last few weeks when a stand-in was teaching.  When I mentioned it she announced loudly in front of everyone she wasn’t sure if she should let me do training tonight because I wasn’t there last week and “who knows what critical thing I missed”.  I was genuinely shocked because 1. I very rarely speak, as I mentioned and 2. We were doing things I’ve done LOTS in the past.

So there we go 2x, I’m sorry for the rant.  I am genuinely confused and I want to try and sort this out.  Any advice?  If it’s any help, I’m nervous about confronting her because she is highly irrational and very snappy and emotional.  If she decides it, she could pretty much refuse to teach me and I’d have no -where else to go to learn this stuff.

I'm a courteous transit rider and whenever I see a pregnant woman, I offer my seat to her. But there are some people that don't. Are they not looking up? Are they looking down so they don't have to risk seeing a belly right at eye level? 

I'm more surprised that women do this too, because I feel like there is an understand women have towards each other in these situations. 

I'm not trying to call these men and women out, but to understand why some people choose not to offer their seats. I would genuinely appreciate hearing why.

t3_25nlnm,"Will any birth control pill work for me?","I've been trying to use birth control pills for a while now, but I've had nothing but bad luck. First I tried Trinessa. First time I tried it I stupidly started on finals week thinking that I wouldn't get any side effects. Instead I felt awful. I kept vomiting, had bad diarrhea, and constantly felt dizzy. I stopped because I had to finish my finals and the effects went away almost immediately.

I tried again a month or so later and instead had an allergic reaction to it. I had no other side effects that that time though. I was just covered in rashes though. I stopped that after about three days.

I then tried Minastrin 24 Fe. That was just terrible. I had diarrhea and nausea. I somehow ended up with a fever and couldn't do anything other than lay in bed feeling terrible for two days after I stopped taking them. I think at that point I had only had two of the pills.

I still want to try taking a birth control. My boyfriend suggests I stop because it just may not be the way for us. He doesn't want me going through all of this when condoms are so much easier for me. I still want to try one more to put my mind to rest I guess. Third time is the charm? I'm still pretty scared to try though.

t3_25oqe8,"A PSA: rape happens...a lot.","I've been thinking about making this post for a couple of days. Now that we're a default subreddit, we've opened up to a broader group of people. While I don't think this should become a educate-men subreddit, I do think it is good to occasionally talk about things that our core users understand but our new users might not.

So what I want to talk about is rape. I want to talk about it because for the last week I have seen so many reddit threads circle-jerking about rape culture and the fact that women have been brainwashed to be afraid of *all* men. I've seen so many comments talking about how hurt men sometimes are when women don't want to talk to them on the bus, or cross the street when they see them, or just are overly-cautious around them. I think this is something that needs to be addressed and discussed.

Some men seem to believe that women have been taught/socialized by the media to fear men, or to think of all men as potential rapists. The truth is, we have been socialized to think that, not by the media but by life. Rape happens. It happens *all the time*. There isn't a woman alive who doesn't know someone who's been raped, or been raped herself. It's prevalent. It's real.

Here's a story. I am in a social group that includes many girls. Last fall, we had a special meeting where we got together and were given the chance to speak about our personal histories, if we wanted. In this group there were sixteen of us in total. Of those sixteen, FOUR admitted to being raped (two by their boyfriends, one by her ex-boyfriend, and one by an acquaintance). More than that, I know one of the other sisters well, and know that she has been raped (she didn't share that during the ceremony). I have never been raped, but I have been sexually assaulted twice (once by an acquaintance, once by a stranger). 

So in total, 6 out of 16 women in a room had been either raped or assaulted. Keep in mind that this is a group of college girls. We are all different. We come from different places, different backgrounds, different religions, different everything. And it was still 6 out of 16.

So yes, I'm wary of men. I'm wary of strangers. I'm wary that the nice guy I'm talking to is only telling me what I want to hear, and will get angry and aggressive if I turn him down. I'm wary that the guy on the bus who sits too close to me isn't just someone with a poor understanding of personal space. It's always on my mind. It has to be. Because these things happen.

That being said, I don't fear men. I know that there are a vast amount of great wonderful men out there. I have many of those men in my life. I believe most men are good. But I'm still cautious, and that's okay. We all have to work together to make this world a safer place.

To any men or women out there who haven't dealt with this topic in your life, please know there's a nearly 100% chance that a woman in your life, probably even within your own family, has been assaulted or raped. It's that prevalent. The best thing you can do is to be supportive and understanding. Parents, teach your daughters to stand up for themselves, to know that they can always say ""no."" Friends, look out for the women in your life. Be there and be supportive if she needs help.

[As a side note, I know that many men out there are raped too. I don't mean to diminish their situations by focusing on women in this post. I thought since this is a female-oriented sub it would be good to stick to a female perspective. However, men deserve our support and understanding just as much as women.]

EDIT 1: To those saying that so many of my friends were raped because we are in college, I would like you to read what I posted in reply to a comment:

>The answer is yes. Of the five girls I know were raped, one was raped in high school, one was an alum who was raped two years after leaving college, one was raped while visiting her boyfriend's family in the suburbs, one was raped in her dorm room, and one was raped at a party. I was assaulted once in high school and once at a college party.

I'm at a loss, and I'm sorry if there's a better way to find this information within this very community. But I'm sure there have to be resources somewhere? I just can't find anything, and I'll take any help that I can get.

A friend of mine was raped by a stranger (parking lot attendant) a few weeks ago, and I've been helping her get through it the best I could. She's done everything ""right"" since then (calling a rape hotline for support, going to PP for plan B, STD testing, even going to the ER for a rape kit), but it took her exactly seven days from the event to report it. By that time, she got tons of criticism from the male officer who filed her report. He asked her questions that, in my opinion, should have had nothing to do with his decision to rule that ""no foul play was identified"" in the final report. He asked if she was sexually active otherwise, when the last time she had engaged in intercourse was before the rape (more than 6 days prior), insinuated that the semen might be from the sex with her partner and not from the ""alleged rape"" that she might be making up since she was drunk at the time, asked how she knows she hadn't consented if she had been drunk, asked why she didn't scream or push him off of her (she did try to push him off, but she dreams every night about it and wakes up crying at the point where she doesn't scream). The officer also criticized her for waiting so long to file the report...etc.

So basically, this officer, who signed up to protect people by being a police officer, just made my friend feel ""like a slut"" (her words, not his.) and feel more guilty about what happened to her. Shouldn't a police officer understand that dealing with trauma victims is part of their job? Shouldn't that knowledge alone make you at least slightly understanding of the fact that some things take time? That you should be a little bit more gentle with victims and not treat them as suspects? Am I just crazy?

I just feel so defeated, and I know it is only a fraction of how defeated she feels. The injustice of it infuriates me so much that I don't even know what I'm asking for. I just want to help her. I want her to know that the world doesn't think she asked to get raped, even though that officer made her feel like she did. And, if possible, I want to know if there is any legal action that we can take in order to file a new police report, although I'm sure that's not actually possible once the original is filed, or maybe take action against that officer? 

Thank you so much in advance just for reading this. It felt good to at least get this all off of my own chest, at the very least.",90,20140515170758,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25nwwn,"When is 'You Lost Weight' not a compliment?","I want to take this moment for my first post, I have something that's been bothering me.

Let me start of with the fact that while I am not the skinniest I am a healthy and what some may even consider to be 'small' size. I work in Beverly Hills at a prestigious company. I am a receptionist and I make good money for an entry level position I came into with hardly any experience at an age where my peers have chosen college. I completely support myself which with the addition of a couple bills, lately means that I cant afford to eat 3 times a day or even twice all the time. As a result I'm sure I've lost weight but I wouldn't definitely know since I never weigh myself and I've never noticed any drastic change in the way my body looks.
Last week a male that I work with was talking to me and at some point he added 'You look good, you've lost weight!', and I was kind of taken back by that. I'm not completely sure why but it offended me. How could he tell I lost weight? Why was that a good thing? Was I not a good enough size before? Did I need to lose weight? I know he meant it as a compliment, but why would he compliment a healthy girl on weight loss?
Just yesterday at work I was speaking with another male I work with while I was eating and he invited me to walk with him and I said I should rather do that than eat seconds of this pot luck lunch we were having since I was completely stuffed at this point. He then said something like about how I've been improving ' You're going blonde, you've lost weight...', and once again I was offended and still not completely sure why. Why is changing my hair color an 'improvement'? I obviously needed to lose the weight right?
I can't seem to get it out of my mind, and I'm not sure if I'm over reacting. It was meant as a compliment but I feel insulted...

EDIT: Insulted is not where I was trying to go with this. It was more along the lines of 'Why should telling someone who is already healthy that they lost weight be a positive thing?'.",24,20140515172119,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

What's the rush, you ask? We're both surprisingly sure about each other. We've decided to wait until marriage for sex, and moving in together before then wouldn't encourage that decision, nor would it make our families very happy. We're just excited to start life together.

I lurk here all the time, and I know you all are very supportive. I hope one of you is kind enough to offer me some words of wisdom right now.

Last night I told my boyfriend (first time I've told anyone ever) about my bulimic behavior. When I eat a big meal, I throw it up. I explained to him why I do it - I'm very depressed and suicidal, and throughout my whole life I've been using food to help me cope. I used to be very overweight until I was about 17-18 (20 now), so I've always truly hated my body. Now, I'm a lot thinner (I lost a lot of weight in very unhealthy ways), get lots of attention, am considered ""skinny"".. but I don't look as good without clothes on. So I want to lose some weight until I'm happy. I feel obese, still. I feel like a whale. I want to die, but I  want to eat everything before I do. To be honest, I'm never full. I hate being around food because I just want to eat it. And if I do, I'll puke it all out. But if it was up to me, I'd eat forever, you know?

After explaining to him that food makes me temporarily happy and takes me away from my depression for a bit, he was worried and showed concern, etc. I specifically asked him for help because I know this is bad and I don't want to damage my teeth any more. Of course, he agreed to help. After the conversation, we went upstairs to his apartment and decided to eat. He made me promise I wouldn't throw it up (I wasn't going to, I had already done that before so I was actually hungry and knew I needed some food to function). As soon as I sit and am about to eat, he says, ""don't eat too much"".

At that point, I put my plate down, and decided not to eat. He didn't have a problem with it, and just continued to eat his food. He saw I was upset but I didn't want to talk. I felt like the fattest person in the world, and well, I felt broken inside, and decided I needed to eat a lot less because he probably agrees with me and also thinks I'm fat... I mean why else would he tell me that? I got the hint.. but I can't deny he made me feel horrible.. 

Fast forward to today, around dinner time, I tell him I don't want to eat. 5 minutes later I change my mind (I was going to puke it out anyway), so as I'm about to get some food, he says, ""I thought you said you weren't hungry."" I said ""I lied,"" to which he replies, ""you need to make up your mind."" He sounded annoyed that I decided to eat.. So, again, I felt like a cow, and decided not to eat. He then proceeded to eat next to me.

Now, a few hours later, we get to his place and he immediately heats up some pizza hut, and just eats it right in front of me.. doesn't offer food, doesn't care if I'm hungry or not (he obviously knew I skipped dinner earlier)... I mean, he doesn't have to offer food, I can eat when I want, but god, I told him how hard it is for me to be around food!!! why is he doing this?

I started to cry, so I told him everything I've typed, and he just said that he's sorry and that he didn't mean it, and that just eating in front of me was wrong. But then, why would he do it in the first place? I'm confused, I don't know why he's making this harder for me? I mean why would you tell someone with an ED that they shouldn't eat too much? Or why would you just eat in font of them when you know they are hungry all the time? :( Am I overreacting? I want to think that I am but I just feel so fat, I feel like I'm not skinny enough for him and that he's kind of doing me a favor by encouraging me not to eat. But a part of me still feels sad.

Sometimes, I can feel myself acting like my mother or father when my boyfriend and I argue or I need to communicate a need. I have no other role models for ""good"" relationships. Things look warped if they don't look like my parent's relationship. My sister and her husband sometimes look like my parent's relationship also, I've noticed. How do I not become them?

I do admire my parent's dedication and ability to keep going despite arguments and still laugh with each other and stuff like that, but at the core of it, I'm deeply afraid I'll become like them.",2,20140515212209,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25o1xt,"I can't take NYC creepy men anymore. Here's what happened today.","Creepy men everywhere are really bad but for some reason either there are more of them in NYC or they're just so much worse.

Today, I went into a restaurant in Manhattan in NYC.  The servers put me at a table next to a window with the seat facing the restaurant. The seats were facing the restaurant and the window, not sideways next to the window.  A few minutes after I sat down, I noticed a relatively large, domineering looking man wearing a white shirt that looked like a chef's jacket sitting in the corner diagnoally opposite from the corner I was in. While his seat was facing the opposite way from my seat, the seat was not directly turned toward me.

But *he* was turned directly towards me and looking at me. I looked at him and he kept looking at me. This went on for about *20 minutes.*  I wasn't looking at him the whole time and after a few minutes I was thinking, you've gotta be kidding me. Someone can't actully do that.  

But, you know, this is planet Earth, and someone, yes, can do that.

Finally after about 20 minutes, I turned to two women sitting at the table next to me and discreetly, without looking at the man, asked them if the man was looking in my direction. They looked at him and said yes.

About two minutes later, he was gone.

Later I asked the server who it was and the server told me that was the owner.

I mean, c'mon. It's not like I've never gotten stared at. But 20 minutes?

Ok. Yes, one of the women said he was just looking in that general direction and looking around.  The server said he likes to watch the restaurant to see how the waiters are and if the customers are happy.

But ok, if you're going to watch the restaurant, make it discreet.

You shouldn't make it a perfect excuse to stare at a woman who is eating by herself, who also happens to be the only Asian woman there.

You're all welcome to go ahead and think he wasn't actually staring at me for 20 minutes. Maybe he wasn't.

At the very least, if you watch your restaurant, be discreet about it!  No female customers like to get stared at for 20 minutes by a creepy looking man no matter what your real intentions are.

When I asked the server about it, he was really apologetic and understanding. I wasn't obnoxious about it, but merely pointed out what had happened.

The two women I asked were sympathetic and suggested I move seats, ""but then he'll know you're on to him.""

Anyone want to doubt that this type of stuff can happen?  Go to NYC!

EDIT: This is not the worst thing that happened to me from creepy men in NYC. Nor is it close to the worst that's happened to any women.

I would just expect that with something as routine as eating your daily lunch at a decent restaurant where most of the patrons are hipsters and yuppies, you should be safe. At least safe from staff. But so many of these managers and owners of restaurants seem to do it because they want control of a place, not to make customers happy. Has anyone else noticed that?

I'm not anti-relationship questions, but they seem to have become a large percentage of the total content. I can understand why people would want to pose a relationship question to THIS sub specifically because I identify with the community, and see a lot of supportive, non blame gamey advice. 

I think work interactions, and social interaction questions are more along the lines of this sub's daily mission because the advice is normally pretty universal while relationship questions tend to be very specific to the person posing them.

I think we should do something like Tuesday and Thursday relationship advice day... and (of course) the occasional post seeking advice about leaving an abuser should not be deleted because the poster's crisis didn't happen to fall on a certain day of the week.

I am a 22F about to finish college. Since the start of my college career I had a boyfriend, we were together for 4 years basically. This past January he broke up with me citing he didn't feel the same anymore. Since then I have gone on multiple dates with different guys but have remained single. I am starting to worry that I'm not going to find someone that makes me feel the way my ex made me feel. Things just felt right with him, we like connected in a way that I've never connected with someone. I also was insanely attracted, I've never been this attracted to someone before he was my perfect guy.


Well as you can tell I really thought that after being together for so long and with our connection that we would end up together. But obviously with the break up thats not gonna happen.


Since the break up and dating multiple different guys I am starting to feel really self conscious and I am worrying that I will never find that real connection again. I know a SO is supposed to enhance your life and not make it, but I can't get rid of this voice in the back of my head telling me that if I never get married or find that guy then I won't be fulfilled in life.

Throwaway because my fiance is a redditor and I would prefer he not read my explicit detailing in this even if we have talked about way worse. This is my problem, and would like to see some opinions on it.

When I was in first grade or so, I remember asking my mom what the white residue left in my underwear was. She never really explained it to me, but it continued. It always seemed to leave a nice white seam line of my labia, concentrated at my clit.

It was normal for me to come home and change into gym shorts until my shower, then new underwear in the morning. I did this all through middle school and most of high school. It wasn't that bad. It didn't smell. It didn't make me feel uncomfortably wet during the day.

I took two shots of the Depo Provera starting at the end of Junior year, and over the summer.

The discharge was gone! Nothing. Zip. Nada. No problemo. I was a lot dryer and had to use some sort of lube for banging, but I was fine most of the time.

I went off of the depo shot in February when I moved in with my fiance. It was very gradual for my periods to get semi regular, and now I have had two real periods. For the first time in my life, I am bleeding on my own.

 See, I never started my period without birth control. First time was during the off week on the pills when I was sixteen. Depo was supposed to regulate me. Instead I got the flood of the red tide for a few months.

So now ladies, the root of the problem: I have an overabundance of cervical mucus at night and too much discharge during the day. I can't go back on birth control because I don't know how bad depo might have messed me up.

Was I wrong?","About a week ago, we had a big birthday blow out for a girlfriend of mine. I (F26), have been away for a really long time, and it's the first time my friend (F29) and I have had to reconnect. A lot of people I have never met attended and the party ramped up pretty quick. It was, by all standards, a really good time. Eventually my friend passes out in her bedroom around 1. I check on her every little bit to make sure she's okay.

One of these check ins, I come onto a male close friend of mine, helping two posing girls take selfies with her passed out on the bed. I got pretty upset. I berated all of them. I asked if that was how they'd want to be treated if they were passed out, and if that's the kind of respect they show for a friend. The girls got snarky and left, and the next morning I apologized to my friend if I was being rude to her pals. She said it's okay and acted nonchalant, but I haven't heard from her since.

I'm worried I've damaged the relationship, but at the same time, I stand by what I did. It makes me worried that we as fellow women are so willing to treat other women so crassly to, what, get a funny Instagram selfie?

t3_25owc3,"My sex drive has evaporated/ personal anecdote about a skin disease that doctors aren't too familiar with","Hi guys, longtime lurker but I would love your input. 

Basically, I had a series of infections ( strep/uti -> kidney infection/ weird allergic response to antibiotics ) and believed that I was essentially one of the unlucky people who are more susceptible to yeast infections. After a year of std tests and other random medications, it  turns out that I have lichen sclerosus- but luckily not visibly matching that on the image search. Essentially, I get intense bursts of extreme itchiness. Yeast infection itchy, and any friction (especially the kind due to penetrative intercourse) makes my bits swell up to blue waffle proportions. And semen *burns* ( I'm not allergic, it's probably due to the microtearing of my skin).

For anyone who has it, I suggest silicone lube, it helps a lot. It has made sex a lot less painful for me.  I used an high concentration corticosteroid which does stop the itching when applied, however, the irritated patches of skin have never completely healed.  I'm able to have a relatively normalish sex life again with minimal pain/swelling, but I'm definitely dryer than I have been in the past. Also, the longer the session, the more likely I'll really swell up. 

I'm just wondering now if I'm associating the pain caused by lichen with sex, or if it's a sign it's just something about my current relationship that isn't doing it for me anymore. I wasn't always like this. I used to love it, and now I don't really care. My partner is so understanding, and he hates to cause me pain.

I don't mind when my partner inserts his fingers but I don't like when he moves around and I can sort of feel the pelvic bone, etc. 

I'm wondering if this is unusual.  It just creeps me out but I feel like, especially as a 26 year old woman, I should be able to touch my own vagina and not get the same cringey feeling I got watching the birds and the bees video in the 5th grade.

t3_25pie9,"Need some advice on how to help my girlfriend come to terms with what I suspect is years of abuse from her father.","Hi,

I have been with my girlfriend now for a few months.  I really care about her and we have a great relationship.  But she has quite clearly suffered phycolgically and it has taken her some time to open up to me about a few things.  She does not want to go into too much detail but I am hoping that she will continue to view me as trustworthy enough to bear the burden with her.

I suspect her father has both physically and mentally abused her.  She is early 20s.  I don't know how long it has been going on and I don't know how far it goes and it worries me.   She has mentioned that her father has hit her in the past and still grabs her and stops her from being able to get away from him when she wants to leave the room.  I don't think it's like one of those crazed moments of fury kind of attacks, but more of the grabbing her arm and forcing her back into the room so he can continue to lecture her.  Apparently it has escalated to the point where she has told him to get away from her and he continued to force her to do whatever it was he was trying to get her to do.  She has said that he did hit her often when she was growing up.  Her father is a devoted catholic, and has a very successful career.  Seems to treat his family like property because he earns good money.....

I see classic signs of abuse.  I love my girlfriend, and she loves me.  We live in different states so it is long distance thing, but when she comes to see me she says she is so happy and relaxed.  But she is being pressured by her parents (remember she is in her 20's and able to make her own mind up) to break up with me, because ""only they have her true happiness and wellbeing in mind"".  They tell her that I couldn't possibly love her as much as her parents which is why they must do 'x'.  It real control issue.  

She does not live with her father, but she lives in his house (well-off family).  She is studying and does not have a lot of income.  Her parents have always said that they will let her live rent free while she is studying.  She lives with her sister who is just as bad as her parents in a lot of aspects.  She does not get along with her.  When she told them she wanted to move out of the house, they coincidentally started charging rent.  This rent coupled with the low-income-student situation means that she now cannot possibly save the money required for rent/bond to move - how convenient!

Basically, I wanted to come here to have a bit of a rant, but I also want to know what you all think?  She has started seeing a phycologist in the last month which I hope will allow her to work through some of this.   

What should I do about this?  I need to get her out of this toxic situation?  Any suggestions?

But they're grown a pretty freakin' awesome sub to the point that it was big enough to default. And one of the things I want is for women to have a greater voice on reddit, and having a woman's sub among the defaults is a great first step. 

But for those of your complaining that 2x isn't a safe space, well, you're right. But why fight over how to run 2x when you have alternatives? We deserve more than one great woman oriented sub! So, I'm here to introduce /r/FemmeThoughts to you. The only thing default about us is that we default to awesome!  

The goal of /r/FemmeThoughts is fairly similar to 2x. We're a casual, comfortable space for women and friends to share perspectives and experiences in relative peace. Our rules are relatively simple: don't be a bigot, don't wish violence onto others, don't doxx and listen to the mods. And above all, have fun! All genders are welcome, but this is primary a space for women. Mods will give warnings for lesser offences (like mansplaining), but bigotry and trolling get banned quickly.

This is a flawed metaphor, but bear with me.  Imagine that we are a calculus club.  We sit around all day talking about calculus, when suddenly a group of people barge in and demand an explanation as to why ""2+2=4.""  We say ""Because addition, but that really isn't what we are talking about today.  Feel free to sit in, but we are talking about calculus.""  They say ""Tell us what it means you fucking Calcunazi bitch.""

I found myself very frustrated in the PSA thread because there were some comments that were so erroneously wrong or questions that were very basic, that I couldn't not answer.  I just couldn't let a person ask ""Wait, consensual sex can turn to rape without someone fighting? Have I been raping my girlfriend?"" without answering.  I *COULDN'T*.  Continuing without answering would have been like playing a guitar without tuning it.  

BUT that wasn't the point of the thread!  And it was so incredibly frustrating to see comment after comment with people either wondering what 2+2= or insisting that 4 isn't the correct answer.  There is obviously need for dialogue, but TwoX wasn't supposed to be that place. It was supposed to be a place where we already all agreed that 2+2=4 and that a yes can change to a no mid sex.

The only solution I can see, now that we are defaulted, is to simply not engage.  Either downvote without replying (since very basic questions like that do not add to the discussion) and completely ignore the outraged ""EDIT: I'm being downvoted for asking a fucking question!

We get along really well, our interests are the same and the sex... oh god, the sex is the best I've had. Everytime he comes over we end up doing it four or five times. He's a screamer (and he makes the hottest noises) and I get quite loud too.

She told me that she can't stand our noises anymore and that the whole building has been talking about it. I was in shock! I apologized and told her I had NO idea they could hear us and that I would be more considerate in the future. She left more calmed, but angry still.

t3_25qf81,"I had something taken from me. I will never be the same again. I lost my virginity to my rapist, simple as that.","I would like to share my story of two separate occurrences that have drastically changed me as a person:

1. I was a young child and my sadistic abusive brother would make my life hell in ever way possible. One particular story that stands out was my brother and I alone for the evening in the home and out of fear (this was nothing new) I would hide in the bathroom, lock the door and push everything against it I could, like a laundry hamper and my legs.  My brother became so irate at this self preservation that he went into a classic rage.  After having to check out mentally for about 4 hours my parents return to find the scene, he had stabbed the door about 50 times with a large kitchen knife, kicked down the door and was on top of me cutting my throat with the same knife.  To this day he has never apologized, has never spoken of any of the hundreds of incidences like this, I truly believe he is a terrible person, just that simple.  Given I grew up in a very wealthy household all of this was hidden form everyone, no therapy for me, no special family talks about situations, no anything, not even my father protecting his youngest child who was almost murdered many times.  I hurt deeply inside and due to all the abuse I received as a child I have no memories of being young, don't know what elementary school was like, what field trips I went on, who I was friends with or what games I played.  I had no childhood and it pains me deeply.

2.  In college I am living with my SO and two more roommates.  SO and I end a 4 year relationship and go our separate ways.  Another roommate tries really hard for something physical, but I continually reject the offers and am very clear with my boundaries (something I learned from my childhood).  After a night of heavy drinking (liquid relationship therapy), I end up in bed with this roommate due to a lack of control on my part, again I was clear though, no touching, no anything, and I just passed out.  The next morning I am awoken by them having sex with me and the confusion and overall overwhelming emotion of hatred for this person instantly.  I had been waiting to have sex when I was first married, something without religious purpose, but something I cared about deeply at the time.  This was taken from me by a greedy and shitty person.  I went into the college offices to speak to people because I was in a rental contract with this very person and needed all the support I could get.  I was literally laughed at and turned away due to 'no evidence' and my word against theirs.  I still cry about it to this day, over ten years later.

Why do I say all of this?
1.  I need to get it off my chest, it pains me to think I am not alone in these situations, and that others experience this very same hell on earth.

2.  Sharing information can enlighten others to realities that exist, I appreciate support, but really I want a conversation on this, so others can learn from my experiences.  I am open for questions, responses, support and hatred. I would like a conversation as a result, feel free to join in.  If anything rubbed you wrong in what I said, call me out on it, so I may learn (and apologize).  

3. I am a male, my brother a male abuser and my female roommate a female abuser.  Both are people I will remember until the day I die, for the way they walked on me and took my purity in more ways than one.  Rape is rape, abuse is abuse.  The type of language used in this subreddit hurt me, literally villify men as a form of support to each other.  I would like to point out, I have suffered at the hands of a man, and it wasn't a gender issue, it was literally a physical representation of that persons hatred for themselves, much like a drug addict may push the limits so much out of self harm.  I was the victim yes, but it wasn't because of who I was as a person, quite the opposite.  I represented what they didn't have, morals and values.  And try as they may, I will never move on those.  Also, I do not look like one would imagine: I am 6'2"" tall, with a shaved head and broad shoulders and a strong voice.  More often than not women cross the street when they see me walking alone at night, I am assumed to be the attacker due to my looks.  Yet my experiences say otherwise. 

4. I am genderqueer (see my two stories above for some background on why).  I believe we proliferate a serious amount of issues due to gender definitions in our society, things like telling girls looking pretty is part of their job, or telling boys they must be ferocious and fight for what they want.  I will not bash anyone, for any reason, period.  

5. I will never know what it is like to be a female, period.  Just like I will never know what it is like to be my brother and have a mindset that can justify such horrible actions.  I am extremely empathetic and believe that having an open mind that sees the other side of the story changes things. 

6.  I wanted my stories to be void of genders, not to hide that I am a male, but because I am genderqueer and see such strong male bashing here that it hurts.  I have never disrespected a womans boundaries (nor a mans), I have never physically attacked anybody, I have supported/stood up for men and women who very clearly were being abused in their relationships or by a stranger.  I live like I think all people should, yet my gender can make me feel like the bad guy in this subreddit at times.  This needs to change.  Emotional support can happen without bashing, empathy can happen without hatred, love ought to be shared by all.

I love you all, you are my family.  We walk this land together, share many things and are unique in others.  Please take my hand as we continue to walk this earth and make our home the most beautiful place possible, one where a smile is the norm, where support is everywhere, where everyone is respected and we can all grow into the amazing creatures we are meant to be.

An acquaintance of mine has been a long standing employee at her job, and we were looking at some information when she pointed out that she makes $20,000 less a year than the other people of her equal position and power... who are 90% men. 

She's lived with it a long time, and retires in less than a decade. She goes above and beyond what's really required of her position to try and branch out networking and communication, but she has gone unappreciated (which hasn't really bothered her) and a newly arisen issue of someone trying to seriously put her down has made her question that maybe she should stand her ground a little more firmly. 

THE PROBLEM: She retires in less than a decade, so does she risk her job to get the equal pay and privilege? How would she do that without going straight to the legal department? What's the best way someone's beat this without causing a serious uproar? **Is it worth it?**

t3_25q375,"My Paraguard Story!","When I was researching different forms of birth control, a lot of negative or scary stories came up for IUDs, which sucked... because that was the form of birth control I most liked. I ended up having a Mirena, which is a hormonal IUD, inserted when I was about 19. 

Let me start by saying I suffer from panic attacks, anxiety, and depression. I am being medicated for it successfully, so it hadn't been a major, life-stopping problem for about a year at the time of insertion. I'm not saying necessarily that the Mirena caused it, but I started getting anxious and panicky afterwards with no cause that I or my family or friends could determine. I was happy with my job, my SO, my living situation, etc... So, I decided to have it removed in hopes that, even if I was making myself panicky over the hormones, my anxiety would dissipate. The anxiety went away and so did the annoying break outs I seemed to be having. So I just used condoms for a while until I finally made an appointment to have a Paraguard (non-hormonal) in. 

I went in on the last day of my period (a feat in itself as I have irregular periods, don't worry I've had everything checked out, my body is just weird.) The cramping was no worse than a bad period cramp and it was only at it's worst while my cervix was being held open by the clamp. It was moderately sore for the next two days afterwards, which went away with some ibuprofen and a HarryPotter-a-thon. 

It's been in for two and a half months. A lot of women say they bleed more heavily afterwards or that their cramps are worse... Here's the weird part, I've had mildly heavier bleeding, but my period cramps have all but disappeared. Also, and this could be completely unrelated, my period has been on-the-dot on time for the two months after. We shall see if that continues at the end of this month when I'm due for my next cycle. 

While I was researching IUDs there were a lot of horror stories. Women who had incredibly painful insertions with long after-effects. My experience was incredibly positive, especially given that I have had no real side effects. AND, the best part, I don't have to think about it for the next 10 YEARS--possibly even longer! At a 99% effectiveness rate as long as it stays in the correct position which is pretty easy to check and very easy for your OBGYN to confirm. I had mine checked yesterday.

So, if you're having issues with hormonal birth control or problems remembering to take your birth control every day, I sincerely hope you give the Paraguard a try and that your experience is as positive as mine was!

If anyone has any questions about my experience, feel free to ask or send me a private message if you're embarrassed!

t3_25qcx2,"To the mods of TwoX: Going default was a good decision","We've heard a lot about why everybody thinks the defaulting of this sub was a bad decision.   

* On the one hand, we've got the faithful TwoX subscribers who are battling the influx of shitposting and rage-inducing commenters and fear that our little 'safe' space is going to the dogs. 
* On the other hand we've got the MENZ. The ones who are pissed off that their internets are contaminated with with girl germs and instead of unsubscribing, they'd rather tell us how wrong we are to think we deserve a portion of their all important brain space (it is usually quite limited in these specimens, so I can see why they'd want to prioritise it...)
 
While I have zero sympathy for the latter, and a lot of empathy for the former... I still disagree with both. I think making TwoX a default was NEEDED, and I'm glad the mods decided to give it a go. I hope they stay with it for a little bit longer. 
 
My reasoning: reddit needs more diversity on its front page and in its default subreddits if it's ever going to become a less shitty echo-chamber of awfulness. As a woman and a redditor for 7 years or more (on my regular account) I've seen reddit go through a lot of changes. Over the years, I've retreated into fewer and fewer subreddits because of the shitty behaviour and opinions of the masses. There are now maybe five subreddits I visit on a regular basis, twox being one of them. I'm not a particularly fragile flower, so the fact that I feel reddit is basically a hostile, unlikeable space for the most part is probably a good indicator that plenty of others do too - and anecdotally I think we can all agree a lot of women feel that way.  
 
**This general awfulness will never change unless there is more diversity in the defaults.**

Does this mean things are going to be easy? No. It probably means TwoX will go to shit... for a while at least. It probably means the mods are going to have a hell of a job moderating shitposts and shitty comments. It means we, the community, are going to have to put up with some uncomfortable situations - and I by no means think the community has to put up with something that makes them uncomfortable. Sexual harassment or rape threats or anything of that nature is **not acceptable**. For users who have to deal with that (and the fear of it is what's causing me to use this alt today, tbh), I'm not sure what the answer is. I'm not sure what's best. For those who choose to stay and engage in TwoX anyway, we'll have to be strong and vigilant and report bad behaviour to mods and admins.  
 
Default status may even mean - worst case scenario - that TwoX is unsalvageable. But I know that you're not going to make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. Hopefully the eventual omelette of a nicer, more equal and tolerant reddit is a delicious omelette worth fighting for (ok, my metaphor ability sucks...)  
 
In the mean time, I'd like to mention that /r/SRSWomen exists - it's a lot like TwoX but men are explicitly forbidden from posting/commenting and some women here might find it a safer space than TwoX until shit dies down here.  
 
**edit:** if there are other women-focused subs that explicitly foster a safe space for women, let me know and I'll list them here too. I realise /r/srswomen might be offputting for some, but I honestly don't know of another sub that strictly enforces a safe space for women...

I'm rather drunk and his house is across the street so I go home with him because my daughter was at her dads for the weekend anyway. Cuddling and crying turns in to crazy sex. Tried to talk a couple times after but it all went back to me being upset about the past and this morning I told him this will never work and I was sorry I went to his house. To which he responds ""Well I wasn't going to tell you but the condom broke and I ditched it"" I freak out and ask if he came in me to which he says ""Im pretty sure""


FUCK. FUCK. I check my period calender, the day he did this was two days before an egg drop. So, for those who don't know, one to two days before your actual ovulation date is absolute prime time to get pregnant.
I am a very fertile person. I have a daughter and had a miscarriage 2 years ago (same dad to both).


It's too late for a plan B. My boobs are super sore and feel much worse than PMS. I have the discharge I had the first two times. and I am FREAKING the fuck out. I have a terrible feeling. A lot of girl who have ever tried to concieve will know this feeling and these symptoms, it's just a funny one. I chalked it up to PMS but this makes so much more sense. You usually don't notice these things unless your trying to get pregnant, which is why it made so much sense today.


I took my daughter to walmart after he told me this through a text and it was so different than the first two times I was pregnant. My ears were ringing and I got dizzy in when I walked by the baby stuff, just thinking oh my god, please, no. Im in a daze right now and I don't even know how to think straight and I don't even know if this is real.


I haven't responded to him. I feel like he meant to do this because he hates the idea of me not being in his life. I fell right in to this trap and Im terrified. I don't know if I can have an abortion, I'm still fucked up from losing my second child.
Fuck. Idk what to do.


As of right now, if I am pregnant, I'd like to think about it for a few days. But if need be I will have to cancel my vacation I have been planning since January for next weekend, and use the money I have saved for an abortion...Im just not sure I can bring myself to do it...Fuck....and there is no way I could tell him ever. He wouldn't support it. I know he wants a baby, he was mad one of his ex's had an abortion. So telling him if I abort it is not an option which means 0 support.....or I keep it.....which seems just as crazy.


tl;dr: Ex is pretty sure he came in me after ditching a broke condom and didnt tell me until it was too late to take a plan b. Im a really fertile person. I cant test until next week at the earliest, but im freaking the fuck out.",19,20140516162550,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

This may sound ridiculous simply because rape or sexual assault can happen in a blink of an eye. However, being a New Yorker I sometimes feel very unsafe coming home at night especially since I was sexually assaulted near my house a year ago (17 y/o).


Some girls have told me that they keep their keys in their hand when walking or that they keep pepper spray with them. Others have taken self-defense classes. One girl has even said she messes up her hair whenever she is on a late-night subway ride in order to look insane and turn away any potential predators.


How do you stay safe and alert?

t3_25rflf,"Boyfriend (25M) sees things in the media and constantly tells me (20F) that I would look ""so hot"" if I dressed like that too... how do I take this?","I know that he's probably just trying to be helpful, but I'm sick and tired of hearing this stuff. I told him once or twice before that I dress according to my own style (which isn't unattractive either) and that I appreciate his fashion advice and I might give it a shot sometime. 

Like for example, he's been telling me to wear thigh high socks, colored pants (like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l8CcsKERqNI/T4H6h8qiyGI/AAAAAAAAC-k/aaGJWOgWA10/s1600/mint+jean+options.jpg) or [this](http://forelyse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mint-Sk1.jpg)), super tight sweater dresses in the fall (like [this](http://image.venusswimwear.com/is/image/Venus/Z9893BKWH.22?$ProductPage380x532$)), leggings instead of jeans or jeggings, etc. 

I feel like he's trying to tell me how to dress and it makes me SO fucking mad sometimes because I know that he's just getting ideas from other women he sees in the media/around town. He makes me feel like I'm Plain Jane even though I think I'm not. 

I always refrain from ever being anything but polite when talking with him about the manner. I'm sure he is just trying to give me some genuine advice. But in the back of my head, I'm asking myself ""Why is he telling me how to dress ""hotter""? Why does he think that I need his help? Am I that bad? Am I not good-looking enough?""

It's even MORE infuriating because, truth be told, he's pretty average-looking himself. He's nothing like the men I see in the media/around town but I never fucking ever tell him how to dress so that he looks ""hotter."" 

Whenever he tries on something, I'm always so supportive of him. It's not that I always like his style, either; I'm honest with him so if needed, I kindly let him know if something is not flattering on him, and he always takes my opinion seriously, which is nice. 

Whenever I *DO* try to step out of my comfort zone a bit and try something new, 7 out of 10 times I pick out something, he always just makes me feel like my selection is ""ok."" He's only impressed when I pick out something that he has specifically mentioned would look ""hot"" on me or something of the same caliber. 

SO WHAT IF I LIKE TO DRESS SIMPLY? SO WHAT IF I DON'T LOOK LIKE GIRLS IN THE MEDIA? SO WHAT IF I'M NOT FASHIONABLE? I wish he'd just SHUT THE FUCK UP and be happy with and supportive of how I dress/look! 

I LOVE HIM BUT WHENEVER HE DOES SHIT LIKE THIS, I JUST RAGE SO HARD INTERNALLY. I'M SO TIRED OF IT. And I don't have the guts to tell him all that I've written here because deep down, I know that he's just trying to be nice/helpful BUT HE'S ACTUALLY DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE.",6,20140516205257,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

We live together and are contemplating marriage, so it isn't as if he is just a fling I want to bring on a whim.

t3_25rftj,"Feminism and Men's Rights: Discussion","I have a question, 2X, which has been bothering me for a while.  I identify as a feminist, but as a feminist I also campaign for men's rights.  Gender inequality does not, I believe, affect just the glass ceiling but also the cutthroat, man-up attitude of career driven persons.  I think it has to do with women being perceived as sluts and men being perceived as predators; of women being seen as weaker in all aspects and men being seen as stronger in all aspects, least you be not womanly enough or not manly enough.  However, I've recently come against some contrary opinions, and I'm thinking perhaps feminism is not necessarily the platform that is supportive of both sexes.

My question, 2X users, is: do you feel that feminism and men's rights are compatible?  By empowering men to break from their own gendered stereotypes are we opening the door to more opportunities for ourselves as women and future generations of women, or does this simply take the focus away from women's goals and rights?

I haven't really talked to anyone either, because I feel like theres nothing to say.

As of lately, my appetite has changed quite a bit. I simply just don't feel hungry anymore. The times I do eat, it's because I know that I can't go throughout my day with an empty stomach. However, every time I *do* eat, I get nauseous because I'm literally forcing myself to eat, or I just don't feel hungry anymore. When I eat, I make sure I'm eating smaller portions, because I don't want to waste food that I know I won't end up eating.

t3_25rb3i,"My abortion story.","A little over a month ago, I had a medical abortion.  In the days before, I searched reddit relentlessly reading people's experiences with abortions.  I can only assume a lot of people would do the same if they were in a similar situation, so I'd like to add my experience (and will attempt to limit the emotional stuff surrounding this).

April 10th I went to my appointment at Planned Parenthood for a medical abortion, which is the one where you take some pills and basically induce a miscarriage.  My mother told me I should just go to my regular gynecologist but for some reason when I realized I needed an abortion, planned parenthood was the first thing to pop into my head.  I also kind of preferred going to a place where I didn't know any of the doctors or nurses.  I was already ashamed even before I went through with it.

My visit consisted of a lot of questions about health history, emotional state, and whether anybody was abusing or pressuring me to do this.  Then there was a vaginal ultrasound which, before I was there I told myself I wanted to see it, if I was going to terminate it I could at least face it and see it before doing so.  When the time came, I told the nurse I didn't want to see or know anything.  

They gave me the first pill at the office, and while I'd held it together just find beforehand, as soon as I swallowed the pill I could not stop crying.  Everything in my life logically said there was no way I could have this baby and the best thing was to abort.  Emotionally, all I could think was I was this tiny creatures mother and I was killing it.  It's the most emotionally draining and devastating thing I've ever gone through.  There were two more pills I had to take at home the next night, and I was terrified of the pain.  Almost every story I read was about how utterly crippling the cramps were with a medical abortion.  Girls rushing to the ER, girls laying on their bathroom floor in agony for hours, etc, and I was terrified.  They told me to take ibuprofen and didn't give me anything else for pain.  

The next night I took my own regimen of Tylenol and then ibuprofen starting 45 minutes before I took the pills.  About an hour after taking the pills the cramps started, and honestly I've had worse cramps during my normal periods back when I was in high school.  For me personally, it truly was not bad.  It was mildly uncomfortable, but completely bearable.  Every 30 or so minutes I had to go to the bathroom and could feel a rush of blood and clots coming out.  The clots weren't painful in the slightest, but they were very unsettling to feel coming out.  

After a few hours the bleeding slowed and everything seemed fine.  I went to my 2 week follow up appointment and they said it looked like everything had come out and that was it.  So I went about my life.  

2 weeks after the follow up, I had a couple of days of very light spotting.  No biggie, I wore a pad for those few days because it was really barely anything.  Then one day I was getting up from my last class of the day and I felt this unmistakeable rush of blood.  I got to a bathroom ASAP and saw that the pad was completely saturated with blood and had gotten through to my pants.  I could still feel it gushing out on the toilet and it had even gotten on the floor.  Once again, I was terrified.  I cleaned up (thank god I still had a huge pad from the abortion floating around in my backpack) and went to my car and called planned parenthood.  I told the girl on the phone I was gushing blood and was there a nurse or anybody I could talk to who can tell me if I need to go to the ER or not??  She told me nobody was available, but I could leave my name and number.  I begged her to please just give me somebody who can tell me if this is normal or not, and I kid you not she started going into a whole ""well, as we get older our bodies change, so your body might just be changing..."" speech.  Basically they told me someone would call me back the next day, so I went right ahead and called my normal OB/gyn and they wanted to see me right away.  

It turns out, the abortion hadn't expelled the whole thing.  I still had ""retained products of conception"" and was still showing up positive on the pregnancy test.  I had to have a D&C, which is basically where they go in their and scrape out the whole lining of the uterus manually.  Aside from a C-section 4 years ago I've never had any type of surgery at all, and I've never been under full anesthesia before.

The surgery was yesterday, and I guess it went fine.  I had a really difficult time this week and can't even estimate how many times I broke into tears.  Every single doctor, tech, anybody kept asking the same question: when was your last period?  And I had to tell people over and over what I did.  The only reason I started to get over this is because as time passes I think about it less, not because it gets any easier to think about.  This past week I've had no choice but to face it and think of it constantly.  But anyway, the surgery was fine, it was over before I knew it, I didn't feel a thing, and I've been in no pain whatsoever since.  I regret not going to my doctor originally, but then there's a lot of things I regret.  

I knew that no matter what choice I made, whether to abort or not, I'd likely regret it.  But all I know is the choice I ended up going with.  And I can't stop thinking about if I'd chosen differently.  ",0,20140516195400,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Neither of us wanted anything serious, it was my first ""relationship"" and he was teaching me about sex and whatnot. It was fun, and nothing serious. We never really talked about what we were, and I know I shyed away from talking about it with him, because some part of me knew what he was gonna say. Anyway, we hang out this past week. He mentions he has a date with a girl next week. I played it off because hey, we never talked about any of that shit. Part of me really doesn't mind. I don't feel passionately about him, and it's not like I love him or anything. I see him as somewhere between a friend and a boyfriend, maybe more towards the boyfriend end but without the attachment.

But the other part of me was really hurt. I'm fat. I know I am (but I'm working on it!). He mentioned something about my weight on our second date, more saying hey if you wanna lose weight you'd be able to do more sex-wise (I'm easy, what can I say). It hurt me, and I let him know that. Since it seemed like he wasn't attracted to me so why waste his time with me? But he kinda assured me his comment was meant more as logical, and not as an attack. That made sense to me, since I have a habit of saying things like that that can be taken as offensice when I don't mean it to. Now knowing he's activiley looking for other partners, I find uncomfortable. I feel--- I don't know, used? Like he was doing me a service by sleeping with me and showing me the ropes, but now that someone he actually finds attractive comes along, what happens to me?

Again, it's not like I want to marry this guy or anything. But I liked what we had-- what we have. We saw each other every so often (he lived in a different state, I'm still in college), spent a couple days together, and then when we weren't together, we skyped and texted a lot. Again, it wasn't passionate or serious, it was fun. But I liked it. I'm still in school and am not looking for nor do I have time for a super serious relationship. I just feel like this is like his way of saying ""I'm done"" or ""I've found someone better"" without actually saying as much.

I don't know. I don't know how I feel. I've been used a lot in the past by friends, and I don't want to be used by partners, and I think this might be the path I'm heading down now with this guy but I also don't know if I'm overreacting because I tend to do that a bit as well.... I'm a rather indifferent person- if nothing is very wrong, I'm perfectly content. So maybe that's the problem?

t3_25r2l1,"On working with women who think you're ""scary""","This is a potentially controversial post, but I want to get perspective from other women and their experience.

For the longest time, I couldn't relate to feminist blogs that talked about difficulties in working with men in the workplace. I'm feminist as all hell, but I've had the most trouble dealing with other women, specifically white women. (Before anyone gets upset, I'm also white.) My attitude is more direct than passive-aggressive, more ambitious than uncertain, and while I'm not being Ms Barch in the office, I'm not exactly being Brittany, (I'm probably more of a Jane) and I think it keeps screwing me. The hiring managers everywhere I've worked or interviewed have been white women and I've noticed a trend in how many are passive, calm, speak quietly, smile often, avoid conflict, and will never tell you if there's a problem because it's easier to complain to others than talk to you. I am more the type to ask someone if there's a problem so we can resolve it, I usually get a big smile about how there is no problem, and then word travels back to me within the office about how so-and-so thinks I'm ""scary"". (""My name is Juu Dee. Everything is fine in Ba Sing Sae."" You know the drill.)

After years of being told to show off my passion for the company I was applying for and to list all of my accomplishments and how I can apply them, I realized it wasn't getting me anywhere. A few weeks ago I tested my theory in an interview, submitted a resume with several accomplishments omitted, lower test scores, and spoke in a flat, spacey tone of voice about ""finding myself"" instead of where I saw myself in five years at the company. She thought I was perfect. I got the job. (I accepted another elsewhere.) I couldn't make this up if I tried.

I spoke to a few of my girlfriends about it and while some have felt empowered by the idea of sisterhood, I spoke to enough who said they always had problems with their female managers because they wouldn't play the game. I don't swear or lose my temper ever (at the office), I'm always friendly and respectful, I never use the tone in this post at work (unless I'm chatting with friends), I've had people describe me as ""intense"" but they say it reflects well in my work, but I'm concerned about how many times my friends and I have been described as ""scary"" by female colleagues and superiors. A few have been denied promotions or been the first in layoffs because of this even though their work ethic is superb. I've always felt worried talking about it publicly because of repercussions from other women insisting this was a stereotype and wasn't true, and from men who would use it as an example of how women are evil manipulative bitches.

TwoX ladies, is this anything you can relate to? Am I full of it? Am I right on point? Have you ever had to play passive to get along with other women at work?

I don't really have anyone I could really talk to this about, and you guys seem to be a pretty awesome and supportive community.

About a year ago I started taking Wellbutrin for depression after a (second) bad run with Lexapro. I've had some pretty fantastic results with it when it comes to my depression (still some bad days but they're far and few between) but shortly after I started taking it I started dropping weight. I started out somewhere between 118 to 123lbs (5'1"") and dropped to around 98 which is somewhere around the lower end of a healthy bmi for my height/age, but it's still dropping.

Shit gets serious when your boobies start to deflate, ladies. I returned to a healthier weight after going off meds for a couple of months, but my depression got considerably worse. One hundred and fifteen pounds is a normal, healthy weight, and the reasonable part of my brain knows that, but fitting snugly into what had been my baggy, stay at home jeans for the past six months made me want to cry. 

I know it's probably pretty fucked up and unhealthy, but I still have that voice in the back of my head when I look in the mirror or see myself on cam (camgirl) saying how my legs could be a little slimmer or my stomach could be flatter. It's some body dysmorphic shit and I know it, but I can't silence it either. 

My boyfriend mentioned an eating disorder last night when we were talking. After thinking on it I'm kind of afraid that he could be right and I'm heading in that direction. I stress about my weight a lot, and with work I'm certainly in a position where there are plenty of opportunities to over analyze. 

However, the thought of changing meds after finally finding something that works is a nightmare, and doesn't really solve the underlying problem.

Any thoughts or suggestions on coming to terms with the squishy bits?

Feminism has been described to me as an ideology that pursues equal treatment for all so generalizations should not be a part of a logical speculation. I may seem ignorant posting about feminism here because not everyone who's genitals are inside their bodies consider themselves feminists. I do believe that most of those that do confess feminists ideals are only moderate in their beliefs and Americans as a whole fail to promote gender equality, no matter where your genitals reside. Take this video for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN4sMISyYgk. The ""not all men"" argument is being made all over the place but I believe this argument is obsolete in this scenario. Why do people expect the abused in this situation to be so helpless? Because the person can be labeled as a she? Why do people expect women to be so docile and rarely talk about victim hardening (making it less possible for a crime to be committed against a victim)? What I truly do not understand is why are victims labeled as women seen as more vulnerable to males that are victimized? Rape is a violent crime that happens to all (prison rapes exceed the amount made in the public and the majority of these victims are males) yet many who post in this subreddit see it as a crime that targets women. It has been said in this subreddit that women are socialized to fear men because of the real dangers they face. But isn't this fear irrational and a product of socializing women to be a part of a gender that sees themselves as inferior in terms of strength and capability? Especially since someone labeled as a male will experience more violence in their lifetime than someone labeled as a female. I have nothing against this subreddit but it seems to provide evidence that the marginalization of the sexes through gender is here to stay. Maybe I'm just gender biased and want there to be a single gender with stoic qualities. I'll call myself a gender Nazi for that reason.  ",0,20140517025219,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25si6v,"SOME Men Arguments & Safe Spaces","Reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25q5vs/iff_behold_its_not_all_man/) thread, I thought it might be useful to address how insisting ""not all men"" derails discussion and how this, specifically, relates to safe space.  
  
First, we've gotten caught up in a discussion of women making generalizations about men. From participating in r/TwoX for a long time, I can't think of an instance where someone has said *all* men are blahblahblah. On the contrary, the generalizations I see are about women's OWN experiences. As in, I often don't feel comfortable in suchandsuch situation. Or generalizations about their lives in certain institutions or fields.  
  
So it seems to me that posters are defending the propriety of ""not all men"" statements based on a largely hypothetical situation. I'm not saying it never happens, just that it isn't some huge issue here. This is a red herring issue, but it betrays a common misconception/anxiety that feminism is concerned with misandry rather than gender equality.  
  
What does this have to do with ""safe space"" or a forum for women's issue? It is a common understanding that different spaces on the internet have their own culture, which newcomers need to learn in order to participate effectively. This is common sense, right?  
  
But when it comes to women's issues, it seems that we cannot assume that newcomers will make this effort. I'm seeing a lot of complaining that this sub is unwelcoming. I'm seeing a lack of understanding about derailing. I'm seeing a lot of posts that start out ""as a man."" Now who feels I am generalizing about *them* specifically?  
  
No, this is not a ""safe space"" like a ""safe room."" People can come and go, and people can flame here. What made this place feel safe was that women (and their allies) could discuss issues without being constantly interrupted. If you want to post here without really understanding this culture, perhaps it is time to ask yourself: why? If you think this is the appropriate place to insist on men's representation, perhaps it is time to ask yourself: why?

t3_25swvp,"I need help with dealing this, I'm exhausted by being touched and being held for others poor actions because of my body shape.","Hi 2x. 

I need help. Badly. 

I'm so exhausted of being treated badly for my body. I can't even wear a skirt or dress because of fear another guy will grope me. 

Let me explain, 
I'm 21 and mixed Native American/German. My body is fit but curvy. I have been called a slimmed down Kim Kardashian? Which confuses me because she does not even have extra weight. My face is different but not exotic.

Anyway, I have been offered for modeling and to work at hooters. I turned it all down because I don't want to be considered ""slutty"" by peers or ruin a possible work relationship I will have in the future. I have been hired based on my looks, really. 

I worked at a sub place, and when we got a new manager I was told by the manager, that the old one had already checked ""Accepted"" on the interview forum as soon as I walked in. Just so they could have something easy to look at. WTF. I'm a hard work! I worked 10-10 shifts 6 days a week to make rent and go to school. I quit after managers were hitting on me, spreading rumors, and some coworkers were urging me to report it.

I had a guy on my 17th birthday put his phone under my skirt when I was standing, waiting to be seated at a restaurant. No one said anything to him, but everyone saw! I was so embarrassed. My mom said it was because I was wearing heels and a tight skirt. But it went maybe 3 inches above my knee.

I have been groped on the street wearing jeans and a t-shirt. I told my dad and he said ""some men can't help themselves, it's the way your body is shaped and looks combined."" He then proceeded to tell me that I should wear baggy clothes and sweat pants. 

During my 21st, I thought I was with some good friends. My boyfriend broke up with me because he said I was having fun and he wasn't. He thought I was having fun to spite him since he was in a bad mood and sulked. I was drunk for the first time, and I cried. So my ""friends"" took me to their place, I crash on the couch and their roommate (both high and drunk) kept waking me up and trying to touch me up my dress. I kept telling him no, and tried to move his hand SEVERAL times. I had the courage to wear a dress for the first time in 3 years because my ex swore he would protect me. 

I hate going to gyms, so I exercise at home but it's not a good enough work out. I use to go to a gym but I had guys follow me out into the parking lot a few times, or pull their cars in front of me to get me to talk to them. I was wearing spandex capris and shorts over them with a tight fitting t shirt. I want to see my muscles move with what ever work out I do. Eventually I stopped going.

I don't like being touched at parties. I hate everything about me now. I hate my breast, my ""onion"" butt. My blue eyes. My dark hair. My slim waist. I had looked at one point to plastic surgery for reductions so I can have no curves and wear a skirt again. If something happens to me again my dad can't blame it on my body, people can't say it was because I was showing off. 

I also plan on selling all my pretty dresses/skirts. I use to love makeup, but I'm so afraid of wearing it because I don't want to give anyone the wrong idea. I'm planning to sell my skinny jeans to get sweatpants. I want my body to be my own. I'm ashamed of me.",66,20140517122524,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25t4ax,"sharing my planned parenthood experience.","i spent hours last night reading 50+ threads about abortion experiences, so i am posting my own as a small way to give back and hopefully help someone else the way i was helped.

i'd been feeling kinda weird and gaining weight for the last month, and finally got the courage to take a test yesterday afternoon.  double positive results.  i didn't even freak out; it's like i KNEW that it was going to say that and the test was only confirmation.  of course, i wasn't happy about it and had to take care of it.  i don't want kids (probably ever, but especially not now), and i've been taking the pill for months.  clearly i fucked up at some point, but moving on.

immediately called my local pp to schedule an appt asap - not sure how far along i was, and was paranoid that i was already too far gone to get it done.  the woman who answered the phone was amazingly helpful and nice and gave me tons of info (though my decision was made).  her office only did abortions on friday, so i'd have to wait a week and schedule around work, which was tough.  she then informed me that another nearby clinic had saturday morning (the next day! less than 24 hours!) appointments still available.  JACKPOT.

so i schedule my appointment and start reading reddit/the internet for hours, about other people's choices and experiences.  the medical horror stories scared me off and i was committed to a surgical.  i was hoping i could get at least a moderate sedative, but i didn't have anybody who could drive me.  still not really freaking out or sad, just kind of anxious about the actual pain of the procedure.

got to pp bright and early (7:20am) on saturday morning.  lots of time with administrative and waiting to go back (maybe 45min?).  when they called me to go back, they did the ultrasound and informed me i was about 5 weeks.  this actually made me happy because earlier abortions are easier abortions, and i was super afraid that i was further than i thought.  then back to another room for more waiting.

next step was the counseling bit, where they asked about my comfort with the decision, any pressure or support i had from others, bc methods, etc.  this went pretty quick cause i knew exactly what i wanted.  then they took a blood sample, bp, weight, etc.  then off to another waiting alcove, where they were playing beauty and the beast.  this was the longest waiting - first a wait to get my ibuprofen, then about 45min for it to take effect and get called into the doctor's.

finally get called in.  kind of freaked out about pain, but a bunch of other women had come in and out of the waiting area with no apparent trauma.  got undressed and sat down awkwardly for ~10min waiting for doc and assistant.  doc came in and asked if i have any final questions.  i asked how soon i would know the abortion worked (a little afraid about having to do it all again!), and she told me that as soon as she does her thing, she checks to make sure ""the pregnancy"" was fully removed.  so, all right.  she also told me it would take 3-4min!  so incredibly fast after the 3 hours i'd spent there already.

then she started the actual procedure, which you can go read the scientific details of somewhere else.  it was surprisingly NOT painful.  i was really worried that with only the ibuprofen i would be suffering.  it was some discomfort when she first opened me up (graphic, lol), then a pretty sharp pinch when she started, i guess.  the assistant was holding my hand and rubbing my shoulder the whole time, which felt super relaxing.  i could feel that my legs were super tense, which probably wasn't helping, and tried to relax them.  i was breathing in and out and really focusing on that.  yoga comes in handy when you least expect it!  then they told me it was almost over and i was very happy.  the worst pain was at the end when the cramps started.  i don't really get cramps in general, so it sucked, but they weren't ever more than a 6/10 on the pain scale.  then the doctor left to check for completion and it was over.  

the assistant stayed in while i cleaned up and got dressed again, then they sent me to recovery where i got a heating pad and a lounge chair.  i was feeling some cramps still, but it was more like discomfort than pain.  i had to listen to a 5-minute post-care spiel, and then talked to another nurse who confirmed the spiel yet again.  went to the bathroom to make sure i wasn't bleeding too hard, and then i was free to go.

all i feel right now is incredibly relieved.  from knowing i was pregnant to having it taken care of in less than 24 hours... i think if i'd had more time to worry about it, i'd be more of a basketcase.  but i just feel good and happy right now.  we'll see what the next week of hormones brings.  the one negative thing is that i'm out $500, but that's way better than a baby.",41,20140517135546,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I told him about it, and he was a HUGE DICKSKIN! I've had to get an abortion before, and went through a lot of depression following and told myself I would never do that again… I also told him. He also knew I wasn't on the pill. No tricking him. So I tell him, he's like well what do you wanna do, I feel as though the realistic option is to abort. He's cool with it. I text him a little while later telling him I don't know if I can go through with it. He immediately calls me and starts talking about lawyers and how hellish this is going to be. It feels like he's trying to emotionally manipulate or intimidate me by being like well if you have it I'm going to make your life a living hell, he talked about trying to get it taken away because in the past I dabbled with prescription pills.

Before this relationship I had been single for a long time, enjoyed my alone time and felt confident in being alone. People often say you don't know what true anger or sadness is until it's manifested by lovers and I now believe that to be true. 
It started with confusion and blame. ""How can we be meant for each other if he can make me more angry than anyone I've ever met"" and the like.

It felt like a small win and gave me hope. Maybe he'd plead guilty and I can start working on feeling like myself again. Feeling okay again.

t3_25t6ed,"In the middle of father cheating scandal (serious)","Long time lurker, first time poster! (And last, throwaway)

The fact that my parent's marriage was never a fairy tale was obvious to myself and siblings from the start, confirmed when we realized their wedding anniversary was less than nine months before my brother's birthday... But they made it work, for the family.

My father met my mother in college, but had been dating a woman before. We'll call her OTGA - see if you can crack the code :P

OTGA has been a constant figure in my life, a photo here, a passing reference there, but my parents have been married for 25+ years (dating for four before my mother got pregnant and he became overwhelmed with Catholic responsibility) and have overcome a lot. My father has no clue I know she is more than a fleeting memory (as he is less than subtle when ""sneaking"" away from family dinners to write up inappropriate emails).

Fast forward to a month ago. My dad invited us on a family trip, hooray! First coincidence, it is scheduled when my mother can't get away from work... Second coincidence, it happens to be to the city where this woman lives... 

The trip is under the guise of being a gift for my sister. I ask my dad, ""why would you choose city x? Sister is intimidated by that city,"" (all she ever wanted was a beach and cervesa, this city is capital M Metropolitan) my dad drops casually that ""he is visiting a special friend there, so he will have to leave us for a day or two... or three..."" Inside I am consumed with rage, but we are at an event and that kind of drama is not my style. I play it cool, pretend not to notice anything.

I spend the next weeks wracked with guilt, realizing immediately he is using my siblings and myself only as cover for his visit to his mistress. I have a good relationship with my mom, so the lying is killing me, but the thought of hurting her by telling her is too much to bear. 

I hate being dragged into the middle, and the price of betraying my mother would cost far more than any trip, but if I dropped out my sister would know something was wrong and I don't want to be responsible for ruining her experience. Rock, meet hard place.

Fast forward to weekend after Mother's Day, I promised her a special girl's night out. She confesses that she knows the vacation is a sham, and has known since September when he first told her about his mysterious desire to visit city x and she tore him a new asshole, until he mysteriously suggests that exact city for a special family vacation. I am relieved of my guilt, and we talk at length and end in a good place together (she talks about taking him for all he is worth in a divorce, we toast :P), but I am still stuck spending two weeks on a vacation acting as an accessory to my father's infidelity doing everything I can to not let on for the sake of my sister, who would be crushed. 

Four people, one tiny apartment, and an elephant in a room for two weeks. 

Not sure if I'm looking for advice, or more of a digital shoulder to cry on. Sorry for the long post, and thanks for listening! If anyone has been in a similar experience, I would love to hear your stories.

t3_25teex,"Help me be okay with my disease.","I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome over a year ago.

I went to the doctor because I was having horrific abdominal pain on my right side. The doctor wanted to be absolutely sure it wasn't appendicitis, so to the ER I went. Multiple external and transvaginal ultrasounds later, I learned that I had dozens of cysts on my right ovary, and one of them was over 6 cm in diameter.

After reviewing the ultrasounds, my gynecologist told me that I had PCOS. It hadn't truly manifested itself until just after I quit taking birth control pills. I had heard about PCOS before, but it shook me to hear that I would most likely be having cysts on my ovary for a very long time—unless I tried taking another set of hormones, which I purposely stopped because the cocktail didn't react well with my brain chemistry. Long story short, they made me suicidal, among other problems. Mostly emotional numbness. I have some form of undiagnosed depression or anxiety, or maybe both. I'm not sure. And birth control pills seem to exacerbate it.

I've only recently begun to read into what else this disease causes, and the more I read into it, the more hopeless I feel. The thicker hair growth I have along my arms, eyebrows, belly, and legs; my molasses metabolism and inability to lose weight; the lack of breast tissue, resulting in conical/tuberous breasts. 

Just... all this time, growing up, I thought I had done something wrong, that maybe I hadn't worn the proper bra, and that's why my breasts didn't look like all of the other girls'. I thought it was because I hadn't taken care of myself in some way, that my mother didn't tell me something that every mom is supposed to tell her daughter as she grows up, but it wasn't any of it. It was because of this disease, a hormonal imbalance, and I never developed the way I should have.

I feel so incredibly upset and *cheated* that I was handed this in my slew of genetics. I'm 5'1"", 155 lbs. with bad knees and an arthritic spine. I can't run to lose weight, I can't stand up for extended periods of time without my lower back feeling like someone's drilling into it, and I can barely reach things on my tip-toes. I have to take medication to keep my body's hormones under control so it doesn't cause me extreme pain, and I should probably be taking medication to keep my head in check, too, but I just don't have the time or the money to find a psychologist right now.

Others with PCOS or with PCOS and depression—how did you come to terms with what you have? How did you find a pill that worked to control your body without controlling your head? How did birth control pills and depression medication interact?

I'm at a loss. I've tried so many BC bills for this, and I've reacted poorly to all of them. I'm starting to run out of options and out of hope.",2,20140517155742,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25sy4h,"Today's Feminine Mystique","The recent post of a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFdWcNJ17YY&feature=youtu.be) from Louie got me thinking. I've also been reading the [Feminine Mystique](http://www.amazon.com/Feminine-Mystique-50th-Anniversary/dp/0393346781/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400348331&sr=1-1&keywords=feminine+mystique) recently. (You should all read it. If nothing else it might give you some insight into how your grandparents grew up and lived) And I've been thinking.



If you're not familiar with the ""Feminine Mystique"" (summary [here](http://www.enotes.com/topics/feminine-mystique)) it's the concept, laid out in the book of the same title, that women are defined only by their roles as wife and mother, and never have an individual identity as a person. Among other things, the book runs through the history of how the women's rights moment somehow lead to the housewifery and (often voluntary) sexism of the 50's and 60's. Within chapter 5 and 6(ish), Freidan talks about how popular media of the time including psychologists, sociologist, marriage counselors, and magazines laid out that a woman's highest achievement was child-rearing and her highest quality was her passive and genteel femininity.



It got me thinking about beauty, and how we view female beauty today. And I'm not talking about the trashy magazines that say ""Bikini-ready in 10 days"" and ""Stars' beach bodies, page 6"", though those are by all rights a horrible message to be spread so pervasively. But what about things like Dove's campaign for real bodies and blogs on the internet that espouse ""fat can be beautiful too."" I see these sorts of attitudes and campaigns emerging and it's lovely that there's a movement to expanding our societal concept of women's beauty.



But perhaps we're missing the point, at least a point. The feminine mystique and all the views of its era says: ""All a woman can ever do or want to do is be charming and beautiful"". Today that's not the case. We encourage women to be astronauts and engineers. But it seems we also encourage them to be beautiful. Campaigns and commercials like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpaOjMXyJGk) seem to tell women that you must see yourself as beautiful. Like beauty has transformed not from the only thing a woman can have, but it still lies in the must category. Why does women's beauty seem to be equated with value? Even in their own minds. A commercial like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDMXvdwN5c) wouldn
t be effective or moving if beauty was just something like ""good at math.""



Maybe we still have some problems to fix. Yes, there's more to beauty than the photoshopped girls on cheap magazines, but why do we as woman need to maintain this complex that we must be beautiful? Why does it hold so much power over us? Why do we need to go on campaigns telling ourselves that even the fat, the flawed, the disabled are beautiful and see scenes of women breaking down and crying at their changed conception of themselves? Why should physical appearance still have a strangehold on our sense of self-worth and societal value? It just seems to me that maybe we're campaigning a little too parallel to the feminine mystique of the past. What do you guys think?

Edit: Awesome comment from /u/animousity692 to remember:

I (F/mid 20s) have this unexplained vaginal discharge. It's white, doesn't really smell bad, and is pretty constant. I haven't had this much discharge since puberty - needless to say, this is not normal for me. Also, my inner labia are noticeably swollen. This has been going on for at least three weeks. 

I saw a doctor, and was tested for BV, yeast, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea, and everything came up negative. I had some minor abdominal pain (unrelated to my menstrual cycle) so I asked to be tested for a UTI, which also came up negative. I'm also not pregnant. 

The doctor told me that the increased discharge could be because I have a new intimate partner. I doubt this, because I haven seen him in weeks. She also said it might be an allergic reaction and advised I wear cotton underwear (FYI, I literally don't own underwear that isn't cotton and never have). The doctor then sent me on my way. 

I'm really frustrated. This discharge is starting to piss me off. I haven't changed major anything about my diet or started any new medications. My detergent is the same, and my shampoo is one that I've used before with no side effects. The only body-related thing I've done in the past few months was get the first round of the HPV vaccine. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? What did you do? Right now I'm planning to ask the doctor to check me for cervical cancer and refer me for allergy testing. ",0,20140517094812,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I'm almost 30. I haven't peed or pooped myself since elementary school. 

But today I was in Walmart just picking up a few things. I didn't even have a cart. As I was standing there debating if the $1 a piece slotted spoons were actually any better than the $1 pack of three when I felt a little rumble and pressure. I noted that I need a bathroom soon but thought to myself, ""I'm just gonna be a few minutes, I can make it home."" I decided on the three pack for a dollar. I grabbed them off the hook and took a step to turn around and head an aisle over to grab a new shower mat. But I didn't make it. I was immediately thrown into panic mode. 

I don't even know how it happened so fast but before my left foot had hit the floor my butthole was puckering so hard it clearly felt bad for what it had done. Chunky, slimy, wetness filled up my crack and traveled all the way around to the front. My panties were soaked immediately and I could feel it starting to drip down to my upper thighs. I dropped my dollar utensils and started walking as normally as one can when trying to hide that last nights chicken curry is in their crotch. I realized I was super lucky to be wearing a black dress and not jeans as the slime headed quickly down my legs. I made it to my car, deciding that a public bathroom was not properly equipped to handle this, and grabbed a stack of papers that hadn't made it into the shredder at work for the past two months. A lady in the car adjacent stared at me as I arranged them on my front seat so as not to ruin the breathable leather. 

I drove twenty minutes home, waddled up the drive way, and trashed the now neon yellow papers on the way to a scalding hot shower.

t3_25u3ft,"I went off hormonal birth control and everything was great, until my skin exploded 4 months later.","Hey everyone,

I don't really know why I'm posting this but I've been crying all day about my skin. I haven't struggled with acne for the past 5 years. When I did struggle, it was BAD. 

I went on the pill to help with migraines and it seemed to, so I stayed on it. It had the added benefit of clearing my skin which was great. 

After a few years, and many different brands of the pill, I decided to go off it to normalize my moods, deal with my depression and just be prescription free to see how my mind and body function in their normal state. 

Everything was great. I was less moody, happier, less irritable, I lost weight and for the first 4 months my skin didn't change much.

Until two weeks ago, when it exploded (not literally). Pimples everywhere. Big ones, little ones. Overall texture was just bumpy and awful. 

Before anyone plugs skincareaddiction, I used to work for a major cosmetic retailer as. a full time skin consultant so I know my skin care. This is not the kind of acne that a great skincare routine can fix (I've tried). I have a GREAT skincare routine, but it won't touch hormonal acne very much. 

I'm frustrated. Very much so. My moods are better but depression is taking a hold because I hate my face again. I barely want to leave my house anymore because I feel disgusting. 

I refilled my old prescription for the pill today and im just staring at the box wondering if I should do it again. It's the lesser of two evils at this point but if I wait it out will my hormones balance and my skin go back to how it was even last month? I just don't know..

Has anyone had this kind of experience?

t3_25tl9g,"Really need advice on deciding whether or not to invite boyfriend's mother to babyshower.","My SO and I are having a baby in September. We're not sure if we want his mom to be inviting to the baby shower that my mom is hosting. 

Reasons to not invite her: 

1. She's been psychologically abusive to her spouse and my boyfriend for his whole life. Example: Giving away stuff my boyfriend had bought himself and his clothes. Telling him how shitty he is daily. Demanding he pay rent when he was 16. She tells everyone that her husband is her meal ticket, but he doesn't care. She's also been arrested twice for domestic abuse against her husband. Punched him and went at him with a knife. One time she thought my SO turned the air conditioner down, so she punched him in the chest and screamed at him. 

2. She's had multiple outbursts directed towards me. Example: When we announced that we were getting an apartment together, she cried and screamed at me that I was a bitch who was stealing her son. Wouldn't let him get his clothes or anything out of his room. 

3. She usually has outbursts at family gatherings. Actually, I cant think of a family gathering where she hasnt had an outburst. Example: For easter we went to eat at grandma's house. My SO's brother, billy, called and asked if we were eating yet. Grandma mentioned that his mom was there (billy doesnt have contact with his mom.) Billy said he cant come then because in his custody papers it says his kid isnt allowed near Billy's mom. Something Billy's ex did when Billy's mom got arrested. SO's mom freaks out, starts cussing at grandma and her husband, and starts walking home. 

4. In social situations she makes everyone uncomfortable and says/does inappropriate things. She makes sex jokes all the time. Today she met my dad for the first time and said ""she's having OUR grandbaby. Thats what I tell everyone. We're the grandparents."" At her dad's funeral, she was extremely loud the whole time. In the middle of the service she'd say something like ""oooh look how pretty the wreath is!"" When she met my younger sister (who was 13 at the time) she was trying to convince her she doesnt do drugs the whole time she was talking to her, and kept rubbing her head and shoulders even though my sister was noticeablly uncomfortable. This is not really that big of a deal to me, but it does contribute to the fact that I don't want her at my baby shower. If this were the only reason I didn't want her there I would invite her anyway. 

5. She has issues with nearly everyone in her family, and I want to invite our grandma and Billy and his girlfriend without there being an episode of family drama at my babyshower. I could call the police and have her escorted out of the babyshower, but to me that would ruin the day and also make other guests uncomfortable. 

The only reason my SO still talks to her is to see his dad. He said if his dad didnt live there he'd never go see his mom again. She definitely has mental issues (which she's getting help for. She's had to go to therapy since she got arrested and committed into the psych ward), and I feel bad for her. I can deal with the fact that she's blown up at me multiple times, and though she acts like my best friend sometimes I'm not sure how she really feels about me. But at the same time I don't want any issues at my babyshower.

I just started taking Microgynon, it is a 0.15 mg Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg Etinilestradiol split. I have never been on this particular BC before, but I have been on others. I have never had acne in my life, just pimples/zits from time to time. Since I went on this pill I have broken out all over my face, even on places I never had zits before, like on my nose and around my eyes. My skin is also crazy uneven, my foundation doesn't cover well, as if my skin is a different color. I am concerned. 

I read online that Seasonale (the same chemical split) causes your acne to get worse for the first month sometimes and when people have waited until the next month it cleared up and their skin even got better. 

So, this is my question, has anyone ever been on this medication? If they have, has anyone had the same experience as I have? Even if you haven't, does anyone have an idea if I should tough it out and wait another month before switching, or switch right away?

4 1/2 years ago my beautiful mother (41) went out to the bar which she NEVER does to celebrate her birthday with her friends. That night she met a younger man (29) and spent the night dancing with him. That night he drove her home and they sat in the driveway for **four hours** just talking and laughing - I don't sleep much so I spied a lot of the time to make sure no naughtyness was going on. - At this time the sun was coming up so she gave him her e-mail (she got drunk and lost her cell, good job Ma! I remember my first beer.) and told him if he got bored to e-mail her. I was up and she was twirling around and was ontop of the world telling me about this mystery man. 10 minutes later she checks her e-mail and in her inbox was a love note. Something along the lines of ""I had one of the best nights of my life with you, I'm not sure if this is too quick but I need to see you again."" and from then on they were in love. 

We'll call him Bryan. Bryan NEVER wanted kids and it took him 5 months to meet my brother (at that time 20) and I (at that time 17) and he instantly loved my brother and I and we loved him. We did everything together and if we weren't together we were sending eachother goofy text messages. My brother moved out and my mom, Bryan, and I built a house together. I became his daughter and he became the best father i've ever had. It didn't matter that we were kind of close in age, if he met someone he introduced me as his daughter. Not his girlfriends daughter, but his even though him and my mom never actually got married. We've even had talks about him walking me down the isle one day, my kids calling him papa, everything. 

Well on Friday May 2nd he was watching TV with my mom when he got up, looked at her, and said:
Him: **""I can't do this anymore.""**
Mom: ""What are you talking about?""
Him: ""I can't do this."" 
- he starts to leave - 
Mom: ""Please, Bryan, tell me what's going on."" 
Him: ""I want kids, okay? I want my own family. I need you and Kelsey to leave."" 
Mom: ""Where did this come from, Bryan? What's going on?"" 

So he packs a bag and leaves. He tells my mom he's staying at his best friend Shawn's house and we don't hear from him. As the time goes on he starts missing us. Asks to come eat with us, asks to sleep at the house, etc. It's gotten to the point where he keeps just begging for my moms attention. He even sneaks into the house and crawls into bed with her. On the 16th he cried to my mom and told her how much he loved her and wanted things to work but there just wasn't something there. Welp, come May 17th he falls asleep in bed with her again and she hears his phone go off. It's another woman texting him. She reads through his messages with her and they date back to the begining of this year and I guess he's been dating her AND bonding with her very young son. 

**My mom is crushed** 

She runs into my room and gives me his phone and my heart sinks into my belly. They're saying they love eachother, he can't wait to see her and her son, they're talking about dinner, they're talking about things a family talks about. This is even before he ever ended things with my mom. I can't breathe, i'm shaking, my mom is sobbing.

**so I call her.** 

She answers and is very confused since it was now 130AM and technically the 18th. I tell her how Bryan is in bed with my mom and just cried over her and still says he loves her. She's confused and sounds annoyed but won't really talk. Won't admit to how long they have been dating despite me saying I saw their text messages, won't tell me anything. It was a 10 minute conversation but it felt like forever. We hangup and I have my mom clean up and get into bed and told her to follow my lead. She gets into bed and I barge into their bedroom and it goes like this:

- flips on light - 
Mom: ""Kelsey, what is it?""
Me: ""WAKE UP BRYAN.""
Bryan: ""Huh? What? What's going on?""
Me: ""I just got off of the phone with your GIRLFRIEND.""
Mom: ""What? What is she talking about Bryan?""
Me: ""Yeah Bryan, why don't you tell my mom about VERONICA."" 
- At this time he puts his hands behind his head and he has a sarcastic smirk on his face and he's shaking his head and staring at the ceiling. - 

He won't talk to us despite me sobbing and screaming at him. How he was MY dad and how much I loved him and how much he royally fucked up. 

He won't talk.
He won't even answer a simple question.
He put on a hat, shoes, and left my mom and I in the middle of the road and didn't look back. 

My mom is broken... we're homeless now. When they first started dating our house got foreclosed on and her credit was screwed from there. I'm only 20 and have no credit. No apartment will take us and we can't afford a house. I'm making more money out of the 2 of us. We have family but they aren't in a good situation either. We're still staying at Bryan's house but now that this happened I don't know what we're going to do....

I work in a large new store with tons of customers behind a counter with several other people, so I am never alone with anyone. 

We don't have a dress code, but I dress very conservatively at work. No cleavage, knee length skirts or longer, and flats, plus I usually wear black tights (when I remember to wash my dang tights). 

Today, one man asked for my number when I asked if I could help with anything and called me beautiful several times, then asked if I was told that I was beautiful often. I turned pretty red and tried to laugh and said something like ""haha, nope! not while I'm at work!"". He was with someone else (I think his mom?) and didn't actually need anything from my counter, but it went on for several minutes while I couldn't leave my computer. He was mostly laughing and being silly, but it put me in a really tough situation.

A second was very polite and not as persistent. He told me I was beautiful while I was helping him and I awkward-laughed and said thank you and that was that. 

It's embarrassing because it happens in our small work space where everyone can hear, and there is no graceful way to let them know that I'm uncomfortable / it's inappropriate / I need to get back to work. I REALLY don't want to embarrass them or make them feel bad, but I also worry about giving someone the wrong idea by being too polite and then running into them in the parking lot when I'm leaving. 

Basically, thus far I've just laughed it off and said thanks and hoped that was the end of it. I've definitely not been harassed, and no one has made me feel unsafe or uneasy, it is just an uncomfortable situation that seems to have no good / safe response.  

I know there's no use worrying about something that hasn't happened yet, but in the past, I've had men ask me if I have a boyfriend, why I don't have a boyfriend, why I don't leave my boyfriend for them (if I make one up) if I want to be their girlfriend, ask if I'd give them MY number, what time I get off, etc. I've also had people track me down via facebook and send me long messages (which are easy to ignore because I'm no longer at work and obligated to respond). This hasn't happened at this job yet. 

I'd love to hear any experiences with this, or advice on how to respond better / something to say in those situations so they stop but aren't upset or embarrassed. ",36,20140518045357,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Today, we are celebrating two major things: our sons second birthday and the arrival of our daughter coming home from the hospital. It's a truly wonderful time in life, and I should be celebrating.

But under all the joy, the stresses of real life continue, and are grinding me down.

My wife, usually very supportive and utterly wonderful, has started to become more irritable as her pregnancy continued. I know most of that is hormones, and also she was a little pre occupied with creating life, but she started saying some pretty rotten things to me, things of never dream of her saying. Name calling, swearing at me, and in general acting as if anything I say, or not say, is a direct affront to her. 

I pride myself in not being the stereotypical male that so many people out there embrace. I'll stay up with her or one or the babies until early in the morning and then go to work early to make enough money to let her live her dream: being a stay at home mom. 

I want to be there for her, I want to support and proved for her, but when she says that my ""I love you"" sounds hollow, and that I'm acting like an entitled Man. 

I don't know. Maybe this isn't the right place for this, but I'm pulling my hair out. I love her, and I know this will pass and I know she doesn't mean what she's saying, that it's her body being totally out of wack right now, but it's killing me to hear the person I want to spend the rest of my life with saying things designed to hurt me and make me angry, then I feel guilty about getting frustrated.

OK, so my problem is that my friend's younger brother likes me. He flirts with me all the time; I flirt back. I'm a nearly 25 year old female and he's nearly 20. I think I am very susceptible to giving in because it's been over a year since I've even kissed a guy. I am really craving that kind of attention, but I haven't met anyone that makes me feel this sexual since my breakup. In other words, I think about jumping his bones. All. The. Time. I would act on it if I let myself, but I would only want a friends with benefits sort of arrangement and not anything serious for reasons stemming from our obvious age gap. And I just really don't want to be in a relationship right now. A part of me feels like this is a pretty messed up thing to want from someone who is my friend's younger brother. I would want to minimize the risk of drama or ruining our friendship.

tl;dr: My friend's attractive younger brother really likes me (I'm female) and I only want him in a physical way. If he wants me in that way too, and I'm pretty sure he does, how should I handle this situation ethically? As of now, I haven't discussed anything with his sister (who is a strict Catholic and doesn't want to lose her virginity before marriage) and if I do, I would want to minimize the risk of drama or ruining our friendship.

t3_25ufm7,"A Different Approach to Misogyny on Reddit","I recently did a little bit of digging into some of the more misogynistic subs on reddit, and came to some interesting conclusions.

I think its reasonable to assume that the majority of contributors to these subs are heterosexual men, and I can't help but feel sorry for them. I think everyone know how horrible it feels to be lonely and how toxic hate and anger can be, and these men are consumed with it. 

Can you imagine loathing roughly 50% of the population, but simultaneously being attracted to them? Hating an entire group of people so much that it leads you to say horrible hateful things, but at the same time crave their attentions, affections, sexual intimacy and more?

I find it stranger still that I am somehow able to empathise and sympathise with these men - although generally not for the reasons they seem to want it. These men hate women for a reason. Maybe not a realistic, logical or even comprehensible reason, but I'm sure that they have reasons nonetheless. 

Again I'll generalise about contributors to these subs. I suspect that many of them either feel that they have somehow been wronged by women, or they have been raised in (or exposed to) an environment in which hate for women is normal. This just makes me feel more sorrow for them. Its entirely possible that some of these men have been genuinely wronged by women, and lets face it, there are unpleasant women out there, and most of us have had to deal with one at some point. Not everyone has the benefit of having largely positive experiences with women, so its somewhat unsurprising, almost understandable that these men are angry.

I in no way condone any of the horrible things these subs say, but I'm beginning to think that they actually play a really important role in online communities such as reddit. These subs give men who are angry, a place to vent, a place to communicate and a place to feel safe. 

I want to believe that most men who participate in these subs only participate for a fairly short period of time, most likely when they are trying to work through issues that they have with a significant woman in their life. These men will eventually realise that being consumed with hate and anger is unhealthy, and will eventually walk away from such a toxic environment. The remaining few who are long term participants have probably been so damaged by negative experiences (real or perceived) relating to women that they are unable to let go of the anger and hate, and they need help, tolerance and compassion.
 
I consider myself somewhat feministic. I believe that society would be better if there was greater equality between the sexes and that people should be respected, admired and rewarded for the quality of their character, their deeds, skills, talents and abilities, and not based on gender. I'm in no way a supporter or proponent of intolerance, so please bare this in mind when you read the below.

I think its time to try a different approach to misogyny on reddit, and I think that 2X is the perfect place to start. I think that instead of fighting  misogynistic vitriol with aggression, righteousness and outrage, maybe we should try responding with compassion. So with that in mind, this is my message to any misogynist who feels the need to read this:

'I'm sorry you feel victimised. I'm sorry that you feel that you have suffered at the hands of women. I cannot imagine how difficult your experiences have been, and I am sure that you are in a great deal of pain. It is my hope that you read this message and know that not all women are horrible, in fact, I hope that eventually you come to see that the majority of women (like the majority of men) are good people, who are simply living their lives as best they can. With that in mind, I hope that you find the help that you need to overcome your hate and you pain. Until then, I hope that at the very least you will attempt to contain your hate to subs created for such discussion, instead of directing it at women who have not wronged you.'

I encourage anyone who has been the victim of misogyny on reddit to respond in a similar way where possible (threats etc should never be tolerated). Lets not give these people the satisfaction of seeing us get angry, hurt or upset, instead give them only compassion, because at the very worst it will frustrate them, and at best it will give them the opportunity to reconsider their behaviour.

  This is a little hard for me to explain, but I'll try to be as simple and clear as possible. 
 I feel like I'm going from maidenhood to womanhood. Let me give you guys some background here:

  I have always been TERRIFIED of childbirth and pregnancy, and just womanhood in general...I never understood it. I never could accept the fact that my body is made for the sole reason of bringing another human being into the world, it disgusted me. 
  My fears come from a number of different things in my past: I was raped a few years ago, I was in an abusive relationship with my ex-boyfriend, I was bullied by all the girls in elementary school, and I was abused by my mother as a child. I was always told (and shown by Hollywood) that childbirth is horrifying, painful, degrading, and traumatizing. I've also been shown that women are often raped, assaulted, and treated like objects quite often.
  As a result of all of this, I've always resented my body and femininity. I've been ashamed of being a girl because of what consequences come with it. I never saw it as a gift or something wonderful, I've seen it as a hideous burden.

  Anyone reading this may be wondering what being raped has to do with this, and it has been the catalyst to what I've been going through recently. I had repressed the traumatic memory of the time I was raped in my mind for years, with the help of booze and drugs. Once I got clean nearly 5 months ago...my mind began to clear. Memories came back...my mother beating me and psychologically torturing me. The teasing I endured as a little girl by my peers and even teachers. My ex-boyfriend taking advantage of me, emotionally and sexually. It all came back to me in vivid detail. Along with the memory, my repressed fears of womanhood/childbirth resurfaced also. I was devastated all over again. I have spent these last few weeks sobbing, screaming, shaking my fist at the sky cursing God. I have been consumed by fear. I have been afraid to have sex with my fiancee because of what happened. Every woman I've seen I can't look in the eye, because suddenly any female just seems so alien and foreign to me...especially pregnant ones. I am afraid to take a shower because I will be naked...and the feeling of the cold breeze on my naked skin brings me back to that horrible place. 

Anyway, with both the PTSD and the phobia of childbirth and pregnancy mixed together, I found myself in the middle of a strange sort of identity crisis. I didn't know how in the world I was going to heal...how I could possibly get over my fears. With the help from my therapist and my wonderful fiancee, I found that healing started with an attitude change. I decided I had to change my perspective on becoming a woman, one fear at a time. Recently, I've started with pregnancy, and the natural duty and obligation of a woman's body being a vessel for life. 

  That phrase I read out of one of my psychology books...""a woman's body is a vessel for new life,"" I felt the cogs and gears turning another direction in my mind...suddenly, an unborn baby in my body went from an alien-like parasite, to something the man I love the most and I created by our love for each other. My body suddenly feels like a warm home, getting itself ready for that one day that the time comes to keep our little one safe and cozy, instead of a host or an empty shell. The idea of childbirth no longer seems so violent and dramatic like they show us on television, but just another strange, weird process that our bodies happen to perform. 

  I think about that baby I'll have one day, I can see his/her eyes looking up at me and my future husband for the first time...seeing our child created by our love and struggles. I want to give that little one the life and kindness I never had.

  Yesterday, I was stark naked in front of a mirror, and I looked at every single inch of myself. I'm a woman now, a beautiful creature. 
  It was cold in there, but it didn't bother me in the least bit. 

 Sure, I'm still scarred by my past...by all those horrible memories. I still cry. I still feel detached and numb sometimes. But I finally feel like I've accepted what I am: a woman. ",13,20140518143158,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I know that the point is that he is not making time for me. However, I do care about him.
>

He literally bailed on me 2 weeks ago on his only off day, and because we couldn't catch each other, he suggested a break because if not, we were (probably) going to break up. **Now I regret not breaking up** - particularly because I feel like he's flirting with other people in the mean time (from afar, of course). 
>

Now to preface this - he totally pursued me and thinks that I am amazing (or he bullshits that I am amazing). I really did feel a connection and although at times, he's distant at work, we click in person and even on the phone/skype. **I love putting myself out there for him and finding that he feels the same about me. But when I don't find him there for me, it gets much harder.**
>

Last but not least, I just saw a super flirtatious comment from a girl on one of his social media accounts. I know I'll sound like a crazy paranoid ex when I say this, but when he bailed on me, he was stuck in the city she is located at. They like each other's face shots on social media frequently in the last couple of weeks. And I don't even know if I *want to* know if something happened.
>

I don't know what to say to him when we talk.. I need advice, or even better if you can tell me if you were in a similar situation and tell me how it ended up. Sometimes the biggest risks are worth taking, but only when you trust the other person, right?

**TL;DR - Guy I recently started dating asked for a break after (in my calculated predictions) he bailed on me to perhaps see another girl who flirts with him on social media.** **Don't know what to feel about it or what to do about it.**

I also could not be pregnant unless I'm like five weeks pregnant, as that was the last time I had sex and I've had my period between having sex and now. Also, I always use condoms.

My (20F) boyfriend (27M) has OCD. His compulsions have caused some problems, but we've (for the most part) been able to work through them. 

Near the start of the relationship, I had to make my feelings known about some of his behaviors. 
He shaves off all of his body hair. I have a head of curly, thick hair and often shed. He is constantly picking hairs off of me and him. He is always making comments about my ""mane"" “hairy monster” or ""woman fur"", but it's usually said with a smile, so it never bothered me. The first time we were intimate, he was appalled by my body hair and asked me to remove it. (it was a spur of the moment thing and I was kickin it oldschool...) Again, not a big deal. That's probably very common in relationships. If he sees a stray eyebrow hair on me, he will pluck it. Same with arm hairs or skin on my face. I feel like he's always picking at something on me. He tries to squeeze blackheads if he sees them. I have very dry skin and it's something I've always been sensitive about. Him pointing it out always makes me self conscious. 

He begs me to let him vacuum my apartment (I live with 5 other girls and things get hairy fast) but the one time I let him, he spent the entire time complaining about the hair, and sent me pictures of the hair in his vacuum. It made my roommates uncomfortable and they asked that I not let him do that again. 

He asked if he could brush my hair every day to get the stray hairs out of his room. I said no. 

He doesn’t allow sex in his bed. We have to do it on the floor. Which I’m sure is also very clean. Sometimes he puts a paper towel down.  We were planning a weekend where I’d spend the night (he has roommates too, but they’re very chill) but ultimately he decided it wouldn’t work because I couldn’t shower in his apt, and I couldn’t spend the night and not shower. 

Despite being a generally unhealthy eater, he is very self conscious about his weight and appearance. He is 6'2 and weighs about 135 lbs. I am 5'8 and weigh the same. He constantly makes comments about the weights of my roommates or girls we see. Girls who are my size, sometimes smaller. I asked him if he wanted me to lose weight and he said it didn't matter to him, he would be attracted either way. He constantly touches and plays with my butt. He says he loves it because it's ""big and squishy."" No girl EVER wants to hear that about her butt.  I hate it. I feel like a fetish sometimes. 

This makes me sound fat, sloppy, messy and hideous. I am not any of those things. I just feel that way when I’m with him. 

His words are good, but his treatment of women in general is horrifying. He slut shames all of his exs, his roommate's girlfriends, and women he knows nothing about. We had a fight and i asked that he not use words like ""slut"" or ""skank"" to describe anyone. He apologized and agreed, but he still slips up quite often. His homophobia is a whole other issue that probably will not be resolved. Very early into the relationship I told him how much it hurt me. He apologized and went right back to throwing around “fag” and “dyke”. When I protest, he calls me a “PC hipster” and things like that. 

Last night we got in a fight because i told him that i didn't feel wanted sexually, and that's very important to me. I told him i felt like I was always initiated, and that I wanted him to see me as more than just my butt. He said very little about this except ""It's hard when the woman you love feels like you see her as a piece of ass."" 

Today he refused to see me because he hadn’t showered yet. I told him I didn’t care and he said that It was important to him and I needed to respect that. I can do that, it just hurts.

There are so many wonderful qualities. He’s so giving, so helpful. So snuggly. He’s casually mentioned marriage a few times and I think he’s serious. 

I’m not 100% on what I’m really asking here. I thought about posting on r/OCD so I could get some input on how he thinks, but his OCD is a part of him and he says he likes the way he is, so I just don’t know. 

Tl;DR My boyfriend has OCD and it makes me feel like trash. How do I fix this?

It wasn't planned, and we'd kind of talked before and I'd made it quite clear that we wouldn't have sex. I wanted to sort of save myself until college at least, I guess. While I am technically almost in college, I almost feel..cheated. 
I mean, I'd told him to slow down if things get too wild because I tend to just go with the flow and can't help it. And he said he would. 
Even then, somehow one day, we ended up doing it and I didn't really stop him so I don't know if I have the right to feel this way. And he honestly cared for me throughout and made sure it was a good experience for me, and he asked me several times after if i was okay or if I felt forced. I said I didn't but I kind of freaked out later, not that it would make any difference.

t3_25x9e8,"People were complaining about ""consent workshops"" at my uni, so I wrote an article about it.","I'd love to hear what /r/TwoXchromosomes think. Basically the situation is the Women's Campaign have pressured the student union into hosting consent workshops. Feminist stories have been met with criticism in the comments section of the student newspaper, The Tab. So I decided to write this.

**The FemiNazis are getting us to do consent workshops now.**


**Hostility to feminism is unfortunately popular in Cambridge.** But the cries of “Feminazi” are sadly ironic, because this is not a women’s issue. Stanley Milgram used his famous social experiment to suggest that Nazi officers were not warped people: they were normal people who committed evil because of the urge in every human being to follow social convention. With this in mind, a perspective needs to be shared. Lad culture threatens to blur the line between social convention and assault. It is men, not feminists, who must confront this head on.


**But why are these workshops needed in the first place?** Do people really believe all men are lecherous perverts who need a good talking to in order to keep their man parts tucked in? Well, no. And hopefully the Women’s Campaign doesn’t either. The aims of this are to tackle lad culture, and stop victim blaming. Legitimate goals with legitimate reasons for pursuing. Firstly, victim blaming is rife. Remarks such as, “People drink themselves into these situations,” and “It sounds like she was definitely kissing back,” are not uncommon, especially on the Tab. Even if these viewpoints are valid in some situations, they’re not going to help us deal with sexual violence. That much should be obvious. Remarks such as “Why did he do that?” “Why do so many men think this is acceptable behaviour?” “Why do men keep abusing women?” These are the questions that will get us somewhere. And it needs to be men asking other men. We need unabusive men to challenge their friends when they say something misogynistic. Instead of laughing along, shouldn’t we oppose it? Shouldn’t we say, “Hey that could be my sister you’re talking about. I don’t appreciate it?” Only when men lose social status amongst their friends for being misogynistic will we start to see meaningful progress. Only then will the harm of lad culture have ended.


**And let’s be clear: lad culture is pernicious because it has arisen out of a desire for social status.** It plays on men’s insecurities and doubts about relationships and popularity. It is not the twisted reality of a parallel universe where Robin Thicke is Equality minister and Katie Hopkins is Women of the Year. It is the logical conclusion of an ever pervasive (and quite wrong) belief that girls are not interested in meek, accommodating, “nice” men. That lacking sexual experience is tantamount to being a social outcast. That in order to be sexually successful you have to be a “dick.” The past articles on the Tab on lad culture and assault have illustrated these situations are rarely clear-cut. Questions such as “If she’s coming home with me, does she want me to make a move?” and “How drunk is too drunk?” have no one-word answer for all women. To some people (for reasons beyond my comprehension), drunk one-night stands are something to choose, want, and enjoy. They might be a small minority, but they exist. But for others who do not give their consent, it can be unacceptable and traumatic to even try. This highlights that a judgement call is needed. In that grey area, lad culture encourages men to make their decisions based on the likelihood of sexual and social gain instead of the wishes of the people involved. When men get these decisions wrong, that’s when assault happens. To address this, men must learn to be conscious of consent as much as their social status.


**But you might still be wondering why these workshops are to be compulsory.** I believe the answer is simple. This is not an issue about being sensitive to the “plight of women,” stuck between the oppression of a male dominated society and the patronising goodwill of some sympathetic male protectors. This is a leadership issue. When a public figure is found guilty of sexual assault, they don’t need to be more sympathetic to women. They need leadership training. They have failed in their leadership. Although by this point it’s already too late; they also probably need to go to jail.


In Cambridge of all places, the leaders of tomorrow should understand that consent is the foundation of our non-Nazi society, and that challenging social convention is vital to this. I do not know whether these consent classes will be any good, but I do think I understand something about why they’re needed. It’s our responsibility as men to support them.

t3_25x6ep,"I'm too damn nice.","Hey TwoX,

I'm (21f) looking for a little advice to keep me out of uncomfortable situations that I've got myself into for being... too nice? I think my personality comes off flirty because I'm smiley and chatty with everyone, so it probably comes off as flirty with guys.

I was always under the impression that boys and girls can be friends but it's got to the point where I realized that every friendship I've had with a guy has either turned into a relationship, or the guy has wanted it to turn into a relationship and then it gets awkward. Even when I preface it with ""I ONLY WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND AND WANT NOTHING MORE FROM YOU"", it still happens.

Do I just avoid friendships with guys? Do I risk coming off as a bitch and be straight up with them from the start? It's a pretty integral part of the way I interact with people in general so I don't want to shut it off, but maybe there are tips or boundaries I can set up? (The problem with setting up boundaries at the beginning of a friendship or whatever is that I feel like I'm being presumptuous and think they'll be into me, so I don't because I give everyone the benefit of the doubt...)

--------------------------------------------------

This is something I think about now and then. I began considering this as a teenager and now that I am nearly 34, this is popping into mind more and more. 

I love my mom. She was a good mother when I was growing up. She wasn't perfect but she is only human and I acknowledged that. She wasn't an addict, nor was she abusive, nor neglectful. She can be very funny and she laughs easily. She loves animals (as do I) and is great with them. 

But I've always felt a disconnect between us. As I grew older, I noticed how some of my gal pals would hang out with their mothers, or go shopping. These days, many of my female friends my age hang out with their mothers when they can, which I notice thanks to social media. I'm very happy for them but seeing this also makes me wistful.

Outside of animal-related activities (like horseback riding lessons together), my mom and I didn't hang out when I was growing up. We went shopping a couple times and while it was fun, it also felt forced to me. These days, my husband and I visit my now-retired parents a handful of times a year (they live about an hour away from us). I enjoy the visits but they are also stressful because I feel like I need to adapt to my parents' expectations of me each time. Yes, even at nearly-34.

As my parents grow older,  however, I find myself wishing that the disconnect between my mom and I wasn't there (there is no disconnect between my dad and I). I've tried to chat with her like I would my friends (but on a more PG-13 scale) and she will usually end up disagreeing with me on one topic or the other, then taking it personally when I state why I feel differently about this topic. It doesn't matter how gentle I am in my approach--she claims I've ""hurt"" her so I just back away and give up. 

As a result my encounters with her feel kind of hollow and  many times I don't know what to say to her. We can only discuss our cats so often! A major thing I wish she would tell me more about are her parents and any family history she knows, so occasionally I will ask her about these topics over email which gives her time to respond at her leisure. But that's the closest we get.

Is it truly the norm to be such good friends with your mother, as it seems from what I've seen with my friends?

t3_25ytrq,"Just looking to vent to a receptive audience.","Yesterday I failed miserably in a promise I made to myself a few months ago that I would stop arguing with stupid people on the internet.

I commented on an article about a feminist student group that advocates placing trigger warnings on assigned readings in schools. The general attitude of the kind and tolerant subscribers to r/news was that this was a ridiculous attempt at censorship.

So I was a fool and shared my own experience. My younger sister was raped by her ex and his friends while I was in college. A few months later during a class presentation on the Nanking Massacre, I had to excuse myself after being confronted by a really graphic image of a dead rape victim. If someone had simply said ""The next picture depicts a dead rape victim"", maybe I could have kept it together. Or maybe I would have still left. Regardless, I would have been a little better prepared.

Some lovely and considerate man decided to let me know that I was invalidly reacting based on an experience that, essentially, is not my own. Further more, that I was a child and that the world would ""obliterate me"". 

First of all, I'm 25 and a completely independent adult, and as far as I know, I have not been ""obliterated"". Second of all, I of course realize that I was not raped. My sister was. Whenever I think about it, I am enraged at how improbable it is that I will be able to strangle the life out of her rapists. I am ashamed of myself for failing to keep her safe. I feel hollow, disgusted, ect. ect. 

It's still not easy to think about, but you know, 2 months after it happened I was having a really hard time dealing with it. Is it really that outrageous that the immediate family member of a rape victim would not want to look at pictures of sexual violence while they were still in the process of coping? Apparently!

Fuck that guy.

Edit:
I just want to articulate that I by no means believe I have PTSD as a result of my sister's rape. It may be difficult to imagine how rape effects family members, but there are tons of support groups out there for that specific reason, so I am very confident that the grief I experienced was entirely normal. 

My initial point was not ""Look at me, my sister was raped and it made me sad, so now everyone should be sensitive to my feelings!"". I was trying to contribute to what I thought was a conversation about how the emotional and social impacts of sexual violence should be dealt with in an academic setting. Are trigger warnings the best way to deal with that? I don't know, but based on my own experience it could be helpful.

FINALLY, it's not even the fact that someone would disagree with this opinion that resulted in my angsty post. I think it's pretty fucked up that I can't have this conversation without being told that the emotions I had at the time couldn't possibly have been bad enough to warrant any sort of mitigation beyond me growing a pair, or that I am just looking for attention or something. I seriously could care less if someone feels that way about my little story. I care more that this seems to be a very widespread reaction to assertions that rape is a hugely negative thing, in general. The sad thing is that the chances that anyone who feels this way will eventually be proven wrong when someone they love is raped are not in their favor.",46,20140519144417,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25yec0,"Adults can be the worse (about casual sexism)","So I just graduated college this weekend, and yesterday I had a graduation party to celebrate. My mom invited a ton of her friends and our neighbors, so I had to spend a good amount of time doing my polite rounds, having pleasant conversations and telling them about my future plans, you know all that bs.

At one point I mentioned last week, in order to get my degree in English, I had to write a 20 page research paper. ""What on?"" I was asked by one woman. Ahh...I feared the worse. My topic touched on feminist topics, and this is not a polite, delightful conversation topic. ""Oh, it was on the representation of female friendships in Women's Films and how their problematic"" I replied, purposefully not mentioning my thesis being ""and how these friendships are defined by and at the whim of patriarchy.""

And that's when the casual sexism begins.

The woman laughed. ""Well, my husband has a theory that women can't really be friends with each other until their in the 30s,"" she explained. ""Before then they're just competing with each other, over jobs, over boys, you know, that kind of thing.""

""Yes, but do women compete with each other because that's how we are as women, or because we culturally teach women to treat each other that way?"" I replied. She tried to deflect answering the question directly.

A man heard us too. ""I can't speak from personal experience, since, you know,"" he says, hiding his distain for the topic behind his sunglasses but not being able to resist giving his opinion. ""But my daughter only hangs out with boys now because she says girls are too much drama.""

""That's funny,"" I said, deciding to give my anecdotal evidence as well. ""Because I have a close group of girl-friends and we've pretty much stopped hanging out with the guys that used to be in our group because THEY are too much drama."" He avoided replying as well.

I guess the reason why this whole event bothered me so much is because, well, this is why I wrote that paper in the first place. I wrote about how these movies gave barely any credit to inter-female relationships and how they can be important to a woman's life, and instead these movies focus on the obsession over woman-to-man romantic relationships that are all too often unequal in their power structure. And the reason why I thought that was important is because I didn't think it just appeared in movies, but in real life as well. And I was given proof of that right before me. I am extremely close to my girl-friends and we've helped each other so much, but here I have one woman telling me that she assumes that these friendships can't be real because we're still in our 20s and 'haven't gotten over our competitiveness,' and I have a man assuming that these girl-friends only add drama to my life, and only friendships with men would avoid that. 

I guess it also bothers me because this was at the celebration of my college graduation, meaning that in some ways I'm now in the 'adult world.' And these are the kinds of conversations I have to look forward to, apparently.

Sorry for my rant, guys, hopefully you'll relate~

(also I want to make clear that I don't think that male-to-female relationships are impossible or aren't important, or that I avoid them in my life. Personally, as of late, I don't have many close guy-friends, but this is not an active choice. I just feel like culturally we undermine female-to-female relationships, which bothers the hell out of me, but I have nothing against male-to-female relationships in comparison)",2,20140519121340,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25y3w0,"Can we talk about the 'Not All Men' meme?","Fundamentally it's meant to be about having faith in a person making an argument, that he or she aren't making any sweeping generalizations. And it's about posts that derail that argument by talking about anecdotes or a unique account of an event. But I don't feel like it's used that way in practice.

Oftentimes, when people say ""not all men"" they're responding to a post that comes off as though it stereotypes men. It's not a statement about one or two men who don't fit the description - it's a statement about men in general, and it's backlash against a post that seems to marginalize significant groups of men by talking in apparent universals.

I think the latter case is justified. If someone makes a post that talks about ""men"", unqualified, it's their responsibility to make sure it's understood if and when they're referring only to a -particular- group of men. And if they weren't sensitive enough with their language (and this is something one needs to be extra-sensitive about), they shouldn't get to balk at someone who criticizes either the tone of their post or the message about men that it seems to imply. 

In practice, with the rising popularity of this meme, I think people are getting too eager to call someone out on a ""not all men"" argument, and they don't bother making the distinction between the latter and the former. So a post that comes off as legitimately insensitive gets defended by it just as well.

The pros are that it seems like I know then and there it was effective in terminating the pregnancy (is this true?). Also, it would be less painful/disruptive and quick. It's just that it kinda makes me nervous to sit here and do nothing but wait for 2 weeks to take care of this issue.

Ultimately, I'm torn between the two because I want to get this over with as soon as possible but I also want to know it's done for good when I go through with it.

Can anyone help me? Thank you so much.",0,20140519142911,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25yvht,"I just need to be told it's going to be okay.","Two years ago, I met a very special boy. I was 18 when I went on a two week Holocaust based trip to Poland and Israel and I met a guy named R* and over the course of the latter 9 days of the trip, we started to fall for each other. I know, commence eye rolling. But on that plane ride home, we basically decided to start a long distance relationship (him on the east coast and me on the west). Seeing as it was three months away from the start of college for both of us, we obviously had lots of people telling us it was a bad idea. But you know what? It was one of the best years of my life. We flew back and forth a total of four times and it was unreal how fast we fell in love with each other and started talking about our future together. 

We broke up a year into the relationship because of me; I'm a very affectionate and physically oriented person and it was getting too difficult for me to be in a relationship and not be able to touch him and still have it feel tangible. Once the break up happened, he backed away for a bit. I still wanted to be close because I still believed in a future together. He still wanted that future but he was too afraid it wouldn't end up happening. Slowly, he started coming back and we resumed a relatively close friendship. We've had this going on for the last year. 

Two weeks ago, my moms friend's friend randomly lets it be known that she is looking for a nanny for their kids to fly with them to THE VERY CITY R LIVES IN for 2 weeks while they go on daytime business trips. I'm a very big believer of things happening for a reason, so I let R know and he was incredibly excited to hear this. We started talking even more and decided that we would engage romantically with everything except for the relationship label. At one point I got scared and asked him about what would happen after I left. He told me that he likes to deal with that when it comes so that we can enjoy it while it lasts.

My first day in his city was last Wednesday. I saw him during the evening and we had a great reunion at first but for some reason we were arguing about little things a LOT. Later on, after we'd been intimate, I started getting very emotional about the uncertainty of our futures. About how I desperately wanted him in mine and/but would feel guilty to fall for someone else and want a future with them etc. He was nothing but reassuring. The next day, I saw him again, and the weird arguing was back and by questioning why it was there, I opened what was to be the enormous can of worms. 

I could tell her was more irritable and impatient than he normally is and I asked him why. That launched us into a conversation about how ""people change"" and ""maybe we're too different now"" and yadda yadda but I eventually got him to open up to the real reason instead of giving me bullshit ones cause he was too afraid to tell the truth. 

After the emotional conversation we'd had the previous night, he kind of got freaked out. He became afraid of not being able to live his life because he'd always be in love with me and comparing other people to me. This has absolutely been my life for this past year; I was in a wonderful relationship but I was literally afraid to let myself love that person. And so he said he needs to let me go for now romantically and that we can't see each other anymore in a romantic context for the duration of my trip. He said that he thinks there's still a ""substantial chance"" that we will be together at the end but he can't close himself off anymore for the sake of his happiness.

The reason this shatters me so much is because for so long I've felt and seen a beautiful future with a wonderful man who was my best friend while we were together. We were incredibly compatible and wanted the same things out of life and talked in such detail about the future we would have. He even told me when he'd propose to me. And now, that's gone. Please don't get me wrong- at the end of the conversation I told him through tears that I thought he was doing the right thing, because I want nothing more than happiness for him. This isn't me trying to wrap my claws around him or bemoaning his selfish ways; I support his decision. But it completely blindsided me and now I find myself scrambling to erase him from my future in order to protect myself from the very real chance that he won't be in it. It HURTS so much to have to force myself to erase a future that was so certain and wonderful. I feel like no matter what, nothing will ever measure up or even if it will, I'll always find myself wondering ""what if"". The fact that I only get one life in this universe and he may very well not be in it is scaring me so much because I never want to have regrets in my life and even though I don't know what I could have done differently, I'm so afraid that the loss of a future with this person from my life will be one I can never get over. 

I don't know what to do or what to think but now I've got a week and a half left in this place and all I do is nanny two babies and desperately try not to cry in front of them. The reason this is so devastating to me is because this isn't just a breakup with someone really cool, it's the loss of a future I was so sure of and happy with. One of the worst parts is how he is capable of seeing alternate paths in his mind- with one of them including me. But now I don't think I can allow myself to see that anymore in order to protect myself. I find myself needing to completely erase the idea of us being together at all in order to heal. But I don't know if that's the right thing to do. I just don't know. I needed to rant and cry and if any of you have inspirational or wise words, they would be so so welcome.

My last two period have been TINY. Normally, I'd have one for about 4-6 days, with the first two being a competition to see how many pads I can go through in one day, and the next couple of days everything calming down. The color changes are like a regular period: bright to dark. 

However, my last period was more of spotting over a span of 3 days. The first day was still the brightest and the 3rd was the darkest, but there wasn't really anything there. I barely needed a pad. 
I thought: ""Alright, no problem, we'll see how it is in a month.""

Same story. Maybe an ounce more of everything, but I'm basically having the same thing:

Bright, but small, first day, and now (the second day), it's a bit darker, but still. More of spotting than a period.
I don't know whether it's a hormonal thing, a pregnancy thing, a nutritional thing, or what. I want to rule out pregnancy, because I've only just lost my virginity a month-and-a-half ago, and since then, had sex maybe 3 or 4 times, where he came. But there was always a condom and it always got tied up and thrown away at the end.

Is it normal to sometimes not have much of a period?

Then my boyfriend's dad said something about how everyone already knows, and she started yelling that he watched porn with my boyfriend.. so I guess that's sexual abuse? That was all the detail I got. Im not sure if he actually touched my boyfriend or how old he was at the time.

After his parents were done arguing, his dad said he needed to talk to him in private. They talked for maybe ten minutes and then my boyfriend came back and sat by me. I asked him if he was okay, and he was like ""yeah I'm fine!"" like whatever they talked about or whatever happened was no big deal. 

I dont think his mom is lying, because his dad was going along with it and saying how much he regretted it but couldn't change anything, etc.

I have no idea what all happened, if it's as bad as it sounds, how old my boyfriend was or what. I don't know what to do about this. We've been together for almost five years and he has never said anything to me about it. Should I talk to him or leave it alone?

If I should talk to him what should I even say? 

We have been having issues in bed, and he has self esteem problems, but I dont want to assume that it has something to do with being molested... but there's also a chance that whatever happened greatly affected him. I don't know what to do.

I spent most of Saturday experiencing severe cramps and therefore laid around most of the day.

My OBGYN said that I would experience cramping for a day or day and a half after insertion but not longer than that. I'm three days out now and I'm still cramping a lot.

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced cramping that have lasted longer than what their doc said?

And what does perforation feel like? Or how do you know if something's not right?

This may sound really petty, and I'm getting a little annoyed with myself for being peeved about it. I've known my best friend for 13 years. I don't get to see her much any more (I moved out of our home town 4/5 years ago) but we text almost every day. She's like a sister to me. 

She's getting married this weekend. It was a pretty whirlwind decision and at first it was only going to be her, her boyfriend, and two witnesses, then having a bigger celebration next year, but it soon developed into a wedding with just close friends and family. My boyfriend and I are going and we were (..are) really looking forward to it.

She always maintained that this would be a pretty simple affair, no big deal, just a 'casual' marriage. She didn't even plan on having a dress. It's now gone to the complete opposite end of the scale, and she's got the dress, a car, the full works. She didn't tell me that she planned to have bridesmaids, there was no mention of anything at all. She'd always said that I'd be one of her bridesmaids when she gets married, and she'd be my only one (as I have zero girl friends where I live now). I saw on facebook (cue sounding like I'm on Jeremy Kyle) that a girl I know posted on her timeline saying 'I am in love with my bridesmaid dress'...hello legitbabyseal14's shocked face. I had to try so hard not to cry! How pathetic.

I asked her if she was having bridesmaids and she said she's decided to buy two of her friends bridesmaid dresses, saying to me 'you wouldn't have been able to try it on, I'll get you one for the next time' - completely ruling out any possibility of me coming down for a weekend to try it - which you know what, I would've done. 100 miles of distance wouldn't stop me going to try something on if she wanted me to be a part of her day. It's just like she's not even taken into consideration even asking me, just ruling me out straight away.

I got a bit upset, I valued our friendship...I still do, but I'm feeling a bit put off by her now. I don't want to be a bridesmaidzilla, I'm just glad I get to see her get married, albeit with gritted teeth when I see her two friends in their undoubtedly gorgeous dresses. Am I being out of order? My boyfriend has been supportive and he seems to think that she's been a bit wrong in this situation.

But it's never been a full blown crush, and on an few that are more 'intense' it's generally because they seem to be a genuinely nice person, so it's more like 'Awww they seem nice, wouldn't it be nice to meet them?' 

I never went through a 'boy crazy/girl crazy' phrase and I'd say the whole thing was kind of low on my radar like when I was in primary school and about 7/8 I think and people were moving onto 'crushes' and 'boyfriend/girlfriend' stuff I wasn't interested (whilst academically 'bright' and apparently slightly advanced I think socially I lagged behind a bit), like I think some vague 'Oh a realtionship would be nice' stuff came through when I was about 16. 

I'm not really sure on my orientation, because of the 'never had a proper crush' thing means there's not a clear 'Oh I like xyz' to go with.

It's not a huge issue but I think it might be over the long term. We've been together for 2 years now but lately I've noticed that my boyfriend's mother has a really low opinion of women, particularly women my age.

I should preface this by saying that we get on brilliantly, she's almost a surrogate mother to me at times. But in her job she deals with a lot of young women who make poor decisions (trying to vague this up as much as possible) and so seems to think that the same is true of me- or at least that's the impression she gives off at times.

Last night she was giving us advice on our housing situation and she basically said that if there's a problem, look for the woman. 

Because women are really the only ones who cause issues... /s

The actual situation has nothing to do with the woman involved, but it really got to me that she instantly went to that.

He is probably the least weakwilled person I've ever known so I don't know why she assumes that's likely.

t3_260axr,"Rant: India","Let me just preface this by saying that I am an Indian woman (by descent, I was born and raised in the states).  

There's been a big hullabaloo in the media fairly recently about India and rape.  Inevitably, these stories get posted on reddit, and certain recurring tropes get entrenched in the collective consciousness.  I'm just gonna list the stuff I take issue with.  

**1)** First off, there's the claim that India is somehow ""rape central"".  Statistically, this is false (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#Rape_statistics_by_country).  

A common counter-argument to this is the idea that there might be a lot of women not reporting rape incidents, or that a lot of rapes might occur in underpoliced areas.  This may well be true, and definitely deserves more investigation, but the argument used is very specious.  You're essentially saying ""India has a lot of rape"" because ""it might have a lot of rape"".  In addition, it discounts the complex issues of underreporting in other countries, and only focuses on India, as if this problem is unique to the country.  

""Then why do we hear about so much rape from India?""  Well, maybe it's because the country has fucking 1.2 billion people in it?  I mean, that's more than the entire population of the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan combined.  

**2)** Then there are the accounts of staring.  Staring is rude, yes.  Men like to look at women, and in the west, we expect them to do this discreetly.  Personally, I have never noticed a problem with staring when I've been to India.  My guess is that some portion of these reports might be due to the novelty of seeing a non-Indian?  

There's also the possibility that maybe, and I really hope this isn't true, but maybe, some women feel, on a subconscious level, more threatened by men of color, and are therefore a lot more likely to interpret things like normal looks as ""stares"" or ""leers""?  I don't mean to discount the concerns of women, but the concerns of people of color are just as valid.  

**3)** Double standards - basically going off of the last idea; nobody really makes a huge deal out of groping in Japanese trains (but they should).  A German accent is seen as sexy, an Indian one is seen as creepy, etc.  Things like this further lend themselves to a more ""subjective"" interpretation of things, which scrutinizes certain ethnic groups under a more discriminating lens.  

**4)** Shaming Indian men.  I've personally encountered this once:  I was having dinner at an Indian restaurant with a (white) girlfriend of mine, chit-chatting about classes and such, when she declared what a shame it was that she couldn't eat Indian food more often.  When I told her she could easily find ingredients at local Indian-oriented groceries, she replied, under her breath, ""Yeah...but it just feels so creepy there.  No offense.""  

When I questioned further, she was unable to explain why (""The guys are just creepy!"").  I'm sorry, but this just seemed like blatant racism to me.  

**5)** It takes a local phenomenon and turns it into a nation-wide one.  Nearly every rape case I've heard about has come out of Delhi, maybe a couple from Mumbai.  These are two cities in India.  America isn't full of crime simply due to Detroit and St. Louis, and India isn't full of rape for the same reasons.  

Of course, nobody sees it fit to generalize all of America as being reflective of its two worst-offending cities.  But, somehow, we end up generalizing India that way.  Kind of akin to how ""Africa"" is perceived as a country.  

**6)** It ""excuses"" western societies.  One of the most oft-repeated tropes in the ""India rape"" threads is how great the U.S. is in comparison, at upholding womens' safety.  Often, these comments will ""exempt"" the U.S. from criticism.  ""Feminists should focus on the *real* misogyny"", ""Say what you want about us, but at least we're not *India*"", etc.  Yes, white western men are perfect and don't ever rape, or sexually harass people.  Feminists should quit feminism and rally against INDIA, because after all, that's where all the rape is, except not.  Ugh.  

I'm anticipating a lot of hate for this, but let me just reiterate that I am NOT excusing rape, and I am NOT excusing the objectification of women.  I recognize that India is still corrupt, and has to make a lot of progress, but the situation is not even close to what most redditors make it out to be.  I'm merely pointing out the unfairness, and possibly very racist double standards that are sometimes used in discussing them.

t3_261i1l,"I am not ashamed of my abortion. [venting]","Recently I tried to give advice and comfort to one of my friend's now-pregnant teen child. I wanted to give her insight into my experience and let her know that no matter how alone she felt, there were always people around that can empathize and show love. The reaction of the people around me blew my mind.

It is appalling to me that when I talk about my own experiences, others around me feel like it should be something I keep to myself.  ""Why would you tell people?"" they say. Why?? Because keeping it a secret and acting like it is something that we should not be talking about only affirms the misconceptions that it is wrong and you should be ashamed of your decision. Well you know what? I am not ashamed.   ""Well you just didn't have enough information or know what you were doing at the time."" Are you freaking kidding me?? You have no idea what i did or did not do and I don't appreciate the judgement.

I got pregnant at 16. The fetus was conceived from a date-rape with someone I thought I trusted.  I was intoxicated, and could not tell him to stop. I never told anyone, and at the time I blamed myself. I kept it from my family, but the rumors started to fly at school and it made it back to them.  My family is ultra conservative and was pro-life to this point. My father made it all about him.  ""How could you do this to me?"" At the time, I felt so guilty for 'putting my dad through this,' but I have since changed my outlook and allowed my true feelings to emerge.  Screw him.  I was a young girl, and in a position I was barely capable of understanding.  I was frightened, nervous, sad, angry, and all he could say was ""how could you do this to **me**?"" My mother was a little more understanding, but couldn't dare show it due to the nature of my family.  Either way, they asked what I wanted to do. 

I wanted to get a surgical abortion (medical abortions were not available at the time).  By the time my family found out, I had already done every bit of research I could.  I had looked into adoption, read about pregnancy, understood the process of abortion, and I had already made up my mind.  There was no way I would be able to take care of a child, and I knew it. I was well informed and took many nights to decide if this was really the right thing for me.  It was not a rash decision or one that I took lightly…even as a child.

""You're killing my grandchild,"" my father said when I told them my decision.  **YOUR** grandchild?!?! What about it being **MY** child? 
No matter who is pregnant, or who you are talking to, it is all about them.  It has everything to do with what *they* would do in the situation, or how *they* feel about it. And this goes for the people to which I share my story.  But you know what? I am not ashamed, and I will never quit talking about it. We all need to know that while making the decision to have an abortion is hard…there is no right or wrong answer. I made the right decision for me, and I have never regretted it.  Is it sad? Yes.  Do I think about it every day? Yes.  Do I wish I would have done something different? Not at all. 

**EDIT:  Thank you for all the supportive comments. Nothing anyone ever says will cause me to feel bad or shame for the decisions I have made, and I am glad to know there are others that feel the same.**",1637,20140520113021,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

It is an unique situation and talking to girls I know did not help that much.

Also, I don't even know if I should be the one talking to her about this. But, I can see that she is always flustered and uncomfortable whenever we are outside and wanted to help her out. So hear me out please. 

Forgive any grammatical errors as English is not my native language.

I lost my elder sister and brother-in-law in a car accident four years ago. My mother became my niece's legal guardian after that. Now, my mother is getting old (70+) and her health is not always peachy so she asked for my help, around six months ago. I always visited them over the weekends and mom asked me if I can move in with them permanently.

I adore my niece and she is my favorite kid in the whole world, So naturally I said yes and moved in with my mother.

I drive her to school everyday, we go shopping/movies together. If she wants to talk to a woman she always has her grandma around.

So here's the problem. When we are outside men stare at her and make her very uncomfortable. I have to admit I did not even recognize that she was uncomfortable until that day when she just clung to my arm and wanted to get out of the park. I didn't even know why. She did not want to talk to me about what made her so uncomfortable. I was able to identify the problem when we went to movies one day and caught some high school kids staring at her and she became uncomfortable and wanted to go back home. I honestly wanted to punch those kids but by the time I looked for them they were gone. 

I checked with my mom and my niece hasn't talked to her about anything at all.

What is the best way to talk to her about this? Is there a solution? I just want her to enjoy and have fun when she is outside and not worry about the pervs and creeps out there. Wish my sister was still here to help her daughter out or at least talk to her.

t3_2611yx,"I can't figure out whether my coworkers hate or like me. Please help?","Hey TwoX, I'm a 20 year old young woman and I work for a fairly small office. The women I work directly with are both older than me (20+ and maybe 35+ years).

This is my first time working in an office environment (been here for 2 months), so I'm trying very hard not to screw it up by learning as much as I can, doing as told, etc. 

What bothers me is that these two women (the ones I have to directly deal with every day) are confusing the hell out of me. They both act very friendly towards me at some point during the day, but it just doesn't feel genuine and it makes me uncomfortable. I've always been well-liked at all of my previous jobs, and I've never felt this ""fake"" friendliness coming from any past coworkers/bosses. It feels ""fake"" because as soon as I open up to them, these women find a way to indirectly tell me how much better than me they are or how wrong I am. Despite this, I always smile and take in their advice and find myself actually trying to figure out what's wrong with what I'm saying or how I'm acting, but I find this strange because I've never had to question myself so much before.

I find this ridiculous as they are much older and this just seems like childish behavior, it feels as if they're trying to compete with me by showing me that they're right and I'm wrong. They also seem to get very annoyed and upset when I ask for clarification on how to do certain things that they've NEVER explained to me before (these things need to be explained because these ladies have very specific ways of doing things around here, so they can't possibly expect me to know this stuff). I also get very mean death stares, as if I did something to purposely hurt them. They also don't make me feel very welcome or as a part of the team. For example, they all talk and joke with each other, but always seem to exclude me. That doesn't bother me as much, but it's just something I've noticed. I also can't help but notice how much my boss (the woman I interact with most) excludes me from their group. For instance, she is always going out of her way to ask all the women on our side of the building if they'd like to order any food (they all order together for lunch, or if she's going to the store) and never asks me if I want anything. I don't know how to feel about this (not that I should expect her to consider me in any way), but why not ask me as well? I, too, am an employee and I do all of my work, I'm always nice to her, I do literally everything she asks of me, so why exclude me so much? 

There's another girl of my age that also works here and they all love her like family, and I'm not asking for the same, but I feel as though this shows me that my age is probably not the problem here. Therefore, I don't understand what I'm doing for them to dislike me. Also, all of the men around here are very friendly and they all try to help me even if I don't need it. Some of the ladies from the other side are also nice and don't seem fake, however I don't see them very much.

I really, truly like this job, but this is getting to me. Is this normal in all office environments, or am I completely out of line here? Am I expecting too much? If any of you have similar experiences, please share! Thanks",30,20140520084041,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

My boyfriend (29) is the best man I've ever met. He is loving, doting, faithful, smart, interesting, funny, sweet, a great communicator, fun to be around, active, has wonderful friends and a close and amazing family, and he's as handsome as they come. 

I (28) happen to also think I'm pretty great, and share many many of the same qualities he does. We've been together almost 2 years and living together for 8 months. Boyfriend and I laugh together, we (make) love together, we cry together, we stress together, and we talk. We don't argue or fight really. Friends all agree we're great together.

What's the problem? 

**He's Christian and I'm not.**

(I'm nothing and prefer not to even say Atheist or Agnostic.)

*It doesn't come up in day-to-day life*: we both try to keep a lid on it - he doesn't regularly go to church so it doesn't come up every Sunday either. He is 100% a believer in Jesus Christ being his Lord and Savior, though, and he prays (like really, really prays a lot about everything) and thanks God and feels blessed every day. He had a very very rough childhood and I don't begrudge him his beliefs at all. They bring him peace and love and he doesn't use them as a weapon against anyone or anything, so I very much respect his personal brand of loving God and Jesus, although I don't share it. In other words, he is very much a firm/strong believer, and not at all ambivalent or light-handed about it.

*It comes up when we talk about our future.* Whether we could marry. How we'd raise our kids. What would happen as we aged, grew old, and died. We've pondered not having kids. We've pondered not getting married, and just going on with our day-to-day. I've told him I can accompany him to church (we've gone a couple times). I can hold his hands as he prays. I can continue to respect and encourage his emotional and religious growth. But I just don't share it. 

We've been having rough talks lately and it came to a head last night when something in him finally clicked and he got the notion that our relationship is a trial, and Satan knows him so well and has tempted him with me and my dis-belief (he loves me so incredibly much that he considered for a teeny tiny second, abandoning his faith/turning his back on God), and all the sudden it is so very clear to him that he cannot marry and have a life with me if I do not believe. 

*He wants me to believe.* Part of me wishes I did - things would be wonderful for us, and maybe I'd get some of the peace and assurance that his beliefs bring him (and I could certainly use another source of strength/calm/love in my life). But the other part of me really truly does not believe and cannot wrap my head around faith and the concept of God and Jesus and there being one right religion, etc. I've never felt lost or empty or alone, and have never had a desire to be saved, found, or any of that. I cannot fake it, either. 

Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone been through anything similar? Should I try to become a believer by surrounding myself with it, and just see what happens? Help.

**TL;DR: I could have the man of my dreams and continue living our wonderful life, if only I believed in and loved God.**

I was told that if I go in the pool, I would have to wear a large, baggy tshirt, and that I wouldn't be able to tan myself in my bikini. They said that because their husbands would be there, they didn't want me wearing anything except ""a trash bag."" I've laughed off most of their comments but finally asked if they really thought so little of their husbands, to which they responded, ""no one wants to see Baywatch running around when we are all covered in stretch marks and McDonalds marks.""

I love them to death, but sometimes I don't get the feeling that it's reciprocated, and obviously that hurts. In the beginning I thought it was normal, it was obvious everyone needed some time to adjust, and it did improve over time, but there is still some friction at certain points.

Actually, the two boys are adjusting just fine, but the girl is only partially. 
In the beginning she gave me a really hard time, and the fact that she had an oedipus complex, only made it worse. For the people who don't know this, I put the link below, but it boils down to the fact that she saw me as 'her adversary' in a battle that was going on in her mind for the love of her father. And before people start to question this, this isn't just my opinion, it is the collectif opinion of me, the father, her biological mother, rest of the family etc. and has been professionally diagnosed.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex

Anyway, quite some time has passed, and it has seeped through to her that it IS possible for her father to love both me and her, but she still really likes to be difficult about the stupidest of things, just for the sake of being difficult to me.

a) How do I react best to this behaviour? and
b) What suggestions do you have to bring our family as a whole tighter together? I've already started doing family nights once a week. That is an evening where we don't turn on the tv and just play boardgames and talk together! :)

t3_2622uf,"He still thinks abortion is murder, so we came up with a compromise for our ""what if...""","I don't know if this will be an unpopular opinion or not but I just wanted to share my side of the tough abortion talks.

We are both 22 and live together.

I'm on birth control. Lately, my boyfriend has been wanting to use condoms out of this extreme fear that my pills aren't effective. I personally don't like condoms, but I understand his fears as there is that 1% chance.

This led to our talk of what we would do if there was an accidental pregnancy. I know we are both too young for kids (in our opinion), and I have worked with children in the foster care system. It is not something that I, in good conscience, could subject another child too. Therefore, since I started having sex, my logical opinion has always been abortion.

I didn't know this, but it freaked him out even more and made him adamant about using condoms. He didn't want to have to put us through making that decision.

A couple days later, we finally have another talk where it comes out how uncomfortable my ""plan"" made him. While he understands my logical stance on it, he does not believe he could emotionally detach himself from it feeling like murder. He said it would eat at him forever.

This hurt me, as I never believed my opinion to be bad, but I thought about it for a day or so and came up with our compromise.

I would be willing to put a child up for adoption under two conditions. One, we picked and got to know the chosen family during the pregnancy. And two, it was an open adoption so that I could be a small part simply to ease my mind that this child was being treated appropriately and in a loving home.

He was much more comfortable with this idea and last night was one of the most loving experiences I have ever had.

I guess I wanted to share this to say that, even though we have varying opinions on the matter, we can still compromise and love each other. Giving up my plan A was a little difficult as I don't want to entertain the idea of going through a pregnancy, but in the end it's about making a decision that both of us can live with.

I think women who have had abortions are strong and I'm glad they felt able to make the decision right for them. In this case, I want to make a decision right for both of us.

Broke up and got back together, cheated on each other quite a bit to ""get back at each other"", I went to a local community college instead of going off to a big state school where I had been accepted in order to stay closer to him, etc., etc.  The usual dumb stuff you do when you are in a first love, high school relationship.  Only problem is, I stayed with him for 5 years after high school, on and off, on and off. I know... Nooo!!

One of the things that really gets me thinking, ""Oh my God, why didn't I ditch him for good after that?"" (and there's quite a few), is the following scenario: 

Some background: I think this was about 7 years in.  He got really mean when he drank hard liquor. 
 
He barbequed and had been stumbling all over the house knocking things over and being a bohemith all night.  He stumbled into the bathroom to pee and I followed him as I had nice, breakable decor in there.  He fell asleep while he was standing there peeing and the stream went all over the floor and around the toilet.  I yelled at him that he needed to wake up because he was peeing all over the floor.  He did wake up out of his stupor and instantly became furious at me for... well... I don't know... me yelling at him for peeing all over the damn floor.  I guess you're just supposed to think that's okay.  

So he started yelling things like, ""You're such a bitch,"" ""You don't let me have any fun,"" ""My BBQ was the bomb and you know it.""  

I said, ""I'm not cleaning your pee off the floor.  I don't care how drunk you are, you need to get an old rag and clean it up and then go to bed.""  He said (and this is where it gets SO good), ""What?!  I don't know where any old rags are!""  He proceeded to get down on his hands and knees and lick his pee up off the floor and off the bottom of the toilet.  I stood there in shock, not knowing whether to try to get him to stop and risk further domestic violence, so I just stood there with my mouth hanging open.  He didn't even make a ""that's gross"" face.  He just finished and got up and walked out.

I did stay with him after that for about 6 more months on VERY rocky terms.  I guess because ignorant, young love knows no bounds.  lol... :(

Now I see pictures of him and his new girlfriend on facebook and I just think, ""Your boyfriend lapped his own pee up off of a bathroom floor and toilet.""  

It really helps me put things in perspective.  My husband and I started dating about 6 months after I finally booted this goofball to the curb, and I've never been happier.  Husband doesn't drink, smoke, or act like a total douche.  He is completely respectful and we have a fantastic relationship.  He is employed full time and we bought a wonderful home 2 years ago.  The worst thing he does is leave small messes around the house (not pee messes).  This is only because he is so busy working stressful shifts, taking all the overtime he can get, and making improvements to our home, that he has barely any time to sleep.

The moral of the story is, if your SO ever licks pee off or around the toilet, leave him immediately.  If your SO does little annoying things here and there, be happy he's not a complete and utter nasty, gross human being.  You can live with little messes here and there.  You cannot live with a pee lapper-upper.",7,20140520110522,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_261zsw,"Not even sure where to go to meet guys. At a loss in my dating life.","I'm not one of those /r/foreveralone types. I know I'm not going to be forever alone, but I also have no idea where to meet people interested in the same things that I am.

I've always been mature for my age. I'm 25, have a full time job, no kids, a vehicle, and am actually in the process of closing on a house. I'm not looking for someone to take care of me.

I'm also what people would call attractive. Probably a 7-8 on the 1-10 scale. I am taller than most women, but I've never had a problem with dating shorter guys. I work out and take care of my body and know how to dress in a flattering way.

Mainly I want to find someone who is compatible with me. Someone that I am mentally and sexually attracted to. I am very into nerdy things (conventions, anime, video games, etc), but it doesn't consume my life (I also enjoy reading, writing, and art).

I have tried dating websites, but the men I find attractive aren't into the same things that I am. The men who are into the same things that I am aren't sexually attractive to me. I feel like I'm constantly having to sacrifice one thing or another, and I don't feel like ""sexual attraction"" and ""common interests"" are all that different from anyone else's goals.

With OkCupid, I have met a few decent people. Though it seems the majority of men on there are looking more for casual sex as opposed to a relationship, something that I am *not* looking for. I want a monogamous relationship. The other handful of men tend to not have jobs or live with their parents and have no goals. I can't constantly drive someone around and baby them when I've been busting my ass since 18 to get myself a college degree, a great job, and a house. (After 2 relationships where men clearly used me for money, it's getting a bit old.)

I even tried to join Gk2Gk, since I figured a paying site would drive off people interested only in sex. Unfortunately, I don't have a high rate of matches on the site as there just aren't that many people who use it in my area, or any area to be honest. I've thought about trying Match.com, but I'm not sure if anyone would have the same interests as me.

I'm not a recluse. I do go out to conventions and talk to people, but a lot of the time (their words, not mine) I'm ""intimidating."" While this may be my height, I'm not sure what I can do to be more approachable. I don't really like going out to bars and drinking expensive drinks in a loud setting, so I don't really go for that.

I suppose I just need suggestions on how to go out and find someone. I feel like I would have more luck finding a living unicorn at this point.

Also the whole ""Don't judge someone on looks alone! Looks fade! You're shallow!"" Be honest with yourself. Do you send messages to girls on dating sites that YOU don't find attractive? I've gone on dates with people I was questionable about only to find we had no spark at all. Alternatively, I've gone on dates with gorgeous dudes only to find we have nothing to talk about. Very frustrating.",5,20140520142314,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26124k,"You know that feeling when you're terrified you might be pregnant, but it's too early to take a test? Talk me off the ledge here, TwoX.","First off, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

My husband and I pulled a very stupid move, and didn't use a condom. And didn't pull out. It was a heat of the moment thing, and yes, it was very very very stupid. 

So of course, since then all I've been doing is freaking out over possibly being pregnant. Problem is, we only did this horrendously stupid thing 8-9 days ago, and I'm not due to get my period for another week and a half or two weeks. So I'm pretty sure it's way too early to test.

I have endometriosis and when we did it, it was *right* after my period ended, so I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been ovulating and regardless, because of the endo I have a lower chance of fertility anyway. I keep trying to tell myself those two things. 

I also keep trying to tell myself that it's way too early to experience any symptoms of pregnancy, yet I keep noticing weird things. Firstly, my pee keeps smelling really weird, even though I'm not eating anything particularly different (no asparagus, etc). Second, I'm peeing a lot more than normal. Maybe I have a UTI? I didn't pee right after we had sex. I've never gotten one before so I'm not exactly prone to them, but it's a possibility. 

I'm also feeling randomly crampy in my uterus area, but I'm thinking those could be caused by my freaking out. Which could also be causing my CRAZY emotional-ness. Yesterday during an argument with my husband, I went from a 3 to an 11 in like, 2 seconds, ended up literally screaming at him and tearing out of the house. I keep crying at random stuff on TV. 

I don't want to be attaching meaning to everything, because I know that I could just be noticing all this stuff more right now because I'm freaked out. But at the same time, I'm very scared. If it isn't abundantly clear, I really don't want to be pregnant. I don't want to put myself through the emotional yuckyness of having an abortion. I'm just very nervous about the future right now.

So I just needed to get it off my chest, I guess. Hopefully I don't get *too* many ""stupid slut"" PM's. Thanks for listening.",5,20140520084220,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I am literally the only woman here...I mean, I'm sure there are others out there. Somewhere. But I've not seen any of them. It's just me and a bunch of dudes, which I thought I'd be ok with but honestly? It's a little rough. I keep feeling like they don't want me here, or that I don't belong and wound up here by mistake.

t3_261g3u,"The girlfriend of my emotionally, sexually, and physically abusive alcoholic ex-boyfriend wants my help with his alcoholism","I considered myself a fairly normal, intelligent, good person with a good judge of character - until I met my ex, let's call him Roger. Roger is genius-level perfect-score-on-SAT smart, good-looking, well-mannered and has fairly rich parents. He's charming and charismatic, so we instantly hit it off and start dating. About two months into the relationship, he starts getting quiet, withdrawn, and shifty. I discover a few months later that this is due to alcoholism. I take many steps to help this man - including getting him to stay through a whole rehab program, helping him get back to school, helping him find a new job after rehab, etc. About 9 months into the relationship, things turn into hell on earth - he starts drinking again, he's constantly suicidal and depressed, and as a result, he starts taking certain liberties with my body that I didn't agree to. He grabs my arms, he takes a pair of scissors and opens up a gash that is still scarred over a year later in my hand, destroys property, tears my clothes off, and generally makes me very afraid - so afraid that, after three months of this behavior, it takes discovering I have an STD (that I must have acquired from him cheating on me) to cause the fatal rift in our relationship. We break up (at the time he had been living with me) and he moves out. The very next day, he breaks into my apartment - and I consequently call the police. 
The man is on probation (due to no priors - he was looking at 2 years jail time, but got off with a plea deal) for 18 months and has a firm restraining (""protective"") order against him. None of which, it seems, his new girlfriend knows about. 
I was unaware he was in a new relationship, unaware that his new girlfriend and I had a mutual friend, and have generally avoided any and everything remotely related to Roger in the year since our breakup. However, I received a phone call this morning from the mutual friend of his new girlfriend (we'll call the girlfriend Sheri). Sheri wants her friend, Jennifer, to give her my number, so that she can get poor Roger back into rehab - because he's apparently drinking again. I inform Jennifer of some of the details of our relationship, and tell her to tell Sheri (who I refuse to talk to) to GET OUT and get away from Roger. If he hasn't started his abuse yet, he likely will if he's drinking again. And now I feel panicked, I had put the man behind me, put the situation behind me, and it seems to have caught up with me again. I keep replaying some of the more gruesome events in my head and all I can think is that I'm concerned for the safety of Sheri. 
I don't know what to do. I feel like I should maybe talk to Sheri directly, try to get her to understand the danger she may be in, try to get her to see reason. But that may also be selfish - maybe he was just abusive towards me, and is trying to change. Should I really be so serious and fatalistic about a relationship I know next to nothing about? I don't know. All I know is that I'm a little terrified right now - turns out he's still in my hometown, in a relationship with a woman who attends the same college at my university, so I'll likely run into her even if I try to avoid it. 

TL;DR: Emotionally, physically, sexually abusive alcoholic ex-boyfriend has a new girlfriend who wants my help in getting him to stop drinking, and I'm terrified of even thinking about the past or talking to her, so I talked to her friend and told her to tell her friend to leave.

Every girl in the class raised their hand when the professor asked us which one of us has experienced street harassment, while the two boys did not. We then discussed how we individually handled it, and what feelings/thoughts arouse during and after the incident.

Some explained that they retaliated by either saying a remark or flipping them off, but most of the group explained that you just feel really terrible and scared and nervous. Even when we told stories of trying to stick up for ourselves, it was instantly riddled with fear, accelerated heart rates, and walking quickly to a safe destination. We even talked about how women are always told to take self defense classes, to carry pepper spray, to not go out during certain hours of the day, and to not wear specific clothing to arouse others to want to yell at us.

I guess I'm just asking, have you been harassed verbally in public and how did you deal with it? How did you feel after? Did you receive any support by strangers or people you may have been hanging out with? Do you feel like you can defend yourself without consequence?

t3_2610tb,"Just got out of an emotionally abusive relationship. Still hurting.","I was seeing someone for a few months. We were on and off for two weeks or so, but decided to leave for good this weekend. I thought I was breaking up because I have anxiety and trust issues, but a lot of what I was feeling was caused by him. I had good friends to tell me, ""hey, this guy is treating you like garbage."" When he found out I spoke to my friends he told me that at least he knows how to deal with issues on his own, unlike me.


He lied to me but still denies it, ignored me for days, turned everything around on me, called me emotional, obnoxious, and intense whenever I tried to talk to him about how he made me feel. His excuse for ignoring me was that it was easier than trying to talk to me.


Before this ended (which was Saturday) I hadn't seen him for a little over a month. Granted we live somewhat far and stuff kept coming up on his end. I believed him, but then he started to ignore me. I got fed up, but I gave him chances and was supposed to see him Saturday. All last week he spent time telling me how we'll see each other more, he'll communicate better, he likes our connection... then all day Saturday he ignored me. Only to EMAIL me Sunday saying his phone was off, and he knows I'm super angry and if I was free I should go see him. Like, if that is true why wait until the next day? To which he said I need to rely on myself more. 


I met him on OKCupid. When we became exclusive I asked that we disable our accounts. He lied to me when he said he disabled his account. He disabled it and reactivated it a few times. He blamed it on tech issues, and I tried to believe him but it really got to me. I would always worry, and he knew this. He knew it was eating at me, and he said he wishes it didn't because he wants to focus on us. I found out he was lying, and it wasn't a tech issues. But he went on with this lie for over a month, right to my face, and even in the end he didn't admit it. It came down to my trust issues.


I keep thinking about things he has said. For example, one weekend after he ignored me I tried talking to him through text. He was talking a bit, but once I asked what happened that weekend he got angry and said ""don't you have a job to attend to.""


I know I do have trust issues with men, and he knows this (and about my past with abuse) so it was easy enough for him to tell me that's what it is. And it was apparently easy enough for me to believe.
I fell for him hard, and I really liked him so I didn't want ""my issues"" to ruin it. Now I can see I was putting in all the effort for someone who treated me poorly. And I'm mad at myself for it, but I want to try to be kind with myself too.


Obviously you all are only getting bits and pieces. But the way he talked to me, treated me... it was shitty. A friend called it gaslighting, which I've experienced. And I've been in an abusive relationship before, and worked at a DV org. Gaslighting and abuse are huge words to throw out there, but the more I think about what he said to me the more it feels accurate.


So I told him I'm not going to be treated this way. That I find him manipulative or at the very least a huge jerk. He didn't care about my anxiety and depression, and made it worse and sometimes it seems like it was purposeful.


He sent me pictures and said I ""should consider seeing him"" because he didn't ""set out to lose a good connection"".


It hurts a lot to be honest. I really liked him, and wanted to build something with him. And he made me happier than any guy has in a long time. Things started out amazingly with him. Texted me every morning, asked me about my day and about my life...


I know it wasn't my fault, but I feel like shit. I wonder if he ever cared, if I wasn't good enough, but I have to cut that out. I hate how easily my mind goes to blaming myself.


I honestly have felt crazy for the past month or so. I use the term crazy purposefully because I don't know how else to describe it. Being ignored, and then having things turned around on you constantly. I feel so warn out, and I am getting better but it hurts. I feel heartbroken.

So, I have this ""perfect"" life: Lovely boyfriend [24/m] that l love, and who loves me, wonderful apartment, a good job in my field, a cat and a doge, best friends I see from time to time (because we live far) and so. But every now and then I wake up with the necessity of breaking up with everyhing and start fresh at some other place.
It has happened to me since I was a functioning and autonomous human, I got fed up and left everything to pursue some other thing, and so on.

I'm not quite sure why I'm posting here other than that I am feeling lost and would like some other perspectives. So I guess I will start at the beginning.

I started menstruating when I was 11 and my periods were always heavy and painful but nothing that caused me much alarm. However between the ages of 16-19 I started getting stabbing shooting pain that would jolt me in shock at the beginning of my periods. The pain would feel like it was in my ass and vagina and was the most painful thing that I had ever experienced. I would sit and cry and beg for the pain to be over and try not to pass out or vomit. The only thing that would help was extremely hot baths. I went to numerous doctors. I was told by the first that it was just normal period pain. I was told by the second, (who gave me an ultrasound on my 21st birthday because of the pain) that he's seen it a million times and it's just because I have a small cervix. (So then why wouldn't I be having the pain since I first started menstruating?) And was told by the third that they just don't know but they are prescribing me an anti-inflammatory for people who have arthritis. After taking the medication, I felt like my life changed, I stopped getting the stabbing pain as much and it eventually seemed to fade in the last few years to the point where my periods have become pretty much normal.

However, I have been getting really bad sporadic lower back pain that shoots to the front of my abdomen and takes my breath away/makes me naseaus/ keeps me from being able to do things. So, I went to a new gyno who is really good and teaches at a university so she is very up to date on everything. She tested me for std's/cultures/pap/sonogram. Everything came back negetive but my sono showed that my IUD had dislodged and was starting to embed in my cervix.

Last week, I had my IUD ripped out and a new one put it. The pain was bad but whatever, I love my IUD. The problem is that I ever since I had a UTI/Kidney infection two months ago, I've been having pain near my left ovary. When the UTI pain was really bad it was almost like I could feel something moving there. I was tested for kidney stones/pregnancy and it all came back negative. No one seems concerend about it but it's only getting worse and has gotten worse since getting my IUD changed. The pain feels like dull pressure, and then stabbing horrible pain on my lower left side. I've been taking Ibprofen 800's for the IUD/period cramps and it numbs that fine but the lower left side pain is still present and gets worse when I walk. It brings me to tears.

I had a sonogram last week. If it were cysts wouldn't that have shown up? Why doesn't anyone take this pain seriously? I know this is a lot of jumbled information but I just feel lost.
