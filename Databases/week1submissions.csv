t3_23ppr3,"TIL You can cough your Diva Cup out","I'm mortified. I've caught a terrible chest cold and needed to go the pharmacy for some cough syrup. Since it's a terrible day it would only make sense that I'd start my period, so I put in my Diva Cup and went to go wait in line for my codeine cough syrup. 

Well, I'm coughing uncontrollably and all of a sudden I feel my Diva Cup moving. I can't stop myself from coughing so now I'm trying to not attract attention (impossible when you sound like you have TB) and putting my hands in my jeans pocket so that every time I cough I can push the stem back up. It was halfway out of my body while I waited for the pharmacist.

t3_23psjo,"Found out I am pregnant, will be getting a medical abortion tomorrow. Feeling so much sadness.","I found out yesterday that I am pregnant and I'm still in shock. I've been with my boyfriend for three years and we've never once had a serious scare so this completely took us by surprise. 
I am very close with my friends and family but I have a feeling that I would experience disappointment and judgement from them if I told them what I was doing, even though I'm certain most of them are pro-choice.
The struggle is that I am 23, in a stable relationship, and finished school so it seems like I am someone who could potentially raise a child. But I'm not in a position in the least to be a mother. I have no money, my boyfriend has massive amounts of debt, we're both pursuing artistic careers and having a child would shatter us.
My boyfriend has been really supportive and has been my shoulder to cry on (multiple times) since I found out. I guess why I'm posting though is that I still feel lonely, nervous and especially am fearing how this will affect me for the rest of my life.
Any words of encouragement, or personal experiences would be so appreciated.

And sometimes my family thinks it's funny to get me all riled up about something (I'm usually pretty calm) and then brush it off, even though they actually genuinely changed my mood and played around with my feelings & it's hard to bounce back from that to cheerful conversation. I guess there's something about being a more emotionally reserved person so that when I do show emotion, it can be more entertainment than me actually having feelings.

t3_23qjfq,"My boyfriend is an idiot and as a result everyone now thinks I'm an idiot!","Last week my boyfriend suffered a concussion whilst horsing around and wrestling with a friend. He knocked himself unconscious and terrified both the friend and those around him. He claimed to be ""fine"" the day of but started experiencing severe headaches and nausea the next day, so we went to the hospital. We are still waiting for a CT scan but he's been officially diagnosed with a concussion and was advised to take it easy.

However, he hasn't. He owns and coaches at a gym which he hasn't taken any time off of but can be easily modified to keep him safe. However, he also still insists on working out although he claims to have ""modified"" the workouts to be less stressful to his head. He's still pushing himself pretty intensely to the point where he's very dizzy or throws up after workouts despite doctors orders.

I've told him about a million times that I'd like him to stop working out. Pretty much everyone in his circle of family and friends has told him this. He initially did try to stay off his feet but said he felt ""fine"" and was back at it after not even a day of rest. He's convinced himself that the positive benefits of exercise are somehow actually good for his potential brain energy and that he's modified things enough to be okay. 

I'm really worried about him, especially as his CT scan is still days away and he has worsening symptoms following exercise. On top of that, I'm also pretty mad at him as well for being so stupid and careless with his health. Part of me feels guilty for even being mad about it, since it is his body and his choice. 

Furthermore, all of our family and friends not only think he's an idiot but have now started seeing me in a negative light as well. I've heard behind my back how I'm an idiot for not ""making him stop"" and for ""putting up with his idiocy"" from his siblings and even from my own!

Anyone have any advice here? I've tried talking to him (and yelling at him!) and it doesn't seem to be getting through. Dealing with my worry and anger as well as external pressures from our friends and family has left me even more exhausted and I find myself suffering from terrible insomnia. I check on him throughout the night, especially when he comes home from the gym because I worry I'll wake up one day and he'll have died in his sleep!

t3_23qda3,"My boyfriend isn't going to my senior prom with me, and I'm still upset about it after 2 months of knowing.","Sorry, long story:

I've been dating him for 2 1/2 years, and was super excited about going to the dance. We didn't go to Homecoming this year because we knew we were going to prom. I mean, I feel like the dance itself is not that important. Why should it be a big deal to me?  But then I think about my dress, and how I get to look my best and dance and have fun. I had already bought my dress when he dropped the news.  See, he is on one of a couple of extracurricular teams that placed in state, and are going to nationals in Washington D.C.   Awesome, right? Well it was, until I found out that prom and that trip were on the same day.

But the thing is, is that the trip is optional. He is not required to go, in fact, some of the seniors on other teams aren't going because of prom.  I just feel so guilty, though, because don't want to be the thing that keeps him from enjoying this. When he told me about not coming to prom... I started sobbing right there. I don't know why I'm still so upset over it, that was over 2 months ago but every time i see a guy asking a girl to prom I just start tearing up. Because now I don't get to be with my best friend at prom, I don't get to experience being asked, it just hurts.  

We talked about it, and I told him how bad it made me feel.  He knows I was crying almost every night.  But in person, when I finally got him to sit down and talk about it, I told him how I wanted to feel important enough to him to pick me over going to his competition.  After that he got this weird look on his face.  I asked him why he looked so conflicted, and it was because he was about to break up with me because he was causing me so much pain, and felt like he couldn't make me happy anymore.  Which, he had tried to compromise by saying the whole ""We can have our own prom!"" line... 

My whole family is upset with him and his parents as well, because last year his parents forced him to go to another girls prom because she didn't want to be alone, even though i specifically told them that I was uncomfortable with it. If I had known her it wouldn't have bugged me so much, but I think its a huge slap in the face for them to disrespect my feelings twice now.  Once when I told them I didn't feel comfortable with that situation, and then now that my prom isn't as important as that girls.  She couldn't be alone, but its ok for me to be?

I sound so selfish when I read this back.  This is a really cool opportunity for him, going to nationals for something is awesome. And I can see how much he wants to... but cant he see how much I want to go to prom? He has an obligation to his team to compete, but I feel like he also has an obligation to me.  He has already decided, hell, he had decided even before he told me about it.  I think what really hurts the most, is that I don't think he has even said sorry about it. 

I don't know what to do about this. I just got my dress back from being altered, but I just put it in my closet and started crying.  I thought I would feel better about this by now, and I have no idea what to do.  I'm scared to tell him, because I don't want him to break up with me because he feels like he can't make me happy anymore. 

He is going to the competition, but I still feel so bitter over it.  I don't want this to ruin our relationship.  Its just prom, and that's what I keep telling myself... but apparently logic doesn't influence my emotions.

t3_23qqqm,"HELP! I'm upset about my job!!","Sorry in advance if this is the wrong sub (if is it not, please redirect me) I will try to make this as short as possible. 

I am a 19 year old college freshman in a small town and have had my first job for about 6 months now. It is a small 5 employee print shop, with two mid 30 year old women and another college female, with me being the newest one. I have recently been noticing that I am beginning to do more of the ""physical"" work including changing air filters, repairing machines, cleaning out offices, moving boxes, etc. My official job title is Customer Service/Production (as I deal with the customers and prepare the jobs). The reason I got this job was with the help of the other college aged worked who has been here for a year and a half. 

Let me also state that I have no intention of staying in this job because I will be moving away out of town for a university by fall of 2015 at the latest to pursue a Mechanical Engineering degree, which my boss, a 50 year old male has. I have a sense that just because I want to be an engineer, he puts me to do the ""manly"" jobs and doesn't want to bother the other 3 who do design work because of their degree. Also, when the other workers are supposed to be working, I see them on their phones (especially the college girl) and when I walk into the office she pretends she's back to working. This has infuriated me to the point that I want to quit because it is not fair that I am doing the dirty jobs while she sits behind a desk ""working"". 

With that being said, there is a new opening as a secretary in town and think it is right for me to experience a new job. My question is, how do I tell my boss I want to quit. Should I go ask for information about the new job and if I get through the interview process and hopefully get hired, do I tell my boss then and put in a 2 weeks notice. This is the first time I have dealt with a situation like this. 

P.s earlier in the year, I decided not to pursue an engineering intership because I felt like the ""company"" needed me, but I now see that the only need they want is my ""physical and engineering help"" 

TL;DR I am having issues at work with how I am being assigned to do the ""physical and dirty"" work in the print shop while others are barely working in an office designing. There also is an opening as a secretary in town. Should I go ahead and see what happens?",0,20140422231441,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23qlph,"Missing period","Hey twox! I am 22 years old and was on the pill for about 7 years before coming off in August last year. I had one withdrawal period in September and then one more period about 2.5 months later in November. It has now been 5 months since my last period.

I am having regular sex with my boyfriend but we use condoms and the diaphragm every time. I have also done quite a few pregnancy tests in the past 5 months so I'm relatively sure I'm not pregnant.

Other related health things:
- I did change my diet (paleoish - mostly wheat, dairy and soy free now) at around the same time that I went off the pill. 
- I have also noticed an increase in deep sore acne around my jaw line (I had pretty good skin on the pill).

All in all, I just want to post this so that if anyone is ever researching Yaz or Loryna they might come across this and not feel as nervous/scared about taking it after reading so many negative reviews.

t3_23qrdr,"Ladies, I got Nexplanon questions","So I've searched this sub about as much as I can so far and I've gotten mixed reviews on how people feel about it. 

I'm interested in it because I've been on birth control pills for going on 10 years and I'm sick of taking those things daily. My life has gotten more hectic recently (grad school, full time job and multiple volunteer/leadership positions) and I'd rather not have to worry about it. I'm in a long term relationship where we don't want children any time soon (probably never) so I'd really like to not get pregnant.

Some women have said they completely lose their periods and others say that they bleed for long periods of time after the initial implantation. I'm curious to know if the women who lost their period are smaller (weigh less) and that may be why. I have a overweight BMI and I'm concerned that it will cause me to bleed for months on end at the beginning. Other thing I noticed is that women said they lost their sex drive. I already have a pretty low sex drive, I think it has to deal with self-esteem and negative body image more than actual sexual desire. 

Any comments or recommendations would help.

No matter how much I told him I didn't want to, he wouldn't listen. He kept pushing me and pushing me. He got so close, my anxiety took over and I froze. He took that as a yes, and that's when it all began. The next couple years were spent with him. I felt too worthless for anyone else. Too dirty. I'd always tell him I don't want to do that. He didn't care. Even when I cried, he ignored it. His forceful touch overpowering my feeble attempts to push him away. He moved away, and I ended it with him, knowing that I wouldn't have to face him and his anger problems. 
I pushed it all deep down. I did my best not to think of it. Now I am 18, and I can't stop thinking about it. Every little thing reminds me of him. I am bisexual, but I tell people I am a lesbian, because whenever I am with a guy I think of him. Now it's getting worse though.

1. Reduce my chances of getting pregnant during PIV sex (the boyfriend and I always use condoms but we want a hormonal method as well just to be sage
2. End the killer periods! I'm sick of missing school and lying in bed feeling miserable. 
3. Not interfere with my other meds (lamictal 200 mg, zoloft 25 mg, and clonidine--not to be confused with klonopin--for bipolar disorder/anxiety nos/sleep)
4. Something cheap. My family is pretty poor but we're fortunate enough to get halfway decent health insurance through my dad's employer (the state). 

Obviously I'll talk to the gynecologist about this and I've been doing thorough research on Planned Parenthood's site. But the My Method app they have isn't too helpful and I want to know more about what people's personal experiences. Also, a few other things:


* I worry about going on the pill because I'm fairly bad at remembering to take the meds I'm currently on, even with reminders and alarms 

* Implanon--the PP website says it doesn't work if you're on certain psych meds--anyone know about this (and obviously I'll consult the gyno and my shrink but just wanted some more info beforehand)? Blog post on Scarleteen said otherwise but didn't specify which meds. Also the insertion method kind of scares me. 

* Mirena: has anyone had an experience with this making their periods lighter? I like the idea of it lasting for five years and being relatively low maintenance. I'm worried about the up front costs and wondering if it will be cheaper than the pill over time. At 18 I think I'm off Dad's insurance? Not sure. 

* I'm very fortunate to have parents and a loving boyfriend who are supportive. Wanted to acknowledge that just 'cuz.

t3_23s966,"Tennessee Making Pregnancy Outcomes a Crime - Why You Should Care and How You Can Help","Tennessee's General Assembly has passed a law that would make women [criminally liable for the outcomes of their pregnancies.](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/10/tennessee-legislature-passes-far-reaching-bill-make-pregnant-women-criminals/) The bill targets women who use narcotics illegally during pregnancy, but is written so broadly that any pregnancy loss thought to be connected to an 'unlawful' act can be grounds for investigation, arrest, and prosecution. This means that anyone who has a miscarriage at any time in pregnancy or gives birth to a baby with health problems can face criminal investigation. The penalties are assault charges, which can carry up to 15 years in prison. 

This is bad business for a lot of reasons. 
* It is [meanspirited and counterproductive](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/opinion/criminalizing-expectant-mothers.html): women who struggle with addiction need health care, not handcuffs. 
* [Medical experts recognize](http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Health_Care_for_Underserved_Women/Substance_Abuse_Reporting_and_Pregnancy_The_Role_of_the_Obstetrician_Gynecologist) that the threat of prosecution actually hurts babies by driving women away from prenatal care.
* The law will [disproportionately punish black women] (http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/17/tennessees-pregnancy-criminalization-law-will-hit-black-women-hardest/), who are more likely to be blamed for their pregnancy outcomes. 
* Prosecutors claim that *only* addicted women who don't seek treatment will be arrested, and they will *only* be charged with a misdemeanor. But [nothing in the law](http://www.salon.com/2014/04/21/you_cant_always_trust_people_to_do_the_right_thing_how_a_law_split_pro_life_gopers_in_tennessee/) limits it in this way. 

Prosecutors and police shouldn't have a place in pregnancy: this is the first time a state has passed a law that gives them an in. 

The bill is currently awaiting Governor Bill Haslam's signature. Groups are circulating a petition [demanding that he veto the law.](http://action.rhrealitycheck.org/page/s/gov-haslam-veto-pregnancy-criminalization-sb-1391)  I hope you will sign, and I would also appreciate your suggestions as to where else I might post.

I moved to Italy with my husband in September.  He is pursuing his postdoc.  I am an engineer, and am working remotely.  The whole thing fell apart.  We got married like 4 days before we moved out here, which was incredibly stressful and ridiculous in its own right, and I was supposed to work at the European site here.  When I got here, they gave some bla bla work visa excuses that my company was supposed to work out but didn't.  Several conversations and weeks later, they asked me to just work ""from home"".


It is so hard.  It has been 7 months and it is not going well.  I am a huge extrovert and my husband is the only person I talk to.  We have some friends yeah, but they are his office buddies.  My whole identity is warped now that I'm married. I'm essentially a stay at home wife.     I have not bothered to learn Italian, I just don't even give a shit.


My job is only letting me do this for one year so I have to go back in September.  I would have gone back by now but I was trying to make it work, and people are coming to visit and I didn't want to disapoint everyone.  We have this stupid picture perfect sounding life - moving to Italy and I get to work my breadwinning job from here - fuck me, its anything but.  My job has unravelled, I get menial tasks, most of the time I don't do anything but stay logged on until I get an email.  I used to be a heavy hitter - now I'm just a name on the org chart.  I've addressed this with my boss but not much has changed. I have been considering changing careers when I get back in Sept, have been considering divorce, I am just not happy.  To be honest, I am more important to myself than my relationship is to me.  I probably should not have gotten married and came out here.  We had been dating 8 years and rushed the wedding when we found out he got the position.


I just need to vent. Today was especially bad for me.  We went on a great trip this weekend but today is our first full day back and my despair hit me like a ton of bricks.  I am so lost. I know when I go back to the US I'll fall into another depressive episode and feel like this was a wasted opportunity that I slept through.  I used to be so loyal and gung ho about my job - why bother to work so hard if they couldn't even back me up this year.  ",8,20140423104841,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I folded it in the C-shape and got it in, but I can't turn it. there's still a bit of C-shape left while it's in. so i'm not sure it's 'sealed'? i heard a 'fwomp' sound. I've done this trice now, after two-ish hours, taking it out (I'm home right now, haha) and putting it back in. 

Taking it out is proving weirdly difficult, since the cup seems to.. err.. migrate up? it's still in straight and doesn't leak (the outside looks clean and there is stuff inside) but it's very far up, so it's hard to grasp it and take it out.

t3_23s25l,"In what world does the abuser leave the victim?? I am having trouble figuring out why this happened & feel like the only one who went through this.","I keep hearing about how abusive relationships are so hard to get out of because the man sweet-talks the woman and begs her to come back. Or at least that's how I THOUGHT it went.

I was in a year long relationship with an emotionally, mentally & physically abusive boyfriend. We threatened to dump each other all the time and the other would beg not to. In the beginning it was me dumping & him begging, but at the last part of it it was the opposite. He controlled, manipulated, and played mind games. I was wrapped around his finger & blinded by, what I thought was, love.

The night we broke up, he was super black out drunk & he decided to beat me because I was crying (that's literally the reason) 
I thought in most situations the guy would hit the girl then feel really bad afterwards and apologize only to do it again in the future; but he didn't stop. He kept punching, kicking, throwing, slapping me. He took my windpipe, looked me in the eye with a look like a demon had possessed him, and suffocated me twice. The last time I fell to the floor passed out.
He tried to leave but for some reason I still cared about him (I still cant figure out why) He said ""fine but I'm leaving in the morning"" & we both pass out.


I wake up next to him. He was laying facing away from me. I was in so much pain. My eye was throbbing and disgustingly bruised. I choked out, ""babe...are we still together?"" He leans over, looks at my eye & said ""Oh God"" He then jumped out of bed and started immediately packing his stuff. I was crying so hard asking why he was leaving, begging him not to. That I needed him (so I thought). He seemed like he was sad and he kept saying ""I have to.""  He then sits down and starts crying with me. He tells me ""he loves me and always will."" and we hug for the longest time. Tells me he will still pay his part of the rent. He then gets up, tells me he loves me, gives me one more hug and leaves me there to wallow in sadness, pain & emptiness.


The next day he told me we were just ""on a break"" and can ""try again"" when he ""gets his shit together."" After that day though he changed his mind and said we could never be together again, but could still be friends and hang out. Why was I the one begging him, when he had hurt me so bad? A week after all this, he calls me up crying saying he had gotten in the car and just drove & drove. Didn't know where or for how long but ended up like four states away. Told me he was scared and thinking about killing himself. I was stupid and still cared about him. I wired him money and we were talking like we were in love again that day. Was he manipulating me or did a part of him really become scared and looked to me for help?


The next two weeks after the incident we are talking. He seemed extremely depressed too. His father was abusive to his mother for like.. 10 years, and I guess he was upset that his father came out in him, because it seemed like he didn't want to become him. But then why did he? He used to cry about his dad so much in the first few months in our relationship. He was so sensitive and remorseful for being mean to me. Grieving for his lost childhood his father robbed him of. Then the last couple months between us, something in him snapped. He was so, angry at me. All the time. No matter how good I tried to be to him. He wasn't the guy I fell in love with, he had become a monster and I'm not sure why or what happened. Im not saying I was the perfect girlfriend, I have made a few mistakes, but I didn't treat him like he treated me. I put way more energy, time, and feelings into this guy than anyone ever has, despite how he acted towards me.


No matter how much I think about it I can't figure out what happened in his head. Did he care about me and just let his demons take over or did he never care & just use me for his own personal gain? When he was beating me he told me he ""stopped loving me a long time ago."" & truth comes out when you are drunk. But if he did, why did he keep coming back when I begged him not to dump me? I mean, he did do a few things for me..He called the ambulance for me when I drank to much, projecting vomit, and spent the night waiting at the hospital for me. He bought me some gifts when I caught him doing something and took me out to eat. Just all the negatives outweighed the positives. But did he care about me or not? Why did he cry and act depressed when we broke up? Only to start treating me like less than dirt again? 


I think he was either bipolar, borderline personality or something along those lines. My therapist says that they are addicted to power and control & leaving is maybe a way they still have control on you because you are begging for them back. But when they leave they wont be able to have power over me anymore to satisfy their hunger. I can don't understand all this. 


Can anyone shed some light on the situation? I am having trouble swallowing the fact that I wasn't even strong enough to leave him. I was BEGGING for my ABUSER to come back to ME. 
WHY?????????
He took that satisfaction away. It was insult to injury, a slap in the face. (Literally) I just *can't* understand why. He was so cruel, but acted remorseful and ran away.


(P.s. I am in the process of pressing charges in case you are wondering. & I am so better off without him. Hes in jail and dead to me. I will never want to have contact with him again.)


Any knowledge on this subject is appreciated. Xoxo.


TLDR: What possible reason could possess my abusive boyfriend to leave ME after he beat & almost killed me? Why was I begging for him back and not the other way around?

EDIT: Might I add he had very large sad eyes when I glared at him in court while I gave my testimony. He looked scared and hurt. I was expecting him to look angry but it was mostly of disappointment it seemed. My mom tells me he probably is remorseful, but I have a hard time agreeing. She also mentioned that he probably knew his father was in him, but just couldn't suppress it any longer and is sad it came out and hurt me. Looking back on some old text messages she might be right. One read, ""It scares me when I yell at you like that because I don't want to lose control, I don't know what I'm capable of."" Showed it to my mom & she said, ""Yeah, he knew.""

Before when we still talked he did apologize a bunch of times and told me he left because ""he didn't want it to happen again"" But why do you suddenly care about me right after you beat & break me? With all the mind control, manipulating and lying hes fed me, its no surprise that I am seriously confused and don't know what to believe.

t3_23ssqq,"Unplanned pregnancy. Very conflicting emotions and thoughts.","Sorry for the long post. I am very conflicted. I am 25 years old, and I have never thought I wanted children of my own, but suddenly this year it's like the mommy hormones finally kicked in, and lots of my friends are pregnant or have had their first kid, and my stupid body is going ""babies! Let's make babies!"", and my logical brain is like ""what is this"" …. And now I'm fucking knocked up and really confused about what I really want. 
I had an abortion at 16, and never thought it would happen again unplanned, yet here I am. That experience was heartbreaking and I really don’t want to go through it again. I am not in an ideal place in my life for a child - the father is my ex that I keep hooking up with because the sex is amazing and I do care about him a lot, but he is virtually homeless and jobless right now, due to really bad financial and business management coupled with severely debilitating depression and untreated OCD. In short, not someone I can count on.
I, on the other hand, have a really excellent job that pays very well and I have full benefits, I rent my own home, but I am still getting back on my feet (about $9k in debt not including my car or student loans) after being un or underemployed for two years. I am in a better place than a lot of women in my condition, but I still don’t think I could handle raising a child right now. 
I have thought a lot about adoption, but that brings up a lot of issues for me too. Could I handle that? After nine months and hours of pain in labor and birth, could I really give my amazing creation away, even if I had an open adoption? I was adopted, and I don’t see or talk to my bio mother, even though we did connect a few years ago (it was a closed adoption). Will my baby grow up to not want to see or talk to me? Will it be easier that way or to see him/her grow up with another couple? 
Also, I am so afraid of losing my pre-baby body. And (I know I shouldn’t care) but what will my coworkers and friends think, how will they react? I am atheist now, but I was raised Catholic, so those feelings of guilt are kind of hard wired into my brain. 
I also feel really lonely in this decision. I am not close to my mother so that’s not even an option of telling her until I actually make a decision (and only if it's not abortion). My father and I don’t talk about this kind of stuff lol. I'm not close to most of my blood family anyway, my family is the community of friends I have built around me, but even then, I would feel ashamed to tell most of my friends, even really close ones. The only person I feel totally comfortable talking to is my ex, the father, but he makes it really difficult because he's still completely in love with me. I know he will support whatever decision I choose, but I still wish I felt comfortable with other people to talk about this with. 
I don’t know if I'm really asking for advice or anything. I just feel really confused and conflicted and sad that this happened right now, at a really inconvenient time in my life. I don’t want to have an abortion, but I don’t like the other options any better. Sigh.

So I had had the Paragard IUD since December of 2012, about 7 months after I started dating my current SO.  If anyone knows anything about IUDs, they would know that they are some of the best forms of BC, since you can't really misuse them.  Anyway, on February 23th I had an excruciating pain in my right side, but since I was between health insurance policies (my next plan was to start March 1st, a week later) I tried to avoid going to the doctor.  After hours of screaming and vomiting from the pain and almost passing out, I decide to go to a clinic to see what's wrong.  This pain.. was like nothing I had ever felt in my life.  Upon arriving at the clinic and spending $100, they tell me to head to the ER right away-- they thought it was my appendix.

Fastforward a few hours, and after several tests we find out it was an ectopic pregnancy.. in my ovary.  The pregnancy was in my right ovary, and had grown so much that my ovary ruptured.  If I didn't go into the ER, there's a possibility that I could have died, so denying help wasn't really an option.  Now, I may have to pay over $10,000 (I'm still waiting to see if I qualify for help) in hospital fees, and I'm not in a place where I can afford that.  My SO isn't any more financially secure than I am (we are both recent college graduates), but I think it's a little unfair that because of something we **both** caused, I have to possibly deal with a $10,000 bill by myself IN ADDITION to all the pain I went through.  Not to mention I had to take 2 unpaid weeks off of work to recover.

When I tried looking this up online, I couldn't find a specific law.  Mostly, I found people opposing the very idea that a man would be financially responsible, and that baffles me.  I would hear arguments that it's a woman's choice to have sex, knowing that she may get pregnant.  Well... I think it's a man's choice as well, knowing that he may get the woman pregnant.  Also, it's not like we were being careless, I was on what I thought was the best form of BC for me, since my body doesn't react well to hormonal BC.

Anyway, can anyone help me understand legally where we stand?  I hate to have to put this burden on to my SO, but I'm still trying to emotionally recover from this whole thing... let alone worry about paying the bills on my own.  Thanks!

If you need any more information, please let me know and I'll try my best to provide the answers.

When she was maybe 20 her family moved to the West Coast - still a suburban/rural area, but better.

Every idea I've thought of seems to amount to nothing. The nearest bus stop is 3+ miles away, she obviously can't drive, doesn't have the money for insurance/gas anyway. Nothing nearby that she could volunteer at. She thinks about getting her GED sometimes but with no transportation or way to get to a job, doesn't see the point. I don't know how to help her; I was afforded many more opportunities growing up so it's hard to even see from her perspective sometimes. The only thing I thought of was WWOOF, but that still wouldn't provide much except a way to get out of the house. 

TL;DR: My 26 year old friend never learned to drive, got her GED, or has had a job due to the circumstances she's grown up in. She's depressed, doesn't have much money, and wants to find a way to get a job/move out but doesn't know where or how to start.",15,20140423221012,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23u24q,"An ongoing review of Betty Beauty's ""BettyBare"" hair removal cream","I'm just gonna say it, I know a lot of us women are always looking for better ways to remove pubic hair. If you like your bush, that's great! If you don't, well, join the club. 

Waxing hurts. A lot. Even more so the first time, so many don't bother going back (or trying in the first place). I've tried to do it at home. Got half a strip down before I had to stop. I know I should try with a professional, but now that I know the general level of pain it will be, I've been putting it off. 

Shaving sucks. I'm sorry, it does. The pricklies grow back fast, and poke and scratch in places that should not be poked and scratched by such tiny little porcupine spikes. Those of us with sensitive skin reach a problem very quickly here: shaving every day causes raw skin, but shaving every other day allows too much time for those little spikes to grow in and start the torture, not to mention a lot more ingrowns crop up in this time. 

And Nair... Veet.... the masters of horror. We ALL have read the horror stories, or have some of our own. No need to go into deets.

So lately I've been hearing about ""BettyBare"" hair removal cream. They claim to be the only removal cream gentle enough for use ""all over the body"", supposedly without ""that lingering bad smell"". I spent a good few hours checking out reviews, searching on other websites, etc. I only found one review from someone who had a bad reaction. SO I thought, why not, I might as well give it a try. What more do I have to lose? I've already nicked, snipped, ripped, and burned my way through so many failures, what's one more?

Well, I'll tell you this. It went.... better than expected. I test patched it first on a small area at the top of my bush. Followed instructions to the letter. Went fine. Removed a small amount of hair, but it was a less than 1"" square patch, so hey. I waited 48 hours and went for (almost) the whole deal. No burning, at all! I swear on my labia, my honor, and my laptop. And I consider my downstairs party a 9 out of 10 on the ""unpleasantly sensitive"" scale. It also really wasn't all that bad smelling. The sulfur smell is there, but to me it's faint, and it doesn't linger, like it said. 

Now on to the downside... actual hair removal was sub par. Instead of removing the hair from the follicle like you think it's supposed to work, it seems to just weaken the hair at skin level and break it off. Not to mention, *of course* it doesn' remove everything the first time around. It did remove a fair amount though, I'd say about 2/3s the hair is gone. The rest just looks and feels like five o'clock shadow, minus the rawness and razorburn. So there's another plus- again, zero burning. Zero pain. The stubble is a little softer and less dead-set of stabbing everything. 

I plan on trying again after another 48 hours and will update here when I'm done. I think that I should have followed the box's advice and trimmed my bush down, but I didn't and I think it factored in on how much hair got left behind. I also left a landing strip of sorts, out of fear of burning my labia, just in case I did have a bad reaction. I didn't, so I may test patch closer to the actual edge of the hair growth there. I'm hoping that a second pass with this stuff will remove 90% the hair that's left, and I can easily tweeze off the remaining weakened hairs (the ones left currently are not all weakened enough to do this yet). 

The way it's going, I don't know if I would really bother to do this regularly or not. It takes about 20 minutes all in all, including application, wait time, and removal. Kind of a pain for results that are stubbly and patchy, despite the fact that it's so far the least irritating hair removal process I've tried. If it works much better by doing it more regularly, that would be awesome, but if it will always be broken stubble rather than actually removed hair, I don't think it'll be my go-to. I'd end up sticking with just trimming. So far I'm giving it a 3 out of 5. 

If anyone else has tried this stuff, feel free to share your own sort of review here, I'm interested. I couldn't find any other posts on reddit at all, aside from one ad with no comments. ",10,20140423234406,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

But I'm so fucking tired of walking around with a fucking open can of tuna between my legs. I've gone beyond embarrassed, and now I just feel like my specially cultured eau de parfum is just a constant reminder of my low quality of life.

This man who wore the mask of a martyr for staying with me through my past mistakes.   I was imperfect, an addict, numbing the pain of his mental abuse and lack of real love.  I didn't quite understand that at the time.   I even strayed during our off times.   
Years ago, I found my will to be healthy, and a better person.   
Through it all, he would bring my past up against me whenever he was angry... even using it against me with our children... Because, he was the martyr who ""saved"" me, who never strayed, I deserved to pay penance and be kept in a virtual prison.  I've worn the scarlet letter for far too long.   
For a couple years now, I've known about the dating profiles,  I had my suspicions for a long time, but no proof.   A year ago, caught him sexting and planning to hook up with a woman. .. That was of course blamed on my past.   I've seen a few other attempts since then. 
Now, I've gotten the bombshell.  I had a conversation with is secret girlfriend of 15 years; longer than our own relationship, by a couple years.   She was trying to contact him to inform him that she had tested positive for an STD.  He doesn't know that I know.  He's going about acting completely normal.  He has no intention of telling me. 
I'm confronting him next week, after I get my blood work.  I don't know for sure what will happen, but I do know that his facade of the martyr will be broken and the hypocrite will be revealed.

Ok, to keep it simple, I'm 24 & have been sexually active since I was 16. I had one long term partner but the sex was always focused on him. I enjoyed it but never felt like I even came close to cuming with him.

My new partner (been together 7 months) is more focused on me. We have a good sex life (2-3 times a week minimum), and he usually tries to get me off but can't. 

We decided to play with a toy and got a bullet vibrator to use on me. Now, from my knowledge (and I like to think I would know), I have never cum before. This one night however, he played with me with the bullet until I was practically convulsing. I couldn't control my body and in the end I think I might have cum. I was so exhausted after the feeling, however it almost felt like I peed a little.

Two weeks ago a friend of your sister's told you they had seen me at a nightclub and you berated me for two hours straight because you thought I was out to fuck guys. I never went out, it was just your shitty sister's fabricated story. Why do you believe her? You know she's a horrid human being who doesn't like you. And I'm your gf of 3 years. Then you said ""I believed you all along, I knew my sister was lying. I just wanted to be sure"". What a shitty fucking excuse.

And today? Today I had to go to group therapy at 6. You messaged me you loved me at 5PM. Then at 5:30 you messaged me again saying I don't care about you and that I'm cheating. You know I abhor cheating and haven't as much as looked at another guy since three years ago when we started dating. This continued for more than half an hour, while I just cried and screamed in front of a fucking PC because I cannot understand your train of thought. And I cut myself even though I haven't done so in months. And our daughter and my mom were worried, and I got late to therapy. And you said you loved me and everything's alright, but you're scared of losing me since you think I'm not ""completely [yours]"". Because I brought up the topic of swinging when we're older - a topic you've brought up several times before.

And now? Now you're just bringing up topics to fight with me. Like saying, out of nowhere, that I don't take care of our daughter - when I'm with her almost all the time. I say almost, because you get angry if I'm not Facebooking with you, even though I have a baby to take care of. I cannot be online all the time you're on and sometimes I may take more than one or two minutes to answer your messages.

And now you say that when she turned one last year, I had to leave her birthday party at your house early because I had therapy, and all your family kept commenting on how stupid it was. And you type in all caps, because that somehow gets your point across better, right?

Now I block you, I just want to go to sleep. I'm tired of you. And so you log into your father's Facebook account to ask me if we're over. And when I don't answer you text me.

I want it to be over. I don't want this anymore. You're making me miserable, you've been making me miserable for quite a while, but I always go back. You change for a bit and everything's alright. You blame me for every time we fight, somehow it's all my fault - but I really don't believe you. I know it's not my fault, but you never listen.

Now you're telling me to decide if we're over or not. I say that I don't know, but you say it's one or the other, and then insult me.

We both know tomorrow everything will be the same. I'll never leave you. We have a child together and I'm just not that strong. Tomorrow, or hell maybe even today, everything will be forgotten.

I'm scared he'll think I'm cheating and do something to me, because he has half-joked that he'd beat me up or kill me if I cheated on him before.

While I'm fortunate and grateful that I have a job, I'm very unhappy and on the hunt for something new. My current job is not very challenging and doesn't pay enough for a single mom to make ends meet. 

I went for an interview today and just really screwed it up. This is the 3rd interview in about 2 months, and the 3rd that I've completely blown. I have good experience and pretty good skills (maybe just not as ""refined"" as some others), but I suck at interviewing. While I don't have a problem sitting down and speaking candidly about myself or my experience without being nervous, when it comes to behavioral questions, it's totally deer in the headlights. I've tried to prepare, and I think I've prepared smarter for each subsequent interview, but it's inevitable that I'm asked a question that I haven't considered and then I stumble and freeze up. It's so depressing. I know that I could do a great job for them, but I'm not able to articulate for them the reasons why or give examples to support myself, which costs me any consideration. 

I'm trying to remain positive until I hear back that I'm not being asked to return for another round of interviews; maybe there were some things that I said that really struck a chord with the interviewers. I'm just not very optimistic at this point and I'm beginning to feel like I'm going to be stuck where I am forever because I can't convince other companies that I'm the best choice for the position. This job would have been a great opportunity at an international company with great pay and awesome benefits. It's just what I need right now and I feel like I let it slip through my fingers. :(

Anyway, if anyone has advice, or just wants to commiserate, that's cool. I mostly just needed to vent. Or if anyone knows of a customer service related position (preferably supervisory) in the northern suburbs of Chicago, who wouldn't mind someone who isn't great at interviewing but would work her ass off and do a great job, let me know. :)

So I have this friend who's part of a group of girls who are their own ""crew"" from elementary/highschool, who came to the same college. I came from overseas and kinda slotted into their group. We're moving onto working life now and I don't know about the rest of them but I'm drifting apart and branching out. It's all good, I still love them, but it's just time, and life goes that way sometimes. I also don't click super well with them and need to meet more people with common interests.

This one girl in particular is really flaky. It's to an inexcusable degree. I searched ""dealing with flaky friend"" etc on here and nothing was quite on point because this friend is way extreme. She is known to be up to 2-3 hours late for stuff. She has gone from being late, to cancelling last min, to not showing up with no warning, to cancelling on plans that SHE made where everyone had to work around her availability.. She once just didn't show because she ""just decided to go watch this movie instead"". She also often only reaches out because her boyfriend is going out of town, and then doesn't show and it turns out it's cuz he decided to stay (she's really co-dependent on him). I should have called her out when these things happened (none of the ladies in my equivalent ""school crew"" back home would EVER pull this shit) but I just get so stunned and go ""oh ok... maybe next time then"".

I should also add she has no issues such as depression that I'm aware of, or any kind of social anxiety, or hugely time-consuming commitments or illnesses or anything that are all good reasons for being late sometimes. She is just really unreliable. (except for being really needy in her relationship as I mentioned. Maybe that has something to do with it?! any insights??)

I regret this and take full responsibility for not calling her out on her shit. Because of this ""slow fade"" I see coming up due to transitioning to the next chapter of my life, I probably won't see her much any more (all good, no hard feelings - just time to meet new peeps). But I'm wondering if I should sit her down and talk to her about her behaviour before ""letting her go"". The group of girlfriends I mentioned before -  they've all known each other since they were like 6, they are objectively speaking less mature than myself I think and on top of that they regress a little around each other cuz they've known each other since they were kids. And they are totally complacent and never call each other out on stuff. They can't be bothered talking to that girl about her flakiness because they know she's aware she's like that and they've spent so long joking about it/making fun of her for it that it wouldn't be taken seriously. And - I know this isn't my place to judge or assume - but I honestly don't think they care about each other as much as they think they do. They care in the sense that if one of them had a crisis they would all be there in a heartbeat, but they don't care enough to sit down and have tough conversations with each other to help each other grow. I want to have these conversations with them but they've known each other so much longer I almost feel it ""isn't my place"" and that they would get defensive of each other - kinda like when an outsider criticises family. Like ""Hey my sister's an asshole but she's MY asshole sister and ain't no outsider gets to say that!""

He got around to talking to me about my major, his business, and networking, and then 5 minutes into the conversation he asks me to lunch. My immediate response is “Oh, no thank you.” And I feel that should be enough, but he asked “Why?” and don't remember exactly what came out of my mouth because I was *so nervous* - and I’m still tense right now, *ugh* – but I said something like I’m uncomfortable with that, and he asked why again… and this went on for a couple of minutes. I was getting super freaked and wanted to leave, but I didn’t want to be rude or have him watch me walk to my car or freaking follow me, so I stayed put. Which is also stupid.

After that weirdness the conversation was okay, and he gave me some advice about public relations courses and stuff. I was clearly being super awkward, yet he was nice about it and I used it as an opportunity to be more social, because I suck at that too.

I feel really stupid for just talking to a stranger who could have overpowered me if he wanted to, especially since I was alone and vulnerable. There were no other people walking around when we started talking. And I feel extra stupid for not having the guts to just ignore him from the get-go. The conversation lasted 25 minutes, and part of the reason it lasted that long was because I kept asking him questions to fill in the silence and not seem like I wanted to run away. He gave me his number so I could text him my number and email, and I was like “sure” but I’m not going to do that, even though I looked him up and he is who he says he is.

I’m trying very hard to come out of my shell and be less socially awkward and anxious about every little thing, but I think I put myself in a situation today that could have turned dangerous for me. I stayed in that situation because I am so desperate to be a better person socially that I think I’ve distorted what's okay to try and what’s not, and I don’t know how to be assertive and just say NO. This could happen again and I’ll browbeat myself to stay because I want to overcome the anxiety and grab a networking opportunity, but I think I’ll just keep making bad decisions.

I need advice on how to respond to someone if I get approached like that again. And do you think it was inappropriate for him to approach me like that? Because if he’s as successful as he said he was, you’d think he would know that approaching a lone woman in a lifeless parking lot and starting with “Where are you from?” is creepy. Or maybe I’m being touchy.

**TL;DR: Anxious female, long conversation with strange man in parking lot, please advise me on how to me more assertive and social in a safe way, because I’m clearly not handling this well.**

**EDIT: Your advice is just what I needed, thank you all! This really helped me clear up my own confusion and now I have some useful phrases and behaviors to practice. I'm off to hardcore study for my last final, with a clear head. And good luck to anyone else with finals coming up!**",28,20140424093333,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

My new position is ok. But I am finding at this new store they don't push me to be better ot try to improve my job there or want to promote me like she did. Its a bigger store and I went from being the golden child to the underdog. I suddenly don't see myself getting promoted here for a long time. Pam just called me up.

I don't really know the best place to start so if this gets long and/or rambly, I apologize in advance. I'll try to put in plenty of paragraph breaks. 

In terms of what's relative to my pain right now I have to go back to October of 2010 when I got engaged to my high school sweetheart who we will call T. I took it as an opportunity for personal growth by knowing that I had to dedicate myself to finding a female friend because I would need someone to stand there and be my Maid of Honor. This led me to a girl from our circle of friends who we will call W. She was in the same major as me, she was dating our roommates best friend, she seemed perfect for me in every way. I stepped out of my comfort zone and forced myself to interact with her, ask her to go out with me, and finally I worked up the courage to ask her to be my MOH and she accepted. I thought we were ""platonic soul mates"" and that I had really made the college friend everyone makes who lasts their whole life. 

I keep erasing a bunch of what I type, trying to remember what's relevant and what's not! To make a very long story short, T and W are engaged now. Less than a full year since T and my annulment became official (because of my Depression we were able to get this even though we were married for a little over a year), when he still has a couple of pictures from our wedding on his Facebook, he is engaged to the girl who was my MOH at our wedding. This alone sucks, super super super duper hard. W more or less abandoned me after swearing she wouldn't. Neither of them even bothered to tell me they were getting engaged, I had to find out on Facebook.

So what was I up to during the year that they apparently were falling into some kind of whirlwind romance that made the most cautious guy I ever knew propose after about a year of being with someone? Well, I thought I was having my own whirlwind romance. I met a guy online just a bit after T and I agreed we would file for annulment and it was a great distraction and confidence booster to flirt a bit with this guy through texting and online stuff. Well, once I moved out and found out about T and W I decided that even though it seemed too early to be messing with anything like that, that maybe since T and I had such a platonic relationship anyways for so many years that it was natural. So I met my online dream boat and it was amazing. Fast forward to December of last year and I'm graduating college and moving to be with him. Fast forward a little bit further to now and I've realized I've been controlled, realized that all of the confidence I had built up through having the strength to end my broken marriage has been systematically torn down by the man that I've been loving. 

I realized that I was genuinely beginning to feel that I was crazy and that he was right, I was making all kinds of shit up about things he did that made me feel certain ways. I began to feel that I was too sensitive and emotional. I try to think of what the breaking point was, but there were so many. My sadness always got twisted into being about him. When I confessed how devastated I was about W and T being engaged, all I got was an angry response that I shouldn't care about my ex. I couldn't trust a single thing he did or said as genuine, and I knew I had to get out. 

So that's where I'm at now. I'm supposed to move back in with my parents on Monday but now there is bad weather that's putting all of that up in the air. I'm still living with my new ex and we're both on an emotional roller coaster where one moment we're getting along and being kind to each other and supportive, wanting to preserve as much of the good as possible so we can look back at our time together and smile and the next moment he's condescending and selfish. 

I have no good leads on jobs back home, even though I have applied for about seven. I am terrified of moving in with my parents and never leaving again. I am terrified of never finding love. I constantly feel like screaming, like my skeleton is trying to claw out of my mouth. I cry at my desk. I'll have moments where I feel uplifted and positive, but they go away fast. There are things I need to do, like fill my Wellbutrin prescription and exercise more to help myself get out of this slump but no amount of knowing I need to do that stuff is making me do it. I have no friends that I can spend time with, I have no female friends at all that I can talk to about any of it. I'm too afraid to open up completely to the couple of female school friends that I do still keep in some contact with. I'm too afraid to open up completely with anyone in real life about how abusive this relationship has been. 

I feel like I'm circling a black hole and close to disappearing forever. 

**TL;DR: I'm a mid-twenties girl who's ex-husband is engaged to the girl who was my Maid of Honor and the only female friend I've ever made on my own, my own relationship is over and I'm hundreds of miles away from home waiting to return with no good job leads, and no personal or female support.

t3_23vvhc,"Thinking about making a huge move, but I have a lot to consider and a week to consider it. Advice?","Hey ladies. Okay, so, for as long as I can remember I've wanted to leave Texas. I was born and raised here but I just feel like I'm supposed to be elsewhere. In my junior year of high school, I was really starting to think about colleges and places I wanted to go. Big city is what I wanted. New York. Chicago. Boston. And I was prepared to start applying and getting ready for a new huge chapter. But then, the summer before senior year, my mother died. Everything was turned upside-down. There was no way I could leave my dad or older brother or my niece and nephew who she was raising at the time. So I stayed and started school here in Texas.
Fast forward to January 2013, going into my second semester of freshman year. My dad and my brother Cody (father to the niblings I mentioned before) decided to up and leave to South Texas to work in the oil fields (cliche, I know). Let me just give some back story on my bro: Cody has never been father of the year. He had my nephew when he was 15, and my niece when he was 16, and still at 25 he has yet to step up and be there for them. So, since my mom died, these kids have been living with their mother, who's a complete basket-case herself, and their grandmother, who is doing her best. SO, after my dad and Cody left, I made sure to pick up the slack and do everything I could to make sure those kids knew they were loved. 
I got a great job for an 18 year old, moved into my own apartment, and started making a little life. I had a schedule perfectly aligned and money specifically set aside where I would get the kids every third weekend. During this time, we'd go to the movies, Lego Land, museums, swimming, aquariums, plays, and basically anything that would make them know that this time with me was special. But then, my dad and brother came back. By this time it's October and I'm refusing to let the kids see the father who hasn't contacted them in 9 months. These amazing children don't deserve to be on this roller-coaster of emotions. But alas, I can't hide them forever, and they finally got to spend time with Cody. Since then, things have been okay. They've had a lot of fun with their dad and he seemed to be getting a little better. But I've seen this before, and once again, I was right for thinking it wouldn't last. Last week, Cody moved 3 hours away for a job. Do his children know yet? No. Guess who has to tell them? Me. And guess who just got accepted to UMASS Boston with everything paid for and doesn't know what the fuck to do?

Me.

So, everyone, I'm asking for your input. Do I stay, or do I go? If I go, I'll 100% make sure that I'm accessible to those kids. I'll call, Skype, pigeon-gram, whatever I have to do. But if I stay, I'll be able to get them whenever I want and show them how much I love and care about them. This is the hardest position I've ever been in. Please help. 

TL;DR Always wanted to move away from TX, and I have just been offered to attend UMASS Boston with everything paid for. But, my niece and nephew live here and the thought of one more person leaving them kills me. Need advice.",2,20140424141958,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I've always been a bit of a tomboy, but I do like girly stuff too. I wear makeup, but usually just foundation and mascara. I dress in t shirts and jeans, but tight fitting and girly. Now this isn't to say that lesbians do the opposite of these things or that straight girls wear makeup and dresses, but this will be a factor later so Im mentioning it now. Anyways, about two months ago I decided to take the plunge and do a pixie cut. (It doesnt look great, I think I have too round a face but that's besides the point.) I am off at school, so my mom only saw facebook photos and she calls me up to talk about it. 

She tells me she likes ""the new me"" and after a bit of normal back and forth she asks if there's anything else new I'd like to tell her. I say no and ask what she means, and she basically says that she has suspected since I was very little that I was a homosexual and that she knows it can be hard to tell people about but that she loves me and supports me. I tell her a little shocked that I am not gay, and she says ""whenever youre ready to talk about it, I'll be here."" It was weird, but I brushed it off and reassured her I wasn't gay. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and I'm home for a visit and my dad starts talking to me about boys. I have never had a boyfriend (I'm 21) and he laughs and says ""Well, don't worry, there's plenty of boys out there."" Then pauses, and adds ""You know, there are plenty of girls out there too. Your mother told me you were not interested in talking about it, but whoever you bring home just know we will be happy."" This led to a huge fight with me practically yelling at them that I do not like girls and never have and hem exchanging glances with one another and saying that they accept me no matter what. I say can you accept it if I'm straight? My mom just folds her arms and says ""Can you?"" and tells me she just wants me to be happy and to find happiness no matter what anyone says. She brings up the way I dress, that I never want to dress ""girly"", that I have had no interest in men, and that when I was little I used to say I was going to marry Ariel as opposed to my sisters who all liked John Smith, Prince Edward etc.) I give up at this point and just say ok. 

They didn't bring it up again, and it cooled down a bit until Easter. The family was grilling so people were milling back and forth from out to inside and eventually I was outside alone with my uncle. He asks me about school and stuff, I ask him about work. The normal. Then suddenly he says ""If you were gay no one in the family would say a word. You'd just be my gay niece! I'd be proud to have you as a niece, gay or not."" I didn't even respond to him I just went inside and confronted my mother. 

By this point I was so frustrated I just began to cry which she took as some kind of ""please, help me come out of the closet"" and said she had even talked to my grandparents about it and they promised to be respectful. She told me not to worry, kept consoling me all while I was so frustrated I just kept crying and crying. I left without even saying goodbye. Yesterday was the first time I talked to my mom since, and I sent her a very long text basically explaining that I was not a lesbian and to stop bringing it up because it was embarrassing and confusing. She replied ""I love you so much, always. No matter what."" 

Still seems to me she thinks I'm a deeply closeted lesbian. I dont know how to deal with this. My entire family is very conservative and on one hand I'm touched that they would be so accepting of me, but on the other, I really am not gay, and it is hurting my feelings that they think so.

t3_23x33m,"[UPDATE] Tonight my dad beat me up. I have no idea what to do...","[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/23hvwl/tonight_my_dad_beat_me_up_i_have_no_idea_what_to/) was my original post from a few days ago. 

So the morning after the assault happened, I ended up packing up a bag and going over to my ex-boyfriend's house, and I've been here ever since. I cancelled my bank account that my dad was a co-signer of and made sure I signed up for direct deposit for everything so I don't have to pick anything up, and I'm currently looking for apartments. No one in my family attempted to contact me for about three days after. We ended up talking to a police officer and reporting the case, and basically he said that it's not extremely likely that the case will actually get charged, and apparently that is how it is for most domestic violence cases unfortunately (especially since I didn't have more evidence than a couple small bruises). So that didn't sound too promising. After reporting the case, the officer called my dad and told him that I had filed a domestic violence case against him, and the day after my mom wrote me an email saying the things you would expect a mother in this position to say: she wished it had never happened, it's tearing the family apart, drop the charges, I wont be able to go to law school, etc...she said that my dad was very upset that I had pressed charges against him and that they could lose everything. She was *still* on my dad's side after all of this and I couldn't believe it. I wrote her an email back last night telling her *my* side of the story, because I don't really believe that my dad told her everything that happened, and why I cannot drop the charges and that I think I made the right decision. Almost immediately after I sent the email, my family repeatedly tried calling my cell phone, and I didn't pick up a single time, nor do I intend to for a while, or ever. 


So basically what it comes down to is, I'm scared. I really don't know what the outcome will be in all of this. I realize it is inevitable that it will tear my family apart, as I can never live with my parents again. I also realize that it is extremely important that I cut any financial ties with them. This means paying for grad school on my own, and they will probably stop paying for my insurance. I can't let them blackmail me with money anymore, like they did with my undergrad education. And who knows, maybe I wont even talk to them or see them again. I just don't know what will happen. Also I should mention that my dad still has not tried to apologize, even through email. I really think they still believe that I am at fault and not my dad. I think I may have mentioned in my original post that my dad has never apologized to anyone in my life. He's *always* right, no matter how badly he fucks something up; it's ALWAYS someone else's fault. I'm starting to speculate through all of this that my dad might actually have narcissistic personality disorder, and I really want him to get help for his issues. My goal isn't necessarily to get him thrown in jail. All I really want is for him to see why how he treats people is wrong, and eventually change his ways.


So anyway, I'm scared for a few reasons: I fear that my dad is probably really angry right now, and probably taking his anger out on my mom, so my mom feels forced to comply with whatever he says. That is what I imagine is going on. I feel bad that my mom is probably really worried about me and I don't want her to worry. I want her to know that I'm fine and I'm more worried about *her*. I also really dread going back to the house to pick up the rest of my stuff. I plan on going back in a couple weeks, probably during the day time, so my parents wont be there. I guess I'm kind of scared on the off chance they *are* there. I'm not planning to tell them when I'm coming back, because I know they'll be there if they know when I'm coming. I thought about bringing one of my male friends with me, because I know that in the off chance that my dad is there, he wont try to pull anything if there is a non-family member present. Unfortunately I can't bring a police officer, because they will only stick around for a limited amount of time, and I would need a while to pack everything up. I just want all of my stuff back and I think I would feel a bit more at-ease. I hate sitting here worrying that my dad is trying to destroy it or something.


Other than that I just really have no idea how this will pan out. I figure my dad will act in one of two ways, based on knowing him for 23 years: 1.) he will go (or has gone) absolutely ballistic and rage on my mom and brother, and be absolutely furious if he sees me again (for example if he sees me while I'm picking up my stuff), and maybe try to assault me again. Or 2.) he wont directly apologize or talk about the incident again, but he'll do something like buy me a really expensive gift, like a piece of jewelry, to try and ""make up"" for it, and get me to drop the charges. So, essentially a bribe. And then he'll use that to justify any of his bad behavior in the future. If you didn't read my original post, justifying abusive behavior with money is very common with my dad.


So that is the current status of my story. If anyone has any advice for me, feel free to say so, as I really have no idea what I'm doing here...",69,20140424213115,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

My family, although I love them, have terrible relationships with food. They are all very large, and I was overweight all through high school until I moved out and became self-aware of what I was eating. 

They don't eat complete crap all the time, but they buy a lot of cheap, easy food, and they have three portions of something when they should be having one. They don't understand calories, or portion control, or anything like that.

So I have hit my goal weight, with the help of gym and reinventing my diet. I'm slim, but I'm well within the healthy BMI for my height. Now my family have started bursting out the ""concern"" when I go to visit. I eat normal portions, they eat triple, and they start getting ""concerned"" when I refuse extra. The fact I no longer eat dessert is a bad sign, the fact I count calories is a bad sign, my sister called me a ""twig"", my dad asked me if I was ""anorexic""... etc.

They simply are deluded as to what a normal, healthy female body looks like (as in, even when I was overweight, my family saw me as normal, and I believed them).

She died 2 weeks ago. Her brother called the next day, but I didn't answer because I didn't feel like talking. I don't go on Facebook much so I didn't find out (we don't live in the same state) until I happened to be talking to one of my girlfriends and my friend Collin also called. My girlfriend said you should answer you know Lauren died right? My heart dropped. She was so young. 

I know it's wrong to cope like this, but I'm drinking. I haven't eaten in 2 days. I slept all day today. I'm fucking heartbroken for her. Drugs were such a struggle for her. She shot up cocaine. Last year she was in the hospital for a month and had heart surgery for endocarditis. She was doing so great after that. She was a teacher. Smart and really kind. She never had a bad thing to say about anyone, but underneath there was a sadness.

Then I feel worse because when Collin called I blurted out Lauren's dead? Why didn't you tell me? He said I tried to call you. Now I just feel like an asshole. A sad angry asshole",17,20140424181241,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_23wb8m,"Feeling demoralized about my hairy vulva...","Hi 2XC, I am posting here as I know the community is very understanding. I always knew that porn never set the right example in terms of genitals apperance so I never compared myself to those standards. Hence my understanding was that my genitals were probably average-looking, maybe a little bit on the hairy side... until I did obstetrics/gynecology as a student.

Having seen more than a hundred vaginas by now, from a wide range of ethnicities, I can say that my hairiness is truly out of the norm.

Let me explain how mother nature cursed me. I always keep my vagina shaven, trimed or waxed, but the rate at which hair regrows is phenomenal. If I shave, I already have 5mm by 3 days. If I wax, it takes about 2 weeks for half of the hair to regrow but with a much higher side effect of ingrown hairs. I have to exfoliate furiously everytime I shower, or if I don't I get ingrown hairs with pustules, sometimes bordering on small abscesses. Trust me I have tried not exfoliating at all, mildly and extensively and there is a clear inverse correlation. 

What I have never seen in any other woman so far is the sheer density of very thick dark coarse hair. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that each follicle is spaced less tham 1 mm apart, often times with 2-3 hairs growing out of the same hair follicle. 

As I said, I keep everything trimed or shaved but the density and thickness is clearly out of the norm.

I am very demoralized by all of this... I am afraid of being judged unless I shave daily to hide this problem (which is impossible timewise). 

The worse thing is that you would never imagine that as the rest of my body is not very hairy at all. My arms and legs have very very pale thin hair, and I don't even have to bother shaving my thighs. I also have quite few arm pit hairs. For context, I am a thin short Caucasian female in her twenties.

Before anyone tells me to get tested for PCOS, I think this is highly unlikely as I am quite thin (BMI 19), not hairy otherwise and have sharply regular menstrual cycles (literally precise to the day). 

I am very tired of all this hair removal... Should I get laser treatment? Anyone's thoughts or experiences in a similar situation? :(

t3_23wdwe,"Met the greatest guy ever, and now I need to dump him","Hello, ladies. I apologize in advance if this seems crazy/trivial, but I have no close girlfriends to talk to right now and am hoping you can offer advice and perspective. 

About 2 months ago I met this guy on OKCupid, we hit it off right away, he was super good looking, I couldn't believe my luck. We met about 2 weeks after our first chat, he brought me flowers (I'd never gotten flowers from a guy before!), was extremely gentlemanly, and sweet. I've never had to guess how he feels about me, always tells me how pretty I am, and is so respectful and thoughtful. He treats me how I've always wanted a guy to treat me since I've been interested in dating.

But I feel nothing. Over the last few weeks I have felt progressively less and less for him, and he's done nothing wrong. At first I thought maybe it's that he's awkward? Am i expecting things to be how they are with my best friend (who is a guy)? But it took forever for us to be comfortable. Do I have to wait with him too? I'd feel better about him once he held my hand or kissed me. So, as you can imagine, I've been quite confused. 

Well, I just got home from a date with him and now I know i have to end it. We went to the movies and I found myself hoping he wouldn't be affectionate, and when he was I felt nothing at all. It felt so wrong. 

Am I broken? Because that's how I feel. How can I feel nothing for the sweetest, most thoughtful man I've ever met?  And how do I do this?? I've never broken up with someone, and all i want to do is run. But i know that only makes things worse.

An ultrasound yesterday confirmed that I am about 6 weeks pregnant, and the IUD was still in place, but baby was doing well with a little flicker of a heartbeat. Today I went to my doctor to see if the IUD could be safely removed and, sadly, it isn't a possibility.

There is about a 50% chance of losing the baby, and I can't even think about what would happen if I was part of the unlucky 50%.
I've searched the internet for support, and I found a few success stories of women carrying to term and having completely healthy babies, but there are just as many terrifying stories of miscarriage and stillbirth.

I went to the gyno yesterday, it was my second time needing my ""lady bits"" examined. I saw the same doctor that I saw last year, so I didn't feel too nervous. Last year she was really sweet and understood me being nervous. She did the exam really slow and told me everything she was going to do before she did it. Sounds great, right? Not this time. The exam started normal, questions, breast exam, yadda yadda yadda. When it came time for the pelvic exam/pap, she put the clamps in without warning. To me, it felt like she was shoving them in without any lube or anything! I was already tense, and it made me tense up even more and grab the handles of the exam table and back up. I told her what she was doing hurt, and she actually said to me ""I'm almost done."" When it was over I found out the was so forceful she made me bleed, and I was in excruciating pain all day. 

I feel like she was very rude and unprofessional, and I don't know what I can do about it.

t3_23yiqk,"We're seeing each other, but he treats me like a friend...?","I need some advice...

Last night was the first time I had a sexual experience more than kissing with a really nice guy who I have been seeing for about 1.5 months. I first became interested in him because he was just so easy to talk to and to be around. I felt like I could be myself around him, so I pursued him by asking him out, texting him first, trying to flirt. Pursuing a guy was new for me, but I felt like all the extra work was worth it.

We are both college students and while I have had a couple boyfriends and hookups, I'm not extraordinarily experienced. The guy I'm seeing however, has never dated anyone at all. I'm pretty sure I was his first kiss, which I'm fine with. However, I am not fine with doing all of the work and with getting almost no reaction out of him when I flirt or try to get close to him. Everything I do that is remotely flirty or romantic he ignores, avoids, or acts like it is just friendly. For example, we were cooking dinner together recently and he was looking at something. In order for me to see what he was looking at I stood slightly closer than normal to him... and he moved away. This happens constantly. When we're at parties, we dance like we're friends. We've never held hands while walking or watching a movie. Whenever it comes time to say goodbye, he backs away from me or walks away like everything is chill. We've only kissed twice, once last night (we had been sitting in my bed snuggling for like an hour and I had to ask ""will you kiss me?"" and then he kissed my forehead once before I teasingly said ""Oh come on, I want more than that""), and once when he was in my room about a month ago. I'm frustrated. All the really strong feelings I had about him and the ability to feel comfortable to be myself around him are mostly gone. Not because he's not nice, but because every advance I make on him is shot down and I feel like he doesn't get me like a romantic partner should. I know he has feelings for me, as our mutual friends have told me, he always makes time to see me, and he is always seems happy to be with me, but he doesn't express those feelings with words or actions (except very rarely, like last night and even then only minimally). 

I want those strong feelings to come back. He is a great person, but I need more romance and more openness and essentially, I want to feel pursued too, but I don't know how to do that. I want to bring it up and talk to him about how I feel like we act like we're only friends when we're clearly both interested in something more. I've been trying to for a while, but I don't know how to do that or when a good time would be. Help?

My second, slightly different problem, which is me just probably freaking out, is that last night I gave him a hand job (after he had already stuck his hands down my pants, I don't understand why he could do that but not kiss me...why??) and he came. We wiped it up with paper towels and then he tried to reciprocate for me, but now I am worried that he might have had cum on his hands... He didn't actually stick his hands into anything important and I'm pretty sure all the cum had been wiped off his hands (if he even had any on them), but now, of course I am worried about getting pregnant. Is that possible?

t3_23zcnc,"I dont know that i want to honor my two weeks notice at a job anymore. Im not sure how to go about doing it or if i should just stick it out, any advice would be amazing.","So last august i got a job as a receptionist/manager at a nail salon. At first i loved the job. It was only weekends but i was told that i would get a 4 day schedule soon, and each shift was 10 hrs so it was decent. I was also making 3 above min wage which isnt that much but i was told that i would get a dollar increase a year or so. My boss is a little old man and he works the other five days a week. Hes the owner and he is pretty stressed out often.

About 7 months ago he cut my pay. When i realized (because he doesnt give actual pay stubs) he told me that he couldn't afford to pay me as much. He then cut my hours and only has me working on the weekends again. He also has me work 9am-7:30/7:45 and doent pay me for that last 45min. Last month i went out and got another job that gives me 30 hrs a week and works around my school schedule. Its every week day and i get weekends off, something that I've never gotten in the 5 years that ive been working. After two weeks of working there i went and told my boss at the nail salon that i was putting in my two week notice. He essentially told me no, that i can quit but he needs me to work until may 10th. I said that i would work this upcoming weekend (tomorrow) and the weekend of the 10th and thats it. He replied with attitude saying that he needed more than a two weeks heads up. I am fed up and no longer want to keep my two weeks. He has me running the store, supervising the girls and dealing with the customers all for 25 cents over minimum wage and its not worth it to me anymore. I dont need the reference and every day that i work there i feel so drained, im ready to stop dreading the weekends. I just dont know what to say because i am a bit of a push over and i dont want to hurt his feelings or stress him out, and i dont know if i am okay to end my two weeks early or if i should stick it out.

t3_23ymsl,"Yesterday afternoon was a little rollercoaster of emotions.","You know how sometimes, when you discover something out of place, your brain will jump to horrible, terrible things? That happened to me yesterday as I preemptively placed my Diva Cup before starting W1D2 of C25K. In the process I noticed something not quite right with my labia... There were bumps, and not little ones either. Cue the brain jumping to horrible, terrible things.

I came out of the bathroom and told my boyfriend that I was pretty sure something was up with my genitals. Did I mention I started crying? I started crying. Not so much because something seemed to be going on with my body, but because of a conversation me and my boyfriend had had before we started dating. You see, we met online and got to know each other pretty well in the time leading up to my move to the same area he lived in. This included having some of the more difficult and important conversations such as what each of us want out of life and a relationship (we match up so well, it was crazy amazing) as well as STD testing and deal breakers. Sexual health is super important to him (score, right?!) so he had always been pro-active about being tested and ensuring his partners are as well since he never wants to wind up with something he could have for life (see why I was starting to freak out yet?). I divulged that I had been treated for Chlamydia in my past, but that I would get fully screened again to be extra sure everything was good (and I did...twice!).

Here we are now, about to celebrate our one year anniversary and I have it in my brain that I might lose him over whatever is going on. After I tell him what I discovered, he held me and told me he loved me and that it was probably fine and that I should make a doctor appointment to have it checked out. Instead of waiting, I decided that I would take advantage of having a Planned Parenthood a block away from where we live. He offered to come with me and after telling him no at first, he offered again and I took him up on it.

Before I continue, I must say that I loved the staff at this Planned Parenthood. I didn't feel judged or uncomfortable and they were just so helpful and nice to me.

Anyway... Genital warts. I didn't cry when the doctor told me about it, but I did when she answered my question about him probably being exposed to it, especially since we don't use condoms. She answered all of my questions: ""Is there anyway to estimate how long they have been there?"" (""Not really, but with how small a lot of these are it really could only have been a couple days"") ""Would this have shown on an STD screening?"" (""No."") When asked if I wanted to start treatment on them, I decided to go for it and have them frozen. 

Let me tell you, not fun. All in all, she said there were about 30 of them, most of them small and I had them near my anus as well. As she lit my bits on fire with q-tips, I thought about how I would tell my boyfriend when I went back out to the waiting room and how he might react. I had been in there awhile and he was probably worried. The doctor had given me a piece of paper with information on genital warts with treatment options and info on how to protect your partner. Essentially, there is a good chance that he now has this strain of HPV in his system (if he didn't already have it before, who knows?). Until mine clear up, it is best to use condoms to reduce risk and to help mine go away even faster. 

As we walk out of Planned Parenthood, he asks me what was up. I handed him the paper the doctor had given me and he glanced through it. I told him that I asked if this would have been something that would show up on a screening and what her answer was and that he was most likely been exposed.

His response? ""No big deal, honey. I love you."" And cue giant fears just  flying away. While he was in the waiting room, he read a ton of pamphlets, including one on genital warts, so he already had a lot of the facts when I told him.

I think the biggest downside for the week about this, aside from the burning genital region, is the having to put of continuing C25K until I am healed up! I am also pretty sure bowel movement will suck for awhile as well...",4,20140425112409,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23z1oe,"Would love some female friendship advice!","Get ready for a REALLY long story /r/TwoXChromosomes. I think this might be novel length.

So I've been best friends with this girl since the day she was born. No joke, I don't remember a time in life where she wasn't there. We've always been close, but my mom hasn't ever liked her much. According to my mom, she's always been manipulative. Anecdotal evidence: we're about 6 years old, she takes my drawing I was really proud of, tears it up, gets mad at me for crying. I end up going and giving her a hug to get her to come back and play with me. Obviously we were kids, but this just demonstrates how it always is with her. She does something, I get mad, she gets mad at me for being mad, I apologize.

We attended the same middle school (6th-8th grade), and our relationship completely deteriorated. I know middle school is just a bad time in general, but this was horrendous. Any time I made a new friend, she would tell that friend something so she would stop hanging out with me. Some time between 7th and 8th grade, I stopped talking to her. Made some of my own friends, and actually had fun. Then she decided to come back, ""apologize,"" and hang out with me again. Introduced herself to my new friends, and later spread terrible rumors about me. Didn't speak to her until after middle school ended, and we had gone our separate ways for high school.

At this point, I had wanted so badly to COMPLETELY get out of that relationship. She hurt me so many times, made me cry. I would have done it too, but we attend the same church and sunday school. Anytime one of the adults or our other friends realized we weren't speaking, we would get a lecture on how we shouldn't let such a good friendship go to waste for some little thing. Not to mention our families are really close, and it would get really awkward when they came over and we didn't talk to each other. I always got talked into being friends with her again.

High school was better, didn't see her as much as I used to. Had casual conversations, and kept my guard up. She would always ask me to hang out, and I would make some excuse. During 11th grade, she sent me a huge email, apologizing for everything she had done, and asking me to forgive her. I was a little wary, but I thought that maybe she had changed, and that she deserved another chance. We started off okay. I realized she was always lying to me, but they were usually petty things, so I let them slide.

Fast forward to now, 3 years later. In my opinion (I'm not sure how valid an opinion that is, since I tend to play things as safe as possible), she has super reckless behavior: driving all over the city a day after getting her permit (got in the car with her once, within 10 minutes she had nearly hit 2 cars), going hiking in abandoned areas by herself (this especially scares me, a girl was randomly raped and murdered in that area 4 years ago), walking around the bad parts of town by herself at night, etc. She told me she constantly picks fights with her mom so she won't ask where her daughter is going when my friend wants to go somewhere her parents wouldn't approve of. About a month ago, she texted me, asking how I would react if she died. I told her my world would fall apart, because everything constantly reminds me of her.

So two weeks ago, I got really angry with her. More angry than I think I've ever been, and I don't know if I was justified in my anger. I found out that she's been not only lying to me (I wanted to go out of town, she said she would come, said her parents said she could, bailed on me as I was walking out the door, saying she just asked her parents and they said no. Just one of many events.), she's been telling her parents she's out with me when she's not, telling our friends horrible, horrible lies about me. I had a total flashback of middle school, and walked out.

This is where I may have messed up. I'm always worried with her recklessness, but I was angry too. Three days later, I called her (very rational) sister out of state and told her about her sister's behavior. I said I didn't want to rat her out, but I wanted to make sure that someone knew what was going on, especially if something happened while she said she was out with me and really wasn't. Honestly, I was scared that if something DID happen, I would regret not speaking up when I had the chance. So I'm not exactly sure what happened after I told her sister, but the next day my friend shut down her Facebook, deleted me off Instagram, and stopped replying to my texts. I thought it was funny/weird how I was the one who should've been giving her the cold shoulder for lying to/about me, but she cut me out instead.

So, did I overreact? Did I do the right thing? I'm honestly exhausted with dealing with her, and I have no interest in rekindling our friendship. What should I do?

TL;DR: Bad relationship with lifelong bff, she constantly lied, I got mad and tried to get outside help, may have royally fucked up.

Also, I forgot to add that even when we were on good terms, she would randomly stop speaking to me for weeks at a time. When she would come back and I asked her what happened, she'd just say it was personal. Once though, she told me her mom compared her to me and she got mad, so she stopped talking to me because of that.",3,20140425135514,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23ynf5,"Frustrated with my body type and sex","I will start with saying this is a rant. This is irrational frustration, and does not reflect my day-to-day state of mind. I also don't mean to offend anyone, and I'm sorry if I do, or if I sound petty or childish.

Ok, my body is basically like this: 5'7"", around 145 lbs, small boobs, small waist, wide hips, big butt, thick thighs. From a fashion standpoint, I don't like it. Sexually, I sometimes love it, but most of the time I hate it.

I like having my breasts played with, complimented, you know, getting positive attention. It turns me on. But, since they're small, they don't stand out. So they sit there neglected during sex, or they receive a little attention during foreplay, almost as if it's common courtesy to acknowledge them for just a minute or two.

What is big and stands out? My butt, of course. All guys I've been with rave about my butt, they compliment it, they touch it, blah, blah blah! But it does nothing for me. It doesn't turn me on. It only makes me feel self conscious about a body part that generally is considered ugly among the collective female psyche.

The thing is, while I know communication during sex is important, I don't like asking for the attention. It just feels forced. And if a guy doesn't like my tits enough to go there on his own, then I will feel shitty forcing him to pay attention to them. It's like forcing broccoli on a child just because it's healthy, and they oblige because mommy won't let them play with their favorite toy later, when in reality they want chicken nuggets AND their toy.

My boyfriend is the same. He says he loves my body and I believe him, but that means, of course, that he likes my butt. He's always complimenting my butt, saying how he loves that it's big and my waist is tiny by comparison, etc. 

One would think he's a butt guy, but no... he's made (not really sexual) joking comments about other women's/anime characters big breasts, so I know he notices... I also remember when we were just friends hearing him talk with another friend about how some girl they both know has big boobs, and how hot they were, etc. So I know he notices, especially when they're big. However, I don't think he's a boob guy either... I like to think he's a ""I-prefer-whatever-you-bring-to-the-table(bed)"" kinda guy, because he's been with all kinds of girls... but still... my boobs feel lonely.

Anyway, I realize this is a case of ""the grass is greener"". It's petty, childish, frustrating... last night we had sex and he didn't touch my boobs, not even once. I kinda feel undesirable, with all the big boob love that society portrays and because I know he notices them. It's stupid. I know it doesn't mean anything. But I really like breast play. I know for fact that given enough love, my boobs can make me orgasm on their own. So yeah... I'm frustrated.",4,20140425113043,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I don't know if anyone can give me advice on this situation.
In the past year my sister(14f) has gone from living in CA with my mother her whole life to living with her father across the US. She has a bad past with her father, but was taken from my mom and ordered to live with her father.

Our home life was not good growing up, my mother is disabled and a drug addict. As a teen I left by choice due to being extremely depressed and her life seemed to change for the better. My sister had a much better life with my mother than I did, and I did not think I had reason to worry, because every time I went to visit things were fine and dandy. I still made it a priority to have a huge positive impact in my sisters life.

Last year it came out that my sister was depressed. She was in the hospital a couple days then required to have therapy. My mother did not follow through. At a counseling at school, it came out that our mother was using meth. I was not aware of this prior.
Long story short, my sister was briefly placed in foster care and a trial was set. My mother could not get clean and within 6 months my sister was sent to her father across the US. It's been 6 months.

The court required her father to move into a 2 bedroom from a studio, get her regular therapy, and have her in an activity she enjoys. He has done none of these. The case is closed, and there is nothing to be done because of this.
She has been in the hospital 7 times because of this. Is more suicidal and self harming. She wants to go to residential care.

I will admit that her fathers hands seem to be tied. He has tried to put her into a residential but his insurance will not cover it and he does not qualify for low income help. He is now touring a school this week that has therapy sessions any time the child needs; this school is for girls with similar issues.

He expressed to me yesterday that he does not know if he can do this anymore. He thinks she can snap out of it. He has lost his job and feels extremely frustrated that she is not willing to do her part. He mentioned possibly having the state take her.
I feel like part of that is because of his frustrations but in the back of my mind I don't know if I should make myself available. During court they would not allow her to be with me because he was a ""non offending parent.""
At the same time, I have a full time job and a toddler to raise.
Does anyone have any advice to give me?
Thank you.

But I hate the progesterone pill I am on at the moment! It is seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend due to it's side effects (it makes me very dry down there and lowers my sex drive!) 

I have set up an appointment with my GP to discuss getting an IUD fitted, but I wanted some advice from real women rather than listen to someone who perhaps may have never personally had the device fitted. One of my main concerns (which may be stupid) is that I have recently started weightlifting and am frightened that squats and deadlifts might dislodge the IUD as I've heard they do move tampons!

For the first few weeks I felt surprisingly good, but then reality kicked in and I began to feel the full impact of being alone. The court date is coming up and recently I’ve been feeling totally shitty, so yesterday in order to try and cheer myself up I got in the car and drove 100 miles to the beach, with the intention of having a nice long walk and then exploring a nearby town, which is the kind of thing I used to do with my ex all the time. It just wasn’t the same though, and after walking around on my own I ended up standing in the rain, staring into the sea and crying. I can’t shake the feeling that nothing is worth doing if I can’t share it with someone, and walking along the beach where everyone else was with a partner or a group of friends or even just a dog, made me feel 100 times more sad and alone.

The fact is, I have nobody to share things with or socialise with at the moment - I ended up very isolated in my relationship, my family are several hours drive away, I love my job but my colleagues are almost exclusively men who are old enough to be my father and I can’t get a dog because of my living situation.

t3_241stk,"Question from a (hopefully) future female scientist.","I am a senior in high school and next year I am going to a science and engineering based university to study biology and math. I've been interest in science since I was a little kid, and decided I wanted to go into biology when I was in 7th grade.  

I've never really felt like I was discouraged from math or science. Maybe looking back on it I was one of the few girls to speak up in a science classroom, but I didn't really notice it at the time. I've had many amazing teachers who encouraged me to keep doing what I loved. I've also had some teachers who would tell me that I wasn't doing well, but that was more often dues to stress or lack of organization, my gender was never viewed as a predictor of my success.
My friends are mostly male. There are a few girls, but the guys do overwhelm the group. Pretty much all of us are either on a science or math team, or robotics, or are programmers, most often a combination. Once again, the fact that I am a girl never seems to be a major factor in our interactions. I am never looked down on for my abilities, nor do I ever feel as if I am being valued more for the way I look and dress rather than for my personality and intellect, I have also never noticed any of the other girls being treated that way. This is regardless of whether or not those girls are in a relationship.  
Next year I am going to be a biology major at Rochester Institute of Technology. I was fairly excited, not just about the fact that I am actually going to be have the chance to actually study biology, but also because of the atmosphere of the school I'm going to. I felt fully prepared to go to a school that was focused on science and engineering, had a high male to female ration, and was also kind of weird and nerdy, because that's what I'm used to. But lately I've been worrying about the fact that I may have a more difficult time there because I AM a girl who is going into a male dominated field (    maybe not so much in biology, but definitely in math). 
I've always been considered smart, but sometimes the combination of anxiety and not being very organized can get in my way. I am very passionate about what I do. Sometimes I will not understand something as quickly as everyone else does, but I will keep trying until I catch up. I'm one of those people who, if I want to achieve something, will put all of my energy into it. And I want to become a biologist. It's something that has been my dream for a long time now, and something I have always been working toward. But I'm worried that once I get into college I will be considered as someone who is less than everyone else because I am a girl, and I am not close enough to ""the best of the best"" to be deemed an exception to the rule. 

Questions:
Should I expect to be treated differently in college?
How?
Is it still common for women to be looked down upon in the scientific community?
Are students more likely to treat me differently or professors?
Is there a way to react to this/prove that I am just as capable?
Any other advice?  

tl;dr I've been interested in science for a long time and never really felt that being female effected my ability to become a scientist in the future. Going to a science and engineering school next year (RIT, if anyone has school specific advice, that would be nice too). I'm wondering what should I expect from college, or should I expect anything.",12,20140426142015,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24129d,"HPV. Feeling bad. Help?","Well, actually, I have two conflicting opinions from two different physicians about my HPV status. I'll explain. 

My ex boyfriend had a genital wart apparently before we met. He informed me of this, and had been treated and had no symptoms by the time we were dating. I also was fully vaccinated with Gardasil, and my doctor told me that my odds of contracting warts was basically nil. 

 One year after breaking up with my then boyfriend, I notice a tiny, tiny bump on my labia that I saw dermatologist twice about. She examined me thoroughly and said that it was not HPV (a wart) and to calm down. 

The tiny bump disappeared in a week, but before then I had taken a photo of it. When I went in for my annual exam with my gynecologist, I showed him the photo and he said it was HPV. He then examined me and said that yep, it was gone, but he still maintains it was ""probably"" HPV because of my history with my ex. 

There is nothing there to take a biopsy now. It's driving me crazy. I've been with my current boyfriend for over a year and he has no signs of anything.

We have been dating for 16 months, I'm 18 and he's 17. I do love him a lot and that's why I need to fix this. 

It's starting to seem like it's all in my head.. Everything that I *think* he does, or I *think* he lies about since I haven't found actual proof. However, with that being said, I still get very upset to the point where I have thought of suicide (that's a whole different problem I need to fix).

I think he does a variety of things that I fear, such as flirting with girls, cheating, to name a few. However, as stated before, I don't have evidence but I **still** feel like he does this and I don't know why. There are points in time where I know he doesn't and I'm confident in our relationship, and then there are points in time where I think I *know* he does what I fear. It constantly changes from those two thoughts. 

I get really sad all the time thinking about the stuff I think I *know* he does and as of the last 5-6 months, I've been continually in a ""fog"" of sadness or something. All we do is fight, I'm guessing because of me, and I want it to stop but I don't know how. 

I accuse him constantly of doing things. There is no end to it. At that time, sometimes it lasts more than a few days, I believe that he does what I have accused him of doing (without no **real** evidence- just the stuff I come up with) and I begin to sort of hate him. I've done this countless times in our relationship. When I do accuse him and we get into arguments, I break up with him and I get into this sort of phase where I say terrible things to him- that I know if someone said to me, I'd be devastated, so I know how he feels- and I'm fully aware of it. It takes me a while to cool down and after that I regret everything. He forgives me because he feels like we can eventually be happy together, which I want to. I want to stop this, I don't wan to do this anymore and I want to treat him right because he deserves it, not the way I have been treating him. He has so much hope for our future whereas I don't. He sticks by me and supports me because he loves me so much and wants me to be happy. He has done so much for me whereas I have not.

I want to fix this twox, but I don't know how. So please help me. Any advice is appreciated.

Of course since he's polite he asks if I'd like to join, but doesn't specify which friends.

It wouldn't be SO bad if we hadn't discussed moving in together earlier and (despite him initiating the talk) he said that he would move in if he didn't have anywhere else but right now he liked his flatmates. Ok, so I'm second choice. I would prefer it to be more that he WANTED to move in than was forced to by homelessness, but what the hell.

**OP tl;dr** Last fall, I had a heart-to-heart with my most trusted mentor about what might be holding me back from landing a tenure-track academic position. He gave me two pieces of advice: (1) ""Remove all traces of your family status from your CV, webpage, and social networking profiles""; and (2) ""replace one of your letter writers"".

I wanted to update because I received so many kind PM's and replies to my original post. I was really frustrated and venting to you wonderful ladies (and gents!) was incredibly cathartic and gave me a lot of strength of resolve. 

I am delighted to say that the job search this round was a complete 180 from previous years. I followed my mentor's advice and replaced one of my letter writers and removed all traces of family status. I was invited to 5 interviews at R1 research institutions and received 3 job offers, one of which was from my top choice school. 

In the end, I think that removing my family status helped me, which is a bit annoying, but a reality. I also think replacing the ""meh"" letter writer helped even more. As one of my mentors said: ""*The application gets the department interested, the letter writers land you the interview, and your interview lands you the job*"". 

In times where the competition is fierce and there are 100+ applicants for each position, I think that every little thing that can set you apart from other applicants, as to be done. I still received a quite a few rejections this round, BUT I ultimately landed the job I wanted. I am feeling tremendously fortunate and excited and happy.

**Girls, what do you do when you're alone?**

I've spent almost the entirety of my adult(ish) life in relationships.
There seems to be the unhealthy pattern of spending too much time together too fast and then sort of becoming inseparable. I've been so dependent on other people, that I've found myself going from partner to partner. **I don't know how to be alone.** I don't want it to be that way!

For the first time, I, a 24 year old woman, am alone. I live with my parents (who stay out of my way, for the most part), but this is the first time I've spent significant time without a partner.

And ... I don't know what to do with myself. It's not even that I have to ""relearn"" how to be alone ... because I really haven't ever been! What do you do? 

Even if you're not single, I suppose most healthy relationships still have ""alone time"". What do you during alone time? How do you fill your days? What are your hobbies? How often do you see friends or go out? What fun dorky things do you do to entertain yourself? 

Right now, I fill the ""void"" (I need to change my perspective- **it isn't about filling a void, its about enjoying alone time!**) by mindlessly and compulsively switching between reddit and facebook, watching Bob's Burgers, and occasionally reading. 

But *I catch myself looking at the time, thinking ""augh, its still so early. What am I going to do until it's time to sleep?"" That's not healthy!*

He's always been a bit childish, but now it's gotten to the point where I don't want to bring him places or hang out with him anymore because he just mopes around. At school I don't want to be near him, and this makes him more negative, because I can't handle it! I've tried asking him what's wrong or whats going on/why he feels like this, but he always has an excuse about his parents making him feel like that.

For example, my friends and I went to hang out at a pool place one night and within 30 minutes of getting there he is sitting in the corner by himself sighing and moping. I'm trying to have a good time so I try talking to him and say, ""Hey, I invited you along so you could get your mind off of things, why don't you play some pool and try to forget about it for awhile?"" And he got mad and told me he ""didn't want to talk about it."" And pouted for hours until I took him home.

Another time he was struggling in math and my friend offered to help him with his homework and my boyfriend said, ""Well it doesn't matter anyways, I'm just gonna screw it up and fail."" This is a regular thing in school.

I want to go to college, he doesn't. I've told him multiple times this is a deal breaker for me, it's the way I was raised and I'm sticking with it. He doesn't take school as seriously as I do.

She has tried multiple brands at the moment, and all of them have had serious negative effects - ranging from impacting her libido and period to mood itself. We've talked about it, and basically, while she does agree to stay on it until we find a better alternative, we both are in search of the easiest and safest method possible with as little an impact on our relationship and selves.

Neither of us are shy of a surgery - we're just worried things like a vasectomy aren't always temporary. We don't want kids now, yeah, but... you know. What if? We've also looked into the those implants (like implanon) and it looks like they often share side effects with the pill. At least she wouldn't have to take a pill every night, but it's still a serious consideration.

I care a lot about her, and I really want what is best for her. What are some of the best alternative birth control methods? We, of course, won't proceed with anything without seeking professional advice. We just both want a really good starting place.",2,20140426212726,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_242wto,"How do you deal with street harassment?","Tonight, my boyfriend and I were on our first date in a long time. I was wearing a cute short skirt and some asshole driving by yelled ""Nice skirt!"" at me - obviously he could have been a lot more vulgar but I think we all know what he meant. My boyfriend was very upset and angry at the guy and he kept apologizing for that happening and asking me if I was okay.

I think he was more upset about it than I was because I've been dealing with this for years just like any woman and I'm sort of... well, I'm not numb to it, but I try to be - otherwise my entire day would be ruined every time it happened. But my significant other was really bothered by it and I could tell he was upset about it for the rest of our date.

Which lead me to want to ask, how do you cope with street harassment? How do you not let it get you down, or not feel ashamed when it happens, or not have it ruin your whole day/night? I know that this is a problem I'll always have to deal with as a woman and I just wonder how on earth I can manage to cope when it happens and not just want to break down and cry.

t3_244mj4,"One week ago, I donated my ova anonymously to an infertile couple. This is my experience. (Quite long)","Before I begin, I will disclose a bit about myself:
I am a twenty-one-year-old soon-to-be university graduate of philosophy and public health, living in the Pacific Northwest U.S., working as a concierge, a maid, a tutor, and a sales associate before I enter graduate school. As someone with an interest and background in ethics as it relates to public health and other areas of social justice, the controversy of choice has always astounded me. I consider all decisions related to conception and childbirth to be of the parents' sole preferences provided that the decisions will not compromise the health of the mother or the total well-being of the child after he/she is born. I am pro-motherhood-by-choice, not motherhood-by-chance.
After having researched infertility and the demand for healthy, educated ova donors, I decided that I wanted to become one. The idea of helping strangers in such a personal way fascinated me. 

The application process:
In November 2013, I applied to a local fertility clinic to become a donor The paper application asked all about my individual and family health history, my education and work experience, my interests, and required that I submit photographs of myself as an infant, young child, adolescent, and of how I currently look. Within a week of submitting my application, the clinic's donor coordinator informed me that they would like for me to be an egg donor and asked me to come in for an interview and physical.
At this appointment I met with two different medical staff: one of whom was a nurse practitioner who performed a full physical and ultrasound, asked about my reasons for wanting to become an egg donor, and explained to me the whole donation process. Another member of the medical staff drew my blood for a Counsyl genetic test and for sexually transmitted diseases. I was informed that I would have to go off my oral birth control medication for two months before they could assess my base hormone levels. Three months go by fine and dandy (having sex relatively infrequently and always using a barrier method of protection), and I go back to the clinic for my follow-up appointment for the aforementioned testing. I learn immediately after my ultrasound that all my anatomy looks good, and a few days later they inform me that my hormone levels are normal. At this point, I am asked to submit a description of myself, my sister, and both of my parents to add to my donor profile. Once this process is completed, I was officially added to the donor registry, accessible only by prospective ova recipients through the clinic's donor coordinator. Included in the profile were the descriptions, my ethnicity, height, weight, education level, high school GPA, blood type, and a picture of me as an infant. Since I had the option to include an adult photo, I gave them one, as I look quite different than in my baby picture! Within three weeks, I was informed that a couple was interested in using me as their egg donor.

Preparing for donation:
From the phone call informing me of my having been picked up to the date of my ova retrieval, the entire process took roughly three and a half weeks. 
On the first appointment, I went in for another ultrasound and blood draw and was taught about my medication administration. The medications for the first two weeks were HcG and Follistim; by the third week I incorporated Ganirelix into the routine; two days before the scheduled retrieval, I took a trigger medication. In addition to these, I was required to drink 4 8 fl. oz. drinks of Nuun/water mixture; 3 whey protein shakes, and 4 8 fl. oz. glasses of water. I had to keep exercise to a bare minimum, refrain from using any drugs or alcohol, refrain from sex entirely, and was told to expect bloating and frequent urination. From the day I started my medications, I had to return to the clinic every two days for an ultrasound (in order to monitor my ova growth) and blood draw (in order to test my estrogen level.) Once I had multiple ova above 18mm diameter and the rest of my ova above 12mm, I was advised to give myself the trigger medication and stop using the other medications. On the final appointment, I signed all of the legal paperwork, and that was it before the retrieval!

The retrieval procedure:
My retrieval was set for 8:45 am two days after I administered my trigger medication. I was not allowed to ingest any food or liquid past midnight the day prior and could not wear makeup, perfume, deodorant, nail polish, or be near anyone who smoked the morning of the retrieval, as the eggs are extremely sensitive. Additionally, I was required to arrange for someone to drive me to the clinic, take me back home, and stay with me for the duration of the day. I asked my boyfriend to do this for me, as he has been extremely supportive of my decision all along and wanted to be there for me in whatever way he could. 
We arrived at the clinic an hour early, so my boyfriend and I were taken to what would be my recovery room. I removed all of my clothing (minus my knee-high socks for comfort and sass) and put on a surgical gown, booties, and a hair net. I waited with my boyfriend in the room on the bed covered in very warm blankets (I assumed to dilate my blood vessels?) until it came time to speak with the anesthesiologist. He turned out to be an incredibly sweet, caring, and soft-spoken young guy who double-checked that I had no allergies then brought me into the surgical room. At this point my boyfriend was asked to leave, so he wandered outside the building in wait for a call from a nurse to come retrieve me. The surgical procedure happened very quickly. I was asked by a nurse to sit on an odd surgical table with padded stirrups that locked my legs in. The anesthesiologist asked if I wanted to listen to anything on Pandora, as it was ""[my] day,"" which completely comforted and me and reminded me that what I was doing was a really good thing. Shortly thereafter, he placed an IV into my arm, administered a pain medicine, which immediately made me feel woozy. After, an oxygen mask was placed over my face, and I had to take big breaths. Within about five seconds, the anesthesia was injected into my IV, and I was asleep. The next thing I remember, I was back in the recovery room wrapped in a warm blanket on that same bed. My throat felt dry so I began to cough, which prompted a nurse to come in and check on me. She gave me treats and a drink, helping me as needed. I was instructed to continue to lay down for another half an hour or more, however long I desired. At this point, I really only felt slightly woozy, like I had just awoken from a long daytime nap--only a little abdominal cramping. After the half hour, the same nurse helped me get dressed into the pajamas I had brought and called my boyfriend to come back for me. I was provided a discharge sheet for my recovery instructions, given a check for my donation, thanked warmly, and off I went with my boyfriend.

The recovery: 
I was told to expect some vaginal bleeding, abdominal cramping, and lethargy for the rest of the day. I didn't experience much of the first two--certainly less than what I would experience during a normal period--but I was extremely tired, so I slept for the duration of the day. The next day, I was back at work with no symptoms beyond bloating. For the next week, up until today, I continued with the protein/water/Nuun routine as advised. And today, as I was told to anticipate, I began my period with a heavier than normal flow. Bloating has gone away, and I feel just as I did before I started the treatment.

Side Effects: 
I was nervous at first about injecting myself every day, twice a day with my medications, but it was actually easy and mostly painless. I bruised something fierce at the injection sites (in my belly fat) and could feel little lumps beneath the area, but that was it, really. Bloating was the only symptom I experienced, which I am told was a result of my having followed the supplemental nutrition routine.

My Overall Impression:
Through the entire process, all of the clinic's administrative and medical staff made me feel welcome, appreciated, and really quite human. Any questions that I had they answered promptly and made my health, safety, and well-being their number 1 concern. At my last appointment prior to retrieval, they even gave me a present for ""being so accommodating and sweet"" throughout the process, which included a thank you card signed by all of the staff that I worked with, a giant NY Times best-selling cookbook, cupcake tins, an an apron. Beyond that, the medication administration really wasn't that bad. The only negative aspect of the entire process was the time commitment, but that was to be expected. I am glad that the donation was anonymous, but I cannot help but want to know a little about the couple as well as whether the donation results in a viable pregnancy. Nevertheless, I regard this as one of the biggest and most rewarding decisions of my life and I would gladly do this again.

I hope that my story helps anyone who may be considering donating her ova, any infertile women thinking about trying IVF, or anyone who's just curious about the whole process. I am happy to answer any questions that you may have. 

Thank you for listening!

t3_243yn6,"A little rant, a little ""Am I wrong for feeling this way?""","Last night I was at a concert (there's a huge music festival going on in my city, it's a lot of fun) and the last band of the night on one of the smaller stages was this bluesy rock band, they were loud and amazing. Some acquaintances of mine were getting a little rowdy and started moshing. No big deal, I'm short and tucked away into the crowd. A couple of my guy friends jumped in and then right back out, just to participate, they got a kick out of being a part of a mosh pit for a little bit. 

I was clearly staying away from the pit, turning my back and bracing if they got too close. I'm barely 5'5"", I had a dress on, and a backpack with my things, including my nice DSLR. It was obvious (or so I thought) that I did not want to get into the pit.

Most of my friends are guys, I have a ton of friends here, this town is great, but I tend to be more relaxed with the guys, I bike around town with a small group of dudes, it's whatever. So I get that they see me as one of the guys. 

At one point I'm being pushed, so I push back thinking it was just someone making their way into the pit. Then I realize that I'm specifically being pushed, by one of my guy friends, into the mosh pit, another friend of our laughs and joins him. I shouted out, ""No, stop!"" and try to dig my heels in. One of them alone are definitely stronger than me, both are taller than me, and with both of them pushing me I definitely have no control. I grab whatever I can, in this instance it's a fellow concert goer, he's tall and built like a brick wall so he doesn't move, I can feel my hand grabbing his arm HARD. He turns and sees me, I shouted ""I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"" and he sees I'm being pushed and goes, ""It's all good!"" A girl next to one of my friends grabs my hand and pulls me to an empty spot next to her. She in an angel and later when one of my guy friends popped up behind us, she made sure it was someone I knew and not just some lurking guy. I need to find her again and buy her flowers or something, she was awesome.

So I am pissed at my two friends. They thought it was a joke. But I know they would have NEVER done that to any of the other girls in our group, just me. I want to talk to them and tell them why what they did was simply not ok. They don't realize how hard they were pushing me. That pit was made of a bunch of dude rowdy dudes, they can handle getting beat on by each other, but I'm shorter and weaker than them. I was pretty tired by the end of the night, and had had a couple beers earlier, so I was relaxed and I know I wouldn't have been about to keep my footing. 

I felt really threatened, I usually feel safe hanging out with guys, if we bike at night I have 3-4 dudes with me, but last night they breached that trust and sense of security. Am I wrong or going overboard in feeling this way?",67,20140427104530,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I've made some changes!

I IMMEDIATELY sprint to the restroom to pee and wipe down. We alternate using/not using condoms or just oral instead of vaginal. I've switched soaps to Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented soap to use down there, baby wipes instead of feminine wipes, no douching EVER, no Summer's Eve shit.

Unnecessary backstory because I need to vent a bit (skip past this paragraph for actual question): 

Summer is coming quickly and soon it's gonna be too hot to wear jeans. Here's the thing: I'm 16, and I've never shaved. There's a couple reasons for that. Firstly, I'm a bit of a late bloomer and my body hair really isn't that thick. This ties into the bigger reason, which is that my mom doesn't support me shaving. She's awfully traditional and European, she never wears makeup, she's never had her nails done, and she certainly doesn't want her baby daughter to start shaving! It took until last summer for me to convince her to at least buy me some waxing strips or something. She's fine with waxing, but I'm kinda tired of it and just want to shave like everybody else. That's why I'm turning to you gals for some motherly advice! 

I've bought myself a Venus Embrace razor and it came with one cartridge. It wasn't the cheapest thing, but I wanted to get myself something that I hope is high quality. Now what I have no clue about is how many times can I use the cartridge? Is it usable only once? From what I gather, you can reuse it a few times, but I'm worried about overusing it. 

In addition, my friends have talked about how washing your legs with conditioner before shaving does wonders. How exactly does that work? Do I wash my legs, then dry them off, then just shave? Or do I shave my legs with the conditioner still on? And do I put moisturiser on afterwards?

I was upfront about the fact that I am asexual from the start, but it's created a mismatch in sex thats been a problem for a while.  Not wanting kids came out later (as it would), and everytime it has come up, he'd be annoyed that I was making a decision on that so early.

We hit a rough patch a couple months ago, caused by my inability to support him in the ways he needed (we're mostly long-distance, but I don't drive, which creates a lot of strain).  We've tried to work on things, and they were seeming to improve.

He is my rock and probably my best friend of anyone.  On Thursday, he told me that he didn't think it was going to work out.  Given that it was in class at the time, I thought I took it okay.  I wanted to go no-contact, but ultimately decided to keep speaking with him, as he had a change of heart on his decision about 12 hours later.

In the discussion we had, it transpires that he thinks that my not not wanting kids (and not wanting to budge on that), and not enjoying sex (I know it is possible for asexuals to enjoy sex; thus far, I'm not one of them) is an indication that I'm refusing to change and clearly just want to be alone for the rest of my life.

I don't know if I should go back to try and fix things again (or if he'd even be willing).  I don't want to feel like I'm lying the whole time, but I also don't want to be lonely for the rest of my life.  Outside of him, I don't really have any close friends.

I'm considering going on birth control and would like to hear your recommendations on what has worked for you with minimal side effects so when I go into my OBGYN I have done some research and can have an educated discussion. I am really only interested in the pill (for probably paranoid reasons I'm sure but I'm sticking to my guns on just pills). Background info below if it helps.

I'm 23 and have never been pregnant but my biggest dream in life is to be a mother. I am so nervous about birth control taking that away from me (don't know why, just am) so I would like some suggestions from women who have had children after being on the pill if possible. I also am not interested in pills that you only have 4 periods a year for this reason. It just seems like its not so good for your body. (Not meant to be judgy. I would just be really paranoid about it for myself.)

I only have one ovary. A little over a year ago I found out (painfully btw) that I had a dermoid tumor on my left ovary which had cut off blood supply damaging it beyond repair. This all adds to my over protection of the ovary/eggs I do have left. I am not on any hormone supplements (the body is a weird but wonderful thing) and have had a regular fluid filled cyst already on my right ovary.

I have always prided myself on not being an emotional person so pills with little to no emotional swing side effects would be awesome--though I know each pill effects each person differently. Minimal weight gain would also be much appreciated.

TL;DR-- Ladies on Birth Control Pills. What has worked for you and why do you like it? What should I really stay away from? What are good questions to ask my OBGYN?",0,20140427134755,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

She is fine with herself as far as most of her self image goes; she's intelligent, athletic, has plenty of friends, etc and she knows her strengths.... but the fact that she's so tall and will almost certainly get taller bothers her. She has said (quite often and with increasing frequency), ""I hate that I'm so tall"" / ""I don't want to be tall"" / ""I wish I wasn't so tall""/etc. The feet thing bothers her quite a bit, too, especially now that it's harder to find shoes. Didn't help that the sales rep suggested she look at the men's shoes....but I digress. 

Of course, I think she's beautiful no matter what... but I'm biased and she knows it because I freely admit to my bias.

Of course, as a typical Dad, my thinking is, ""There's not a whole hell of lot you can do about that, so why are you complaining? Make the most of it! Hell, it's why you're first string on the volleyball team!"".... but she's a 13 year old girl having body issues. I know that's not a particularly *helpful* response.

So, women of reddit that went through something similar..... What things did people do our say that made things better for you at that age? What things did people do or say that made things worse for you at that age? Any advice for me in general?

t3_244r5s,"I can not get motivated to do well in school. I feel so burnt out and depressed over it. Any advice?","Hey ladies. Didn't know where else to go with this but I know you all are accepting and supportive so I figured I'd ask for advice here. 

For the past, oh, three semesters or so, I cannot make myself do well in school and I hate myself for it. All through elementary/middle/high school I was an honor roll student, and my first semester of college (fall 2012) I finished with a 3.5 GPA. But since then, I have had zero motivation at ALL. It's not that I don't care about my grades, or that I don't want to be in school. I am going into social work and want to focus my work on children with mental illnesses and autism. I am very passionate in learning about this field, but not so passionate about going to class, writing papers and studying. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've fought depression and anxiety for some time and tried several medications. My depression hasn't been so bad as of late so I have not been taking any medications (most medications have done terrible things to my sleep habits). I also work 24-30 hours a week at Walmart and suffer from Crohn's disease, which often leaves in me in pain and very very fatigued when my symptoms are at their worst. 

I cannot keep doing this. It's finals week and I put off so much of my school work that I had to call off work for a day just to do papers and assignments I slacked on. It's like I torture myself with this shit and fucking hate myself for it. I want to do well in school, but can't make my lazy ass get up and go to class, or write my papers, or study for the tests.

I seriously need to fix this problem and I don't even know where to begin. My entire academic life my parents and especially grandparents have pressured me to do well and shamed me when I came up with anything below a B and I feel like that has something to do with it. 

If any of you girls have been in a situation like this before, how did you get out? I have no desire to drop out of school, transfer or change majors. I am happy with all that, but have the hardest time motivating myself to do well and I feel worthless. Thanks girls. ",33,20140427160054,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_244xoh,"I started taking birth control today and I am SO HAPPY.","I've known since I was twelve that I never wanted children. My family is conservative, so I was never really able to tell my mom that I wanted to  be on birth control. Over the years, being on BC became this great thing that I would have *someday*, and be a real adult (ha!), and finally be able to have sex (after a couple pregnancy scares in my teenage years, I decided to be abstinent until I was on the pill). 

I also had no clue how to go about getting birth control, but it turned out to not even be an issue- last year I started getting acne, and it steadily got worse until I finally went to the clinic to get it looked at last month. The awesome doctor put me on tretinoin, and so I was actually *required* to be on birth control. I didn't even have to ask for it. I picked up my first pill box that afternoon. So easy! Awesome! I was told to wait until the first sunday after my next cycle, and so for the first time I was actually looking forward to getting my period. I took the first pill today, and I have a year's worth of prescriptions... it was (almost) worth dealing with acne just for this.

A lot of my fellow girl gamers seem to get harassed quite a bit...","So I really hope this doesn't come off as gender-generalizing or inducing drama... I believe this is a legitimate issue. A lot of female gamers get harassed online either through private messaging or chat forums on the gaming sites - particularly RPG games. It feels like women are blamed for ""being beautiful"" and that they should like the harassment because they are getting attention. The most disturbing thing about the harassment of women online to me personally is when it's a minor. I was 17, a minor in Texas, and I posted that very clearly on my profile of a gaming site I had joined. Men in their 30's were still messaging me saying ""Hey beautiful, what's up?"" I was 17 years old, and hounded by mysterious guys much older than me. One guy from India kept trying to get me to marry him. I don't care if they are ""trolling."" It is harassment, and it makes me really uncomfortable to play online games anymore which sucks because I love gaming! I have gotten some obscene messages in my inbox before, as a 17 year old girl, and I still get them now. I guess I just wonder if any other female gamers on here have experienced this, and what were their thoughts on the matter?

I want to make a note now: I do NOT believe for one second that all men are out to prey on women in the gaming community. I just think it happens a lot more than it should - and I believe it is related to the way people view women, and I wanted to hear others' thoughts on it. ",6,20140427234026,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I said something like ""oh I don't have any, I'm only 24, not ready yet"" and they all LAUGHED at me. One was like ""please I had my first kid when I was 16."" Ok that's great for you and all but I'm a little too old now to have my first kid at 16, and how does that even apply to me? Am I some kind of old hag for not having kids yet?

t3_245au3,"Recently lost virginity, been told I'm 'bad at sex' :/","I'm 24 years old and only lost my virginity a few months ago.

It was through casual sex with a guy who is pretty much all about the sex. However, he's respectful, we have chemistry sexually and I wanted something casual myself. I waited a long time to lose it because the right person never came along and well, needs got in the way and I decided to just do it - and he was happy to offer to do the deed.

I never bled at all the first time. Guess years of sports/gymnastics/horseriding sorted that out!  I was so grateful. Beyond that, it was sort of painful. It was actually too painful for me to let him enter me missionary style so I laid on my stomach and that felt a lot better.

We recently started having sex again. In the break between us not sleeping together for a few months, I never slept with anyone else. Now, when we had sex again, once again, found it way too painful to have sex with him on top, missionary style but we persisted anyway because I wanted to.   After we were done, we noticed BLOOD EVERYWHERE. I guess I was in pain because well, it was hurting me! 

Also whilst we were having sex, he found it really difficult to get 'inside' because I was so tense. He kept asking me if I really did want to have sex because my body was so tense/unrelaxed, it was making him feel weird as I didn't seem to be into it at all. He said I was bad at sex or maybe we didn't fit.

The thing is, I WANTED the sex. Mentally, I wanted it! I find him incredibly attractive and I was comfortable with our casual arrangement. I don't understand how I was tense and why my vagina was acting like a chastity belt against itself!

I guess I'm not very sexually experienced, even at my age. I was raised in quite a religious environment and haven't really sexually explored much.  Is this normal? Are most women tense like this? Just looking to see if anyone can relate?

I travelled 9 hours to visit my FWB for a week, where I got my period on the second day. Neither of us like period sex, so there was no sex until the very last night.  
One of the nights I was there I had intense diarrhoea but I was too scared to go poop because it's a tiny unit and there were like 4 people there. I had to wait until morning.  
We had anal sex but he thrusted a bit too hard and my bhole hurt for like 3 days. The whole time we were doing it I was terrified of shitting myself because I've had fucky intestines for a few weeks.  
While I was travelling back home my ear got blocked up, and the day after I woke up with the worst flu I've had in years.  
The day after that, I was running with my dog chasing me and I crashed into a doorframe and broke & dislocated my toe.  
The antibiotics I got for the middle ear infection I ended up having gave me thrush. My FWB was home for easter and, again, we couldn't have sex because my nether regions were on fire from thrush. I tried to give him a BJ but couldn't breathe through my nose because of the flu.  
I think I scratched my clit off, it itched *so bad*.
I was having some weird pink discharge along with the thrush and nothing I read about it mentioned pink discharge. The only thing that said anything about pink discharge was implantation bleeding. Oh shit oh shit oh shit.  
I have Implanon and my FWB also pulls out so there was practically no way I could be pregnant but I was still shitting myself (figuratively, thank god).
The test arrived in the mail today and I'm not pregnant! And the thrush is clearing up! The pink was probably a bit of blood from the scratching. Finally something good.

Some background first: I'm 21 years old next week and due to vulvodynia (fixed now though!) I only stared using tampons 2 periods ago. I'm a swimming teacher so I'm in the pool 3-4 days a week either one or two times a day and I HATE wearing tampons. Over in the tampons thread someone brought up menstual cups and their amazingness.

The question/s:
Those of you that use mensrual cups, what is their effectiveness while you're in the water?
Does it leak at all?
Is it comfortable for lots of movement? (My job is very physical and I go to the gym ~4 times a week).

t3_246q8u,"How do I continue to check-in on my friend who has a verbally abusive boyfriend?","This past weekend a dear friend of mine showed up at my doorstep distraught and in tears. She is a very private girl, but also extremely sensitive, and she opened up to me a lot about her and her boyfriend's relationship. 

The gist of it is that he is very controlling, paranoid and disrespectful of my friend. When he gets angry at her, he yells and accuses her of yelling. He yells over her to make sure she shuts up and cannot get her point across. He will not let her be alone with other people because he is afraid that she will be talking about him. And he has been stealing  her money in various ways from getting her to pay his portion of rent/bills, all meals, and straight up lying to her about needing money for things, but not buying said things.

She spent most of the weekend with me and stayed at my apartment. During this time he (and his mother) called her phone over 100 times. He sent text messages threatening to kill himself, trying to guilt her into coming home. 

Eventually, she did return home, at her own time and pace. 

But when I texted her to check in, I thought the response was really peculiar. I'm afraid that she wasn't the one texting me back and that it was actually her boyfriend. I sent something very vague like ""how's it going?"" and the response was something like ""We are fine. We are resting in bed. We are doing great""

I didn't like that ""she"" used the we voice, and it seemed strange because she never has in the past.

So how do I check in with her in ways that he cannot intervene?

Please advise.

This is a post about marriage and me questioning my actions. I am feeling alternately like a horrible meany and a doormat, and I need some perspective from the Collective TwoX. Here is the lowdown:

I am married to a guy who I really dig. We have been together 7 years total and have one kid together, I had one when we met who he loves and helps raise. Last October he tore his esophagus while eating and had emergency surgery, which was followed by a month in the ICU where he was on a ventilator and unconscious most of the time - he came close to death a few times. He recovered and came home in November. When this happened he was working as a contractor, so did not have FMLA protection, and lost his job. Luckily he had short term disability through the contracting firm, and he was approved through January. Once January came, he was not yet recovered enough to go back to work, but he never called his contracting firm or applied for a disability extension. Now he is more or less recovered, but is still not working or looking for work. 

We have talked about this once, and it was hard. He has a lot of very complex feelings about still being alive, and the after effects of being in the ICU for so long. That was about two months ago and at first I was very sympathetic. But that is wearing thin now. 

Since we have lived together, about 5 years, I have been the primary bacon maker. He was finishing his bachelors, then I had a baby so he was stay at home dad. He graduated last May, then got that job. I'm in grad school, and last year got the opportunity to start teaching - but that meant that I had to leave the bacon making job and take a job making facon - but with the promise of Big Bacon later on. The plan was that he take over some of the bacon making. Obviously, having a big scary thing happen was not part of the plan, but now I feel like I am the one carrying everything still, and that it is going to fall on me for a long time to come. Last week he said he was thinking of applying to grad school now rather than applying to jobs....

I am working two jobs and going to school and hardly making ends meet. I don't know if he just does not realize how hard I'm working or if he just thinks everything is cool...I know that I am not communicating well, but that is part of why I am here. I don't like confrontations, and when I start to talk about money and such, he gets all upset. Then it turns into a fight. I don't know what to say, and could just use some words of encouragement. Maybe some one has been here, and can tell me that everything will be alright.

I was previously on Yaz and was having wonky side-effects i.e. depression whenever I would get switched around on generics.

I've read both positive & negative experiences here and elsewhere on the webz and was seriously worried yesterday when I had sharp pains that send keeling over and crying.

The insertion was pretty painful, and I had on and off waves of worse-than-normal menstrual cramps but nothing that set off alarms until yesterday. As per the suggestion of my MD sister there's not much I can do but max dose myself on ibuprofen, unless I wanted to go to the ER and wait for a specialist and the most they'd be able to do is sonogram and then possibly remove it. I'm out-of-state at the moment for work and there aren't any urgent MD places around. I scheduled a call with a specialist today and an appointment tomorrow for a branch of my doc in the area.  

I've checked the strings and was able to feel my cervix that it's still in there because I'm on my period (never realized how low it sits during that time!)  

Has anyone gone through a week of hell with their IUD then have it be fine?  

**UPDATE:** Spoke to an RN and a specialist at my docs. RN was concerned that my sharp pain and nausea didn't sound normal and put me in touch with specialist.   

They both wanted to get me in to see an MD as soon as possible, they said it's possible it perforated during insertion and/or that my body is getting used to the new hormones/going off my old BC.  

Unfortunately I'm traveling for work and the timing is bad, so I'm going to go see someone when I get in. But specialist said if anything gets worse to go to ER. I woke up this morning thinking I felt fine, but sure enough like clockwork if I don't take ibuprofen, the sharp pain from my tailbone up my spine and nausea sets in.  

Specialist agreed there's not much they can do until the physically examine me then possibly ultrasound me. Fingers crossed that I just might need stronger pain meds for a week or so and that everything is fine. Have an appointment tomorrow will let you all know how it goes, thank you again for the support! <3  ",6,20140428110104,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_2477gt,"My relationship is falling apart and I don't know what to do","I don't know what I'm looking for here, maybe to hear some encouraging words and read some other experiences? Basically my relationship with my boyfriend of almost 3 years is falling apart. I know in my heart that this isn't going to work in the long term but every time I think about this, I just want to try harder but it all falls back to the same pattern.


We really don't have any ""major"" issues other than communication, not knowing how to communicate. Our entire relationship issues can essentially be exemplified by what happened this morning:


My boyfriend is allergic to our cat. He gave me the cat as a present knowing fully well that he is allergic but he has opted to deal with it. I was extremely happy and grateful for the gesture though we did talk about that owning an animal should require a more thorough discussion next time and should not be a ""surprise"".


Ever since we got the cat, he's been having stuffed nose which causes him to snore. The snoring basically got worse and worse so I suggested him to see a doctor. He was basically prescribed anti-allergy med, saline solutions and some nose spray.


This past weekend, his friends from out of town came to visit and stayed with us. We live in a small one bedroom open concept apartment. They slept in the living room. Essentially for the 3 nights starting on friday, his snoring became the worst I've ever experienced. It was so loud that ear plugs essentially didn't do much. I couldn't sleep elsewhere either because his friends were here. On sat night I literally laid awake for 7 hours straight listening to his snoring. I did not get even a hour of sleep and basically crashed the next day/slept after he got up. I tapped him a few times throughout the night when I thought I would literally go insane if he didn't stop. So last night, after his friends are gone, I basically slept in the living room with ear plugs (and can still hear him), but at least I got a few hours of sleep.


So this morning, after a weekend of reading up on snoring on the internet, I asked him to go see the doctor again and see if there's anything else they can do. I didn't specifically told him the things I read on the internet (like sleep apnea) but basically said he's not really sleeping well either snoring like that. His response, like always, is negative. ""It's no use. There's nothing more they can do. I've already seen the doctor. It's the allergies, it's the cost of having a cat. There are no other solutions. The only solution is to get rid of the cat. Do you want that?"" He then proceeds to tell me how his friend's snores can move mountains but his gf never say anything to him but just to leave the room.


At this point I just got so angry. I haven't had a good night's sleep in 3 nights. I haven't been mean about his snoring. I talked to him calmly about seeing a doctor and honestly all I wanted was him working with me to find a better solution, if there is one. But no, of course he doesn't. All he can do is say ""I'm sorry you have to experience that but  I'm doing all I can."" then shot down me asking him to see the doctor. (We live in Canada so health care cost is not a concern.)


I got so angry that we had an argument. I packed my stuff and said I would sleep at my mom's until he's willing to work with me. He then told me to ""not come back"". Then after seeing that I meant what I said, he started to say things like ""I'm not saying I'm not going to see the doctor. I'm just saying you may have to live with the reality of this. When did I ever say I wasn't going to see the doctor?""


At this point I was just so fed up that I left. I don't understand why we can just never have a productive and calm discussion. His response to any of my ""suggestion"" would be to be negative and defensive, then try to take back his words afterwards which made me even angrier. I know we both have issues but seriously I feel like I'm dealing with a child everytime I want to talk about something. 


This argument basically just exemplifies our relationship. I know I can't live with this kind of relationship forever. Everytime I try it just falls back to the same pattern. I want to break it off but I can never bring myself to it. ",4,20140428120648,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

So I brought it up with my doctor on my physical, and she wrote the prescription. ""Oh, by the way, it's pretty expensive"" she says. I knew that, but had only heard stories from the US, so wasn't sure what to expect here (Canada). I ask how much, and she says ""it can be $400 or $500."", Oh, wow. Then she says ""Get it at Costco, I think it's $350 there, and that's definitely the cheapest."" I don't have a Costco membership. But! I learn, from her, you DON'T need to be a Costco member to use the pharmacy! You just walk in and instead of showing a membership tell them you're going to the pharmacy. It's so cool! Meds there are cheaper than other drugstores, the dispensing fee (or whatever it's called?) is less than 50% most pharmacies. 

And today, I learn, the pharmacists there are WAY more competent than any other I've dealt with. I have medical coverage through my work, and my SO has coverage for me through his work, but no other pharmacy has known how to put both through (they just give us the receipt and tell us to send it in to the second insurer. Which isn't always worth it, if the prescription didn't cost too much.) So the pharmacist scans the Mirena. $0.00. She scans some migraine medication. $0.00. She scans my antibiotics. $0.00 (the other prescriptions are unrelated to the Mirena, just they were all on the same page). I'm shocked and elated. I just got over $400 worth of prescriptions FOR FREE. I'll have birth control for FIVE YEARS for FREE. 

I was so excited, I had to tell someone. And my friends and family aren't really the type to want to know about this. And it was many of you ladies who helped me make this decision, so I figured I'd share here. Cheers :) ",618,20140428225429,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Why is it so hard for me to feel happy for him?","Hi ladies, I need your help. And please, unlike the people who love me, be honest with me and don't sugar coat anything! My main question is, am I a horrible person for feeling like this? Just incase someone close to me knows what my reddit account is, I'm going to use a throwaway.
  
So let me explain my situation. A while ago I dated this sweet, loving guy that I met in college. We dated for the next 3 years and I can honestly say it was my most intimate relationship. I ended the relationship shortly before we graduated because, although I deeply loved him, I didn't see a future for us. I just felt like he wasn't motivated. For a long time he wasn't working, skipping class, I was paying the bills, looked after him, helped him with everything he needed. It's not that I thought he was lazy, just that he wasn't motivated. When I asked him what his goals were, he didn't have any. I just felt that, although he had a wonderful, caring heart...that I just didn't have it in me to spend my life with someone who was doing nothing with his life.  
  
We had an amicable breakup, although he didn't take it lightly at first we agreed to be friends. After college we both went our separate ways, I wished him luck and I meant it.    
  
A few months ago I kind of went through Facebook checking on random people I use to know, and ran across his page. Everything about his life is different. He looks completely different, he has his own successful company, and he's just...not who I was with. Every time I hear someone talk about his upcoming wedding and he plans on flying out his family/fiance's family, I would be lying if I didn't admit that part of me wished that was my life given my recent struggles.  
  
How come it's so hard for me to feel happy for him? I think he's a wonderful guy and I couldn't care less if he a millionaire or dating another girl, it's just a part of me asks *why* he didn't change when he was with me, but the other part of screams that he owed me nothing. I'm trying to work up the courage to just send him a message and tell him I feel so happy for him and am so proud of him (as we haven't spoken for years), but each time I try I can't help but feel like I'm not doing it for the right reasons.

t3_248c7g,"How to deal with guys that are really forceful at clubs...that are my acquaintances/somewhat friends?","Hi there, throwaway because I don't want friends of mine seeing this. Somewhat long.

I feel like people on this sub are really nice and provide some good advice so hopefully you guys can help me out! 

I'm a 22F and not a person who hits up a club every weekend, but I do go occasionally (maybe a few times per year for birthdays/special occasions). I've been lucky in that for the most part I haven't experienced inappropriate behaviour from guys at clubs. Within the last 2 months I've had guys that are friends of friends that have been a little too forward with me.

The first time I was dancing with a guy I had met previously, but he kept getting really close. 

Sidenote: I have a boyfriend, and this guy knows this (bf wasn't there that time). My bf is awesome and has no issues if I dance with other guys, however, I felt really uncomfortable with how close this guys was getting.

He kept turning me around to face him and pulling me close and it was just...I don't know...very awkward. I kept trying to pull back and at several points I was actually backing into things. He wasn't getting the hint but I was kind of at a loss at what to do/say. I've never really been in situations like this before so I told him I had to leave (I actually did need to go).

The second time was at a club for my friend's bday (with my bf, but he was elsewhere at the time of the incident). At one point a bunch of us were dancing in a circle and this guy that I had met that day (let's call him B) pulls me practically onto him and starts aggressively grinding. Pretty much as soon as he did that, a guy friend (M) pulls me off B, but he grabbed me again. It all happened really fast and I was kind of at a loss for what to do, but I just turned around and told B I had to go to the bathroom. It was obvious afterwards that B was totally trashed, but I still don't excuse his behaviour.

So, if you're still with me, thank you! My question is...how do I deal with situations like this? If it was some random guy I wouldn't have a problem telling him no, or to screw off, but these are guys that I will potentially be seeing in the future. How should I handle the inappropriate behaviour? I don't like having to run off to the bathroom because it doesn't address the issue and I don't want to leave because of some guy.

I also just end up feeling bad about myself. I always question what I should have done differently. M even made a point of saying ""you need to tell guys 'no'"", which I agree with, but how can I do this diplomatically with guys I know? I don't want to cause drama that may follow in the future. I hate that I always freeze in these situations or run off. 

Anyone have concrete advice on what to do/say to these guys without being rude? Or am I allowed to be rude? Halp.

TL;DR How to deal with guys dancing inappropriately with me when they are friends of friends?

I don't know whether to just be happy with this friendship we have, I'm pretty sure she's my soulmate (and I don't mean that cheesy...it's just that we clicked instantly and it seems like we've known each other much longer than 2 years) but she's definitely a lifelong friend....I'm just curious to know if it could go further.  Does anyone else out there have a friendship like this?  What became of it? ",0,20140429133546,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24arop,"What would you want to ask a woman who had a baby with her HIV-pos husband?","Hi everyone,

I'm new here, so please forgive any Reddit-newbie errors. And if this is the wrong place for this, let me know and I'll remove it immediately.

I'm just curious: I saw this article on the Washington Post website last week: Mixed-status HIV couples have babies the old fashioned way: http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/as-mixed-status-hiv-couples-weigh-risks-more-choose-to-conceive-the-old-fashioned-way/2014/04/24/8c8b11a4-b9d4-11e3-96ae-f2c36d2b1245_story.html

I started thinking what I would ask of couples who fit this description. If you had a chance to ask (respectful) questions of these women, what would you ask? What would you most want to know?

I think I'd want to know how they weigh the risk. Like, how do you get to a comfort level with the risk that you might get HIV? What does that mean to them? And did you always want to have a baby, and if so, how did you decide to marry someone with whom having a baby might be impossible?

I don't have kids, and I'm about to turn 40, and I'm really wondering if my current relationship is right for me, since she doesn't want to have kids. So I guess the last one is the most personal for me.

What about you?
