We put to rest the blue and green Paisley Hanes, a younger lass who always was there to not show a panty line when the Thong Unit had been exhausted. The enemy came upon us swiftly and in the middle of a final. There was nothing she could do. She fought bravely. 

We also honor Watermelon Pink Hanes, with her colorful blue and green band. Getting on in her years and a little loose in the elastic, she should have been retired months ago. But alas, yet another surprise attack from the enemy brought her down. We had underestimated the heaviness of the onslaught, our battlements did not hold. She held off several waves, sacrificing herself in her ever-devoted mission to keep safe The Pants. 

Ladies, a moment of silence for our fallen soldiers. ",2875,20140429215715,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24begi,"[NSFW][Possible trigger] After years of hating giving oral because it played a major part in my sexual abuse as a child, I enjoyed it for the first time.","I have always hated blow jobs. Ever since I was eight and made to do them. The very thought, for a very long time, made me gag. I had a boyfriend, and I couldn't do it when he asked. I choked and gagged before it was even in my mouth. I had a few flings and one nighters. Still couldn't do it. Another boyfriend? Still no. Then when I was a month shy of seventeen I got a more serious boyfriend. The only one where I tried hard to do it. But I was *always* reluctant. I *never* enjoyed it. And he had to ask or pester for it, and would try and take control and generally not respect me. He didn't respect me as a person either. And I was never truly attracted to him. We were together for years.

 I'm a few months shy of 21 now, and I slept with someone casually. Someone who I was extremely attracted to and vise versa. This guy seemed to respect me as an equal, and wasn't selfish in bed either. He didn't even have to ask. I found myself readily wanting to do it, so I did. And I *enjoyed* it. Guys, I *enjoyed giving someone a BJ*. For the first time ever. I never thought this could happen and it did, and I'm so happy.

All it took was time, maturity, real physical attraction and mutual respect. I know for others it may take more than that, and for others it may never happen. And I respect that.

I just had to share, I'm not really comfortable talking about it to anyone else but reddit, and especially TwoX, and this is a pretty major thing for me. It's something that has bothered me because I always wanted to work past it.

1) I've always pictured the guy proposing... but don't actually have a problem with 'stepping up' and doing it.

Women who've asked - does this stupid standard ever bother you in the back of your mind and you *kinda, sorta* wish you'd've waited for him to do it?


2) Will he be offended that I didn't wait for him to get the courage? 

He's very introverted but super romantic. I can tell he's genuinely thinking about it because of the glint in his eyes whenever the topic comes up (on tv, in our jokes, him *really* wanting my very intimidating dad to like him, etc.), but our first ""I love you"" story is of me stealing the words from him (I *knew* he was about to say it, he was teary eyed and nervous) and he says he was relieved. Not sure if proposing marriage is something he'd be relieved about if I beat him to it, too.... 


3) How did you do it? 

I love turning insignificant moments into important ones! So I'd probably do it during a walk, at breakfast, when he comes home from work, or right when we're waking up... 

Did you have a ring? Did you drop to one knee? Did he repsond the way you expected?

t3_24c6pi,"I have an abortion scheduled for Thursday. I'm trying not to doubt my decision or become overly emotional.","I've been on birth control for the last two years, always with a perfectly consistent period (almost to the hour). About a month ago I started getting blinding migraines. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Fioricet. I asked the doctor if the medicine would effect my birth control and she said ""no, not at all."" Then last month I didn't get my period. After trying to figure out what happened in the last month (I was never late taking a pill) I googled Fioricet and birth control and *every entry* talks about an interaction. I feel stupid for not doing my own homework, but I trusted my doctor.

I've had one abortion before, two years ago. I was in an abusive relationship. It was extremely hard. I wanted to have the baby, but knew it was not safe to go through with the pregnancy for me or the child that would grow up in that situation. I grieved for a long time, but I also felt very relieved. This time I am in a very supportive relationship with someone I will spend the rest of my life with, but we just aren't ready. The first time around my whole family was encouraging me to go through with it. I feel like if I told them I was pregnant and considering an abortion now it would just be...shameful. I feel guilty for being in this situation and angry because I thought I was doing everything right. A part of me feels like now that I'm in a good relationship, I ought to have the baby, that it's the ""right"" thing to do, that we would love it and do whatever we had to in order to raise it. But I have a very deep fear that it could come at the expense of mine and my boyfriend's relationship and our education/careers. It just seems smarter and better for everyone if we don't bring a child into the world right now. My boyfriend, though he is extremely supportive and equally rational, is also a devout Catholic, and he has a nagging guilt that us having an abortion would be grave sin. It doesn't change his feeling about what is right for us and for our future family, but knowing that he is feeling that kind of pain and moral conflict wears on my conscience as well. 

On top of those stresses, the abortion clinic in my town has within the last few years been bombed, in the past abortion doctors have been killed, and to this day there are protesters that stand fifty feet away from the door shouting at the women who go in. I lay awake at night imagining my boyfriend sitting in the waiting room while I'm having the procedure and the building gets firebombed. It doesn't help.

I’m sorry that it’s taken me twenty years to get this out to you. This is by far the most painful thing I have ever done. I had to get up to turn all the lights out because even the act of typing these words out makes me want to throw my computer out the window and comfort myself by thinking of ways to die before I go to sleep. I’ve started and stopped this document periodically over the years, unsure of how to put it all out there; unsure of what words to use. Some people are able to poetically write their experience. Some people are able to make it tragically beautiful. I’m sorry that I can’t do that. I’m sorry that this is so painful. I don’t even know where to start.

I’m sorry that I couldn’t put words to the experience you had when you were six. I’m sorry that I suppressed the memories and told you that you were lying to yourself. I’m sorry that sometimes you still feel like you’re lying to yourself. I’m sorry that I have to write a letter to myself as if I am not myself because this is so fucking painful that using the word “I” instead of “you” makes me want to slit my wrists open and bleed out in a bathtub full of hot water.
This is so fucking hard to type out and I’m sorry that it is so raw. Tinyboldgirl, you were molested when you were six years old. I’m sorry that this is the only validation you’ll ever receive and I’m sorry that it has to come from yourself, but after twenty years of denying it – that’s better than nothing I suppose. You were molested by your best friend. She forced you to perform oral sex on her because if you didn’t, you weren’t her best friend. You didn’t really have many friends and you had a shitty, nonexistent relationship with your parents so you didn’t really know better. It’s not your fault even though it feels like it is. She made you lie there as she performed oral sex on you while her older brother video-taped it. When you threatened to tell, he duct taped her hands and your hands and then pushed you down the stairs. It was that day when you realized no one would ever listen to you and I’m sorry to say this but you were right.

You were molested for three years until they moved houses. She then began to masturbate in front of you with pens and pencils and other sharp things. I know you’ve been trying to block this out of your memory for years. I know this is why you don’t masturbate and I know this is why you hate oral sex. I know this is why you feel like you want to kill yourself when guys and even other girls shame you for not masturbating and not wanting to give blow jobs. I’m sorry, I am so fucking sorry that this is the way it is and people are just generally pretty terrible. I’m sorry that all I can say is I’m sorry.
When they moved to another part of Texas, I know that you were relieved. You tried visiting them a few times but you knew in your heart that you were really fucking happy that they were gone and that you’d never see her brother again. Your parents never knew and will never know.

I am sorry that when you were in seventh grade, you “dated” a boy who stalked you in fifth and sixth grade because that’s how you thought it was supposed to be. I’m sorry that you thought if you “just gave in” things would be better. He manipulated you and abused you and I’m sorry that when you think of movie theaters and the color red and black boots, you want to kill yourself. He stalked you for eight years after that.

When you were a junior in highschool, you fell head over heels for a guy with blue eyes and a nice smile. You thought if you could just put all of the ugly things behind you, things could really work out. You thought if you just treated this boy like the way you wanted to be treated, things could really work out.

It was late September, early November in your senior year of highschool when he raped you anally. You stood there in Memorial Park, pulling up your shorts, feeling the sting of ripped tissue, feeling the blood and semen spilling out of you. He stared at you in disgust, telling you to “clean yourself up”. You felt so embarrassed and ashamed that you wanted to die but you did as you were told and you told yourself that you liked it and you held his hand as you walked back to his car together. I am so sorry, I am so fucking sorry.
A week to the day later, you found out he cheated on you and you cried and cried. You still kept thinking that if you forgave him, if you were a good girl, things would get better. If you just shoved it under the rug, things would get better. If you tried harder, things would get better. So you got all dolled up for homecoming and tried to be a good girl but it didn’t work because he raped you in his car in front of your house anyway.

Your boyfriend raped you. He grabbed you by the back of your head and dragged your body over the console. Your face hit the steering wheel and he took his penis out and hit you in the face and in the eyes with it. He told you to give him a blow job, that he deserved it, that you owed it to him, that he’s been waiting patiently all this time. You kept begging him to stop, you kept saying no, please, no, I don’t want to do this. You tried to get up and he forced your lips onto his penis. You tried to say no and he forced it inside of your mouth. Your tongue was on the tip and it tastes so sour and bitter. You were so scared. You tried to pull back and he pushed you down. You couldn’t breathe; you felt like you were choking.

When he let you up, you asked him if he would walk you to your door and he said no because his mom and dad were probably worried about him. He told you to keep it a secret because it would hurt his reputation if people found out. He told you to confide in him whenever you felt bad because, really, he was the only person you had left.
He was mentally, emotionally and sexually abusive to you. He kept on raping you for two more years after that. I’m sorry that when you think of sex, you think of feeling scared and if it isn’t scary, then it isn’t sex. I’m sorry that when you think of yourself, you feel broken. I’m sorry that when people try to pay for your coffee, it makes you think of those words that he said to you: “You owe me this”. I’m sorry that I’ll be the only person who will ever apologize to you because people are generally pretty rotten and selfish and don’t really know what to say to rape survivors like you. 


But I also want to say that I’m fucking proud of you. You have nothing and no one but you still hold your head really fucking high and soldier through the pain. You’re 2 months clean from cutting yourself even though no one cared if you were cutting yourself or not. Even though you’re failing school in most areas right now and your parents don’t care to understand why, you’re ALIVE and that in itself is pretty fucking amazing.

I’m proud of you because you get up in the morning and you look at yourself in the mirror and you think to yourself, “Even if no one else thinks I’m beautiful, I think I’m beautiful.” I’m proud of you because you had the courage to get those tattoos and walk away from someone who was hurting you because you finally believed that you didn’t deserve that anymore. I’m not sure if ‘better’ exists but I know that you’ll never put up with anything like that ever again.
I’m proud of you because even though it’s hard not having anyone, at least you’ve had the courage to walk this path 100% alone. That’s a lot more than other people can say for themselves. I’m so fucking proud of you, I am so fucking proud of you.

I’m proud of you because even though every person who has ever loved you has hurt you in horrible ways, you still haven’t given up on the idea of love and being loved by someone. I am not sure that person exists but I do know that at least in my head, you’ll be loved by someone who accepts your past and won’t ever force you to give him a blow job. He won’t even ever ask about it. Don’t give up on finding that person and don’t hang around girls and guys who say that one day you’ll just “get over it”.

The life you have led is horrific and yet I’m proud of you because you try your best not to hurt anyone and you rescue every damn animal that you see. I’m proud of you because you’ve gotten rid of most of the negative people in your life and I’m proud of you because you stand up for yourself. I’m proud of you because you’re in therapy. I’m proud of you because you fight to give other rape survivors a voice, even when other people think it’s socially inappropriate. I’m proud of you because you want to become a licensed counselor for people just like you. 

I’m sorry that you can’t sleep at night because you’re plagued with nightmares and I’m sorry that when you think of men, a tiny part of you hates them. I hope that one day you’ll meet one that makes you think that they can be good people but I don’t blame you for thinking that they’re not.

Love,

t3_24d3ic,"I made an appointment with a genetic counselor.","I've always thought of myself as high risk for breast cancer due to my family history. My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 bilateral breast cancer at the of 31, before it was even recommended she get a mammogram. She died at age 36 due to her cancer. My grandmother had breast cancer, as did her sister and her mother. It's always seemed somewhat inevitable.

My general practice doctor has been very dismissive of my concerns and has denied my requests for a mammogram as I am only 24, despite knowing my family history. 

So I finally made an appointment with a generic counselor. I know I won't find anything out in my first appointment specific to my genes and my prognosis, but I'm still terrified. 

I know there are many options for how to deal with a positive BRCA genetic mutation, but I am just stuck on the thought of removing all breast tissue, or as much as possible. I'm only on my parents insurance for 2 more years, and their insurance would cover the vast majority of the cost involved with a radical mastectomy and reconstruction, so that makes me feel like I'm on a timeline.

Broke up a major relationship beginning of the year. Amicable, guy was very good about it. All credit to him. Had a 6 week fling with someone, he broke it off, we remained good friends. 

House share I was in broke down, I am miserable. Second guy offers me to stay with him for a bit, till I sort myself out/know what I'm doing. It's fun living there, he's a good guy, and a nice person, we get on really well. He's charging me very little rent, so I can save up for a deposit/similar. He owns it outright (is older, had lots of savings and help from family). 

The problem is that I am a massive fucking sponge. I don't want a relationship, but him being around and having slept with him before means that it seems very strange for me not to do it now - I am a really base creature like that! We're spending a lot of time together, but it's such a laugh. 

I don't want to move out, I've got a good deal here and he's given me a massive gift, but I am unsure how to proceed. I've got it in check for the minute but if he starts seeing someone else I'm not sure what I'll do.

A little background: I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and I've had major depressive episodes in the past as well and for a very long time I felt very hopeless and lost and I had no idea how to get myself out of it and get healthy. I tried to take my life a few times, isolated from almost everyone and everything in my life, dropped out of school in grade 11, and was just generally a mess. My parents stuck by me, though, and kept trying to find help for me. Where I was, though, there were almost no mental health resources and definitely nothing that was equipped to deal with my issues. 

Last fall I was admitted into a specialized treatment facility a few hours away and I've been there until today. I completed two programs (one for stabilization and one for PTSD) and I've made such huge improvement it's, again, almost unreal. I got to read my chart while I was there which included some notes from my regional hospital and it was very depressing to realize how incredibly sick I was but I realized how different I am now. I've put in so much work and been so determined to get better. I'm pretty committed to life now, and to recovery, I'm much more aware and accepting of the special needs I have, and I'm working on not blaming myself for everything that went wrong. It's hard sometimes to deal with the anger I have for what happened to me in my past to set my life so far off track but it's another thing I just have to accept that I cannot change, but I know I can change my future. 

Which leads me to where I am now. The hospital said I needed to continue my treatment as an outpatient so my parents set my older sister and I up in an apartment in a bigger city that has the resources I need and I'm going back to school to complete my high school credits and hopefully be able to grow into someone who's skin is a little easier to live in. I'll always have the scars but maybe they're not quite so suffocating anymore.

My wife has a history of kidney infections, she was also having pain during and after sex that started after a kidney infection. Went to see a Gyno/Urologist specialist, and she prescribed pelvic floor physical therapy for the pain and she's going to get surgery to fix the kidney issue.

She verifies that the therapist she picked is listed on the blue cross blue shield Alabama website as ""in network"" and starts going.  Fast forward 4 weeks, and the therapist says that the insurance will not cover anything, we have to pay out of pocket.  Therapist has never seen a claim just flat out denied, as even medicare covers pelvic floor physical therapy. (We are not in AL, but company ins is from there).

I am really mad and frustrated.  If my doctor prescribed me Viagra, even though I am not even 30, they will cover it no questions asked. But sexual dysfunction for women is not covered? What the hell? I get that one is physical therapy one is a pill, but this feels so misogynistic and wrong.

I called them and they are going to mail me an appeal form (ofc you can't download it).  I will fill it out and have both the PT and prescribing doc write notes with it but I am not hopeful.  Yes I don't want to pay 100% of this, but even more I am just really fucking pissed that they will cover men's sexual dysfunction but not women's.

------------------

I feel bad accusing him of things, or calling it rape, but I don't know of another word for it. Instead, I will explain how things happened, for myself more than for the reader, in hopes that it will help me move beyond this. 

We talked about having sex long before we actually did. I thought I was in love with him. He knew I was a virgin. He asked me if I'd ever thought about how I'd like to lose my virginity, and I told him I never thought about how I wanted to lose it, but how I knew I didn't want to. I told him I didn't want to be drunk, and I didn't want to be on top. 

Cut ahead. He broke up with me, but I already made plans to go out and see him, so I went anyway. He kept giving me mixed signals. I get there, and we're having a great time. We agreed I'd stay in the same bed because regardless, he was a friend, and his bed was large enough I felt comfortable. The first of ten nights there, he was admiring my tattoo. He asked if he could lick it. I was so caught off guard and kind of weirded out by the question that I agreed. Somehow, this led to him fingering me. I never said no. I was shaking so much I could hardly breathe, but I never said no. This is not the rape I am writing about. I do not blame him for touching me on the first night. 

Cut ahead again, a few days later. Halloween. I had never truly been drunk before, and wanted to be a typical young person on Halloween for once in my life. Too much vodka, my head was spinning. Before I even visited, when we talked of sex and how I did not want it when I was drunk, I begged him to promise he would not let me talk him into it if I was drunk. I told him I would tell him I was not drunk, that I was fine and making rational decisions, but he must reject me. He did not. I was more drunk than I have ever been in my life, or ever will be again, and he suggested sex. I said okay. He said, wait, you're drunk. I said that it was okay. This is still not the rape I am writing about. I only partly blame him for initiating sex that night. 

We're in his bedroom. He's taking off my pants, and he tells me mine are the most boring panties he's ever seen. I should've stopped him there, but I didn't. My head and heart were screaming for me to stop him, but I laughed it off and let him grab hold of my ankles. This is not the rape I am writing about. I only partly blame him for insulting me on what should've been one of the most special nights of my life. 

He decides part-way through that he doesn't like how the condom feels. He does not ask me if it's okay before he rips the condom of and continues to have sex to me (I say to, because it was not with. I was outside myself by this point, disappointed for letting it get this far). He has an STD, and I am not on birth control, but he does not think of the consequences. I realize what he has done and my head starts swimming with worry and anxiety. My body aches from him resting himself upon me and the pain of him being inside of me. I do not want him there. I never did. He is not the one. I ask him to stop. I tell him to stop. I beg him to stop. He does not. I am shaking harder than I ever have before, and I feel like I am going to throw up. He is done with me and rolls over, says we should get Plan B, so we go to Walgreen's. I am ashamed. I know the woman behind the counter is judging me, blaming me, hissing ""slut! slut!"". At least he paid for it. The pills make me very sick, and mess up my periods for 3 months. The sex makes me very sick, and messes up my head and heart for a good deal longer.

It's just that I feel like there are so many rules and none of them are going my way. There's a ton of stuff I can't eat/drink because of the chance of listeria, or mercury, or whatever. Yet, I'm pretty sure our parents ate whatever, drank, smoked, etc. and I'm okay, you're ok. Did we really improve outcomes that much that I have to cut ALL these things out for the duration? 

And here's what bugs me the most. I can't get a massage for the first trimester. Ok, fine, whatever. I got assaulted by a patient at work. I'm a nurse, and a confused patient grabbed me by the front of my scrubs with both hands, held me in place and kicked me in the stomach. And my manager and doctor both said the same thing, you will be fine, there's so many things keeping that little one safe that one little kick from an 88 year old lady won't hurt the baby. If you start bleeding, then we'll worry. So, no fun, but getting kicked is ok? I understand, they are trying to calm down a hormonal, crying lady. But I can't help but feel that this is just another double standard for women. It's the same as expecting us to not want sex, because that's dirty, but we have to look sexy and attractive or we aren't worth anything. Now I'm pregnant and I puke constantly, only want to eat certain foods, but can't eat half of what I want, but have to eat something or else I'm hurting the baby. I can't do things that will make me feel good like a massage, but I can get assaulted and be just fine, stop crying.

Last month I was promoted (based on what I thought was my numbers being almost double that of what goal was) to the final department before supervising/training/etc. This is a huge deal for me. I have been struggling with depression and have had issues with not being able to perform well under stress and so I felt like I was finally able to be a functioning adult in the real world.

Tonight my roommate and I invited a couple that we work with over to have cake and ice cream (they also live very close to us) and as it usually goes since we were work friends the topic turned to work. In the process of talking one of them mentions the ""only reason I was brought over was because senior manager wanted to work with roommate because he thinks shes pretty"" and then ""oh the only reason you didn't get moved to this spot was because you and roommate have to be on the same schedule"" this spot being a brand new team that is literally being set up for failure so that they can fire them.

I'm really hurt. I don't know how to process this. I'm mad that it's being seen as I didn't earn this promotion. Senior manager would consistently speak to my roommate about things and not me in regards to our schedule. She is more outspoken but I feel like I am just this barnacle attached to her now. That I need to separate myself from her for my success to be recognized, or if I do and make waves then am I going to be fired?

This is something that was brought up in my own home so its not something I can go to HR about. Or can I? I feel like this has deflated my confidence about everything I felt I earned since September and undermines my joy about being successful. How do I even handle this? I'm not ready to bring this up to my roommate because its not her fault shes conventionally pretty and very extroverted but this is really hurting me.

t3_24fhs2,"To the girl who asked about sternum pain while sleeping with SO:","I went to comment on your topic, but it wouldn't let me because it was deleted and your account was deleted too. I just wanted to let you know that I don't necessarily think it's as grave as the other commenters made it seem! 

I have the same exact issue when I sleep in an unfamiliar/new bed in a new position when first dating a person. For example, after sleeping on my side in my own bed, by myself, in a very comfy position, for months as a single lady, my body gets used to that. Once I start dating someone new, and try to put my body in a snuggling position it's not used to sleeping in (especially in a bed it's not used to), I get sternum pain just like you described. After a few nights of habitually sleeping in this new way, my body gets used to it.

I would guess it's a similar thing with you. If so, just wait a few more nights to see if it gets better. However, if you've been sleeping this way with your partner in this bed habitually for a while and it's still occurring, then it may be something else, and it wouldn't hurt to see your doctor.

Good luck! ",13,20140430230338,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24fbhx,"WARNING: RANT. Friend of mine called me, I got shamed for an unintentional mistake and basically got blamed for a series of events that ""ruined"" her evening.","I'm very fed up with this! It's kind of hard to explain the situation but it ended in me getting a private class before her, she's usually first and then I have my class. The class was only an hour -I chopped off mine so that she could start earlier. 

So, there was some misunderstanding tonight and I somehow thought that I was supposed to be before her. (We have private classes once every week).

We have often before exchanged classes with *no* problems, even without calling each other first, because we were both free over these two hours that our classes are, so if the other asked to exchange, the other usually would just wait and get ready for her class while she waited.

Anyways, tonight I was supposed to be after her but for some reason my schedule said that I should be first, and that made it possible for me to accept a meetings afterwards. (work related, so I kind of couldn't skip it, but it would have been manageble and solvable if I wouldn't be free). 

So, I start my class, and suddenly she just rushed in, furious, saying that she has places to be and that she needs her class RIGHT THEN. She [friend, lets call her Y) then walks out, very upset and angry. (She's usually very down-to-earth and relaxed about things like that, but's she's been very up-high for the last month and has been acting weird towards me, like we weren't friends, almost as if I had done something that could have hurt her, **which I know that I haven't done, and I have talked to her about that, and she said that it wasn't so, she also said that everything was okay**).  

I realize my mistake and offer her to take my class (technically hers). She said no and walked away.

On with the class;The teacher somehow tries to find a way so we both can have at least some time each, and we talked together and decided that I would finish earlier, so she could start earlier and therefore quit earlier and be on time. Y accepted this idea and said that it would be alright to be late for this thing she was supposed to be. **I know that I made a mistake with that class and told her. I offered her to take the class, and said that I would change my meeting, she said no, that we'd do like the teacher suggested**. So we keep on with my class, with me thinking things were alright between Y and me.

Anyways, she comes *late* for her class, (I had no idea what the time was) and I have a lot of stuff to take out of the classroom so as soon as she walked in I started packing my stuff and in the meantime I'm talking with the teacher about next class while I'm picking up my stuff, while she get's ready. She's ready before me and I told them just to start and don't mind me while I finished. (I repeat; *I had PLENTY of stuff to take out*). I finish; I hurry out and Y seems to be okay with this and we say our good byes. She though refused to start with me in the room. I don't know why; that hasn't been a problem before.

Anyways, I'm home after the class, just getting ready for my meeting, and my phone rings. 

That's her to tell me what a terrible person I am, that I can't suddenly change classes like that and that I can't be like this and that and can't behave like that before calling her first. Saying that I should have hurried more out from the classroom, saying that I should have stopped the class earlier...etc She is going apeshit in the phone, almost screaming at me. 

I was so shocked that I couldn't even start to explain my side of the situation. The only thing that I could think of was ""she was late to her class anyway, why is she blaming it on me?!""

She keeps on, telling me how I ruined her evening, that she had TWO very important place to be right after that goddam class! **She only mentioned one thing to do, and she had said that it would be okay to be late for it**.

She then goes on saying how her evening was a complete disaster because of me. That she missed the first thing, AND ALSO THE LATER THING. Because her class started 15 mins later than usually! 

We live in a *very* small city and she was on car. There was no fucking way that she could have missed two things in a row. Unless she was supposed to be on the other side of the country!

At this point, I have tears in my eyes, trying to tell her that I was sorry for that, that it was a mistake that I made, I knew that and I had tried to fixed that earlier, so she could have everything like she needed. But she hadn't mentioned the second thing, said that it would have been okay to be late for the first thing **and** she also accepted the idea that our teacher came up with. I tried to ask her why she didn't just said straight away that she needed the class, right then. And why she wouldn't take my offer etc.etc.etc. She wasn't listening.

While I'm trying to explain myself, she's just practically throwing shit at me. Things like:
 
*""You are *so* terrible!"" 
*""It's **your** fault that my evening is ruined"" 
*""You cannot make mistakes like that EVER!"" 
*""I need *you* to call *me* when you make decisions like that!!!"" 
*""My evening sucked because of you and your decisions!""

These things were screamed at me. Like that I made the decision of making a mistake. Once. Like I had the intentions of ruining her little something, that she couldn't even tell what was, or why it was so important.

She wouldn't listen to me till I raised my voice a little and asked ""Why didn't you said anything?"" **Because she didn't**

This is such a silly thing to be upset with, but I did **SO NOT** deserved that! She's the one that has always been changing the classes, she's the one that's been getting a little extra time because she always goes a little into my class, and I've always been very relaxed about it. I have only once before had to change the class before, and I called her 4 days prior! 

I've always done my best to be nice, offer her rides (because, we live in the same neighbourhood) and stuff like that. I've never said anything mean to her, and I think that I have only been a good friend. And I cannot see, why on earth, she thinks that it's alright to call me like that and act like that. I don't feel like I deserve that. Yes, she would have been late for that first thing, because of me, but she said that it was ok! Also acted like that!


Oh, and also; when I tried to make my apology -just getting this case over and done, guess what she replied? 

""Yeah right, I'll consider it"". 

That was it, and I hung up.


I will see this girl at school tomorrow, and the day after that, etc. I'm still in a kind of a shock, she has never acted like that towards me before and I'm trying to figure out weather to talk to her about this and tell her how upset she got me, or if to ignore her, until she finds a reason to talk to me, either to shame on me or talk. 

**TL;DR** I made a mistake, tried to make up for it, reverse it, whatever. Friend acted like it was okay, we arranged things. Got a phonecall later from her, where she screamed at me and acted like I had intentionally ruined her evening. She would not take my apology. Also would not tell me exactly what I ruined. I feel like I did not deserve that kind of behaviour.

I've been considering an IUD off and on for a few months now. I am 19 and in a monogamous LTR. I was mostly interested in Nexplanon, but they don't insert those at my university clinic. I had my annual gynecological exam today and mentioned that I was interested in learning more about IUDs. My provider was happy to give me the literature for Paraguard, Mirena, and Nexplanon. I've seen a lot of testimonials from the ladies here on Reddit as well.

Since I expressed interest in it, my provider went ahead and completed an STI test for me, since it is required for IUD placement. As I was checking out, though, the secretary asked if I wanted to go ahead and get my pre-IUD consultation out of the way. I had time, so why not?

I talked with another nurse about exactly what the procedure involves and what to expect. She told me about when to come in, what kind of drugs to take, all that jazz. Honestly, this worried me more than comforted me. My clinic will not prescribe Cytotec (the cervix softening drug). They will also not prescribe any kind of pain medication. I am the BIGGEST WEENIE. I get extreme motion sickness and I can't even have blood drawn without feeling dizzy and clammy. Might I mention that they want to do this next Tuesday, right before finals?

Overall, I'm just feeling very nervous about the whole thing. Just thinking about the procedure makes me want to vomit and cry. My friend (also 19) had Mirena placed as well, and not one week later, had it expel itself. Is there any kind of advice you ladies could offer? How was your IUD experience?

Edit: Thank you all for your experiences and responses. I have decided against the procedure, at least for the time being. I am not prepared to do this, especially right before finals.

You gals have helped me in the past and I am really glad that I have someone to help me with my problems. 

So I know it was long ago but in the beginning of the year my friend Alex left me. 

Me and him used to be on top of the world. Everyday we would talk and hang out. He was my shoulder to cry on and my therapist. 

We were friends for 4 years, and on year 2 he told me he liked me, you know like a crush. But during the time I liked him he didn't like me back and I had gotten rid of all my emotions for him and I never liked him back. 

So I practically ""friend zoned"" him for 2 years yet he still liked me and stayed by by side. 

Well in December me and him just started a little spark or whatever you want to call it. I started to fell crazy love for him and it was driving me nuts. When we got back from winter break I was waiting in my usual spot waiting to see him after not seeing him for two weeks. I saw him and he SPRINTED to me, and hugged me as tight as possible. 

After that I just started to like him. And by December 30th. we had our first kiss. and then we started holding hands and such and then I guess he just got to clingy because every moment he had to know what i was doing or where i was and I really never got any alone time. I stopped liking him and I started to miss my EX boyfriend. 

Well I wanted my EX boyfriend back in my life as a friend. just a friend. But then we started talking a little more. and a little more. and then we flirted. and before I even knew it. I had fallen in love with my EX boyfriend. 

my Ex told me that he wanted to get back together and I was really down for it. Alex on the other hand wasn't. He tried to talk me out of it so many times cause he wanted me. Well i just couldn't date Alex. I was to afraid of losing him of we were to somehow break up .

Well one morning i was sitting with Alex in the hallway and my EX boyfriend came up and held his hand out to me. I had all these books on me and I put them on Alex's lap. (dick move i know) But i took my EX's hand and he kissed me and we started going out. 

Alex and me kept fighting and fighting. But i cared about him so much. 

Well me and my boyfriend went into the library and that is where Alex usually sat and he hated seeing me and my boyfriend together and I can understand why. But Alex texted me that he was upset that we came into the library and i was so pissed off that day that i said some mean things and I guess Alex had enough. 

He stopped texting me and stopped all communication. and then it happened. . . 

On February 1st. . . Alex walked up to me. I knew this was going to happen. But he gave me a red box. A box I had given him on Christmas. It contained all the things i had given him over the past 4 years, including his best friend ring he had worn for 5 months straight. 

I was in tears and crying so hard. But I didn't say a word.  I gave him a goodbye hug and it was the hardest thing i had ever done in my life. 

I took in one last deep breath of his scent and then he left. forever. I still see him around in the school but he looks at me and gives me the cold shoulder. He can't look at me in the eye. and i hate to see him do this. 

I still care about him deeply. I'm to the point where i have to bribe his friends to make sure he doesn't do something stupid and ruin his life. 

I see him walking with other girls and flirting with them and it hurts me so deeply. 

I'm actually crying while I am writing this. 



I lost him... and I'm still crying about it.

He will come by our department to chat with me and the other girls, we IM each other periodically using our work IM program, etc. But lately I feel like he's been amping up the interactions and getting increasingly flirty. The final straw was this IM from today:

""You are awesome, you make the days brighter and it's awesome getting to talk every day so thanks for always making time to""

Now, this is nice and all, and I feel sort of similarly (I like chatting with him throughout the day. As a FRIEND!) but it makes me a little uncomfortable. I have a serious boyfriend who I love a lot. And yes, I try to mention my bf a lot. I even offered to introduce them since they're both musicians! I'm not interested in my coworker in that way and I don't want to lead him on. My problem is that he could just be being friendly, and I don't want to be presumptuous and shoot him down when he's not trying to make a move. I also like talking to him and if we can maintain our friendship without the flirtiness I would prefer to.

Him and I had met on a gaming server about two years ago, we quickly became friends and started talking over skype. Over the course of about a year and a half I went through many bad relationships and he was always there to help me as a friend. After  my most recent breakup we started talking more, calling on skype. 

I met his wife,a really odd person, found out how old they actually were (20 him, 28 her) and the fact that she was pregnant. Over the course of the month him and I started getting closer and I began to see what absolute mess his marriage and life was. You see Troy(not his real name) had found Molly(also not the wife's real name) on wow when he was 17, him and her had a long distance relationship and Troy left his mother's house to escape to Molly. 

They both work at a fastfood place working a little over minimum wage. Troy works on average 35 hours a week, Molly works 15. They both live in her depressive parent's house that's covered in mold and dog crap and the overall house is toxic to their health. Troy wants to do things with his life, get out of the rut he's in, while Molly wants to stay there and let mommy take care of her every need.

When I learned all of this, I was just appalled. Their marriage was dying and they decided to have a kid. Troy has scoliosis, Troy hasn't been to the doctors in years for it but suddenly Molly decides that they can afford a kid? They were struggling to make ends meet as is. Then I got to talking to Molly about the kid and possible adoption since they both can't afford the kid and it would probably die if left in the house. She refused to adopt. The probelms kept stacking up ect. ect.

I wanted to be there for Troy, to give him support, and while giving him that support, we fell for each other. Molly still doesn't know and it's been two months now. All I want is to make Troy happy, help him learn to live life and feel freedom. I want to help his kid have a good life and not grow up in a twisted household. I honestly love Troy and would stand by him no matter what he chooses. 

Right now he wants a divorce from Molly but can't afford it and the household is becoming toxic. I paid for a plane ticket to get him out to a friends house so he has a chance to breathe for once and to clear his mind about this whole ordeal.

I don't want to be a homewrecker, I just want to help the person I love have a decent life.

Edit: I guess I forgot to mention that he told his wife that he did not want to be with her anymore about two weeks before him and I started connecting.

I'm a criminal justice major with a focus in victim services/victim advocacy. I was raped my freshman year of college but suppressed it for a solid six months. It wasn't in a dark alleyway, I wasn't drunk, I had invited him in to my apartment. A sudden and horrific panic attack made me face it and see it for what it was. Rape.
That's about the time I started learning more about feminism, rape culture, and many other facets in those areas. I had always known, coming in to college, that I wanted to help people. I just didn't know how. I was already a criminal justice major and I started looking into something dealing with victims. I had no idea how many resources there were that I could have taken advantage of, that would have been incredibly helpful. I found out that there was a certificate I could get. ""Victim advocacy"". 

That was it. That's what I knew I needed to do. There was no doubt in my mind and I could not have been more excited to take this next step in my life, in a positive direction. Jump forward to about a month and a half ago and I hear about internship opportunities opening up in the universities' victim services. I have never wanted anything as bad as I wanted this internship. It was the exact job I wanted to get in to and the experience I could gain from it would be invaluable. So I apply. First I send in my application, then I have an on-the-phone interview. They said they would call me back in a few days to let me know if I was picked for an in-person interview. I WAS!! So I go to that interview and it's me and another girl together with 3 interviewers asking us questions. I was so nervous! At the end of the interview they said they would let us know the next week if we got a position. 

This last week was probably one of the longest ones of my life. But they called today and I got in!! As soon as I got off the phone I hopped up and started dancing around, I was so happy. This is one of the most amazing opportunities for me and I honestly can't convey how thankful I am that I made it.

However, I've also started to notice a problem I've been having.  I really love to wear dresses, but if I wear them (or anything else with an open bottom) without tights, I become really, really uncomfortable about my legs.

I don't really know why. D:  I do know I think my knees look a little weird, but I don't know if it's just that or something else.  Other people's reassurances unfortunately doesn't seem to help. >.<

I actually do really like wearing tights, so that's how I've gotten around this for now.  However, my friend suggests wearing the dresses without them, and it's also starting to warm up for Spring around here, so I probably can't keep wearing the tights forever.

Plus, I've noticed myself feeling the same thing when I wear some shorts. :c  When I'm not wearing dresses, I just wear jeans (which are again starting to be a little problematic due to the increasing heat).

I know this doesn't necessarily have an easy answer, but how do I stop feel so self-conscious about my legs?  I certainly can't keep avoiding this forever, and I just want to be able to wear a cute dress without being uncomfortable with myself.

So anyways, I am the first female field tech for a huge internet company. I get on roofs, run cables, and do some really scary things! I posted it before I started, so I thought you ladies would like a little update for those who are interested. 



I am actually typing this in a Subway about 200 miles from home, fixing some internets. SO I will write as uch as I can now. 


I work with all guys, they are all so nice. We all get along, and they all treat me the same as everyone else, which was my huge fear. They take me seriously, too! I had 4 days of trainging until they said I could propbably go out on my own. I picked it up fast, and I get very shoked faces when I show up to people's houses. Here is the most common conversation:

*i call them up about 20 minutes before I get there*


Me: Hi, this is iamkindacool, looks like we have an appointment to fix your connection today. Would it be okay if I head out here in about 20-30 minutes?  


Customer: Yeah okay sounds good ,just tell them if they need help with directions, to call me.  


Me: *ugh* okay, sounds good! Ill call you if I get lost, are you still at *address*?


Customer: Yep, just let them know it if the first house on this road.


Me: Okay sounds good, I will see you then!


Customer: Okay! I will keep a lookout for them!



Then they act all surprised when I show up. I get guys that come hold my ladder (I think they like staring at my bum.) I had a guy the other day sit in a lawn chair and watch me while I point their antenna in a different direction on his roof. I've had quite a few women tell me how awesome it is to see a woman in this industry. 


I have guys that can't lift my ladder. I have guys come on the roof and try to help me, and they can't even get off the ladder before they get scared and get down. I've used a 37 foot ladder to get up on a roof and have it break the gutter it was leaning against when I am 2 feet away from reaching the top, causing me to almost fall. I fell off a 6 foot step ladder onto a huge pile of snow, and I STILL get shit for it. 


I went on a roof that didn't even ""peak"" as in it was pretty much a dome, and on my way up (about 20 ft in the air) the ladder starts sliding below me, and thankfully soome guy ran and held it for me. I cried for about a day since I wouldn't have been able to use my legs ever again if he wasn't there. 


I've had a guy straight out refuse to let me get on his roof. 


I had a guy hit on me and start touching my back when I was sitting on his floor programming his antenna, I didn't finish the job. I left right after he touched my back and got in my truck and left. 


I went to a animal hoarder's house... It was really sad. I got out of there ASAP. The guy that owned the house couldn't even get out of the chair and he was on an oxygen tank. I couldn't breathe in his house. 



A tech came out to help me on a job, and a house was so gross that I decided to stand up. He sat down and it ended up being human shit on the chair he sat on. He threw up. 


I have SO many stories and EVERY day is a HUGE adventure, and I NEVER know what will happen. I just got out of being absolutly lost in the wetlands. 4 wheel drive baby!


Thank you all for the encouraging comments on my last post!!

I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks almost a year ago. My son's delivery was a traumatic emergency c section after 36 hours of labor. 

I am seriously struggling with this pregnancy. Everyday since I found out 2 weeks ago my doubts and sadness have grown. I constantly feel terribly sick and anxious. I'm crying all the time. About everything. I'm not able to properly care for my son due to how sick and exhausted I am. On top of that, I have awful anxiety about nausea and vomiting and can't seem to figure out where my real physical symptoms end and my anxiety begins. 

I feel like I would give anything not to be pregnant right now and find myself secretly hoping to miscarry again, even though miscarrying was awful. And I feel so unbelievably guilty and ungrateful for feeling this way. So many women would kill to have what I have. Why can't I be happy about this like I should be? Like I thought I would be? Is it only hormonal or do I really feel this way? What is wrong with me? And what the fuck am I supposed to do about it?

t3_24h3b5,"My dad died on Tuesday. We weren't on the best of terms and it sucks.","My dad was an alcoholic when I was growing up. I didn't know it then; I am pretty sure kids usually don't. Looking back, I can remember the times after my parents' divorce where it should have been obvious to me. I can remember him falling backwards in a chair and smacking his head against the size of the house. I remember us getting pulled over by the police on a drive home and my dad tossing a blanket over his open beer. Didn't matter, I pointed it out since I was only 6 and didn't know what he was doing was wrong. Basically, most of my childhood memories of him aren't the best.

He wasn't a terrible dad; he tried. He was definitely a better dad to my sister. She was a tomboy and so much my dad's daughter, whereas I am more of a mama's girl if I had to classify us. Even when my dad had stopped drinking for his third wife (she was a former alcoholic and would not put up with any of it), he was still much more there for my sister than for me. That was mostly okay since his wife was nice and supportive of me, treating me like her own daughter, which was especially good for me since at this point my mom lived on the other side of the country. 

My dad's dry spell lasted only as long as his marriage. I can remember sitting on my couch during my sophomore year of college. He called me and he didn't sound right. I asked if he was drunk. He was and I hung up immediately. He had been sober for about 5 years and just decided to pick up again. His new girlfriend didn't help much as she was an overgrown party girl. His drinking this time around was different for me since I was so much more aware of what a problem it was. I did my best to encourage him to stop, to get help, but eventually I just stopped noticing. It was easy since I wasn't around.

Fast forward a few years. My dad is married to his party girl. She is nice enough, but I don't feel much of a connection with her and find her more annoying than anything, but I am polite. I find myself in the Peace Corps, 6,000 miles away when I get a phone call from her. My dad is dying. She is crying her eyes out as I tell her how to contact Peace Corps so that they can get me home to be there with them. I was working at a summer camp, so I wasn't even at home when I got this call. I pack up, jump on the next bus to my town so that I can grab my passport, and make a mad rush to the nearest train station thanks to a local friend with a car. I took me close to 60 hours to make it back home. Luckily by then my dad was no longer in a dire state, but he was sickly and so thin. All those years of drinking had deteriorated his body. I am not sure how he didn't expect this to happen. He blamed his brother a lot, rather than himself. He had seen his older brother, an alcoholic for a long time, drink and drink and drink, but he was ""fine"" he was ""healthy"". Thankfully, this was what it took to get him to stop drinking. I wish I could say it was for good.

He fell off the wagon last October. I found out when my step-mom called me crying saying he was drinking and threatening her. He later told me he ran out of his meds and didn't have any insurance to get more. He tried going to rehab, but they sent him home because it was a psych thing, not alcohol. I didn't believe him. I was pissed. He sent me angry e-mails, apologetic e-mails. I sent him an e-mail back telling him I was done and that I couldn't handle this back and forth. That I couldn't handle him putting himself back in the hospital and on the verge of death because he wanted a drink. I told him I couldn't handle listening to his wife cry on the phone to me not knowing what to do. It all just broke my heart. I vented all of my angry feelings that I had held against him for years. I ignored his e-mails, texts, and FB messages (I blocked him). 

I hadn't talked to him since. Come Tuesday, I found out that he and his wife had moved to Mississippi for work because he had finally found a job. I found out that I didn't have a working phone number for them. I asked my sister for his wife's phone number after finding out from my sister that when the ambulance arrived at their house, he had lost so much blood from internal bleeding that he should have been dead. I had just gotten to work and learned this. I broke down and lost it crying. I called my step-mom and found out that the surgery he was about to have was risky since he was took weak, but if they didn't do it he would die anyway. I came home as I was in no state to work.

Luckily, my boyfriend had worked from home on Tuesday and was here when I came home. Not too long after getting home, I get a call from my step-mom. He was out of surgery, but couldn't stop the bleeding, so it was only a matter of time. I hung up the phone and it rang again an hour later after he had passed. I didn't expect to be so upset. I really didn't. 
I thought I had convinced myself that it wouldn't hurt so much because we weren't that close, because he did it to himself, because ultimately he killed himself, albeit slowly.

I just needed to get this out. I was such a bitch to him in the months before he died, and while I do feel he deserved that attitude from me, it sucks that he might have died feeling like I hated him. My step-mom told me he really wanted to go back to work so that he could contribute to my sister's upcoming wedding as well as my future wedding. So as I was over here doing my best to avoid contact with him, he was still doing what he could to look out for me. How fucked is that?

I recently got out of the mental unit in a hospital for suicide thoughts and attempt. Why did I want to kill myself? Because I've been severely depressed for years, have extremely low self-esteem, have wild mood swings and depended 200% on this guy for my happiness. Then I found out he was going to sleep with another girl, a few days after sleeping with me. Four years of knowing him, of loving him, and of thinking he genuinely cared for me, and this happened. I was, or am, in love with a jerk and I just CAN'T get over him.

This past week was my first week back from the hospital. He hasn't spoken a single word to me. He knows I was at a hospital, he knows the severity of the effect of what he did had on me. I go home every day thinking he will text me, like he always did every day, and I'm finding myself to miss him more and more each passing moment.

And a few minutes ago... well I just found out he asked a girl to prom. My ex-best friend, a girl I've thought has always been 100 times more beautiful than I ever will be. And it's like... two weeks ago he was treating me like I was the only girl he ever wanted, while he was planning something with another girl, and now, he's probably going to start talking to yet another girl. I've completely been erased from his life, in a matter of a week. And it fucking HURTS.

I feel like any progress I've made, I've lost. I'm right back to square one, where I'm feeling like an ugly piece of shit, undeserving of anyone, who's mental illness is what probably exhausted him and led him to go to another girl. I wish I could be normal and just say ""forget him."" But I can't. Every day I see him and I miss his voice, his touch, his scent. I miss him supporting me and telling me everything will be okay. I miss him.

I'm supposed to be getting better. I'm supposed to focus on myself and treating my depression. These meds are supposed to be working. But I'm losing it again, and I don't want to end up at the hospital.

I'm sorry if this was the wrong subreddit to post on. But I admire all of you and see you all as such powerful, confident women. Women I wish to be like one day.

My first follow-up in January came back normal, but the one from two weeks ago didn't. I have another colpo/biopsy scheduled for next thursday.

Long time lurker, first time poster. However I could really use your advice and/or opinion on my current situation. I'll try to keep the rant as concise as possible.

So there is this FWB I have, let's call him Chris. Last Saturday, Chris helped me with the preparations for a party I'd throw and at some point he told me about this semi-threesome he had had a week ago. It had been with two mutual acquaintances (a couple), it had involved making out and heavy petting and he told me he'd rather enjoyed it. Half-jokingly I said he ought to call me before their next session, because I'd like to join them. It sounded like fun and I had wondered before what a threesome (or in this case, foursome) would be like. However, we did not go into deep detail on the subject.
The couple showed up at the party that night and the guy talked to me a couple of times in a really flirty way. Chris had apparently informed him that I knew about the threesome-ish and this guy kept inviting me and Chris over for lunch and some board games some time. 
Yesterday evening I was on the phone with Chris and during the conversation I mentioned that I might have been a little oblivious (I am known for always being the last one to find out about something really obvious) but that the guy maybe had wanted to invite me to join their little circle of love sometime. So Chris laughed and said that yeah, he had told the couple that I wanted to join them the next time.
At first, I just felt a little uncomfortable. I really hate it when something is decided for me and I'm only informed in order to confirm the deal. But gradually, I became more and more angry and hurt. It wasn't just that I would find it harder to say 'no' now that they all expected me to go with it. It was the whole thought that Chris had proposed such a thing in my name without me explicitly asking for it. It felt like I was being pimped. And Chris initially really didn't see the point. He really didn't want to hurt me so he was sorry but I had to walk him through my thought process in order for him to understand. Which in a way makes it worse. Apparently it had not crossed his mind that it was none of his business to take such initiatives without involving me.

And now I'm having this huge mindfuck. Is it just me overreacting that I am so offended and hurt? I know I said I might be in for joining them, should I've seen it coming that Chris would tell them right away at the first opportunity he had without explicitly checking with me first?

I'm sorry for the rant, I am just really confused. I know Chris wouldn't want to hurt me or mistreat me in any way and I can't seem to wrap my head around why this shit has happened.",0,20140501091552,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

We got a short term rental house for the time we have to spend at our second office and I'm about to loose my cool. 

I'm a quiet, reserved person. I normally live with my husband, daughter, and since we moved one of our good friends.

 I've never had a roommate. Never shared my space with someone I didn't love 100%. 

Until recently, I had only ever spent 2 nights away from my husband since we moved in together in 2008. 

I've been away since Sunday, I'll have a week home, then two weeks here. 

I'm tired. Day starts at 6, it's loud. People are stomping, playing music loudly, and being generally aggravating. 

We're at the office from 7:30-6pm typically. Come home, and it's loud and stressful again. Around 7:30 everyone starts working again and stops around 11 or midnight. I can work that much, god knows I have stuff to do, but I can't be ON that much. I can't stand talking about work any more. 

I'm tired. I'm surrounded by people. I can't not participate (my boss, her boss, and the company president are ALL here), but I don't want to work 15 hour days, go hiking, go running, go golfing... 

For dinner tonight, all I wanted was a burger. I spoke up about it, planned it out with a few people, and we were down. I left to take a shower and they had ordered sushi while I was gone. I have no car here - can't go get a burger. I dislike sushi, but I'm not a complainer. I've eaten it the last THREE DAYS because it's what two people wanted. Some one offered to take me to grab one, but it was in a very ""ugh, I guess if we have to deal with you"" way. 

I'm hungry. I'm tired. I feel like my space is being violated. I've never shared a space with this many women before (10 others). I miss my husband. I miss my daughter. 

I'm the only one here married with a child. I don't bitch or complain about missing them, but some one said, ""It's probably hardest for you here!"" I agreed it was difficult and I missed my family, and my boss scoffed and rolled her eyes. 

I don't know what the fuck to do TwoX. I'm not a crier, but I'm about to rage on people. I'm not complaining - I'm smiling and laughing and being involved, but I just don't have it in me to keep going. ",12,20140501220454,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24ianu,"How do you deal with unwanted attention (i.e. catcalling?)","Hey everyone,

Summer is approaching and with that, comes warm weather and a change of wardrobe. Where I live, it's been quite the hot week after having a cool spring, and I'm slowly getting readjusted to shorts, skirts, and tank tops. Unfortunately with the [skimpier] clothing, I've already experienced a fair share of unwanted attention and catcalling on sidewalks and intersections (doesn't help that I tend to walk everywhere and take transit). Of course, clothing, or lack thereof doesn't necessarily, directly correlate with street harassment, but it's undeniable that it definitely tends to spike in the summer. 



The perpetrators tend to usually be older, scruffier looking men (truck drivers, construction workers, etc.) who look like my dad's age, or greasy-looking womanizers, and thus I never feel comfortable or consider ""flattered"". It just makes me feel completely uncomfortable and kind of messes with my somewhat low self-esteem, not to mention making it difficult to pick an outfit in the morning as I become very conscious of myself and how I carry myself. 


There's been times where I've been extremely riled up and yell back at the perps, or show the finger. It can definitely be difficult ignoring at times, especially when you're a bit of a hothead like me. 

So, how do you all handle street harassment/unwanted attention?

t3_24i1bk,"Considering facial mole removal, my GP heavily discourages it because of the possibility of scarring. Tell me the truth, how noticeable/distracting is this mole?","I have a mole on my face that is a birthmark, it is not cancerous or shiny/bumpy. It is matte black and I always pluck any hairs that grow near it.  I have had it since birth obviously. I was a shy kid and a lot of people when I was in elementary school used to ask ""what is that"" which made me develop a self conscious feeling about it. I feel so uncomfortable knowing that there's people out there, that don't know me that well and have to refer to me in conversation, say ""that person with the mole."" There's just this general idea that moles are unattractive, and even if they are on an attractive person, they are just always brought up in conversation. I'm a shy person and I don't like the idea of having a feature that makes me easily distinguishable from other people. 

I feel as though people see it before they see my face, and that it's gaudy and makes me look old and gross. When I was 15 my parents let me go to the doctor to ask about the removal process. He said it would scar really badly and my parents told me to keep it because of that. Now 5 years later I go to the same family doctor by myself and ask about it again. He says that he can't do removal because it's extra risk for him or something, and was going to recommend me to a surgeon that would charge $300. He also said that the scar would be ""ugly"" and possibly a ""keloid."" He made the surgery sound very gruesome like they would cut it and sew it back together. I don't know what's behind his motivation to make the process and recovery sound so damn bad. 

I feel like there are other doctors who could do it for less and who would be more helpful, but there aren't many specialists around here who will take you without a referral. 

Is this procedure really as bad as my doctor describes it, or is it more simple and can heal nicely? I have a few cartilage ear piercings that never got scars, and any cuts I've had never left scars either so I feel like I'm not prone. I haven't had major surgery though. I wouldn't mind a flat scar because I can cover it with makeup. The doctor acts like this huge inch tall keloid is GOING to form.

I thought about whether I still want to or not, and I realized that this hasn't really stopped me from doing anything, I have had a lot of success at getting jobs that I want and I have a long term boyfriend. But I am always scared to meet new people that I have to impress because I feel like they're looking at this mole.. 

I have only asked my mom and best friend about this because it's embarassing to talk about extensively and I don't want people to lie and say it's okay, or tell me that it's huge and distracting to my face. That's why I would really appreciate your two cents. Don't be afraid to tell the truth! Is it the first thing you see? Does it distract from me? When you see me, do you instantly think ""girl with a mole?""

t3_24hr9k,"Anyone here not have many (local) friends and are single? How do you deal/keep yourself busy?","What's the longest you've gone without really interacting with anyone? I find myself being able to go almost a week without any quality social/human interaction and that's scary. I don't even want to count how many Saturdays it's been now that I've spent by myself. I mean, I guess it's a good thing that I fall more on the introverted side, but it still sucks. 

Despite my many attempts at expanding my social circle, I always find myself feeling very lonely because I just don't have that many friends. I don't need a lot of friends (quality over quantity) but the downfall to that is when my friends are all out of town, busy, or off doing things I'm not interested in (e.g. bar hopping or clubbing), I find myself alone, wishing for human interaction but not having anyone to reach out to.  I'm starting to dread the question, ""How/what did you do this weekend?"" I can fill my schedule with classes and volunteering to keep myself busy, but the interaction I get with people then isn't always enough. Even though I know I'm not ready to date, I find myself almost wanting to find a relationship just so I have a built in hang out buddy. I don't like that mindset, but it just goes to show how frustrated I am I guess. =/

Anyways, the point of this post isn't asking how to change my situation (and meet new people,etc.), as I already know how... but I'm more interested in how you lovely ladies spend your time, and how you deal/cope with being alone and/or the possible loneliness that can come with that.

I stopped taking it due to insatiable hunger and some intense mood swings. The hunger stopped but now I feel so weird. Some new symptoms are:

1. My fingers and toes feel like they're on fire.

2. Not hungry at all. I get jittery if I don't eat but no actual hunger pangs. 

3. The worse one, crazy mood swings. I recently got back from school and I thought the reason for the dramatic changes in my mood were because of finals stress. It's not. I just ended up screaming at my poor parents for asking me to stop being snarky. I told my mom she must hate me and told my dad he was freaking out because of his PTSD (touchy subject). I ended up running to my room and hyperventilating in my closet. 

Before I started taking birth control I was a stoic, calm, person who never cried and who was joking referred to as cold by friends/family because I didn't let stuff faze me. Now I feel like all my emotions have been magnified by 1000 and if I'm not overly happy, I'm sobbing or pissed off.

I'm worried but excited, and a little scared.","I own the apartment I've been living in for the past five years jointly with my parents. I live here alone (for the most part, see below) and I like it that way...We decided that it's time to cash in on the investment (Okay, they decided but I'm okay with it) and I happened to find an amazing, quirky loft space that I'm very excited about. It's only 15 minutes away by car, but that 15 minutes gives you a giant change - right now, I live in the middle of a major US city. My new apartment is just north of the city, in an...urban suburb (?). It has no buildings attached to it, it's on a busy road that doesn't lend itself to walking around (I have a car but have never relied on it for everything like I'm going to have to now). I have been able to walk 90 seconds outside my front door to go buy milk/cat food/toilet paper at 2am for the past 7 years. It's a big change. 

Being that I've lived in this busy (college kids, sports fans, marathon runners...) neighborhood for 7 years, I'm worried I'll become a shut-in or that my friends won't come to the new apartment or that it won't feel like home.

t3_24i3gg,"[UPDATE] Buddy system and advice needed regarding labels and ""good guys""","Hi TwoX! So I made a post previously about using the buddy system after I was left behind at the bar, got a ride with a ""nice guy"" who tried to take me home, had to walk back to my own house after being locked out at 3am, ended up losing my belongings that I gave to a friend and in the end was told it was my fault completely. I understand it may have been a miscommunication between friends but I took your advice that most (if not all gave me) and went my own way instead of continuing our friendship as it isn't the first time this has happened to me or to the others.

I've also decided to take it a step further and seek therapy (not just because of this issue) and so far, I'm feeling better. With that being said, since your advice worked the first time I'm back for round two.

Since that night (in which I overreacted) I've had some mean comments thrown my way, mostly stating I'm crazy. Truthfully it's getting to me and I'm trying pretty hard to get better and I don't know what to do.

To give a shortcut, that night at the bar I was talking to a guy for three hours just at a table and literally didn't move. I should have spent the night with my friends but considering they were doing the same, I didn't think it was a huge deal. My friends left without me, without checking, and I made the mistake of assuming that we were all going to get a taxi like we always do. Around 1am I started searching and realized they were gone and at 2am eventually I got a ride with a ""nice guy"" I went to school with.

I told him, along with his friend, that I had to go back to my other friends house and they assured me it worked out because my friend Alison's house was on the way to their own. I thank them and I hail a cab. I am drunk at this point (as it's St.Pattys day) and as I get in the taxi I not only repeat that I'm going to Alison's house and where it is located to them, but also to the taxi driver.

I'm pretty on edge at this point as it's coming on to 3am and you know, my friends have ditched me and I literally don't have anyone except these two guys- plus i'm drunk. Anyway, the nice guy Steve, tells the taxi driver to go to his apartment. I figured I would get dropped off on the way back and Steve briefly forgot where I was going as he was tipsy as well. They both get out, Steve and his friend Chris, and I refused.

Long story short, Steve tries to convince me to get out of the taxi and go back to his place for the night. I keep saying no. He tries to assure me along with his friend, I can go back to Alisons's tomorrow. It's coming on to 3:30 am and I say no, that's not what we agreed upon. They keep trying until the taxi driver tells them to go inside and gives me a free lift.

Now the kicker that sort of makes me think I'm possibly being targetted by these people and being victimized for ""talking down"" about nice guy Steve, is because when the taxi driver closed his taxi and began driving he deliberately told me multiple times how I made the right decision. He even went further to say that he use to do that when he was young and Steve knew the entire time, along with the taxi driver, where I was going and was just playing dumb/taking advantage that I was intoxicated in an attempt to get lucky.

Mentioned that it was a bit messed up he did it in the first place and he heard me several times not only say I'm not going home with them but give directions where I wanted to (I was correct that it was on the way to their house). Eventually I got back to Alisons's, was locked out, needed my stuff to get back to my own apartment, was angry, scared, sad and I did completely overreact. I was banging on the door crying when it sort of hit me I could have been raped (stupid I know) and I was angry my friends left me behind. Long story short, I got in a fight with the girl who lost my coat and ever since, pretty sure she, along with Alison's housemate who didn't know what completely happened, have been spreading some awful stuff. 

I overreacted but ever since, I'm labelled crazy for thinking Steve would even do such a thing. I don't know what to do, I feel like I am crazy which is why I'm getting therapy but apart of me also is considering that I'm also partially being victimized by these people. I moved away for a year and no one ever called me crazy (that I'm aware of). We all went to high school together and it's like no one ever dropped my label and they keep building on. I don't know how to escape it. How do you know when you're crazy? 

As said, I think I have an idea how all those girls feel who have truly been raped and had no one believe them due to their past decisions or responses. No one looks at the situation objectively but I think what hurts most and what's bringing me down, is that no one wants to take my side because it's so easy to blame these bad encounters on my ""crazy"". I wish someone would sit me down for once and really ask my side of what happened instead of just turning cheek. What does it matter. I'm crazy, nothing I feel or think makes sense to anyone.

tdlr; Bad friends left me at the bar alone, ""good guy"" Steve offered me a cab ride, tried to take me home, I'm crazy/mean weeks after for thinking he would ever take advantage of a woman

See this dress I’m wearing? Apparently, I’m not allowed to wear it anymore because it’s offensive and disrespectful to my teacher. This is my favorite dress. My sister gave it to me, and she has a similar one in blue. I feel pretty in it. I’m in Student Government for Christ’s sake, so it’s not like I don’t know what our dress code is. Our principal has told me he liked the zombie unicorns on it. 

I had to stay in after class because my teacher told me that it might be “allowed on campus, but it’s not allowed in her classroom”, because it goes against Chinese culture and is disrespectful to wear it when learning the language. She makes me  wear extra layers, even in 80+ degree weather. She inspects my outfits every day now, and no one else’s.

Wanna know the real kicker? It’s because I’m a bit fuller. None of the other girls in my class are targeted by her. Only once has any other girl been told to cover up, and she was wearing an undershirt under a really cute dress. I’ve even asked her why my body offends her and why female anatomy offends her. I’ve even gone as far as to tell her that what she’s doing is unfair to me, and that I shouldn’t be punished for my body and the way clothes cover it.

She told me I look like I’m asking for something bad to happen to me if I was in China. **NO ONE EVER ASKS TO BE MOLESTED**

Now if I were honestly doing something crude or offensive, or just downright inappropriate for a school setting, I’d understand, but all I’m doing is wearing a dress with some unicorns on it. 
Tomorrow I’m going to wear this dress again and if I get in trouble for it, I’m reporting her. My parents are on my side in doing this too, and are telling me to record the conversations that may happen is she makes me stay in during break.

I'm currently in school, and it's been awesome. My first year I took a course on sexuality which had a brief feminism unit that I really, really enjoyed. It felt at once empowering and devastating to examine feminist issues. Anyways, I've been much more active on that front and enjoy discussing it with my girlfriends. However, I've realized that I absolutely cannot vocalize any kind of complaint about daily sexism to my boyfriend because he thinks it's some kind of first world problem!! I am not at all preachy about it (last time it came up, I told him I wished more of the movies we watched had leading female protagonists), and I've lately realized it's better not to talk about any kind incidents that might hint at inequality, sexism, oppression, etc in daily life because of how he reacts to it, but now he likes to ask me about it just so he can ""debunk"" modern sexism and turn it around to tell me that because I've lived a pretty nice life it's laughable for me to try to claim that I've faced any kind of oppression. To give you a better idea, in our last argument, I told him he would probably never really understand unless he spent the day as a woman, to which he told me I've ""won the lottery"" as an attractive and educated woman, and if I occasionally wish I had been born otherwise, I have some kind of ""messed up perspective on life.""

I'm almost at my wits end. Like I said, it's not as though I go around moaning and crying about having a terrible life...because I don't. I had a great childhood and am pursuing a great education, but just like any other woman I do experience daily sexism and really hate being made to feel as though I am actually just insane/spoiled/whatever. I've tried my best to recall what we went over in that sexuality class, and usually fall back on the [caged-bird metaphor](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marilyn_Frye) but he just isn't having it. I honestly would prefer to just leave it alone but, like I mentioned, he has taken to trying to bring it up from time to time and it's just exhausting. He is very facts-oriented, so if any of you perhaps had some kind of literature I could direct him to, or really just general advice, that would be great. He's very intelligent and I love him for every other quality but unfortunately his father is a bit sexist and I think it's starting to show in him. ",17,20140502013319,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24j5gu,"Thinking about going off the pill","I've been using one brand or another of birth control pill for about 4 years now.  

The first one I used for a couple years killed my sex drive.  I switched last summer, and that issue is better, but I feel like my acne and mood swings are way worse on this one.  Now when I PMS, I get so irritated and even straight up angry, it's ridiculous.  I also feel like my mood throughout my cycle and even throughout individual days fluctuates like crazy - going from perfectly content and happy to crushed and disgusted with myself and then back again just like that.

Soon after I switched to this new BC, I moved to a new city and started graduate school, so maybe stress and a new environment has something to do with these symptoms, but I can't really isolate the variables.  I've also been dealing with (self-diagnosed) depression/low self-esteem for a while now.

I just want to be in control of my emotions again!  I don't know which of my emotions are real and which are affected/caused by my medicine.  I feel like I don't know who I really am.

So, does anyone else feel like their BC affects their mood this much?  Does switching to a different brand/formula help?  I am a bit tired of shopping around though and want to give it up entirely.  How long does it take for your body to stabilize after stopping the pill?  I am going to study abroad for 7 weeks this summer.  If I decide to stop taking the pill, should I wait until I am back home?

Thank you for reading my ramblings, and I appreciate any advice you may have.

t3_24isvr,"High-school just got a lot worse today, should I move schools?","Some back story, tonight was a farewell bonfire party to some exchange students. We are all 15-16. I bought the food, firewood and planned everything. The party is awesome for the first few hours then some kids who weren't invited showed up and everything went to shit. 

A brief overview.

* I was called a bitch for asking no one to bring alcohol (we would get suspended or expelled because it's considered school time)
* I was made fun of for having dark leg hair, which means you can see my hair follicles even if I shave.
* I was told I had small tits
* I was called fat because I didn't want to take off my shorts while swimming (I have really bad stretch marks and don't shave my pubic hair because I am lazy and have sensitive skin)
* My best friend told me not to be jealous of her because she was about to kiss a boy and I was not.
* My other best friend went off and flirted with the guy who made fun of my small breasts and dark hair. For three hours. Even though she said she hated him, though now it seems she loves the attention. This guy hash-tags his own selfies with, #handsome, #goodlooking. 
* Kids started lighting random stuff on fire. The 'random stuff' was my belongings I had brought for the party, i.e. bags of chips, tubs I carried the stuff in, some paper towels. 

This does not do justice to hell-hole that was disguised as a party. 

Everything that happened is so trivial but it adds up over time and I'm just worn out. My thick skin can't protect for this long. 

I go to a school that has maybe 40 kids within the grade, 12 of them being female. It is a K-12 private school and I have now been with these kids for five years (I transferred in grade 5.) I was hoping maybe I could just disappear, float away. But in a school this small it's impossible.

But my question is, with two years of high school left, should I move schools? Is it better in a bigger school where the kids aren't stuck up private schoolers who love to prove that mommy and daddy didn't shelter them? 

Have any of you changed schools this late in the game? What kind of school should I go for? Public, private? 

Any advice would be lovely. I'm sitting in my room right now just frustrated and over-whelmed, so much so that I feel like crying.",2,20140502004915,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24jsn0,"High School Dress Code & Rape Culture Rant","So I'm a student teacher at a high school (I'm a 26 year old woman). We've been having a heat wave, and the admin has been cracking down on student dress code. It should be noted that our school has no women in the administration or in the student management office. A couple days ago, a female student put up posters around the school to the effect that the dress code (which is heavily female-biased) was promoting rape culture, since it cited the distracting influence of female dress on boys. In my opinion, she's not wrong.

The principal punished the student who put up the posters, cracked down on a planned protest by several students, and had a meeting with some of the more vocal students about this. This morning we had a staff meeting so he could update us on what's been going on. He clearly thinks it's a joke. He said he didn't know what rape culture was - that he had to do some research - and made some comments that he thinks students are doing this to ""try to be feminist."" He went on to say that ""being a feminist means you shouldn't dress like that,"" and that ""boys wear inappropriate things sometimes too!"" He also made some classist comments about how our poor students (we're a high poverty school) don't know how to dress, because poor people don't know what's appropriate for the workplace. The district is re-writing the dress code with gender-neutral language, but the fact remains that the administration, and most of the teachers (largely men and older women), are treating this like a joke. 

It's not a joke. Part of our job as teachers is teaching and discussing appropriate socialization. Part of our job is to teach our students that they have a voice. Our job is to speak truth. Rape culture is not a joke. It's not something that will go away with re-writing the dress code or telling students they can't wear short-shorts. Punishing a student for speaking her mind about something that matters to her - and should matter to everyone - is disgusting. Expecting, and requiring! female students to be ashamed of their bodies (when our culture idolizes and fetishizes their young female bodies) is disgusting. Not having any female admin is disgusting and backwards. Blaming this on class and parenting is disgusting. 

I'm pissed as hell. I can't do anything - I'm a student teacher. I can't talk to the principal because I'd jeopardize my chances of getting a job (the principal is a required reference for a lot of districts). My supervising teacher - who's a woman - is pretty conservative, and I don't want to piss her off, again because of references, but also because I need a to have a working relationship with her for the next 8 weeks. I basically have to keep my mouth shut. I was going to apply for a job here, but I'm seriously reconsidering doing that. I don't want to work in a sexist, classist environment like this. I don't want to work in a place where student, and especially female voices are treated like they don't matter. 

Am I wrong to be pissed about this? Am I reading too much into it? Should I jeopardize my career to speak out about this (I'm considering it)? ",23,20140502105411,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I was the first person to be hired onto the team to do a certain line of work, but I've never been allowed to do that line of work because I ""don't have enough experience,"" but several of the male employees that we brought in after me had less experience than I do.

I'll type out my question and maybe you guys can point me in the right direction. 

On 4/21 my ex lured me to his apartment and raped me. Looking back at the messages earlier that day it seemed like it was premeditated. I went to the cops (a few days late... I was scared) and got a case and my phone messages/call logs copied for them. I also went to the hospital to get bruises photographed, poked, swabbed, and drugged up with antibiotics. I went in again later that week and gave them copies of messages from my facebook. He logged onto my daughters account since I had all of his accounts blocked and in those messages it states him raping me and his craziness... when I block accounts he makes new ones to message me. He's showed up at my work and home unannounced.  

My problem is it's been over a week and I haven't heard anything from the cop, detective, lawyers, anyone, about anything. I've gone in left papers, called and left messages, and in the meantime my ex is messaging me and driving around free and starting up a new relationship with another girl. He got a new car and new tv, and is living his life while I'm stuck being afraid every little noise is him coming for me. 

Who do I need to talk to to get him arrested? How long does an investigation of rape take when there's messages about how he's raped me? I can't live with him free to pop by at any time... Im at work alone a lot and there's no way anyone else can be scheduled with me.",10,20140502202022,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

But those dreams quickly turn sour from the struggles and pain my parents went through raising two special needs boys.   I suppose, as a defense and coping mechanism, I've decided that instead of pining away at wanting a child but being too scared, it's easier to just decide that I vehemently don't want a child, even though, that's the polar opposite from the truth.

t3_24laph,"Please help me regain trust with my boyfriend. (semi long, please read)","I am 21 y/o and just moved across the country with my 30 y/o boyfriend.

Super long story short, I am not a cheater, never have cheated. I had an old boyfriend of three years who mutually broke up with around Sep-Oct. of 2013. I started reconnecting with my current bf (we were past friends) in November, even though he lived across the country we got along super well, and I recently moved across the country for him a month ago.

Fast forward to last night. I get an angry e-mail from my ex (who has a severe history with depression finding a drunken post I posted a while ago when I was down saying I wasn't interested in my new boyfriend and was lost (I immediately deleted it the next morning, feeling it wasn't true and I was being stupid). He told me I cheated on him, blah blah blah, making me feel like shit.

And what do I do? The dumbest, most regretful thing. I played sorry for him, telling him I loved him and missed him in an e-mail, that I made a mistake by moving, because I didn't know how else to comfort him. I definitely never cheated on him! We were over, and I guess he always thought things could rekindle. I moved on and didn't even start dating my newer SO until two months or so ago, (April 2014) and I moved on before our break up. 

So I delete the email, and hurt start crying to my SO saying what happened and how I wasn't a cheater. (It hurt me so much because I did/stuck around a lot for him, and that wasn't me. It made me furious along with having a low depression month after my grandfather's recent passing) I didn't tell him about the e-mails I sent back, because I didn't want him to know honestly. I didn't know what to do, I felt stupid and lost. And I know, I KNOW, it was wrong.

Fast forward a few hours later, my SO wakes me up hurt because he saw the e-mails. He was confused, thought I was telling the truth in them (of course he did, why wouldn't he) and we talked for a few hours while I balled my eyes out. Worst of all, he saw the reddit post about him which made me so so sad, because I deleted it so quickly and my ex got a hold of it and e-mailed it to me, I of course didn't want any one to see it, I felt like it was a journal entry. He forgave me when I explained everything, which was bold and mighty of him since his ex of three years cheated on him a ton with multiple men.

We talked more this morning, and things seem to be a little better. I am still heartbroken and in so much regret, I have been crying on and off. I also wrote an email to my ex saying the truth and that I wasn't coddling him anymore.

I don't deserve his forgiveness but I will do everything in my power to prove my love to him. This is a super summarized version, so if you need elaboration I will. I just want to know if anyone has ever been in this situation and how I can go about gaining his trust back? I know it takes time, but I want to show him I would never, ever, cheat on him. I just had a stupid mistake feeling low and vulnerable, but I would never touch, or kiss another man while being in a relationship.

I made a post in this subreddit before about [a problem I have](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jtpyg/i_dont_know_what_a_vagina_looks_like_and_im/) (I've forgotten the password for that account, it's been two years). I kind of haven't managed to overcome that problem since that thread, and I know that makes me kind of shitty and pathetic but whatever. 

Anyway, the big problem now is I think I have thrush. I've got an appointment with my GP next week because I've got a pretty nasty infection around one of my nipples which is no fun and the antibiotics I was on didn't clear it up at all. Really they just made my life a little bit worse. Anyway, the thought of talking to my GP about my vagina is horrifically daunting for me, and the possibility of having to actually show my vagina is already giving me panic attacks, but even beyond that I'm fairly certain the solution will involve putting something into my vagina and I don't know if it's something I can do, but I don't think I can explain that to my doctor without sounding like I'm insane. 

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me. Or... I don't know, I'm not sure really what I'm hoping to get out of this. In all honesty I'm hoping it magically disappears before I see my GP and I never have to mention it again.

Edit: Or you could downvote me. That's helpful too I guess. If this should be in a different subreddit, can someone let me know instead of just silently downvoting? Or I dunno. Whatever. I guess it's a stupid problem. 

Update: I haven't seen my doctor yet, but I got an over-the-counter cream to use on the meantime, though I'm not really 100% certain where I'm putting it which probably isn't a good thing, but hey, better than nothing, right? I tried taking a picture to see if I could figure shit out, but I couldn't even see any openings and now I just feel sick on top of everything else.

Edit 2: Okay, I guess I'll go now, people are just kind of downvoting everything I say so I'm pretty sure I'm not welcome here. I just thought I might be able to get some advice.

t3_24kvok,"Just had my first pap smear, and I'm a little confused with the results. I can't call the office until Monday. Help?","So I just went in a couple weeks ago to my university health clinic for my first pap smear. I only started having sex about a year ago, and have only been with two guys. Since going on birth control around 5 months ago, I've noticed a change in discharge, which can be normal at times I've heard. But after I let my bf come inside the first time, I immediately had what seemed to be symptoms of BV. I used some probiotic supplements, and as long as I don't let him come inside me I'm fine. Since we're long distance right now, it hasn't been a problem because we haven't been able to have sex very often at all.

So to the part where I'm confused. I went in for my pap smear, and they post the results online. At the top the note from the doctor states that my pap smear is normal. But below under the specific results it reads, ""a shift in vaginal flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosis"". Should I call my doctor and ask about this? Is it something to be concerned about? or does it simply mean my pH right now is a little high? I unfortunately had the pap smear two days before getting my period, so perhaps that has something to do with it? I'm worried about it, and the office is closed until Monday morning. I'm just afraid that when my bf comes home in a couple weeks from school that its going to start back up. And I thought perhaps some people here could help me out with some insight or advice.

A few months ago I started dating a friend I've had for years. Its fantastic! I've never felt so happy and supported through my whole life. However last night he dropped some heavy news. He might be required to move to the west coast for his job. He is looking to purchase the magazine he has been working at.  This is wonderful news for him and he has questioned whether or not I would be able to attend school in the province where he will be going. I'm about to start my second degree in a very competitive program that is only offered at a handful of schools in my country. There is only one that I could go to and it would be a substantial amount more money than I currently have and would be able to save. 

He won't know if he needs to move for another few months so it's all up in the air. I feel pretty choked and I want to handle this in the healthiest way possible but I'm just not that good at waiting! My last boyfriend told me he was leaving me when he left to go tree planting a month before he left and it was a very miserable month. I think I might be extra edgy because of this. My current boyfriend says he really doesn't want to have to leave me and his family and the wonderful support and community he has built in our city, but this is a huge opportunity for him and at 25 he needs to focus on his career.

Any thoughts or related experience are welcome. If you have any suggestions on how to be level headed about this and wait it out patiently I would so much love to read it!

For the last few weeks we've been planning my nephew's first birthday and the house has been in chaos. My mom, SIL and I have been super busy with planning and cooking on top of going to work and all the other crap we've had to deal with. Today while setting up for the party my dad started to yell at my mom in front of our in laws for not doing more to prepare. This is something that has been a regular occurance throughout my life. My dad has always been the type who's pretty mellow but the second he gets mad or upset he just flies off the handle yelling and screaming horrible things at all of us (in our family). 

Well today I had had enough and told my dad in a firm but low voice to just cut it out this once because the day was meant to be a happy one. Not only did his rage triple but he ran at me screaming at me to shut up. This time however he didn't just run at me screaming like usual, he held up his hand in a closed fist and threatened to ""beat me senseless"". I said ""Do it then!"" and he lunged forward and opened his hand but right before he could hit me stopped, turned, and stalked off. My mom is now upset because she thinks I need to just get over it and move on because, ""that's just how he is.""

I've never been so scared and angry and sad all at once. Writing this now and thinking about it I'm shaking. I'm a fucking 25 year old woman and I don't know what to do. My job doesn't pay quite enough to move out on my own right now and I don't want to tell my boyfriend what happened or he'd never come over to my parents house again. I don't know where to turn. Moving in with my boyfriend isn't really an option because right now he's out of a job and could be returning to his home country if he doesn't find work by fall. 

I need advice please please PLEASE. I can't think straight and every time I think of my dad's face I just want to vomit. I hate him so much right now and I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive him for the hell he's put our family through all these years. I don't know how I can be in this house with him after this or how to go about moving or running away.

t3_24nje2,"My baby sister just turned 8...and I think she's in the earliest stages puberty already. Help!","So here's what's up. My baby sister just turned 8 not even two weeks ago. I'm 20, we're 12 years apart. She has always grown in quick spurts and been the among the tallest girls in her class. Right now, she comes up to my shoulders (not sure of an exact height measurement, but I'm 5' 2"" if you want to guess off of my shoulder height) and she weighs 70 pounds. For the record, her biological father is 6' 5"", which has to contribute to the height.

As of late, my mom and I have noticed certain changes about her physically and emotionally. For one, she been eating more than usual. A LOT. Thankfully it's mostly healthy stuff (she loves vegetables...and refuses meat, oddly enough. Youngest vegetarian I've ever known) with the occasional spoonful of Nutella and potato chips here and there. Either way, she is putting on weight faster than my mom can buy clothes that fit her. She is nowhere near overweight as she's a very active kid, but I remember going through a phase like that right as I began puberty. She's also become more...self-conscious? I guess? About being clean. My parents are fixing up a house currently and she was over there with them, the entire time complaining that she ""felt gross"" and needed to take a shower because she stunk. When we got home, she was in the shower before we finished unloading stuff out of the car. Just a few months ago you had to force her to bathe, and now she's persistent about keeping clean...another transformation I went through when I started puberty. She's also been having some sleep troubles too. She'll fall asleep at 7pm, be wide awake at 2am (when I usually get home from work) and go back to sleep until morning time. I know your body needs extra rest during those times, which makes me wonder as well if some things are starting to change.

Her emotional changes have been a disaster already! She's already beginning to have mood swings. She will just randomly start crying, and when asked why she's sad she just answers ""I don't know"" or ""I'm just tired"", then she will be perfectly fine 5-10 minutes afterward, like nothing happened. (She's a generally happy kid and is never persistently sad, so we're certain she's not depressed.) My mother and I always tell her it's okay be sad now and then and to cry even if you don't have a reason to.

I know this is all a natural process, but I am so worried for her. I have always been a tiny girl, so I didn't start puberty until I was 11 (at the absolute earliest), started my period when I was 13, and didn't get pubic hair or boobs that amounted to anything until 15-16. I felt as though I developed on the average timeline. I'm worried for my sister though...she's such an early bloomer. I'm afraid other kids might make fun of her at school (she's only in the second grade) or that she might start her period and not know what to do or bleed on her pants and get sad or something. :( My mother plans to have the period talk with her within the next few days and let her dad know to be prepared (she has visitation with her father every weekend.) 

I don't know what I should do as the big sister in the situation. Mom plans on giving her the talk, but little sis has always been my shadow and my partner in crime, and I want to be there for her when she starts going through all this craziness. I want her to feel like she can come to me with questions and be open with me, and I'm sure she will be. I'm just so nervous for her. I don't want her to feel like a freak of nature when all these changes start happening. :(

TwoX, were any of you ""early bloomers""? How did you handle it? What kind of support would you have liked during that time?

My youngest sister, 14, is self harming/drinking/doing drugs. My parents immediately went to action when they found out and found a really wonderful therapist that specializes in girls her age with these exact issues, so that's not what I need advice on. 

The issue is this- she has really poor self esteem. She gets down about how she looks, and that manifests in aggression towards me/my mother and self harming. She is the youngest of 4 girls, 7 years younger than my twin and I, and 11 years younger than our oldest sister. She is really into fashion (think [Rookie](http://www.thestylerookie.com)), but does not dress her body type well. In fact, she dresses very poorly.  I'm not sure how to go about talking to about dressing her body type better when she talks to me about her unhappiness with her appearance. 

She gets EXTREMELY hostile if you even so much as mention that the way she dresses is in any way, shape, or form bad, so I don't know what to do. I think she would be happier if she dressed to her body type more, but I can't figure out how to talk to her about it. Any suggestions? I know this is jumbled, so feel free to ask question to clarify ",16,20140503193601,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24o38x,"I got fired for a stupid reason, but it's kind of a good thing. [Kind of ranty]","So, the woman who runs my department at my university has taken a severe disliking to me. I don't know why, and she's not dumb enough to admit anything about it directly. Suffice it to say, she has yelled/cursed at me, insulted me, called me things like arrogant, lazy, unprofessional, undedicated, mediocre, etc.

I recently had a departmental review, and several of the professors have said they felt bad about the things that were said there (by her.) I don't think her opinion of me is objective. That is to say, I don't think I really AM lazy, arrogant or any of the other things she has said. Granted, most people don't think that of themselves, but I've gone over and over it in my head and I've asked other people and begged them to be honest, and while I'm not perfect, I'm not as bad as all that.

Some people from outside the situation have said she might be jealous (I'm an art major, and although she has an MFA, we will pretty much be competing in the same shows after I graduate, at least in this my state). I think she might be offended that I taught drawing to some high school kids last summer at a camp without telling/asking her, but I don't need permission from the school to do that. I have also been known to be really harsh with a couple of my peers when they ask for critique on their work, but I usually realize it and try to apologize, and lately, I've been afraid to speak at all about other people's work for fear that she'll be even angrier.

When I got my work-study job, it was because she pressured my boss to hire me. She has used me to pressure other professors about department politics too, in very manipulative and vindictive ways. Since she has taken a disliking to me, she pressured my boss to hire her new pet student, so I've now lost my job and all the power and privilege and responsibility (and the paycheck) that came with it. I normally wouldn't be so bothered by it, but the thing is, the paradigm for my job was to hire someone at the end of their freshman year and let them work the job until their graduation. That's how it was with my predecessor and all the ones before me, as far as I know. I thought I had job security. But this is the end of my junior year, and now I'm jobless. No one else has ever been fired from this job, as far as I know. And while my performance hasn't been perfect, I don't think it was bad enough to have been terminated. I've always gotten everything done on time at the level of quality my boss desired. They didn't even tell me they had fired me or hired someone else or anything. My second boss just got an e-mail telling me to turn in my keys at the end of the semester, which I have never had to do before. This prompted me to ask my boss, and he told me he had already offered the job to someone else but that ""I would be the first to know.""

I am bummed. I am angry. I -almost- want to take it to an authority figure and do something about it, even though I'm not sure I have grounds to. I don't think I'm going to do any of that, though. Now that I've been fired, she doesn't hold any more power over me. I'm 21 years old, I'm going to pull on my big girl pants and get a real part-time job that will probably pay better and will be there after I graduate. I've got a job lined up for the first half of the summer, but in the second half, I'm going to come back to town and get down to business.

Do any of you have some wisdom for me? Tips and tricks on how to deal with a bully in a position of power? Ever been dropped on your ass and had to pick yourself up?",7,20140503221405,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24o185,"Follow-up Post: Got my IUD yesterday. It kinda sucked.","Original post is here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2350gk/wanted_to_share_my_30f_experience_with_getting_an/


TL;DR:  Got an IUD, it hurt in a way I couldn't have imagined.  Still cramping, but would do again.

Here are my stats if you don't want to read the original post.  I am 30, female of course, never had children, in a committed relationship (we're planning to marry).


So.  First, I had to misoprostol 8 hours before the procedure.  It's the generic for cytotec which is used off label to induce labor.  Within an hour I was having moderately painful cramps.  It wasn't bad enough to keep me from work, however, and I did not take any ibuprofen  However, I experienced the unpleasant side affect of diarrhea, which came on VERY suddenly.  


My appointment was at 2:30.  I knew it was going to hurt and the doctor recommended I take some ibuprofen before the appointment.  I have some left over darvocet so I decided to take one of those at 2 as well as 4 ibuprofen  Now I'm obviously not a medical professional.  I don't even know if this is a dangerous combination but I did it.


I got to the appointment and the room was already set up with all the tools.  They had me undress from the waist down.  They asked if I had anymore questions before we got started.  I didn't.  I did tell the doctor I was scared.  She said everyone is scared, even she was, because you don't know what to expect.  My doctor was very reassuring so that was really helpful.  She explained everything she was doing throughout the whole thing.  I got in the stirrups per usual but she had me splay my legs out.  Normally at a gyno appointment my knees are pointing up.  This time she had me point my knees to either side so I was completely wide open.


Usually at a gyno appointment, I don't really experience any discomfort.  Speculum doesn't hurt, getting the cervix cells sample doesn't hurt either.  


First she checked my uterus by having one hand in and one hand out and pushing her hands together.  Then came the speculum.  This actually caused some discomfort because she opened it pretty much as wide as possible.  I felt a lot of pressure and ...like, a stretching feeling.  Then she cleaned the cervix.  She did a couple quick swipes 3 different times with whatever it was she used.  It didn't hurt, just a little pressure.  However, she noticed that I had a polyp on my cervix so she cut it off.  This didn't hurt either.  I hardly noticed it was happening.  That will be sent out and tested.  She told me a lot of women bleed after sex because they have a polyp that is getting hit but don't know it.  (I was experiencing this so it explains a lot!)  This was kind of the only awkward moment because she called in her nurse to bring in a container for the polyp.  So there I am...as wide open as I could possibly be and this other girl is hanging out down there.  I was prepared for one person to be up in my biz but 2 was kind of disconcerting.


So first - she had to measure my uterus.  I don't exactly know what all this entails but something goes up in my cervix...and it hurt.  At that point I knew the actual insertion was going to be worse because the IUD was bound to bigger.  It hurt.  A. Lot. It was like these intense pinching cramps, like everything just seized up.  This was pretty quick though so the pain was over relatively quickly.


Next came the actual insertion.  Nothing could have prepared me for this.  I was mentally prepared to experience pain.  But this wasn't like any pain I've ever felt.  It didn't hurt in the way you think of something being painful - like a shot or a punch in the arm or something.  This experience taught me that there aren't really pain receptors in the cervix and uterus. 


She started the insertion and IMMEDIATELY my body seized up and i was making uncomfortable noises.  My arm went over my head and I started holding my breathe.  Again, it wasn't ""pain"" but more of a sharp, pinching, worst cramps you're ever going to have outside of childbirth type pain.  But it's a constant tight cramp if that makes any sense.  The insertion was longer than the uterus measuring.  I couldn't tell you how long really because it felt like time stood still.  I was really wishing my boyfriend was there to hold my hand at that point - I don't even care if it sounds stupid.  She trimmed the strings during this part and then it was done.


She asked if I wanted to sit but I said I couldn't because I was light headed.  At this point the doctor said to me that she actually almost passed out during her insertion but doesn't tell people that.  Even so, she would do it again and again.  After about 5 more minutes I was able to sit up.  I got dressed, put my panty liner in (was on my  period as requested and though it was light, I expected some bleeding from the insertion), and left.  


I really wish I would have had someone to drive me home.  It hurt. again, just a giant terrible cramp.  It hurt significantly enough that I thought I was going to vomit.  I felt like this for a few hours.  Every bump, even  my pants were hurting me because they were constricting my lower stomach.  I actually checked my seat belt because I though it was on my stomach really tight but it wasn't.  I got home, put on my biggest pair of sweatpants (actually my boyfriend's pants), got my heating pad, curled up in bed and put Mad Men on Netflix.  The heating pad was AWESOME.  It's helped a ton.

As for bleeding...panty liners weren't enough.  I bled through and onto my pants. Now it wasn't like I was gushing blood, it was just more than a panty liner could handle which I really should have thought of.  And it wasn't clumpy and mucous-y period blood either.  I'm pretty sure it was 95% blood caused by the insertion.  It was pretty watery which I'm sure contributed to the messiness.


Today I put in a tampon - which was terrifying - but it was good.  I'm still crampy all the time.  Ibuprofen helps but I still feel it.  I can tell immediately when the ibuprofen wears off because it starts hurting and I also start experiencing lower back pain.  With the ibuprofen it just feels like light period cramps.  Pants still hurt.  I went in to work today for a few hours and was really uncomfortable because of the jeans in my stomach while sitting up.  Ultimately, it's 90% better than it was yesterday.  I've already decided I would do it again - just not next week or anything :)


Tomorrow is my friend's wedding shower and I'm a bridesmaid.  I prepared them for the idea that I may not go but I'm going to be there---wearing a maxi skirt lol.  A lot of moving around makes it more uncomfortable.  I'm also not looking forward to having it come out but even now just the knowledge that I'm better protected from pregnancy than if I got my tubes tied is beyond comforting.  Mine will be in for about 2 years before we remove it to try for kids - Still worth it.  Now is not the time for us. I'm not sure how long the cramping will last or when I'll be ready for sex but I figure that we'll be doing it again by next week ;)


So yes...it sucks.  but being in pain for a day and then some mild pain for a few more days is worth it to me.  I hope I didn't scare anyone off but I wanted to be as honest as possible.  Also - I've decided I want the epidural during childbirth and that my boyfriend will be in attendance at all future IUD appointments.  

UPDATE: It's now the second day after the insertion and I'm not experiencing any pain or cramps anymore. I'm having just slight bleeding..but its more like spotting mixed in with the other stuff that normally leaks out.  Dr. said I could be spotting for 12 weeks so I'm prepared for it.

UPDATE: I was feeling around for the strings and could only feel one. Also...it's really long...as in nearly to the edge of my vagina long. I talked to my Dr.'s nurse. She said the strings are pretty thin but what I'm feeling is thicker. She advised it sounds like they are just stuck together. I'm not feeling any abnormal pain so she thinks the strings were left that long on purpose (Dr. told me she cut them long but that seemed too long). I can't feel anything protruding from my cervix so she doesn't think it's being rejected and I'm not in any pain. I'm still nervous about it being properly placed so I'm going to continue to use condoms until my follow up appointment in 6 weeks.",7,20140503214521,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I am in the middle of writing my application essay/Letter of Intent for a graduate program, and I've been working on it now for... over two weeks. It's a two page essay. Every time I go to write, I freeze. I know this is the right program for me, I'm pretty sure this is the right school for me (and there aren't many options for me to choose from anyway), and I know it is definitely something I want to pursue. Why am I having such a hard time with this? I almost feel.. undeserving? I don't know. I am in a constant state of anxiety/panic. I have taken care of just about every other part of the application, this is pretty much all that is left (and waiting on recommendation letters).

I think some of the trouble I may be having is that, with undergraduate applications, it was like ""ok here pick a topic, write about it,"" whereas now I am being given a set of questions to answer in letter form. I have tried to answer them each individually, but can't seem to make it ""flow"" in any logical way or connect them into one coherent piece of writing, the ""write a thesis statement"" approach doesn't seem to apply either. Additionally, a lot of my drive for wanting to pursue this program is from life experience, rather than my undergraduate education, but they clearly do not want my cheesy little life story and I don't want to bullshit this essay because this is really important to me.

t3_24oyzs,"So I got a lot of shit for being a feminist AND an Asian women...","This post is about my experience as a feminist, and how I got so much shit for it because I am also an Asian women. You know, because of the whole demure, submissive, china doll stereotype. Oftentimes you hear Asian women regarded as the epitome of femininity, thus why a lot of men are interested in us. I don’t see this as a compliment at all, but rather dehumanizing. Why? Because a lot of these men who subscribe to this stereotype are some of most misogynistic and possess ridiculous backward thinking. That me being a feminist somehow makes me less of an Asian women because I am not submissive and ""act like a men-hating feminazi"".  

For example, there are a lot of sexpats coming in to /s/Asiantwox (a sub for Asian American women) to creep on Asian women. They would always try to marginalize every discussion we have pertaining to racial and gender issues. Last time I tried to call out such troll, he sent me a long message about how we are overreacting and how “feminism has ruined us” (this is why I use a throwaway account, to prevent harassment). Okay, just because we don’t fit into your sexist stereotypical view of how an Asian women should act, then we are somehow no good. Then I dig into this guy’s comment history, lo and behold, he is a frequenter of porn subs with Asian women, a red-piller who thinks a wife cannot deny her husband sex under any circumstance, hates white women, a sexpat in Hong Kong, and a Men’s Right and White Right activist. I am not surprised at all, because I found that a good chunk of these men who have “yellow fever” are like that. That they are so misogynistic and backward thinking that no western women would want them, so they seek out Asian women, whom they believe is more submissive and “what a proper women should act”. Does this sound like men you would want to date? 

It doesn't help that often times they are treated like kings in Asian countries, because some Asian girls see white men as some sort of status symbol. Doesn't matter how much of a sexist pig the guy is, by being a privileged white men you would still have local girls running into your arm. I felt like these women are full filling the stereotype. 

In no way am I trying to lump together every guy whom has an interest in Asian women as sexist. It is just that in my experience, there are a lot of these men that are like that. There is a distinction between a guys who has a certain preference (in this case, racial preference) vs those who have ""yellow fever"".

t3_24pqyu,"How can I learn to be OK with my life not being a fairy tale?","I think I suffer from watching too many Disney Princess films. My dream growing up had always been to get married, have babies and live happily ever after. Now I realize that's impossible. Even if you find the 'perfect' guy, get married, and end up with a cute house and tons of adorable kids, it's still not a fairy tale. It's a hard journey of compromise, bills, arguments and heartache. Not to say life can't be beautiful, I just think I've set up unrealistic expectations for my dreams. 
My question for all of you women is, how do you accept the reality of not being a princess and learn to be so damn strong? 
My hopes is I can learn to look at life as an adventure rather than a goal. I don't want to strive for one silly dream forever only to realize it's a sham. I want to take pride in each day and live it to the fullest. Women, what can I do to make myself stronger?

Edit: I'd like to expand on how I think the Disney culture is kind of messed up for girls. Growing up as a Disney girl, I've seen almost every female character's life become better after she found a man. Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, Ariel, Jasmine, Tiana, Lady, Jane, Mulan, Belle (although it could be argued she made the Beasts life better), Giselle, Esmeralda, Meg, Nala, Maid Marian, Dutchess, Rapunzel, and even Anna. Even if they don't get married they all end up with a man. It almost seems like the end goal in life is to get a man and find romance. There is nothing wrong with love. The problem is there are very few Disney movies that promote a women having an adventure that doesn't involve men. Brave comes close by saying Merida doesn't need a man but the entire plot does revolve around men. Pocahontas is the same. She lets him go but the movie revolves around her relationship with John Smith. I'd say that Lilo and Stitch is the only Disney movie that shows a strong independent woman: Nani. Sure, Nani has a boyfriend but he doesn't solve her issues, he's just a side character used to add a bit of depth to the story. Nani also represents reality. She struggles to pay bills, take care of her sister and even has curves, which is a rare Disney trait. 
Anyway, that's just my little Disney rant. Still a huge fan of the films but wouldn't it be nice if they had more characters  like Nani?

Edit: Just remembered: Elonwy, Alice, Penny, and Jenny. All young girls who have no need for men. They're honestly too young for men but it's still important to note they are fairly independent characters.

Edit: You all are fantastic! You've gotten me to think about why I fantasize about being these characters and to also realize exactly what these characters stories really mean. I think I will be able to be much more content with my life as an actual person. :)",4,20140504144046,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24qy0q,"So I just had the most uncomfortable conversation about body odor with my boss.","I've spent the past few months in a depressive state, I'm on an up and I've been getting the help I need. I work in an office, but I can frequently work from home. I would occasionally come into the office where I maybe knew I was on a rough day. So I could maybe see where I'd smell bad. 

But today, i stopped to talk to much boss and he apparently thought it had been brought up to me. I asked if it was a problem today, because I had showered the night before and basically just went to bed a few hours later. He said yes. So I guess i am just a particularly odiforous person.

He's really incredible, he motivates me to be better and loves me with all my imperfections; he's handsome, funny, charming, super smart, everything I want in a long term partner and then some more! My issue with G is that we constantly bicker about my inherent lack of ""lady - like qualities"" and that I have few, if any, female friends.

To put it in perspective, I would LOVE to have a group of girls to hang out with, I've always longed for girl friends but it never happened. I work in a male dominated field (think 8 women to 115 men), my interests are sports and working out, I grew up with all brothers and played on the roller hockey team where I met my best friends growing up, all guys. My roommate is a guy. Every time I've tried to integrate myself into a group of girls I either try too hard and weird them out, or don't try hard enough and they don't include me. 

G is understandably uncomfortable with my ppredicament, so to make him feel more comfortable I've alienated myself from my life long male friends, become super b itchy to my male coworkers so they don't talk to or come near me, and blown off all men who come near me in general. Now I feel very... lonely. It's hard to be feminine and feel confident as a woman when all I know about being a girly girl comes from magazines and the Internet.  G likes to point out when I sit without my legs crossed or start discussing the NFL Draft, and it really wreaks havoc on my identity and confidence.

G also gets jealous when I talk to men. Today at the gym, for example,  there was a problem with android phones connecting to the WiFi,  so I helped a few (admittedly, all male patrons) fix the issue on their phones. I didn't even make the connection that they may have been approaching me with the intent to flirt with me until G pointed it out. I was just trying to help! I'm not the type of person to see someone with a problem and walk away! 

G is now frustrated with me for ""playing naive"", and I'm frustrated with myself for not removing myself from the aforementioned situation.  I want to be smart and friendly and feminine and girly, but I want to attract female friends, not male attention!  How can I get G, the most important person in my life, to understand that I'm seriously not trying to get male attention and that I am trying to make girl friends? 

I want my boyfriend to know he's the only man for me, and I want him to be secure in that.  However, I don't want to keep feeling like a social outcast. Any advice? Anything would help! Thank you, two X! ",5,20140504164208,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24q1jm,"Sometimes, I handle friendships like a guy would. :-/","This seems to be a real issue among some of my female friends, and I don't know how to handle it. This is probably going to be a relatively long post, and I apologize for that.

I grew up with five brothers, and have always gotten along better with those of the male gender. I don't know if that holds any weight with why/how I handle my friendships the way I do, but at least you have some background on me.

I've been having ""tiffs"" with my best friend lately. We'll call her Tina. Tina and I have been borderline inseparable for the past year and a half or so (since we went to Basic Training and AIT together; we also are now stationed on the same post). 

To give you all an idea of what exactly it is I'm talking about, here are some examples:

In Basic Training, Tina and Kayla* (our mutual best friend who is unfortunately not stationed where Tina and I are) got into an argument with two other females in our platoon over something that was ENTIRELY between the four of them. However, after the argument, Kayla and Tina were upset with me that I didn't ""stand up for them."" I just stood there flabbergasted until I finally (in a matter of words) said, ""The fight was between you two and ___insert other girls' names here__. I don't have a problem with them, and I don't need one. I'm sorry, but you two are grown adults. There was no need for me to 'stand up for you.'"" This pissed them off for the rest of the day, but then we just pretended the whole thing never happened.

In AIT, Tina was ""talking to"" (??? I dunno. Is that a phrase people use still? Damn, I'm getting old) a guy in our platoon that I had been cool with since Basic. I'll spare you the details, but essentially, she got mad at him for something he said to purposely upset her/embarrass her, but without context or knowing the background story, NOBODY would have known what he was talking about anyway. She told Kayla and me that she was upset with what he said, that he's an ass, blah blah blah. 

The next day in the school house, I confronted him about the situation, then once he had said his piece, moved on to just talking to him like I would with any other friend. Tina and Kayla both were upset with me again. Kayla even specifically said to me, ""Well, he hurt Tina and she's mad at him, so you should be mad at him too."" This time, I got a little more defensive than I had in Basic and told her, ""Kayla, that's retarded, and the most childish thing I've heard since high school."" Whatever. We all moved past it with an understanding that I should be ""more defensive of my friends in the future.""

Now, for my most  recent ""dilemma,"" if you can even call it that. Tina had been dating Jack, a friend I had made here on post prior to them dating. They broke up about 2 months ago, and I recently had a party where I invited both of them. Tina said she wasn't going to go since I had invited Jack, but the night of the party she showed up anyway, then left early because Jack was wasted and ""bragging"" about his most recent female companions. (I wasn't there to witness that actually happening, but Jack is not a malicious nor vindictive human being. I'm sure he wasn't ""bragging"" right in front of her to purposely make her jealous.) Tina is still somewhat upset with me for inviting him in the first place.

I've explained all these scenarios to my husband and have brought up the issues I've been having in my relationship with my best friend. I would hope my husband's response to my issues was to reassure me that I'm not a horrible friend, but simply a woman that handles things in more ""male"" terms, but sometimes I'm not so sure. This is how I've always been, but maybe I am doing something wrong. 

TwoX, what is your opinion on this? Is there something I need to change about myself to get along better with/not upset my best friend as well as other female friends?? Thanks in advance, and sorry that this post is ridiculously long.",0,20140504163440,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24qnk1,"I lost my virginity last week and now I'm missing my period","Hey Reddit,

I'm a 21 year old female (obviously) and I lost my virginity to my boyfriend of two years last week. We used a condom, lube, and he my boyfriend didn't even cum. We had messed around naked earlier in the month but he never penetrated without a condom. He was rubbing this dick on my clit to tease me.

My typical cycle comes about every 25 days, but it can happen anywhere from 24-27 days. My period was predicted to come yesterday but it didn't. I keep thinking I'm having cramps, but it feels more like ovarian pain than my usual cramps.I also think I'm having cramps but it's just gas. I know the odds of precum getting a girl pregnant are exponentially low, but I'm freaking the fuck out. I'm on the verge of a panic attack. If it doesn't come tomorrow, it'll be past the 27 day mark and I've never had a period that late.

I'm hoping it's just stress that's pushing my period back. I've dealt with finals during my cycle and the lost of my virginity, which I've been struggling with. I wasn't sure if I made the right choice and it's weighed on me. I'll take a test on the weekend if it doesn't show up, I know it's too soon to take it now.

For the past several months I've been on numerous antibiotics because of an illness,  giving me chronic yeast infections.  Even before the illness (since about a year ago) I've had this ongoing pain/burning on the ""bottom"" of the inside of my vagina. Back then I had a great gynecologist and he was actually able to look inside (!!!) by using numbing gel and having the nurses hold my hand, yet he told me that nothing was wrong with me and that there was slight irritation. 

Then I moved and my current OBGYN (the nurse for the main OBGYN) is pretty good,  but I cannot have anyone examine me or stick the Q-tip in there because it causes me to have the worst pain imaginable.  I ALWAYS stick it in there myself.  I can stick things up there just fine but when someone else does it it's extremely painful. 

Then last week the nurse wasn't in so I had to see the regular OBGYN. He couldn't get the speculum in.  He touched me and it HURT, like there was a cut there.  Then he got very angry at me.

This Saturday I went to prom, and I was super excited and spent all day getting ready with my best friend. Well, we show up, and of course I see how beautiful everyone looked and was running around complimenting people. 

I was standing with a group of girls talking about my dress and such, and mentioned the rib cage size was a little big on me and I was a little worried about basically flashing everyone. One of the girls then said ""you think your worried? I'm wearing a strapless, and you don't have to worry because you have no boobs."" 


I was naturally incredibly offended at that point and wanted to say something but decided to not let her spoil my fun. I also had a girl later on tell me she thought I had very high levels of testosterone because of ""how andro and boyish I look"" (I have short hair, but so does she) and how my ""body type is"" whatever that means. She said that because we were talking and I said something about jokingly about ""well maybe I have a guys brain, thinking about sex all the time"" (I'm bisexual)


Both of theses comments hurt because these girls were my friends, not close friends but we still hung out socially on occasion, and one girl looks just as ""boyish and andro"" as the next girl, and the other girl has more boobs because she's a bigger girl, it's her body type.

I didn't let her ruin my fun though. I got hit on plenty of times that night by guys who don't seem to care about my small stature and short hair.

t3_24sw5k,"So he cheated on me...(Update)","I posted about a month ago asking for support and advice for a breakup that seemed sudden after a 7 year relationship.  So I suppose this is an update on that situation.

The last month has been horrible.  Between trying to get him to move his stuff out to vacillating between hope that he will come to his senses and grief for a lost love.

Well I find out from a few friends over the weekend that he showed up at a party with his climbing partner.  A girl who I always felt threatened by and who I expressed concern over an inappropriate relationship. The last few months he would go on climbing trips and not contact me claiming there was no cell service. I would express my concern and he would reassure me that they were just partners, that he wished she was a man so I wouldn't worry. That I would never believe that there was nothing going on. He made me feel guilty for ever contemplating the possibility that there was something unsavory happening.

At the party friends told me that they were acting like a couple.  Yesterday I decided I wanted clarity rather than to just wonder. So last night I texted him asking for a straight answer. He didn't reply. This morning I tried again saying that I deserved to know. He replied saying that he started seeing her a week ago.

A seven year relationship that he moves on in two weeks. I offered him everything. I supported him financially, emotionally, physically. I helped him cope with depression. I helped him get through his PhD. I unconditionally loved him through quirks and forgotten birthdays. I have never done a single thing unkind or unthoughtful to him.

I'm not an idiot I know this started before we broke up. He sent her text messages implying that he couldn't wait to to be rid of me. I was just too blind to really see what was happening. I praised myself for being a trusting girlfriend. I let him go on trips and never asked him to stop the relationship with her. He most certainly emotionally cheated on me and while I don't know if he physically cheated it is enough.  

I just can't believe how wrong I was about this person. He has shown me no respect, no care and has proven how little he actually loved me. 

In the end I suppose at least it is a line. I can never be with someone who has that little regard for someone they were with for a huge portion of their lives. Someone who they claimed to love.  And to some degree I suppose they deserve each other because she had a long term, live in boyfriend too that she left to be with him.

This time last year, I made a great new group of friends. They were fun, went on adventures, and seemed to have hobbies they cared about. But over the course of this past year, things have... changed. 

They've become obsessed with their genitals.

Guys and gals alike, it's all they ever talk about and all they ever want to do. Topics of conversation used to vary; we'd talk about TV shows, current events, gossip, pretty much everything. But now, all they ever talk about is gender theory, getting laid, who they want to fuck, things shaped like genitals, how to become more sexual, why polyamory > monogamy (sex-wise), and pretty much anything having to do with their penises or vaginas.

And to be fair, there's nothing wrong with talking about these things. It's very important to create a dialogue about gender theory and polyamory, because the more people talk about these ideas, the more the rest of the world becomes aware of their importance and relevance. 

But seriously, they WILL NOT talk about anything else. Every conversation turns into a circles jerk about how they're cooler than ""normies."" Hell, I've stopped going to their parties because they all turn into orgies. 

I feel like I'm going crazy. These people are really the only friends I have right now and they're not bad people. They're really nice, smart, and funny! And I've tried changing subjects and asking them to speak less sexually, but nothing comes of it. 

I just can't handle this over-sexualized lifestyle. I have no hangups about sex (and I'm by no means ""vanilla""). I enjoy sex as much as the next girl, but it's not my life. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm being judged for my worth as a potential sex partner rather than as a friend. Everything is so shallow now. And it's making me feel so lonely.

I'm in my mid-twenties, and I have no idea where to make new friends. And I don't know if I should keep trying to make it work with the friends I have or if I should give up and crown Netflix as my new best friend.

I'm not sure what I want to hear from you guys. I just don't know what to do. I miss the days of childhood where friendships were just so easy.

t3_24snjd,"Married for almost 1 year and feeling lost.","Hi ladies. Throwaway account. Not sure if this is the right place, but I could really use some advice. Apologies in advance if this gets kind of long. 

I'm 24. I got married last May at 23. My husband and I dated on and off since high school, with a 2-year break from each other during college. We got together in the summer of 2010 after I broke up with a verbally abusive ex, and we started living with each other almost immediately. In 2012, we decided to move across the country together. Two months after moving, he proposed. 

Now, two weeks shy of a year into our marriage, he's thrown a complete curveball at me. He claims it's a quarter-life crisis, and though I kind of feel like that term is a bit silly, I would have to agree. Here's the situation:

Two months ago, he quit his high-intensity job with an abusive boss to work for a non-profit at a much slower pace and a much nicer boss. His high-intensity job was the first job he got when we moved out here, and for a long time, he was making it his life goal to climb the ranks, make a lot of money and earn a six figure salary by the time he was 30. After quitting, he had a moment of clarity where he realized how incredibly unhappy he'd been over the past two years at his old job. He realized that he hadn't taken any time to develop himself as a person, or to work on developing his relationship with me. 

Three weeks ago, pretty much out of the blue, he told me that he was taking a step back to re-evaluate his life, and that he was going to start doing things just for himself to find out what makes him happy. I was fine with that--I encouraged him to find the things in life that would make him happy. But he started to get distant. He started to act annoyed by me. He started treating me like an annoying girlfriend. When I started talking with him about our relationship, he confessed that he felt that he wasn't sure where I was going to fit into his new identity, and that he had started to question every decision that he'd made in the past five years. He told me that he felt like I was too indecisive, like half a person, and that he needed me to work on myself while he worked on himself. That he needed distance. 

He started contemplating buying a motorcycle. He started going out with friends and not coming back home until 2 AM. If I cried out of sadness or confusion, he would get angry with me for ""making it a tragedy."" I recently quit my own job and found a new one at a place I love, and instead of feeling celebrated, it felt kind of blase. If I try to be intimate with him, sexually or not, he pulls away because he claims that he's not used to me being intimate, and that it feels fake. He's told me that he isn't sure if he was actually ready to be married. He tells me he wishes we spent more time dating and living separately. This, after 4 years of commitment and love and growth together. And then, in the middle of the night, he'll cuddle up to me and say he's sorry, tell me that he needs me and that he loves me. Then, the next day, he's got his walls up again. 

No, we've never had a perfect relationship, and we've had our fair share of fights, but right now, it feels like he's negating everything we've built together because he's not sure what to do with himself. He's really confused and I'm getting pulled along for the ride. 

He and I decided--together--to go minimalist, and we've cleared out our apartment and donated 80% of our belongings. Now I'm sitting in our nearly empty apartment, glad that I've decluttered my life, but sad that it had to get to that point in the first place. And I don't know what to do. 

I love this man. I've loved him since I was 17. We may have been bad in the past at maintaining our own separate identities outside of the relationship, but we've got a very solid identity together, and it feels like over the past couple of weeks he's quite abruptly ripped himself out of that identity and out of the life we've built together. Although in the past week his mood has been better, and he seems like he's starting to calm down, I know we're not at the end. 

One thing I forgot to mention is that, at a young age, my husband was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He was on very heavy medication from age 13 until about 19, when he decided one day to just stop taking it. Fortunately, he made it through without any complications, and has been mostly stable over the past 5 or 6 years, but I feel like it's something he still grapples with, and it may be part of this recent upheaval. Like he had been coasting along in a somewhat depressed state for a long time, doing a good job of either hiding or disguising it and just recently, something switched the mania on. 

I love him to death and would never hold his diagnosis against him, but it's been hard to watch and deal with, and I don't know how to bring up the possibility to him that his disorder may have been triggered and is now fueling this fire, especially since it hasn't really been part of our conversations with one another for the past 4 years.

TwoX, I don't know if any of this really makes sense, but I'm feeling kind of desperate here, and I could use some advice. How do I handle this? How can I help him without seeming pushy? What can I do to make our first anniversary special, even if he is going through an identity crisis period? Some days I feel like more of a grown up than others, but when it comes to this, I just feel young, stupid and clueless. Sometimes, the amount of sadness I feel is overwhelming, and even though I'm working on building friendships outside of my marriage, I feel like I've got very few people with whom I can talk about all this. 

**TL;DR:** Husband recently found himself in a period of identity crisis, and has since ripped himself out of our mutual identity. He has a history of bipolar disorder and I'm curious if this may be a sign of mania. Lost and clueless; looking for advice. 

**edit:** spelling

**edit edit:** So I wanted to thank everyone for their input, advice, etc. I guess my fear that his BPD may be the culprit is more realistic than I realized. I sat him down last night and talked with him about what I've been seeing in him, how it makes me feel, and suggested that he talk to a therapist or see his doctor. He wasn't gung-ho about the idea that his BPD may be rearing its head again but I feel like our talk got him thinking pretty seriously about seeking therapy. So, thanks again everyone. Your comments really pushed me to realize that this situation is beyond my control. ",64,20140505133819,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24snps,"""Are You Straight?"" A rant about perceived sexuality...","Growing up, I was a tomboy. A hard core, no-hair-combing, anime-shirt-and-jeans wearing, dress-despising, barbie-burning tomboy. I loved playing with the guys as they made me feel comfortable. I appreciated their roughness and having fun with them meant less judgement in my little girl eyes. I could be dirty, have fun and play the games I wanted to play


As I got older and went to middle school, I knew I had to slightly 'conform' to girlish wear in order to get the attention I wanted from men. Around this time, my sister jokingly said she thought I was going to grow up gay. It kind of hurt my feelings but I took it with a grain of salt as I know she loves the hell out of me anyways. Middle school was a trying time and I was scrawny, flat (as most young girls are) and was completely acne ridden. My peers would make jokes about my sexuality and I never understood it. I loved guys and thought they were sexy. Why wasnt I straight based off of that?


Flash forward to now, I am 23 years old and I do enjoy things my 10 yr old self would hate me for. Not because of social influences but simply I enjoy looking feminine, make up is fun and I look amazing in heels because I have a track runners butt lol However, I still get asked this question constantly:


""Are you straight?"" ""Are you bisexual?"" How can you even GAGE that from how I look? I even had a guy tell me its because of all the jeans I wear and the books I was carrying in my facebook photos. Really?? Straight women cant read and wear jeans? Yes, I know I have a mohawk but I've only had it the last few years but the question has been prevalent my entire life. Its insulting because now 'straight' women cant be seen as women like me. I still have a good amount of guy friends and a GREAT amount of girl friends. Yes, I can be quite the pervert but what modern day lady in her 20s isnt? I MUST be a lesbian, I MUST be bisexual. I have nothing against the LGBT community and Im not 'hiding'  anything deep down. I've explored many aspects of my sexuality and I know that I am straight and I am proud.


Thank yall for listening and if anyone has any stories or anything they would like to share, please do. I sometimes get very down about it.

Fast forward to about a month ago.  I had just been laid off, was in hardcore ""find a boyfriend not just a f-buddy"" mode, and went out with a guy.  I made some bad calls (read: took him home the first night) and then spent way too much time with him in too short a space of time and got in this weird headspace around him.  Anywho, after nine days of feeling smothered and finally realizing that this guy was a stage five clinger and my weird headspaces were not my own anxiety but rather because my brain was trying to say ""danger Will Robinson!! red flag red flag.""

When I went to go meet him to ""break up"" with him in person (can you break up with someone after only 9 days?), he showed up wasted.  Like stumbling slurred words can't walk in a straight line wasted.  He called me a heartless c**t, and that I would be alone forever, was a ""classic bitchy virgo.""  Then he called me every 3 minutes until Verizon helped me block his number.  I had a full on anxiety attack, convinced that he would come to my house and harass my household, and all that (thankfully he did not and my roommates and call from my mama helped peel me off the ceiling).

Now I'm more in go-with-the-flow mode and have reconnected with POF guy.  He says he's cool with me going slow, which is nice.  We're playing pool this week. I'm truly awful at it but I think it's really fun.

I suppose my question (and my point) is wondering how to differentiate between being nervous after a bad experience and actual spidey sense red flags.  I want to give this POF a real chance, but I also don't want to not be careful.

t3_24th0x,"SO says it's my fault I got sexually harassed","I could really use a few words of advice/alternate viewpoints.

Last week I started exchanging emails with a classmate of mine. They were strictly school-related, until a few days ago, when he got really drunk and tried to ask me out via email. I told him I was seeing someone but we could be friends (we're in the same very small academic program). He said that he ""might be in love with me"" (only have talked to him four times max), ""wants to hang out forever"", etc.

I debated telling my SO about it, but decided he should know (and I thought it was kind of funny). He wasn't amused, and then went on to say that I was probably flirting with him and I should have been clear from the start that I wasn't interested. I had told the guy ""no, I'm seeing someone, I don't want to go on a date"", but my SO thinks I should have been clearer from the start.

Apparently this came down to my very ""flirty"" personality. I will admit that sometimes my personality comes off that way. I smile a lot, laugh at jokes, and my sense of humor can sometimes come off as flirtation.

A few years ago, I had an encounter with a coworker where he pushed me up against a wall, started making out with me, and tried to shove his hands down my pants. I said ""no"" about a dozen times, and was using all my strength to try to get his hands away from me. I was really shaken by the whole thing and lost my job over it. My SO brought up /that/ incident too, and says I probably gave the coworker the wrong impression.

I'm feeling kind of hurt by this, especially him bringing up the coworker incident. I know I have a flirty personality but I don't think that means I deserve to be harassed in any manner. We stopped talking about it because I was getting upset, and I feel like there's no real resolution to this.

I'm in a period of my life where I'm trying to meet new people. And the way I do that is by acting like myself. I just can't imagine meeting a guy and then automatically saying ""oh by the way I'M NOT INTERESTED"". That just sounds really presumptuous and stuckup to me. But my SO says I need to ""make the line clear"" because I'm leading these guys on.

He says he doesn't want me to change my personality but I know it's bothering him. I don't want to change my personality either. I guess I should ""tone it down"" a bit? In the case of the classmate, I never intentionally flirted with him. And apparently ""friendliness"" counts as flirtation.

So I don't know. I think he has a point, but at the same time, I feel like a creep is a creep. If they don't listen to ""no"" at any point, why would they listen to ""no"" at the beginning??",1,20140505183048,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I (24f) have been with my current SO for over a year.  He is wonderful in a lot of ways...he is kind, smart, funny, and incredibly sweet and selfless.  He makes me feel very loved; he always wants to cuddle with me and tell me how great I am, tells me he misses me after days apart, and tells me how good I am for him all of the time.  

I am overall very happy with him, except that he has a kind of ""meh"" attitude about socializing.  He doesn't hang out with people in real life besides me (or when I bring him to things with my friends), doesn't have many interests (aside from me and video games) and seems completely fine with both of those things.  When we do go out, he is usually very quiet and doesn't seem to be enjoying himself, even though he will later tell me he had fun.  There are times when I am with him that I find myself thinking that he's boring/being bored by him, and that bums me out.

I am usually completely happy to go out and do my own thing and then go hang out with him for sex and cuddles and video games, but I am feeling anxious about this going forward. It should be noted that I am kind of a homebody as well, and so I was initially totally psyched to find someone that didn't pressure me to go out. However the longer we've been dating, I find myself wishing that he wanted to do these things, and not that he was just okay with them if I bring them up. I hate the idea of forcing someone I love to spend their time a certain way, and kind of want to be able to be completely fine with the fact that this is how he is, but it obviously makes gatherings a source of worry for me. I also kind of wish he was more spontaneous and up for a good time, and more able to be as fun as he is when we're alone in his apartment when we venture outside, but feel like that may just be how he is and it's unfair to want him to be someone different.

So any insight / opinions / suggestions would be much appreciated, ladies!!

---

I had an MRI performed last week on my hamstring to diagnose an injury.  In reviewing the films with my sports physician last night, she pointed out that the scan had also captured my right ovary, which had a huge (too many to count) number of cysts on it.

I'm 30f, 5'3"", and weight has fluctuated ~54-58kg since age 18 (within healthy BMI).  Healthy diet, healthy lifestyle etc etc etc.

Since I was 18, I've had roughly 5 or 6 internal ultrasounds looking at my girly bits.  Every single ultrasound has showed multiple cysts on each ovary (always 12+, sometimes 20+ per ovary).  The ultrasound technician has always expressed alarm at that, particularly as from 18-24 (when I had one of the scans) I was on the pill so shouldn’t have been ovulating, but none of the GPs or gynaegolocists I've seen have ever given a damn.



PERIOD PAIN
---
I have had incredibly painful periods since I was 12.  I was on OCP from ages 18-24 and that helped somewhat.  

I know that the heavier (fatter) I am, the worse my period pain is.

In August 2012 I had an episode of THE WORST PAIN I had ever experienced - literally rolling on the floor crying, unable to function.  Ambulance came, doped me up on morphine, okay!  I was referred to an gyno who specialises in endometriosis, who literally spent about 5 minutes talking with me, and then two weeks later had me on the operating table for a laproscopy where he diagnosed and removed the endo that he found.

Unfortunately since then, my period pain has been consistently getting WORSE.  I've had another morphine-needing episode, and monthly I'm on prescription painkillers.


ACNE
---
From ages 18-27 I developed horrific acne on my back and upper arms.  Doctors told me it was quite mild and nothing to worry about, and during that time I tried about 4 different versions of the OCP.  It got to the point where I was embarrassed to wear tshirts and dresses, so I finally put my foot down and demanded a referral to a dermatologist.  He revised the diagnosis from ""mild"" to ""severe acne” and put me on a 6-month course of Roaccutane, which was equally horrific but ultimately worked a dream.



--- 

So, to reiterate, I have a follow-up appointment with the gynaecological surgeon at the end of this month.  I am certain that he will try to convince me of one of two things:  another round of surgery to “remove more endo”, and/or insert the Mirena IUD.

The surgery did nothing the first time round even though he guaranteed me that he removed everything he saw.

I’m against having a foreign object inserted into my body, hormonal meds screw with my head and body at the best of times, AND mostly I’m concerned that Mirena would just be masking whatever is REALLY going on.

Is it worth pushing him to investigate the polycystic ovaries thing more?  I just don’t understand why no doctor seems to give a damn about my ovaries.

t3_24txho,"Friend unknowingly crossed some boundaries. Should I talk to him/make amends, and how?","Hey TwoX, you are my go-to for social situation/sexual harassment dilemmas, and this is both. Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks in advance for your time!


I’m a university student who will be changing schools to attend an institution across the country in the fall. A few weeks ago, I had to inform my extended group of friends that I would not be returning (I’d told a few of my closest friends a bit earlier). One friend of mine, whom I will refer to as R, sent me a facebook message later saying that he was upset that I’d told other people but not him, and that he just wanted to help and be a good friend.


To be honest, I reached out to those few closest friends then because I tend to self-destruct when I'm stressed and alone, and they were the only people I could reach immediately who I trusted to talk me down and listen without judgment. R has a good heart, but he’s a little socially awkward (he and several of our psych major friends believe he’s on the autism spectrum, though it's not official); on several occasions I’ve found myself in the position of being his outlet when I don’t have sufficient resources to do so, and I definitely didn't have resources then.


I didn’t see or hear from R again until our mutual friend’s house party a day or so later. I tried to avoid him, but eventually he found me, pulled me off to the side and apologized. I was kinda pissed and also unsure of how genuine the apology was because he was a little drunk, but to get him off my back I accepted and went on my way.


A few hours and a few drinks later, I passed by R sitting in the hall by himself, extremely drunk. He asked me to sit down because he wanted to talk to me for a bit, and I did. He started talking about how sorry he was, and also getting really touchy-feely – hand on my neck, forehead against mine like he was about to kiss me, etc. He was getting dramatic and I was getting uncomfortable, so I told him I had to go, but he grabbed my wrist and pulled me back down. Just then, though, one of my other big guy friends came around the corner, and when I signaled to him for help he came up with some excuse to haul R off to a different part of the house.


And now, a little part of my brain keeps asking, what if my other friend hadn’t shown up then? I'm a very small person, and even if I’d been sober I doubt I’d have been able to escape. I feel so unreasonable, because nothing actually happened, and rationally I don’t believe R would have done anything. But for a week after, I froze every time I saw R, and even after two weeks I’m still uncomfortable interacting with him one-on-one or with him touching me. 


I’m not sure if he even remembers what happened, but he’s noticed that I’ve been avoiding him, because he sent me another message the other day saying that he’d been a jerk and was sorry. I told him it was okay, and that the whole situation is a mess, and he just replied “Yeah, but still”. I didn’t know how to respond (someone said that it was R fishing for compliments, trying to get me to tell him that no, he’s been a perfectly fine friend) so I didn’t.


Except now, I always try to make amends with everyone whenever things end, and I’m wondering if I should talk to R, and if yes, what to tell him. I feel like I should tell him the real reason I was avoiding him, and that he should know that he becomes really inappropriate when he’s drunk (he’s gotten really physical with other people on other occasions as well). But I’m also not sure how productive telling him would be; he gets really defensive about things because he really does have good intentions, and also this happened weeks ago and he might not even remember it.


**TL;DR: To explain or not to explain to my friend before I move away that I’ve been avoiding him as an overreaction to his gropey-drunk behavior from weeks back: that is the question.**

I heard the news about your new opportunity and would love to chat for a few minutes. Will you have time to stop by at 4:30? Let me know.

I made it clear in the email that I would only meet with her if HR is present. They both accepted the invitation.

I searched for a long time and it just seemed appropriate here. ;( I'll try to keep it short-- I'm just sick of googling all sorts of things and thinking EVERYTHING applies to me when it probably doesn't.


I'm 26 and have been on the pill for 8 years. I've never taken a break from the pill and while I have had those rare times when I would miss a pill, I would always follow directions properly and promptly in those times.


I'm in a long distance relationship and I recently saw my boyfriend a little less than 2 weeks ago. He stayed with me for a few days and of course we had a ton of sex. Probably about twice a day for a few days. As I said I'm on the pill but we've been together for 2 years and have decided not to use condoms, however he does pull out. This is mandatory for both of us. Pills + pull out.


The first day he was here I was on the last day of my period. We had sex twice that day; I was on my last sugar pill that day and he pulled out both times. The next day we had sex in the morning and pulled out, however it seemed some semen landed across my vagina. We cleaned it up and I took my first pill of my next pack that night. We had sex several times over the course of the next few days, while taking my pill on time every day and him pulling out (and almost having a hard time orgasming since we've been having so much sex).


Fast forward to now and I'm having period like symptoms in the middle of this pack of pills (not supposed to get my period for another 2 weeks). I spotted a light brown yesterday-- sorry graphic!-- and what seemed to be a little bit of a yeasty infection type stuff along with it. This only lasted a few trips to the bathroom before everything seemed normal again. I don't have cramps (I never get them) and my breasts feel normal, but I have that weird type of 'down there' heavy feeling like I'm about to get my period or something.


I was wondering, given with the timing and our methods, and what I'm describing just how likely this all is? Maybe semen entered me during the last day of the sugar pills or the first day of the new pack. It's apparently far too early to take a pregnancy test. I won't even know if I have a missed period for another 2 weeks.  :( Just looking for some support, advice, insight, anything.

I was shocked, overjoyed, and excited to see that so many other women share this need to see porn that is made for US. A little about me... I'm 26, have been in the sex industry since I was 18. Some of the things I've done (if you care): been in a vanilla boy/girl porn, been in femdom porn, was a well-known camgirl with 15K Twitter followers (in 2009-2011), and am now a well-paid phone dominatrix in NYC. Due to my location, I have no problem scouting good-looking guys with big dicks, beards, and tattoos. I will be the creative side of the production process. A female friend of mine is in film and has access to a crew and equipment.

Only spots where the locals tend to hang out and very hot people are often seen. We're speaking to a bar manager next week about how to put this together tastefully.** 

**EDIT 6: I can't believe this is happening so fast!

She's really excited about this, as it will also be *their* first event ever! There will be good food, good alcohol, and good times.

I know that society acknowledges that short men are treated unfairly, but I think that petite women also get the...""short"" end of the stick.  
  
I know there are some celebrities who defy this, but it seems like the women who are considered the most beautiful tend to be tall and thin, like models. It's frustrating feeling like, no matter how hard I try to look good, I just look dumpy next to my taller friends. Clothes NEVER fit right off the rack, and I get so sick of salespeople telling me to try the children's section. (I'm in my mid-20's!!) It feels like I can't look very fashionable, because clothes never fit my petite frame, and the ones in the ""petites"" sections that I find look like grandma clothes. (Being short also means that a weight loss or gain of 10 lbs, which would be pretty normal on a taller person, can suddenly push you over either side of the line of looking scrawny or overweight...which can make clothes shopping that much more frustrating.)

  I also don't think super-short women get taken nearly as seriously, particularly the ones who look young for their age like I do. I've actually posted about that issue on here before, because it gets exhausting being treated like a child, being asked, ""What do your parents think of that??"" and, god forbid, ""What grade are you in?""   
It's gotten a little better in the past few years, but I felt constantly overlooked for opportunities in my undergrad, and part of it was because I looked so much smaller and younger than my colleagues, even though I was typically about 5 years older due to starting school later. I rarely feel like I'm seen as an actual adult woman, let alone a strong or independent one.

* Work for a top Fortune 500 technology company (think shiny silver...fruit)
* Fantastic team and manager & interesting and challenging responsibilities and opportunities  
* I own my own home in a desirable area with great amenities & schools
* Engaged to a wonderful man who I adore and we are excited to start our lives together and start a family
* Supportive families (both our parents still together, etc)
* Traveled the world plenty in my youth, through college & after
* Significant savings & trust fund 

I'm really struggling because I feel extremely unfulfilled with my life. I have everything that anyone could seemingly want and yet it isn't making me happy or fulfilled. I struggle with dealing with these feelings and then I feel awful about myself because there are so many out there that would kill for a chance at what I have... and I think it isn't good enough? What is wrong with me? 

I don't know what it is that I want, and I don't know how to feel fulfilled in my life. But I do know that whatever I'm doing now isn't cutting it. I'm in therapy (for anxiety and just because) but it isn't really helping. I tried anti-depressants but that just made everything worse. I think I'm just in the throes of a quarter-life crisis and I'm not handling it well. 

I don't even know if I'm looking for advice here or maybe it's just a misery loves company thing. But thanks for reading anyway.

This doesn't happen to me all the time but more than i would like. It's just so uncomfortable, no matter how i re position it or try to push it up it just doesn't want to move. It feels like my vagina muscles are trying to push it out. Not to get too graphic but i have a very tight vagina so maybe that's it? I have been using it for years & love it so i'm not looking to change my form of birth control. If anyone has similar stories or can shed some light on why this is happening that would be great.

t3_24v7yo,"Throwaway. This is a safe community so I'll confess: I feel guilty about being fat and keeping postponing seeing a guy I met on reddit.","Okay, so about a year ago I met an amazing dude on reddit. We met on his country's subreddit because I'm moving there. 

Anyway, I'm afraid to meet him though I desperately want to. Up until a few years ago, I was a high school athlete and in formidable physical fitness well into my college years. Then... crippling depression hit and I gained something like 60 pounds, which is a lot on my frame. I'm not a land whale by any means, but going from a size 8 to 16 is jarring and even though I am still very proportionate and did maintain my muscle mass, I just... I hate the way I look. My measurements are 41-32-44. I'm so ashamed of my body now. I used to be muscular, lithe and strong and now I'm just sad. 

I knew I probably shouldn't keep talking to him because I didn't want him to get involved with me knowing I would never want to meet up, but we did. And we Skyped, and sent pictures and stuff. And he's gorgeous. Tall and super fit and just... amazing. He's like a 10. I used to be comparably attractive but now for the past three years I just feel invisible and my self esteem is at an all time low.

I know he has feelings for me but I am terrified of meeting him and I am contemplating just never meeting him at all, despite the fact that I'm going to end up about a half hour away from him after I move. 

I keep buying clothes in my smaller size, but I just don't have the motivation to lose weight. I'm still depressed sometimes. I was supposed to meet him in December 2013, then March 2014, then June and now I've just moved my move back to September 2014 in fear that he'll see me and I'll disappoint him horribly. This is really affecting me.

I have four months to make a change, I guess. I just don't feel healthy and I need to do it for that too.

t3_24v7yu,"How can I be a better friend to someone who doesn't want any help?","Full disclosure: I have been in an abusive relationship before. I can recognize the signs of abuse and I understand that those people need help. I got 0 help. I eventually got out of it because I reconnected with old friends, but all the people who knew me, including my family, didn't say anything to me. I look back on that time and I still feel angry that none of my friends, family or even teachers (I was in HS) said anything or did anything to make my naive young self see what was happening.

I have a good friend, she has been my friend for almost 8 years. We have been through a lot together in that time and I consider her my family. Shes a bit of a late bloomer and wasn't ever interested in relationships until the end of college. When she did start dating, she didn't make very good choices. The guy she dated for a while was probably worse than the current SO. He called her names, told her who to hang out with, who not to talk to, made her feel guilty for doing things, yelled at her in front of people for no real reason, put her down in front of others, basically he was just a POS. I got fed up with it and as I was friends with them both, I cut my ties with him and explained to him why. I wasn't nice about it and I pretty much told him I thought he was an asshole and was ruining her life. Well, no surprise to me but she took his side and told me that I was wrong for yelling at him and she cut ties with my for a little while. Eventually they fought and ended things and she came back to apologize to me and I understood and forgave her. Fast forward 2 years and I feel myself in a similar situation with her. Every time I talk to her, she tells me horrible things that her current SO is doing to her: Manipulating her, showing aggression, threatening suicide if he doesn't get his way, calling her a bitch/whore/cunt/slut, accusing her of cheating, telling her who she can and can't hang out with. She will bring up several times in a conversation how she is ""ugly and fat"" and ""deserves to be called names sometimes."" She defends him by saying she deserves it, or that ""he was having a bad day."" I really don't know what to do. I, and some of our other friends, feel like we need to say something to her, but when we do she just gets mad and won't talk to us. I don't really want to confront her boyfriend because ... I've known him for a long time and I know saying anything to him is just as bad as saying anything to her. I don't want to, but I am almost ready to cut ties with her because I can't take hearing about it anymore and her getting mad at me!

t3_24w02c,"Friend is Jealous When I Make Other Friends","Hi all. I'm just looking to vent a little and seek some advice. I'll try to keep this somewhat short. 

Me: I'm pretty shy/timid and it's often hard for me to make new friends. 
J: She's very outgoing and talkative with practically anyone. 

I've been friends with J for around 4 years. When we first met she was super super sweet and really supportive. We had a similar sense of humor so we clicked really well and became close. I have other friends but J was someone who I spoke with on a consistent basis, usually daily. Once we got more comfortable with each other, I feel like J's real personality began to show and I learned she had a snarky/bitchy side (I guess everyone does though occasionally, I know I do). 

Anyways, over the course of our friendship J has made a lot of new friends. Maybe she would just get excited to meet someone new, but at times she'd hold newer friends on a pedestal while kinda treating her more long term friends like they're boring. Sometimes I felt like she was trying hard to make me jealous because she'd praise her new friend and go on and on about how wonderful and supportive they are. I felt a little annoyed at times but never really jealousy as I was used to how frequently she met new people. 

After going through a kind of depressive/weird phase that I kept mostly to myself, I felt a surge of confidence recently and began putting myself out there more and talking to people. I met someone new, I'll call her B, who I instantly clicked with and we shared a lot in common. B began introducing me to some of her friends who were equally as great as her. Anyways, J became super jealous even though I never ignored her or changed the amount of time I spend talking to her. Last Friday night B wanted to have a movie night at her place with a few people, she told me that I could bring J along if I wanted to (they don't really know each other but B is familiar with J). I invited J to come and she got totally bitchy with me and kind of shat on the idea. She later sent me a long message saying she was jealous and that she feels like I'm forgetting her and replacing her with someone else. She said she feels like I'm HER bestie and that it makes her feel weird that I'm getting close with someone else. She said she knows it's irrational to feel that way and that I should be allowed to have other friends but that she can't help the way she feels. I was a bit shocked that she said she felt like I'm forgetting her because I still talk to her all the time.

Another surprise too is that J hasn't really had much enthusiasm for our friendship for the past several months. I was having some health problems (nothing serious) and anxiety that made me a bit depressed so I wasn't my usual self but it wasn't like I was a downer either. I've always felt like I've had to entertain J or she gets bored easily. Sometimes it's exhausting. Perhaps I'm a bit annoyed while typing this and I feel it's a bit too one sided, but there ARE still things I like about J and we do have good conversations most of the time. 

In the moment, I reassured J that nothing was changing with our friendship and that I still liked her just as much. Honesty though, I feel really pissed off. I keep feeling like she is not someone who cares about my best interest. Especially since she knows that I've had a rough patch the past few months, this new friendship was something that really perked me up. I feel like any normal person would be happy about that for someone. She KNOWS I barely have any friends, why is she upset about me meeting more people? Especially since she is constantly doing things with people. Does she want me to be friendless and miserable forever?
