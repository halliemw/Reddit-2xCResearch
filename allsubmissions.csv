t3_23ppr3,TIL You can cough your Diva Cup out,"I'm mortified. I've caught a terrible chest cold and needed to go the pharmacy for some cough syrup. Since it's a terrible day it would only make sense that I'd start my period, so I put in my Diva Cup and went to go wait in line for my codeine cough syrup. 

Well, I'm coughing uncontrollably and all of a sudden I feel my Diva Cup moving. I can't stop myself from coughing so now I'm trying to not attract attention (impossible when you sound like you have TB) and putting my hands in my jeans pocket so that every time I cough I can push the stem back up. It was halfway out of my body while I waited for the pharmacist.

t3_23psjo,"Found out I am pregnant, will be getting a medical abortion tomorrow. Feeling so much sadness.","I found out yesterday that I am pregnant and I'm still in shock. I've been with my boyfriend for three years and we've never once had a serious scare so this completely took us by surprise. 
I am very close with my friends and family but I have a feeling that I would experience disappointment and judgement from them if I told them what I was doing, even though I'm certain most of them are pro-choice.
The struggle is that I am 23, in a stable relationship, and finished school so it seems like I am someone who could potentially raise a child. But I'm not in a position in the least to be a mother. I have no money, my boyfriend has massive amounts of debt, we're both pursuing artistic careers and having a child would shatter us.
My boyfriend has been really supportive and has been my shoulder to cry on (multiple times) since I found out. I guess why I'm posting though is that I still feel lonely, nervous and especially am fearing how this will affect me for the rest of my life.
Any words of encouragement, or personal experiences would be so appreciated.

t3_23pxgq,Rant: no one takes my anger seriously,"Whenever someone's doing something that makes me outwardly frustrated, angry, or annoyed, they have a tendency to metaphorically pat me on the head and comment on how ""adorable"" it is when I'm angry. It's probably because I'm short and conventionally cute I guess, but I don't really get how petite-ness transfers into not having real emotions?? Just because my frustration is ""cute"" to you doesn't mean that I'm not actually angry... And sometimes my family thinks it's funny to get me all riled up about something (I'm usually pretty calm) and then brush it off, even though they actually genuinely changed my mood and played around with my feelings & it's hard to bounce back from that to cheerful conversation. I guess there's something about being a more emotionally reserved person so that when I do show emotion, it can be more entertainment than me actually having feelings.

I don't know. I'm angry and no one will believe me, so I'm writing about my feelings on the internet instead of talking about them IRL. Ha, take that family & friends.",4,20140422175121,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_23qjfq,My boyfriend is an idiot and as a result everyone now thinks I'm an idiot!,"Last week my boyfriend suffered a concussion whilst horsing around and wrestling with a friend. He knocked himself unconscious and terrified both the friend and those around him. He claimed to be ""fine"" the day of but started experiencing severe headaches and nausea the next day, so we went to the hospital. We are still waiting for a CT scan but he's been officially diagnosed with a concussion and was advised to take it easy.

However, he hasn't. He owns and coaches at a gym which he hasn't taken any time off of but can be easily modified to keep him safe. However, he also still insists on working out although he claims to have ""modified"" the workouts to be less stressful to his head. He's still pushing himself pretty intensely to the point where he's very dizzy or throws up after workouts despite doctors orders.

I've told him about a million times that I'd like him to stop working out. Pretty much everyone in his circle of family and friends has told him this. He initially did try to stay off his feet but said he felt ""fine"" and was back at it after not even a day of rest. He's convinced himself that the positive benefits of exercise are somehow actually good for his potential brain energy and that he's modified things enough to be okay. 

I'm really worried about him, especially as his CT scan is still days away and he has worsening symptoms following exercise. On top of that, I'm also pretty mad at him as well for being so stupid and careless with his health. Part of me feels guilty for even being mad about it, since it is his body and his choice. 

Furthermore, all of our family and friends not only think he's an idiot but have now started seeing me in a negative light as well. I've heard behind my back how I'm an idiot for not ""making him stop"" and for ""putting up with his idiocy"" from his siblings and even from my own!

Anyone have any advice here? I've tried talking to him (and yelling at him!) and it doesn't seem to be getting through. Dealing with my worry and anger as well as external pressures from our friends and family has left me even more exhausted and I find myself suffering from terrible insomnia. I check on him throughout the night, especially when he comes home from the gym because I worry I'll wake up one day and he'll have died in his sleep!

t3_23qda3,"My boyfriend isn't going to my senior prom with me, and I'm still upset about it after 2 months of knowing.","Sorry, long story:

I've been dating him for 2 1/2 years, and was super excited about going to the dance. We didn't go to Homecoming this year because we knew we were going to prom. I mean, I feel like the dance itself is not that important. Why should it be a big deal to me?  But then I think about my dress, and how I get to look my best and dance and have fun. I had already bought my dress when he dropped the news.  See, he is on one of a couple of extracurricular teams that placed in state, and are going to nationals in Washington D.C.   Awesome, right? Well it was, until I found out that prom and that trip were on the same day.

But the thing is, is that the trip is optional. He is not required to go, in fact, some of the seniors on other teams aren't going because of prom.  I just feel so guilty, though, because don't want to be the thing that keeps him from enjoying this. When he told me about not coming to prom... I started sobbing right there. I don't know why I'm still so upset over it, that was over 2 months ago but every time i see a guy asking a girl to prom I just start tearing up. Because now I don't get to be with my best friend at prom, I don't get to experience being asked, it just hurts.  

We talked about it, and I told him how bad it made me feel.  He knows I was crying almost every night.  But in person, when I finally got him to sit down and talk about it, I told him how I wanted to feel important enough to him to pick me over going to his competition.  After that he got this weird look on his face.  I asked him why he looked so conflicted, and it was because he was about to break up with me because he was causing me so much pain, and felt like he couldn't make me happy anymore.  Which, he had tried to compromise by saying the whole ""We can have our own prom!"" line... 

My whole family is upset with him and his parents as well, because last year his parents forced him to go to another girls prom because she didn't want to be alone, even though i specifically told them that I was uncomfortable with it. If I had known her it wouldn't have bugged me so much, but I think its a huge slap in the face for them to disrespect my feelings twice now.  Once when I told them I didn't feel comfortable with that situation, and then now that my prom isn't as important as that girls.  She couldn't be alone, but its ok for me to be?

I sound so selfish when I read this back.  This is a really cool opportunity for him, going to nationals for something is awesome. And I can see how much he wants to... but cant he see how much I want to go to prom? He has an obligation to his team to compete, but I feel like he also has an obligation to me.  He has already decided, hell, he had decided even before he told me about it.  I think what really hurts the most, is that I don't think he has even said sorry about it. 

I don't know what to do about this. I just got my dress back from being altered, but I just put it in my closet and started crying.  I thought I would feel better about this by now, and I have no idea what to do.  I'm scared to tell him, because I don't want him to break up with me because he feels like he can't make me happy anymore. 

He is going to the competition, but I still feel so bitter over it.  I don't want this to ruin our relationship.  Its just prom, and that's what I keep telling myself... but apparently logic doesn't influence my emotions.

t3_23qqqm,HELP! I'm upset about my job!!,"Sorry in advance if this is the wrong sub (if is it not, please redirect me) I will try to make this as short as possible. 

I am a 19 year old college freshman in a small town and have had my first job for about 6 months now. It is a small 5 employee print shop, with two mid 30 year old women and another college female, with me being the newest one. I have recently been noticing that I am beginning to do more of the ""physical"" work including changing air filters, repairing machines, cleaning out offices, moving boxes, etc. My official job title is Customer Service/Production (as I deal with the customers and prepare the jobs). The reason I got this job was with the help of the other college aged worked who has been here for a year and a half. 

Let me also state that I have no intention of staying in this job because I will be moving away out of town for a university by fall of 2015 at the latest to pursue a Mechanical Engineering degree, which my boss, a 50 year old male has. I have a sense that just because I want to be an engineer, he puts me to do the ""manly"" jobs and doesn't want to bother the other 3 who do design work because of their degree. Also, when the other workers are supposed to be working, I see them on their phones (especially the college girl) and when I walk into the office she pretends she's back to working. This has infuriated me to the point that I want to quit because it is not fair that I am doing the dirty jobs while she sits behind a desk ""working"". 

With that being said, there is a new opening as a secretary in town and think it is right for me to experience a new job. My question is, how do I tell my boss I want to quit. Should I go ask for information about the new job and if I get through the interview process and hopefully get hired, do I tell my boss then and put in a 2 weeks notice. This is the first time I have dealt with a situation like this. 

P.s earlier in the year, I decided not to pursue an engineering intership because I felt like the ""company"" needed me, but I now see that the only need they want is my ""physical and engineering help"" 

TL;DR I am having issues at work with how I am being assigned to do the ""physical and dirty"" work in the print shop while others are barely working in an office designing. There also is an opening as a secretary in town. Should I go ahead and see what happens?",0,20140422231441,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23qlph,Missing period,"Hey twox! I am 22 years old and was on the pill for about 7 years before coming off in August last year. I had one withdrawal period in September and then one more period about 2.5 months later in November. It has now been 5 months since my last period.

I am having regular sex with my boyfriend but we use condoms and the diaphragm every time. I have also done quite a few pregnancy tests in the past 5 months so I'm relatively sure I'm not pregnant.

Other related health things:
- I did change my diet (paleoish - mostly wheat, dairy and soy free now) at around the same time that I went off the pill. 
- I have also noticed an increase in deep sore acne around my jaw line (I had pretty good skin on the pill).

t3_23qseg,My positive experience with Loryna birth control,"I started taking birth control a few months ago.  I was prescribed Loryna, which is a generic of Yaz. I did some research on it and found a lot of negative reviews about it. I even searched on this subreddit and found negative reviews. This made me hesitant to take it and worried about what effects it could have on me.

I have been taking it for 4 months now, and I have had no negative reaction to it. No weight gain, cramps, depression, etc. In fact, my face doesn't break out anymore. I haven't had a pimple for a whole month, which has never happened to me before.

All in all, I just want to post this so that if anyone is ever researching Yaz or Loryna they might come across this and not feel as nervous/scared about taking it after reading so many negative reviews.

t3_23qrdr,"Ladies, I got Nexplanon questions","So I've searched this sub about as much as I can so far and I've gotten mixed reviews on how people feel about it. 

I'm interested in it because I've been on birth control pills for going on 10 years and I'm sick of taking those things daily. My life has gotten more hectic recently (grad school, full time job and multiple volunteer/leadership positions) and I'd rather not have to worry about it. I'm in a long term relationship where we don't want children any time soon (probably never) so I'd really like to not get pregnant.

Some women have said they completely lose their periods and others say that they bleed for long periods of time after the initial implantation. I'm curious to know if the women who lost their period are smaller (weigh less) and that may be why. I have a overweight BMI and I'm concerned that it will cause me to bleed for months on end at the beginning. Other thing I noticed is that women said they lost their sex drive. I already have a pretty low sex drive, I think it has to deal with self-esteem and negative body image more than actual sexual desire. 

Any comments or recommendations would help.

No matter how much I told him I didn't want to, he wouldn't listen. He kept pushing me and pushing me. He got so close, my anxiety took over and I froze. He took that as a yes, and that's when it all began. The next couple years were spent with him. I felt too worthless for anyone else. Too dirty. I'd always tell him I don't want to do that. He didn't care. Even when I cried, he ignored it. His forceful touch overpowering my feeble attempts to push him away. He moved away, and I ended it with him, knowing that I wouldn't have to face him and his anger problems. 
I pushed it all deep down. I did my best not to think of it. Now I am 18, and I can't stop thinking about it. Every little thing reminds me of him. I am bisexual, but I tell people I am a lesbian, because whenever I am with a guy I think of him. Now it's getting worse though. Even though he lives hours away, I know he wants to move back here one day, and I fear that I will see him again. Every day I scan my surroundings to make sure he's not anywhere near. I can't get close to anyone without remembering his vile touch. I had a boyfriend who I really cared for, but there's one noise he makes that is the same as one he makes, and I ended it with that guy and haven't spoken since.

t3_23qy8n,Birth Control Experiences and Concerns,"Hey y'all, I'm 17 and going to the gyno for the first time this week (or next). Sexually active and subject to killer periods. I'm trying to figure out the best method of birth control--one that will:

1. Reduce my chances of getting pregnant during PIV sex (the boyfriend and I always use condoms but we want a hormonal method as well just to be sage
2. End the killer periods! I'm sick of missing school and lying in bed feeling miserable. 
3. Not interfere with my other meds (lamictal 200 mg, zoloft 25 mg, and clonidine--not to be confused with klonopin--for bipolar disorder/anxiety nos/sleep)
4. Something cheap. My family is pretty poor but we're fortunate enough to get halfway decent health insurance through my dad's employer (the state). 

Obviously I'll talk to the gynecologist about this and I've been doing thorough research on Planned Parenthood's site. But the My Method app they have isn't too helpful and I want to know more about what people's personal experiences. Also, a few other things:


* I worry about going on the pill because I'm fairly bad at remembering to take the meds I'm currently on, even with reminders and alarms 

* Implanon--the PP website says it doesn't work if you're on certain psych meds--anyone know about this (and obviously I'll consult the gyno and my shrink but just wanted some more info beforehand)? Blog post on Scarleteen said otherwise but didn't specify which meds. Also the insertion method kind of scares me. 

* Mirena: has anyone had an experience with this making their periods lighter? I like the idea of it lasting for five years and being relatively low maintenance. I'm worried about the up front costs and wondering if it will be cheaper than the pill over time. At 18 I think I'm off Dad's insurance? Not sure. 

* I'm very fortunate to have parents and a loving boyfriend who are supportive. Wanted to acknowledge that just 'cuz.

t3_23s966,Tennessee Making Pregnancy Outcomes a Crime - Why You Should Care and How You Can Help,"Tennessee's General Assembly has passed a law that would make women [criminally liable for the outcomes of their pregnancies.](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/10/tennessee-legislature-passes-far-reaching-bill-make-pregnant-women-criminals/) The bill targets women who use narcotics illegally during pregnancy, but is written so broadly that any pregnancy loss thought to be connected to an 'unlawful' act can be grounds for investigation, arrest, and prosecution. This means that anyone who has a miscarriage at any time in pregnancy or gives birth to a baby with health problems can face criminal investigation. The penalties are assault charges, which can carry up to 15 years in prison. 

This is bad business for a lot of reasons. 
* It is [meanspirited and counterproductive](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/opinion/criminalizing-expectant-mothers.html): women who struggle with addiction need health care, not handcuffs. 
* [Medical experts recognize](http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Health_Care_for_Underserved_Women/Substance_Abuse_Reporting_and_Pregnancy_The_Role_of_the_Obstetrician_Gynecologist) that the threat of prosecution actually hurts babies by driving women away from prenatal care.
* The law will [disproportionately punish black women] (http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/17/tennessees-pregnancy-criminalization-law-will-hit-black-women-hardest/), who are more likely to be blamed for their pregnancy outcomes. 
* Prosecutors claim that *only* addicted women who don't seek treatment will be arrested, and they will *only* be charged with a misdemeanor. But [nothing in the law](http://www.salon.com/2014/04/21/you_cant_always_trust_people_to_do_the_right_thing_how_a_law_split_pro_life_gopers_in_tennessee/) limits it in this way. 

Prosecutors and police shouldn't have a place in pregnancy: this is the first time a state has passed a law that gives them an in. 

The bill is currently awaiting Governor Bill Haslam's signature. Groups are circulating a petition [demanding that he veto the law.](http://action.rhrealitycheck.org/page/s/gov-haslam-veto-pregnancy-criminalization-sb-1391)  I hope you will sign, and I would also appreciate your suggestions as to where else I might post.

t3_23rx22,Expat Trailing Spouse resenting marriage. Super lonely!,"Hi Ladies, 

I moved to Italy with my husband in September.  He is pursuing his postdoc.  I am an engineer, and am working remotely.  The whole thing fell apart.  We got married like 4 days before we moved out here, which was incredibly stressful and ridiculous in its own right, and I was supposed to work at the European site here.  When I got here, they gave some bla bla work visa excuses that my company was supposed to work out but didn't.  Several conversations and weeks later, they asked me to just work ""from home"".


It is so hard.  It has been 7 months and it is not going well.  I am a huge extrovert and my husband is the only person I talk to.  We have some friends yeah, but they are his office buddies.  My whole identity is warped now that I'm married. I'm essentially a stay at home wife.     I have not bothered to learn Italian, I just don't even give a shit.


My job is only letting me do this for one year so I have to go back in September.  I would have gone back by now but I was trying to make it work, and people are coming to visit and I didn't want to disapoint everyone.  We have this stupid picture perfect sounding life - moving to Italy and I get to work my breadwinning job from here - fuck me, its anything but.  My job has unravelled, I get menial tasks, most of the time I don't do anything but stay logged on until I get an email.  I used to be a heavy hitter - now I'm just a name on the org chart.  I've addressed this with my boss but not much has changed. I have been considering changing careers when I get back in Sept, have been considering divorce, I am just not happy.  To be honest, I am more important to myself than my relationship is to me.  I probably should not have gotten married and came out here.  We had been dating 8 years and rushed the wedding when we found out he got the position.


I just need to vent. Today was especially bad for me.  We went on a great trip this weekend but today is our first full day back and my despair hit me like a ton of bricks.  I am so lost. I know when I go back to the US I'll fall into another depressive episode and feel like this was a wasted opportunity that I slept through.  I used to be so loyal and gung ho about my job - why bother to work so hard if they couldn't even back me up this year.  ",8,20140423104841,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I just got my period and I got the damn thing in easily enough, which was a surprise. However, i'm unsure if I did it right, haha. 

I folded it in the C-shape and got it in, but I can't turn it. there's still a bit of C-shape left while it's in. so i'm not sure it's 'sealed'? i heard a 'fwomp' sound. I've done this trice now, after two-ish hours, taking it out (I'm home right now, haha) and putting it back in. 

Taking it out is proving weirdly difficult, since the cup seems to.. err.. migrate up? it's still in straight and doesn't leak (the outside looks clean and there is stuff inside) but it's very far up, so it's hard to grasp it and take it out.

am I doing it right? it'll get easier with practice I'm sure and i don't feel it in there, but I'm afraid that if i leave it in for, say, six hour, it'll migrate further and i won't be able to get it out!

t3_23s25l,In what world does the abuser leave the victim?? I am having trouble figuring out why this happened & feel like the only one who went through this.,"I keep hearing about how abusive relationships are so hard to get out of because the man sweet-talks the woman and begs her to come back. Or at least that's how I THOUGHT it went.

I was in a year long relationship with an emotionally, mentally & physically abusive boyfriend. We threatened to dump each other all the time and the other would beg not to. In the beginning it was me dumping & him begging, but at the last part of it it was the opposite. He controlled, manipulated, and played mind games. I was wrapped around his finger & blinded by, what I thought was, love.

The night we broke up, he was super black out drunk & he decided to beat me because I was crying (that's literally the reason) 
I thought in most situations the guy would hit the girl then feel really bad afterwards and apologize only to do it again in the future; but he didn't stop. He kept punching, kicking, throwing, slapping me. He took my windpipe, looked me in the eye with a look like a demon had possessed him, and suffocated me twice. The last time I fell to the floor passed out.
He tried to leave but for some reason I still cared about him (I still cant figure out why) He said ""fine but I'm leaving in the morning"" & we both pass out.


I wake up next to him. He was laying facing away from me. I was in so much pain. My eye was throbbing and disgustingly bruised. I choked out, ""babe...are we still together?"" He leans over, looks at my eye & said ""Oh God"" He then jumped out of bed and started immediately packing his stuff. I was crying so hard asking why he was leaving, begging him not to. That I needed him (so I thought). He seemed like he was sad and he kept saying ""I have to.""  He then sits down and starts crying with me. He tells me ""he loves me and always will."" and we hug for the longest time. Tells me he will still pay his part of the rent. He then gets up, tells me he loves me, gives me one more hug and leaves me there to wallow in sadness, pain & emptiness.


The next day he told me we were just ""on a break"" and can ""try again"" when he ""gets his shit together."" After that day though he changed his mind and said we could never be together again, but could still be friends and hang out. Why was I the one begging him, when he had hurt me so bad? A week after all this, he calls me up crying saying he had gotten in the car and just drove & drove. Didn't know where or for how long but ended up like four states away. Told me he was scared and thinking about killing himself. I was stupid and still cared about him. I wired him money and we were talking like we were in love again that day. Was he manipulating me or did a part of him really become scared and looked to me for help?


The next two weeks after the incident we are talking. He seemed extremely depressed too. His father was abusive to his mother for like.. 10 years, and I guess he was upset that his father came out in him, because it seemed like he didn't want to become him. But then why did he? He used to cry about his dad so much in the first few months in our relationship. He was so sensitive and remorseful for being mean to me. Grieving for his lost childhood his father robbed him of. Then the last couple months between us, something in him snapped. He was so, angry at me. All the time. No matter how good I tried to be to him. He wasn't the guy I fell in love with, he had become a monster and I'm not sure why or what happened. Im not saying I was the perfect girlfriend, I have made a few mistakes, but I didn't treat him like he treated me. I put way more energy, time, and feelings into this guy than anyone ever has, despite how he acted towards me.


No matter how much I think about it I can't figure out what happened in his head. Did he care about me and just let his demons take over or did he never care & just use me for his own personal gain? When he was beating me he told me he ""stopped loving me a long time ago."" & truth comes out when you are drunk. But if he did, why did he keep coming back when I begged him not to dump me? I mean, he did do a few things for me..He called the ambulance for me when I drank to much, projecting vomit, and spent the night waiting at the hospital for me. He bought me some gifts when I caught him doing something and took me out to eat. Just all the negatives outweighed the positives. But did he care about me or not? Why did he cry and act depressed when we broke up? Only to start treating me like less than dirt again? 


I think he was either bipolar, borderline personality or something along those lines. My therapist says that they are addicted to power and control & leaving is maybe a way they still have control on you because you are begging for them back. But when they leave they wont be able to have power over me anymore to satisfy their hunger. I can don't understand all this. 


Can anyone shed some light on the situation? I am having trouble swallowing the fact that I wasn't even strong enough to leave him. I was BEGGING for my ABUSER to come back to ME. 
WHY?????????
He took that satisfaction away. It was insult to injury, a slap in the face. (Literally) I just *can't* understand why. He was so cruel, but acted remorseful and ran away.


(P.s. I am in the process of pressing charges in case you are wondering. & I am so better off without him. Hes in jail and dead to me. I will never want to have contact with him again.)


Any knowledge on this subject is appreciated. Xoxo.


TLDR: What possible reason could possess my abusive boyfriend to leave ME after he beat & almost killed me? Why was I begging for him back and not the other way around?

EDIT: Might I add he had very large sad eyes when I glared at him in court while I gave my testimony. He looked scared and hurt. I was expecting him to look angry but it was mostly of disappointment it seemed. My mom tells me he probably is remorseful, but I have a hard time agreeing. She also mentioned that he probably knew his father was in him, but just couldn't suppress it any longer and is sad it came out and hurt me. Looking back on some old text messages she might be right. One read, ""It scares me when I yell at you like that because I don't want to lose control, I don't know what I'm capable of."" Showed it to my mom & she said, ""Yeah, he knew.""

Before when we still talked he did apologize a bunch of times and told me he left because ""he didn't want it to happen again"" But why do you suddenly care about me right after you beat & break me? With all the mind control, manipulating and lying hes fed me, its no surprise that I am seriously confused and don't know what to believe. With all these mixed messages and signals.",1,20140423113929,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23ssqq,Unplanned pregnancy. Very conflicting emotions and thoughts.,"Sorry for the long post. I am very conflicted. I am 25 years old, and I have never thought I wanted children of my own, but suddenly this year it's like the mommy hormones finally kicked in, and lots of my friends are pregnant or have had their first kid, and my stupid body is going ""babies! Let's make babies!"", and my logical brain is like ""what is this"" …. And now I'm fucking knocked up and really confused about what I really want. 
I had an abortion at 16, and never thought it would happen again unplanned, yet here I am. That experience was heartbreaking and I really don’t want to go through it again. I am not in an ideal place in my life for a child - the father is my ex that I keep hooking up with because the sex is amazing and I do care about him a lot, but he is virtually homeless and jobless right now, due to really bad financial and business management coupled with severely debilitating depression and untreated OCD. In short, not someone I can count on.
I, on the other hand, have a really excellent job that pays very well and I have full benefits, I rent my own home, but I am still getting back on my feet (about $9k in debt not including my car or student loans) after being un or underemployed for two years. I am in a better place than a lot of women in my condition, but I still don’t think I could handle raising a child right now. 
I have thought a lot about adoption, but that brings up a lot of issues for me too. Could I handle that? After nine months and hours of pain in labor and birth, could I really give my amazing creation away, even if I had an open adoption? I was adopted, and I don’t see or talk to my bio mother, even though we did connect a few years ago (it was a closed adoption). Will my baby grow up to not want to see or talk to me? Will it be easier that way or to see him/her grow up with another couple? 
Also, I am so afraid of losing my pre-baby body. And (I know I shouldn’t care) but what will my coworkers and friends think, how will they react? I am atheist now, but I was raised Catholic, so those feelings of guilt are kind of hard wired into my brain. 
I also feel really lonely in this decision. I am not close to my mother so that’s not even an option of telling her until I actually make a decision (and only if it's not abortion). My father and I don’t talk about this kind of stuff lol. I'm not close to most of my blood family anyway, my family is the community of friends I have built around me, but even then, I would feel ashamed to tell most of my friends, even really close ones. The only person I feel totally comfortable talking to is my ex, the father, but he makes it really difficult because he's still completely in love with me. I know he will support whatever decision I choose, but I still wish I felt comfortable with other people to talk about this with. 
I don’t know if I'm really asking for advice or anything. I just feel really confused and conflicted and sad that this happened right now, at a really inconvenient time in my life. I don’t want to have an abortion, but I don’t like the other options any better. Sigh.

t3_23sam9,Is my SO at all financially responsible for my ectopic pregnancy removal?,"Please read the entire story before jumping to any conclusions.  Also, I currently live in California, and if someone could cite the exact law, I would appreciate it.

So I had had the Paragard IUD since December of 2012, about 7 months after I started dating my current SO.  If anyone knows anything about IUDs, they would know that they are some of the best forms of BC, since you can't really misuse them.  Anyway, on February 23th I had an excruciating pain in my right side, but since I was between health insurance policies (my next plan was to start March 1st, a week later) I tried to avoid going to the doctor.  After hours of screaming and vomiting from the pain and almost passing out, I decide to go to a clinic to see what's wrong.  This pain.. was like nothing I had ever felt in my life.  Upon arriving at the clinic and spending $100, they tell me to head to the ER right away-- they thought it was my appendix.

Fastforward a few hours, and after several tests we find out it was an ectopic pregnancy.. in my ovary.  The pregnancy was in my right ovary, and had grown so much that my ovary ruptured.  If I didn't go into the ER, there's a possibility that I could have died, so denying help wasn't really an option.  Now, I may have to pay over $10,000 (I'm still waiting to see if I qualify for help) in hospital fees, and I'm not in a place where I can afford that.  My SO isn't any more financially secure than I am (we are both recent college graduates), but I think it's a little unfair that because of something we **both** caused, I have to possibly deal with a $10,000 bill by myself IN ADDITION to all the pain I went through.  Not to mention I had to take 2 unpaid weeks off of work to recover.

When I tried looking this up online, I couldn't find a specific law.  Mostly, I found people opposing the very idea that a man would be financially responsible, and that baffles me.  I would hear arguments that it's a woman's choice to have sex, knowing that she may get pregnant.  Well... I think it's a man's choice as well, knowing that he may get the woman pregnant.  Also, it's not like we were being careless, I was on what I thought was the best form of BC for me, since my body doesn't react well to hormonal BC.

Anyway, can anyone help me understand legally where we stand?  I hate to have to put this burden on to my SO, but I'm still trying to emotionally recover from this whole thing... let alone worry about paying the bills on my own.  Thanks!

If you need any more information, please let me know and I'll try my best to provide the answers.

It requires a bit of backstory, so please bear with me. She grew up in a very rural area and was ""homeschooled"" - in actuality, there was very little schooling going on and she mostly got to do whatever she wanted all day long. When she was maybe 20 her family moved to the West Coast - still a suburban/rural area, but better. She tried to move out and live in a bigger city, but due to her lack of a GED/diploma, job experience, and a disability (hearing-related) she wasn't able to find a job and had to move back home. She's now 26 and quite understandably upset about her life. 

She never learned to drive, she's one of many kids and grew up taking care of her siblings. Her mom doesn't have a valid driver's license, her dad whom she doesn't get along with works long hours (and there's an interesting dynamic between her parents that I don't ask about - her mom has a boyfriend in another state who comes to visit). She's depressed and can't even get help for that because she has no insurance. 

Every idea I've thought of seems to amount to nothing. The nearest bus stop is 3+ miles away, she obviously can't drive, doesn't have the money for insurance/gas anyway. Nothing nearby that she could volunteer at. She thinks about getting her GED sometimes but with no transportation or way to get to a job, doesn't see the point. I don't know how to help her; I was afforded many more opportunities growing up so it's hard to even see from her perspective sometimes. The only thing I thought of was WWOOF, but that still wouldn't provide much except a way to get out of the house. 

TL;DR: My 26 year old friend never learned to drive, got her GED, or has had a job due to the circumstances she's grown up in. She's depressed, doesn't have much money, and wants to find a way to get a job/move out but doesn't know where or how to start.",15,20140423221012,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23u24q,"An ongoing review of Betty Beauty's ""BettyBare"" hair removal cream","I'm just gonna say it, I know a lot of us women are always looking for better ways to remove pubic hair. If you like your bush, that's great! If you don't, well, join the club. 

Waxing hurts. A lot. Even more so the first time, so many don't bother going back (or trying in the first place). I've tried to do it at home. Got half a strip down before I had to stop. I know I should try with a professional, but now that I know the general level of pain it will be, I've been putting it off. 

Shaving sucks. I'm sorry, it does. The pricklies grow back fast, and poke and scratch in places that should not be poked and scratched by such tiny little porcupine spikes. Those of us with sensitive skin reach a problem very quickly here: shaving every day causes raw skin, but shaving every other day allows too much time for those little spikes to grow in and start the torture, not to mention a lot more ingrowns crop up in this time. 

And Nair... Veet.... the masters of horror. We ALL have read the horror stories, or have some of our own. No need to go into deets.

So lately I've been hearing about ""BettyBare"" hair removal cream. They claim to be the only removal cream gentle enough for use ""all over the body"", supposedly without ""that lingering bad smell"". I spent a good few hours checking out reviews, searching on other websites, etc. I only found one review from someone who had a bad reaction. SO I thought, why not, I might as well give it a try. What more do I have to lose? I've already nicked, snipped, ripped, and burned my way through so many failures, what's one more?

Well, I'll tell you this. It went.... better than expected. I test patched it first on a small area at the top of my bush. Followed instructions to the letter. Went fine. Removed a small amount of hair, but it was a less than 1"" square patch, so hey. I waited 48 hours and went for (almost) the whole deal. No burning, at all! I swear on my labia, my honor, and my laptop. And I consider my downstairs party a 9 out of 10 on the ""unpleasantly sensitive"" scale. It also really wasn't all that bad smelling. The sulfur smell is there, but to me it's faint, and it doesn't linger, like it said. 

Now on to the downside... actual hair removal was sub par. Instead of removing the hair from the follicle like you think it's supposed to work, it seems to just weaken the hair at skin level and break it off. Not to mention, *of course* it doesn' remove everything the first time around. It did remove a fair amount though, I'd say about 2/3s the hair is gone. The rest just looks and feels like five o'clock shadow, minus the rawness and razorburn. So there's another plus- again, zero burning. Zero pain. The stubble is a little softer and less dead-set of stabbing everything. 

I plan on trying again after another 48 hours and will update here when I'm done. I think that I should have followed the box's advice and trimmed my bush down, but I didn't and I think it factored in on how much hair got left behind. I also left a landing strip of sorts, out of fear of burning my labia, just in case I did have a bad reaction. I didn't, so I may test patch closer to the actual edge of the hair growth there. I'm hoping that a second pass with this stuff will remove 90% the hair that's left, and I can easily tweeze off the remaining weakened hairs (the ones left currently are not all weakened enough to do this yet). 

The way it's going, I don't know if I would really bother to do this regularly or not. It takes about 20 minutes all in all, including application, wait time, and removal. Kind of a pain for results that are stubbly and patchy, despite the fact that it's so far the least irritating hair removal process I've tried. If it works much better by doing it more regularly, that would be awesome, but if it will always be broken stubble rather than actually removed hair, I don't think it'll be my go-to. I'd end up sticking with just trimming. So far I'm giving it a 3 out of 5. 

If anyone else has tried this stuff, feel free to share your own sort of review here, I'm interested. I couldn't find any other posts on reddit at all, aside from one ad with no comments. ",10,20140423234406,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23tgw6,I'm at my wit's end over a particular stubborn case of BV.,"One of the most horrible things about being an American is the lack of accessibility to healthcare. I'm unfortunately in a position where my benefits won't kick in until a while, but I'm barely managing to go paycheck to measley paycheck that I just can't afford to take off work and pay for a doctor's visit for something non-life threatening. Or even life-threatening for that matter.

But I'm so fucking tired of walking around with a fucking open can of tuna between my legs. I've gone beyond embarrassed, and now I just feel like my specially cultured eau de parfum is just a constant reminder of my low quality of life. 

So I'm just sitting here for an hour with a freaking plain yogurt soaked tampon up my twat; crossing my fingers (and legs) for the best.

So freaking ridiculous.

If you are from a glorious European nation, Australia, East Asia, New Zealand or anywhere on earth that actually considers their fucking citizens as human beings - consider never moving to the US without healthcare already taken care of.

I'll let you guys know if this old wives tale works. Otherwise I might have to do something a little more extreme. Maybe filling a female condom full of yogurt and burying it under some goddamn tree in the moonlight.

t3_23u0ke,My life with a narcissistic hypocrite,"For a while, I've known he was a creeper.   Mr. Charming to most who ""know"" him.   I know who he is.   This man who wore the mask of a martyr for staying with me through my past mistakes.   I was imperfect, an addict, numbing the pain of his mental abuse and lack of real love.  I didn't quite understand that at the time.   I even strayed during our off times.   
Years ago, I found my will to be healthy, and a better person.   
Through it all, he would bring my past up against me whenever he was angry... even using it against me with our children... Because, he was the martyr who ""saved"" me, who never strayed, I deserved to pay penance and be kept in a virtual prison.  I've worn the scarlet letter for far too long.   
For a couple years now, I've known about the dating profiles,  I had my suspicions for a long time, but no proof.   A year ago, caught him sexting and planning to hook up with a woman. .. That was of course blamed on my past.   I've seen a few other attempts since then. 
Now, I've gotten the bombshell.  I had a conversation with is secret girlfriend of 15 years; longer than our own relationship, by a couple years.   She was trying to contact him to inform him that she had tested positive for an STD.  He doesn't know that I know.  He's going about acting completely normal.  He has no intention of telling me. 
I'm confronting him next week, after I get my blood work.  I don't know for sure what will happen, but I do know that his facade of the martyr will be broken and the hypocrite will be revealed.  
I have grown, and continue to strive to be a better human being.   He is incapable, it seems.   I pity him. ",0,20140423232339,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23t5ec,Did I cum?!,"Sorry if this is stupid! 
Ok, to keep it simple, I'm 24 & have been sexually active since I was 16. I had one long term partner but the sex was always focused on him. I enjoyed it but never felt like I even came close to cuming with him.

My new partner (been together 7 months) is more focused on me. We have a good sex life (2-3 times a week minimum), and he usually tries to get me off but can't. 

We decided to play with a toy and got a bullet vibrator to use on me. Now, from my knowledge (and I like to think I would know), I have never cum before. This one night however, he played with me with the bullet until I was practically convulsing. I couldn't control my body and in the end I think I might have cum. I was so exhausted after the feeling, however it almost felt like I peed a little. 

Is this normal? How can I tell if I did cum? I was thinking from the way that I went from tense & convulsing to utterly exhausted that I did?",1,20140423175139,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_23tshs,"I thought we were better, but I guess I thought wrong","I thought we had gotten better. Two weeks ago a friend of your sister's told you they had seen me at a nightclub and you berated me for two hours straight because you thought I was out to fuck guys. I never went out, it was just your shitty sister's fabricated story. Why do you believe her? You know she's a horrid human being who doesn't like you. And I'm your gf of 3 years. Then you said ""I believed you all along, I knew my sister was lying. I just wanted to be sure"". What a shitty fucking excuse.

And today? Today I had to go to group therapy at 6. You messaged me you loved me at 5PM. Then at 5:30 you messaged me again saying I don't care about you and that I'm cheating. You know I abhor cheating and haven't as much as looked at another guy since three years ago when we started dating. This continued for more than half an hour, while I just cried and screamed in front of a fucking PC because I cannot understand your train of thought. And I cut myself even though I haven't done so in months. And our daughter and my mom were worried, and I got late to therapy. And you said you loved me and everything's alright, but you're scared of losing me since you think I'm not ""completely [yours]"". Because I brought up the topic of swinging when we're older - a topic you've brought up several times before.

And now? Now you're just bringing up topics to fight with me. Like saying, out of nowhere, that I don't take care of our daughter - when I'm with her almost all the time. I say almost, because you get angry if I'm not Facebooking with you, even though I have a baby to take care of. I cannot be online all the time you're on and sometimes I may take more than one or two minutes to answer your messages.

And now you say that when she turned one last year, I had to leave her birthday party at your house early because I had therapy, and all your family kept commenting on how stupid it was. And you type in all caps, because that somehow gets your point across better, right?

Now I block you, I just want to go to sleep. I'm tired of you. And so you log into your father's Facebook account to ask me if we're over. And when I don't answer you text me.

I want it to be over. I don't want this anymore. You're making me miserable, you've been making me miserable for quite a while, but I always go back. You change for a bit and everything's alright. You blame me for every time we fight, somehow it's all my fault - but I really don't believe you. I know it's not my fault, but you never listen.

Now you're telling me to decide if we're over or not. I say that I don't know, but you say it's one or the other, and then insult me.

We both know tomorrow everything will be the same. I'll never leave you. We have a child together and I'm just not that strong. Tomorrow, or hell maybe even today, everything will be forgotten.

I'm sure most of you think my issues are stupid, and it's easy to get out of the relationship, but it's not, at least not for me. He was/is my first boyfriend, we've been together since we were 16. I've wanted to leave him before when he used to hit me and I even pressed charges but I went back because I thought he had changed. I'm scared and I don't have any friends I can confide in. I'm scared he'll think I'm cheating and do something to me, because he has half-joked that he'd beat me up or kill me if I cheated on him before. He hasn't been violent for a little more than a year but I'm very scared nonetheless.**",0,20140423214840,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_23u4s4,Screwed up another interview today. :(,"Sorry to vent here, but I'm just really down on myself right now. I'm really in need of a job change. While I'm fortunate and grateful that I have a job, I'm very unhappy and on the hunt for something new. My current job is not very challenging and doesn't pay enough for a single mom to make ends meet. 

I went for an interview today and just really screwed it up. This is the 3rd interview in about 2 months, and the 3rd that I've completely blown. I have good experience and pretty good skills (maybe just not as ""refined"" as some others), but I suck at interviewing. While I don't have a problem sitting down and speaking candidly about myself or my experience without being nervous, when it comes to behavioral questions, it's totally deer in the headlights. I've tried to prepare, and I think I've prepared smarter for each subsequent interview, but it's inevitable that I'm asked a question that I haven't considered and then I stumble and freeze up. It's so depressing. I know that I could do a great job for them, but I'm not able to articulate for them the reasons why or give examples to support myself, which costs me any consideration. 

I'm trying to remain positive until I hear back that I'm not being asked to return for another round of interviews; maybe there were some things that I said that really struck a chord with the interviewers. I'm just not very optimistic at this point and I'm beginning to feel like I'm going to be stuck where I am forever because I can't convince other companies that I'm the best choice for the position. This job would have been a great opportunity at an international company with great pay and awesome benefits. It's just what I need right now and I feel like I let it slip through my fingers. :(

Anyway, if anyone has advice, or just wants to commiserate, that's cool. I mostly just needed to vent. Or if anyone knows of a customer service related position (preferably supervisory) in the northern suburbs of Chicago, who wouldn't mind someone who isn't great at interviewing but would work her ass off and do a great job, let me know. :)

t3_23ulde,This happened to me today [possible TW],"I went to see my boyfriend at work during his break today, as usual (it's a routine), where we have a heated emotional discussion. I cried but it wasn't dramatic waterworks and I really tried to keep it on the low. We settle things but my emotions are still a little shaken and he walks me to the traffic light to send me off back towards home. We kiss, but it's not making out, more like long pecks? I then feel a hand graze my butt and I turn around to see this white guy smirking at me (I'm 21 and 5'4"" and I don't look my age). 


I stood there, shocked and speechless and my boyfriend was both shocked and speechless as well but shaking in anger. Before anything can escalate, I pull my boyfriend back all while the guy smirks at us.


We leave in the opposite direction, my boyfriend fuming and me in tears again from the shock but not crying. I just got home and I'm so numb about this whole evening - am I being melodramatic? I don't know if this puts this into more context but I've been sheltered by my parents my whole life so I've never experienced anything 'bad' before; the worst has been catcalling which made me feel sick but this was physical and I'm just numb. A part of me feels relieved that it was just a graze of the guy's hand, not a grab or squeeze.

t3_23uky7,Should I talk to my unreliable friend who I'm drifting apart from?,"Hi all. So I have this friend who's part of a group of girls who are their own ""crew"" from elementary/highschool, who came to the same college. I came from overseas and kinda slotted into their group. We're moving onto working life now and I don't know about the rest of them but I'm drifting apart and branching out. It's all good, I still love them, but it's just time, and life goes that way sometimes. I also don't click super well with them and need to meet more people with common interests.

This one girl in particular is really flaky. It's to an inexcusable degree. I searched ""dealing with flaky friend"" etc on here and nothing was quite on point because this friend is way extreme. She is known to be up to 2-3 hours late for stuff. She has gone from being late, to cancelling last min, to not showing up with no warning, to cancelling on plans that SHE made where everyone had to work around her availability.. She once just didn't show because she ""just decided to go watch this movie instead"". She also often only reaches out because her boyfriend is going out of town, and then doesn't show and it turns out it's cuz he decided to stay (she's really co-dependent on him). I should have called her out when these things happened (none of the ladies in my equivalent ""school crew"" back home would EVER pull this shit) but I just get so stunned and go ""oh ok... maybe next time then"".

I should also add she has no issues such as depression that I'm aware of, or any kind of social anxiety, or hugely time-consuming commitments or illnesses or anything that are all good reasons for being late sometimes. She is just really unreliable. (except for being really needy in her relationship as I mentioned. Maybe that has something to do with it?! any insights??)

I regret this and take full responsibility for not calling her out on her shit. Because of this ""slow fade"" I see coming up due to transitioning to the next chapter of my life, I probably won't see her much any more (all good, no hard feelings - just time to meet new peeps). But I'm wondering if I should sit her down and talk to her about her behaviour before ""letting her go"". The group of girlfriends I mentioned before -  they've all known each other since they were like 6, they are objectively speaking less mature than myself I think and on top of that they regress a little around each other cuz they've known each other since they were kids. And they are totally complacent and never call each other out on stuff. They can't be bothered talking to that girl about her flakiness because they know she's aware she's like that and they've spent so long joking about it/making fun of her for it that it wouldn't be taken seriously. And - I know this isn't my place to judge or assume - but I honestly don't think they care about each other as much as they think they do. They care in the sense that if one of them had a crisis they would all be there in a heartbeat, but they don't care enough to sit down and have tough conversations with each other to help each other grow. I want to have these conversations with them but they've known each other so much longer I almost feel it ""isn't my place"" and that they would get defensive of each other - kinda like when an outsider criticises family. Like ""Hey my sister's an asshole but she's MY asshole sister and ain't no outsider gets to say that!""

TL;DR Unreliable friend impossible to make plans with. I already plan to slowly fade her out of my life - no hard feelings, it's just the turn the friendship is taking. Should I also have a heart to heart about her behaviour?",1,20140424054746,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I’m upset about a social interaction I had this morning with a stranger I met in the parking lot at school. I was by myself at the edge of the parking lot (nowhere near my car), and then as a man in his late 50s gets closer he asks me where I’m from. I was so startled that I just responded automatically, and then found myself getting caught in conversation that just came out of nowhere.

He got around to talking to me about my major, his business, and networking, and then 5 minutes into the conversation he asks me to lunch. My immediate response is “Oh, no thank you.” And I feel that should be enough, but he asked “Why?” and don't remember exactly what came out of my mouth because I was *so nervous* - and I’m still tense right now, *ugh* – but I said something like I’m uncomfortable with that, and he asked why again… and this went on for a couple of minutes. I was getting super freaked and wanted to leave, but I didn’t want to be rude or have him watch me walk to my car or freaking follow me, so I stayed put. Which is also stupid.

After that weirdness the conversation was okay, and he gave me some advice about public relations courses and stuff. I was clearly being super awkward, yet he was nice about it and I used it as an opportunity to be more social, because I suck at that too.

I feel really stupid for just talking to a stranger who could have overpowered me if he wanted to, especially since I was alone and vulnerable. There were no other people walking around when we started talking. And I feel extra stupid for not having the guts to just ignore him from the get-go. The conversation lasted 25 minutes, and part of the reason it lasted that long was because I kept asking him questions to fill in the silence and not seem like I wanted to run away. He gave me his number so I could text him my number and email, and I was like “sure” but I’m not going to do that, even though I looked him up and he is who he says he is.

I’m trying very hard to come out of my shell and be less socially awkward and anxious about every little thing, but I think I put myself in a situation today that could have turned dangerous for me. I stayed in that situation because I am so desperate to be a better person socially that I think I’ve distorted what's okay to try and what’s not, and I don’t know how to be assertive and just say NO. This could happen again and I’ll browbeat myself to stay because I want to overcome the anxiety and grab a networking opportunity, but I think I’ll just keep making bad decisions.

I need advice on how to respond to someone if I get approached like that again. And do you think it was inappropriate for him to approach me like that? Because if he’s as successful as he said he was, you’d think he would know that approaching a lone woman in a lifeless parking lot and starting with “Where are you from?” is creepy. Or maybe I’m being touchy.

**TL;DR: Anxious female, long conversation with strange man in parking lot, please advise me on how to me more assertive and social in a safe way, because I’m clearly not handling this well.**

**EDIT: Your advice is just what I needed, thank you all! This really helped me clear up my own confusion and now I have some useful phrases and behaviors to practice. I'm off to hardcore study for my last final, with a clear head. And good luck to anyone else with finals coming up!**",28,20140424093333,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Its trendy, cool, higher and store and I love the merchandise. My old Boss, we'll call her Pam, loved me. I don't know why, but most people hated Pam. I had friends quit because of her. Still, Pam tried twice to get me into management positions but her boss (our out of touch regional manager) kept putting her own people into the two I was aiming for. Pam got me a promotion, each time, but not as good as what I was after. This last time the promotion sent me to a better store. Promotion still, but again, not management. Then she left the company. My new position is ok. But I am finding at this new store they don't push me to be better ot try to improve my job there or want to promote me like she did. Its a bigger store and I went from being the golden child to the underdog. I suddenly don't see myself getting promoted here for a long time. Pam just called me up. Asking to chat about an assistant manager position available in her current store. Its a plus size lady store. So I would have little knowledge of the merchandise nor would I be able to wear any of it. But assistant manager! I am meeting with her tomorrow.

I couldn't think of a better community to reach out to than you awesome gals.","I am a 24F and I'm having trouble keeping my head above water. I don't really know the best place to start so if this gets long and/or rambly, I apologize in advance. I'll try to put in plenty of paragraph breaks. 

In terms of what's relative to my pain right now I have to go back to October of 2010 when I got engaged to my high school sweetheart who we will call T. I took it as an opportunity for personal growth by knowing that I had to dedicate myself to finding a female friend because I would need someone to stand there and be my Maid of Honor. This led me to a girl from our circle of friends who we will call W. She was in the same major as me, she was dating our roommates best friend, she seemed perfect for me in every way. I stepped out of my comfort zone and forced myself to interact with her, ask her to go out with me, and finally I worked up the courage to ask her to be my MOH and she accepted. I thought we were ""platonic soul mates"" and that I had really made the college friend everyone makes who lasts their whole life. 

I keep erasing a bunch of what I type, trying to remember what's relevant and what's not! To make a very long story short, T and W are engaged now. Less than a full year since T and my annulment became official (because of my Depression we were able to get this even though we were married for a little over a year), when he still has a couple of pictures from our wedding on his Facebook, he is engaged to the girl who was my MOH at our wedding. This alone sucks, super super super duper hard. W more or less abandoned me after swearing she wouldn't. Neither of them even bothered to tell me they were getting engaged, I had to find out on Facebook.

So what was I up to during the year that they apparently were falling into some kind of whirlwind romance that made the most cautious guy I ever knew propose after about a year of being with someone? Well, I thought I was having my own whirlwind romance. I met a guy online just a bit after T and I agreed we would file for annulment and it was a great distraction and confidence booster to flirt a bit with this guy through texting and online stuff. Well, once I moved out and found out about T and W I decided that even though it seemed too early to be messing with anything like that, that maybe since T and I had such a platonic relationship anyways for so many years that it was natural. So I met my online dream boat and it was amazing. Fast forward to December of last year and I'm graduating college and moving to be with him. Fast forward a little bit further to now and I've realized I've been controlled, realized that all of the confidence I had built up through having the strength to end my broken marriage has been systematically torn down by the man that I've been loving. 

I realized that I was genuinely beginning to feel that I was crazy and that he was right, I was making all kinds of shit up about things he did that made me feel certain ways. I began to feel that I was too sensitive and emotional. I try to think of what the breaking point was, but there were so many. My sadness always got twisted into being about him. When I confessed how devastated I was about W and T being engaged, all I got was an angry response that I shouldn't care about my ex. I couldn't trust a single thing he did or said as genuine, and I knew I had to get out. 

So that's where I'm at now. I'm supposed to move back in with my parents on Monday but now there is bad weather that's putting all of that up in the air. I'm still living with my new ex and we're both on an emotional roller coaster where one moment we're getting along and being kind to each other and supportive, wanting to preserve as much of the good as possible so we can look back at our time together and smile and the next moment he's condescending and selfish. 

I have no good leads on jobs back home, even though I have applied for about seven. I am terrified of moving in with my parents and never leaving again. I am terrified of never finding love. I constantly feel like screaming, like my skeleton is trying to claw out of my mouth. I cry at my desk. I'll have moments where I feel uplifted and positive, but they go away fast. There are things I need to do, like fill my Wellbutrin prescription and exercise more to help myself get out of this slump but no amount of knowing I need to do that stuff is making me do it. I have no friends that I can spend time with, I have no female friends at all that I can talk to about any of it. I'm too afraid to open up completely to the couple of female school friends that I do still keep in some contact with. I'm too afraid to open up completely with anyone in real life about how abusive this relationship has been. 

I feel like I'm circling a black hole and close to disappearing forever. 

**TL;DR: I'm a mid-twenties girl who's ex-husband is engaged to the girl who was my Maid of Honor and the only female friend I've ever made on my own, my own relationship is over and I'm hundreds of miles away from home waiting to return with no good job leads, and no personal or female support.

t3_23vvhc,"Thinking about making a huge move, but I have a lot to consider and a week to consider it. Advice?","Hey ladies. Okay, so, for as long as I can remember I've wanted to leave Texas. I was born and raised here but I just feel like I'm supposed to be elsewhere. In my junior year of high school, I was really starting to think about colleges and places I wanted to go. Big city is what I wanted. New York. Chicago. Boston. And I was prepared to start applying and getting ready for a new huge chapter. But then, the summer before senior year, my mother died. Everything was turned upside-down. There was no way I could leave my dad or older brother or my niece and nephew who she was raising at the time. So I stayed and started school here in Texas.
Fast forward to January 2013, going into my second semester of freshman year. My dad and my brother Cody (father to the niblings I mentioned before) decided to up and leave to South Texas to work in the oil fields (cliche, I know). Let me just give some back story on my bro: Cody has never been father of the year. He had my nephew when he was 15, and my niece when he was 16, and still at 25 he has yet to step up and be there for them. So, since my mom died, these kids have been living with their mother, who's a complete basket-case herself, and their grandmother, who is doing her best. SO, after my dad and Cody left, I made sure to pick up the slack and do everything I could to make sure those kids knew they were loved. 
I got a great job for an 18 year old, moved into my own apartment, and started making a little life. I had a schedule perfectly aligned and money specifically set aside where I would get the kids every third weekend. During this time, we'd go to the movies, Lego Land, museums, swimming, aquariums, plays, and basically anything that would make them know that this time with me was special. But then, my dad and brother came back. By this time it's October and I'm refusing to let the kids see the father who hasn't contacted them in 9 months. These amazing children don't deserve to be on this roller-coaster of emotions. But alas, I can't hide them forever, and they finally got to spend time with Cody. Since then, things have been okay. They've had a lot of fun with their dad and he seemed to be getting a little better. But I've seen this before, and once again, I was right for thinking it wouldn't last. Last week, Cody moved 3 hours away for a job. Do his children know yet? No. Guess who has to tell them? Me. And guess who just got accepted to UMASS Boston with everything paid for and doesn't know what the fuck to do?

Me.

So, everyone, I'm asking for your input. Do I stay, or do I go? If I go, I'll 100% make sure that I'm accessible to those kids. I'll call, Skype, pigeon-gram, whatever I have to do. But if I stay, I'll be able to get them whenever I want and show them how much I love and care about them. This is the hardest position I've ever been in. Please help. 

TL;DR Always wanted to move away from TX, and I have just been offered to attend UMASS Boston with everything paid for. But, my niece and nephew live here and the thought of one more person leaving them kills me. Need advice.",2,20140424141958,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_23wroa,My entire family will not stop being supportive and loving about my being gay. I AM NOT GAY.,"It started about 2 months ago, when I cut my hair off. I've always been a bit of a tomboy, but I do like girly stuff too. I wear makeup, but usually just foundation and mascara. I dress in t shirts and jeans, but tight fitting and girly. Now this isn't to say that lesbians do the opposite of these things or that straight girls wear makeup and dresses, but this will be a factor later so Im mentioning it now. Anyways, about two months ago I decided to take the plunge and do a pixie cut. (It doesnt look great, I think I have too round a face but that's besides the point.) I am off at school, so my mom only saw facebook photos and she calls me up to talk about it. 

She tells me she likes ""the new me"" and after a bit of normal back and forth she asks if there's anything else new I'd like to tell her. I say no and ask what she means, and she basically says that she has suspected since I was very little that I was a homosexual and that she knows it can be hard to tell people about but that she loves me and supports me. I tell her a little shocked that I am not gay, and she says ""whenever youre ready to talk about it, I'll be here."" It was weird, but I brushed it off and reassured her I wasn't gay. 

Fast forward a few weeks, and I'm home for a visit and my dad starts talking to me about boys. I have never had a boyfriend (I'm 21) and he laughs and says ""Well, don't worry, there's plenty of boys out there."" Then pauses, and adds ""You know, there are plenty of girls out there too. Your mother told me you were not interested in talking about it, but whoever you bring home just know we will be happy."" This led to a huge fight with me practically yelling at them that I do not like girls and never have and hem exchanging glances with one another and saying that they accept me no matter what. I say can you accept it if I'm straight? My mom just folds her arms and says ""Can you?"" and tells me she just wants me to be happy and to find happiness no matter what anyone says. She brings up the way I dress, that I never want to dress ""girly"", that I have had no interest in men, and that when I was little I used to say I was going to marry Ariel as opposed to my sisters who all liked John Smith, Prince Edward etc.) I give up at this point and just say ok. 

They didn't bring it up again, and it cooled down a bit until Easter. The family was grilling so people were milling back and forth from out to inside and eventually I was outside alone with my uncle. He asks me about school and stuff, I ask him about work. The normal. Then suddenly he says ""If you were gay no one in the family would say a word. You'd just be my gay niece! I'd be proud to have you as a niece, gay or not."" I didn't even respond to him I just went inside and confronted my mother. 

By this point I was so frustrated I just began to cry which she took as some kind of ""please, help me come out of the closet"" and said she had even talked to my grandparents about it and they promised to be respectful. She told me not to worry, kept consoling me all while I was so frustrated I just kept crying and crying. I left without even saying goodbye. Yesterday was the first time I talked to my mom since, and I sent her a very long text basically explaining that I was not a lesbian and to stop bringing it up because it was embarrassing and confusing. She replied ""I love you so much, always. No matter what."" 

Still seems to me she thinks I'm a deeply closeted lesbian. I dont know how to deal with this. My entire family is very conservative and on one hand I'm touched that they would be so accepting of me, but on the other, I really am not gay, and it is hurting my feelings that they think so.

t3_23x33m,[UPDATE] Tonight my dad beat me up. I have no idea what to do...,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/23hvwl/tonight_my_dad_beat_me_up_i_have_no_idea_what_to/) was my original post from a few days ago. 

So the morning after the assault happened, I ended up packing up a bag and going over to my ex-boyfriend's house, and I've been here ever since. I cancelled my bank account that my dad was a co-signer of and made sure I signed up for direct deposit for everything so I don't have to pick anything up, and I'm currently looking for apartments. No one in my family attempted to contact me for about three days after. We ended up talking to a police officer and reporting the case, and basically he said that it's not extremely likely that the case will actually get charged, and apparently that is how it is for most domestic violence cases unfortunately (especially since I didn't have more evidence than a couple small bruises). So that didn't sound too promising. After reporting the case, the officer called my dad and told him that I had filed a domestic violence case against him, and the day after my mom wrote me an email saying the things you would expect a mother in this position to say: she wished it had never happened, it's tearing the family apart, drop the charges, I wont be able to go to law school, etc...she said that my dad was very upset that I had pressed charges against him and that they could lose everything. She was *still* on my dad's side after all of this and I couldn't believe it. I wrote her an email back last night telling her *my* side of the story, because I don't really believe that my dad told her everything that happened, and why I cannot drop the charges and that I think I made the right decision. Almost immediately after I sent the email, my family repeatedly tried calling my cell phone, and I didn't pick up a single time, nor do I intend to for a while, or ever. 


So basically what it comes down to is, I'm scared. I really don't know what the outcome will be in all of this. I realize it is inevitable that it will tear my family apart, as I can never live with my parents again. I also realize that it is extremely important that I cut any financial ties with them. This means paying for grad school on my own, and they will probably stop paying for my insurance. I can't let them blackmail me with money anymore, like they did with my undergrad education. And who knows, maybe I wont even talk to them or see them again. I just don't know what will happen. Also I should mention that my dad still has not tried to apologize, even through email. I really think they still believe that I am at fault and not my dad. I think I may have mentioned in my original post that my dad has never apologized to anyone in my life. He's *always* right, no matter how badly he fucks something up; it's ALWAYS someone else's fault. I'm starting to speculate through all of this that my dad might actually have narcissistic personality disorder, and I really want him to get help for his issues. My goal isn't necessarily to get him thrown in jail. All I really want is for him to see why how he treats people is wrong, and eventually change his ways.


So anyway, I'm scared for a few reasons: I fear that my dad is probably really angry right now, and probably taking his anger out on my mom, so my mom feels forced to comply with whatever he says. That is what I imagine is going on. I feel bad that my mom is probably really worried about me and I don't want her to worry. I want her to know that I'm fine and I'm more worried about *her*. I also really dread going back to the house to pick up the rest of my stuff. I plan on going back in a couple weeks, probably during the day time, so my parents wont be there. I guess I'm kind of scared on the off chance they *are* there. I'm not planning to tell them when I'm coming back, because I know they'll be there if they know when I'm coming. I thought about bringing one of my male friends with me, because I know that in the off chance that my dad is there, he wont try to pull anything if there is a non-family member present. Unfortunately I can't bring a police officer, because they will only stick around for a limited amount of time, and I would need a while to pack everything up. I just want all of my stuff back and I think I would feel a bit more at-ease. I hate sitting here worrying that my dad is trying to destroy it or something.


Other than that I just really have no idea how this will pan out. I figure my dad will act in one of two ways, based on knowing him for 23 years: 1.) he will go (or has gone) absolutely ballistic and rage on my mom and brother, and be absolutely furious if he sees me again (for example if he sees me while I'm picking up my stuff), and maybe try to assault me again. Or 2.) he wont directly apologize or talk about the incident again, but he'll do something like buy me a really expensive gift, like a piece of jewelry, to try and ""make up"" for it, and get me to drop the charges. So, essentially a bribe. And then he'll use that to justify any of his bad behavior in the future. If you didn't read my original post, justifying abusive behavior with money is very common with my dad.


So that is the current status of my story. If anyone has any advice for me, feel free to say so, as I really have no idea what I'm doing here...",69,20140424213115,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23xc9u,"My family can't comprehend weight-loss, and won't stop commenting on it.","I (20F) have been losing weight steadily, and healthily, for the past several months. My family, although I love them, have terrible relationships with food. They are all very large, and I was overweight all through high school until I moved out and became self-aware of what I was eating. 

They don't eat complete crap all the time, but they buy a lot of cheap, easy food, and they have three portions of something when they should be having one. They don't understand calories, or portion control, or anything like that.

So I have hit my goal weight, with the help of gym and reinventing my diet. I'm slim, but I'm well within the healthy BMI for my height. Now my family have started bursting out the ""concern"" when I go to visit. I eat normal portions, they eat triple, and they start getting ""concerned"" when I refuse extra. The fact I no longer eat dessert is a bad sign, the fact I count calories is a bad sign, my sister called me a ""twig"", my dad asked me if I was ""anorexic""... etc.

They simply are deluded as to what a normal, healthy female body looks like (as in, even when I was overweight, my family saw me as normal, and I believed them). 

I just needed to rant I guess, and ask for advice? I told them to knock it off and they just said they were ""joking"" :I

Often used in a derogatory way to describe a girl with a lot of emotional issues.

My girlfriend said you should answer you know Lauren died right? My heart dropped. She was so young. 

I know it's wrong to cope like this, but I'm drinking. I haven't eaten in 2 days. I slept all day today. I'm fucking heartbroken for her. Drugs were such a struggle for her. She shot up cocaine. Last year she was in the hospital for a month and had heart surgery for endocarditis. She was doing so great after that. She was a teacher. Smart and really kind. She never had a bad thing to say about anyone, but underneath there was a sadness.

Then I feel worse because when Collin called I blurted out Lauren's dead? Why didn't you tell me? He said I tried to call you. Now I just feel like an asshole. A sad angry asshole",17,20140424181241,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_23wb8m,Feeling demoralized about my hairy vulva...,"Hi 2XC, I am posting here as I know the community is very understanding. I always knew that porn never set the right example in terms of genitals apperance so I never compared myself to those standards. Hence my understanding was that my genitals were probably average-looking, maybe a little bit on the hairy side... until I did obstetrics/gynecology as a student.

Having seen more than a hundred vaginas by now, from a wide range of ethnicities, I can say that my hairiness is truly out of the norm.

Let me explain how mother nature cursed me. I always keep my vagina shaven, trimed or waxed, but the rate at which hair regrows is phenomenal. If I shave, I already have 5mm by 3 days. If I wax, it takes about 2 weeks for half of the hair to regrow but with a much higher side effect of ingrown hairs. I have to exfoliate furiously everytime I shower, or if I don't I get ingrown hairs with pustules, sometimes bordering on small abscesses. Trust me I have tried not exfoliating at all, mildly and extensively and there is a clear inverse correlation. 

What I have never seen in any other woman so far is the sheer density of very thick dark coarse hair. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that each follicle is spaced less tham 1 mm apart, often times with 2-3 hairs growing out of the same hair follicle. 

As I said, I keep everything trimed or shaved but the density and thickness is clearly out of the norm.

I am very demoralized by all of this... I am afraid of being judged unless I shave daily to hide this problem (which is impossible timewise). 

The worse thing is that you would never imagine that as the rest of my body is not very hairy at all. My arms and legs have very very pale thin hair, and I don't even have to bother shaving my thighs. I also have quite few arm pit hairs. For context, I am a thin short Caucasian female in her twenties.

Before anyone tells me to get tested for PCOS, I think this is highly unlikely as I am quite thin (BMI 19), not hairy otherwise and have sharply regular menstrual cycles (literally precise to the day). 

I am very tired of all this hair removal... Should I get laser treatment? Anyone's thoughts or experiences in a similar situation? :(

t3_23wdwe,"Met the greatest guy ever, and now I need to dump him","Hello, ladies. I apologize in advance if this seems crazy/trivial, but I have no close girlfriends to talk to right now and am hoping you can offer advice and perspective. 

About 2 months ago I met this guy on OKCupid, we hit it off right away, he was super good looking, I couldn't believe my luck. We met about 2 weeks after our first chat, he brought me flowers (I'd never gotten flowers from a guy before!), was extremely gentlemanly, and sweet. I've never had to guess how he feels about me, always tells me how pretty I am, and is so respectful and thoughtful. He treats me how I've always wanted a guy to treat me since I've been interested in dating.

But I feel nothing. Over the last few weeks I have felt progressively less and less for him, and he's done nothing wrong. At first I thought maybe it's that he's awkward? Am i expecting things to be how they are with my best friend (who is a guy)? But it took forever for us to be comfortable. Do I have to wait with him too? I'd feel better about him once he held my hand or kissed me. So, as you can imagine, I've been quite confused. 

Well, I just got home from a date with him and now I know i have to end it. We went to the movies and I found myself hoping he wouldn't be affectionate, and when he was I felt nothing at all. It felt so wrong. 

Am I broken? Because that's how I feel. How can I feel nothing for the sweetest, most thoughtful man I've ever met?  And how do I do this?? I've never broken up with someone, and all i want to do is run. But i know that only makes things worse.

t3_23w9vt,Pregnant with Paragard (x-post /r/pregnant),"I just found out Easter Sunday that I am pregnant, despite having the Paragard IUD for a little over 2 years. I was hoping that it had just fallen out (I was especially hopeful considering I previously had the Mirena IUD fall out). An ultrasound yesterday confirmed that I am about 6 weeks pregnant, and the IUD was still in place, but baby was doing well with a little flicker of a heartbeat. Today I went to my doctor to see if the IUD could be safely removed and, sadly, it isn't a possibility.
Now I just have to sit and wait, and I'm really scared. I wasn't planning on having more children (I have a 4 year old daughter), but now I want this baby more than anything. There is about a 50% chance of losing the baby, and I can't even think about what would happen if I was part of the unlucky 50%.
I've searched the internet for support, and I found a few success stories of women carrying to term and having completely healthy babies, but there are just as many terrifying stories of miscarriage and stillbirth. I guess I'm just looking for any sort of positive thoughts and support, maybe some advice from those who have been in my situation. Thanks in advance :)",7,20140424163014,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I went to the gyno yesterday, it was my second time needing my ""lady bits"" examined. I saw the same doctor that I saw last year, so I didn't feel too nervous. Last year she was really sweet and understood me being nervous. She did the exam really slow and told me everything she was going to do before she did it. Sounds great, right? Not this time. The exam started normal, questions, breast exam, yadda yadda yadda. When it came time for the pelvic exam/pap, she put the clamps in without warning. To me, it felt like she was shoving them in without any lube or anything! I was already tense, and it made me tense up even more and grab the handles of the exam table and back up. I told her what she was doing hurt, and she actually said to me ""I'm almost done."" When it was over I found out the was so forceful she made me bleed, and I was in excruciating pain all day. 

I feel like she was very rude and unprofessional, and I don't know what I can do about it. I already know I'll be switching doctors for next time, but is there anything I can do to make sure no other girls experience this? I'm at a loss, I've never felt so violated in my life.

So a couple of nights ago, I womaned up and told him that while ""having sex with you feels amazing, but I need a little more warming up and I need a little more stimulation on my clit if I'm going to come."" We didn't see each other for a few days, but last night we got down to sexytimes and HOLY HELL.

I feel so below average at everything. I don't have fun, I stress so hard over school just to get average grades, I hate my job, I have terrible self image issues that I'm constantly reminded of by looking at all the pretty girls everywhere I go, and I'm overwhelmed by trying to find a real person job with my college degree after/if I graduate by the end of the year, among other things.

t3_23yiqk,"We're seeing each other, but he treats me like a friend...?","I need some advice...

Last night was the first time I had a sexual experience more than kissing with a really nice guy who I have been seeing for about 1.5 months. I first became interested in him because he was just so easy to talk to and to be around. I felt like I could be myself around him, so I pursued him by asking him out, texting him first, trying to flirt. Pursuing a guy was new for me, but I felt like all the extra work was worth it.

We are both college students and while I have had a couple boyfriends and hookups, I'm not extraordinarily experienced. The guy I'm seeing however, has never dated anyone at all. I'm pretty sure I was his first kiss, which I'm fine with. However, I am not fine with doing all of the work and with getting almost no reaction out of him when I flirt or try to get close to him. Everything I do that is remotely flirty or romantic he ignores, avoids, or acts like it is just friendly. For example, we were cooking dinner together recently and he was looking at something. In order for me to see what he was looking at I stood slightly closer than normal to him... and he moved away. This happens constantly. When we're at parties, we dance like we're friends. We've never held hands while walking or watching a movie. Whenever it comes time to say goodbye, he backs away from me or walks away like everything is chill. We've only kissed twice, once last night (we had been sitting in my bed snuggling for like an hour and I had to ask ""will you kiss me?"" and then he kissed my forehead once before I teasingly said ""Oh come on, I want more than that""), and once when he was in my room about a month ago. I'm frustrated. All the really strong feelings I had about him and the ability to feel comfortable to be myself around him are mostly gone. Not because he's not nice, but because every advance I make on him is shot down and I feel like he doesn't get me like a romantic partner should. I know he has feelings for me, as our mutual friends have told me, he always makes time to see me, and he is always seems happy to be with me, but he doesn't express those feelings with words or actions (except very rarely, like last night and even then only minimally). 

I want those strong feelings to come back. He is a great person, but I need more romance and more openness and essentially, I want to feel pursued too, but I don't know how to do that. I want to bring it up and talk to him about how I feel like we act like we're only friends when we're clearly both interested in something more. I've been trying to for a while, but I don't know how to do that or when a good time would be. Help?

My second, slightly different problem, which is me just probably freaking out, is that last night I gave him a hand job (after he had already stuck his hands down my pants, I don't understand why he could do that but not kiss me...why??) and he came. We wiped it up with paper towels and then he tried to reciprocate for me, but now I am worried that he might have had cum on his hands... He didn't actually stick his hands into anything important and I'm pretty sure all the cum had been wiped off his hands (if he even had any on them), but now, of course I am worried about getting pregnant. Is that possible?

t3_23zcnc,"I dont know that i want to honor my two weeks notice at a job anymore. Im not sure how to go about doing it or if i should just stick it out, any advice would be amazing.","So last august i got a job as a receptionist/manager at a nail salon. At first i loved the job. It was only weekends but i was told that i would get a 4 day schedule soon, and each shift was 10 hrs so it was decent. I was also making 3 above min wage which isnt that much but i was told that i would get a dollar increase a year or so. My boss is a little old man and he works the other five days a week. Hes the owner and he is pretty stressed out often.

About 7 months ago he cut my pay. When i realized (because he doesnt give actual pay stubs) he told me that he couldn't afford to pay me as much. He then cut my hours and only has me working on the weekends again. He also has me work 9am-7:30/7:45 and doent pay me for that last 45min. Last month i went out and got another job that gives me 30 hrs a week and works around my school schedule. Its every week day and i get weekends off, something that I've never gotten in the 5 years that ive been working. After two weeks of working there i went and told my boss at the nail salon that i was putting in my two week notice. He essentially told me no, that i can quit but he needs me to work until may 10th. I said that i would work this upcoming weekend (tomorrow) and the weekend of the 10th and thats it. He replied with attitude saying that he needed more than a two weeks heads up. I am fed up and no longer want to keep my two weeks. He has me running the store, supervising the girls and dealing with the customers all for 25 cents over minimum wage and its not worth it to me anymore. I dont need the reference and every day that i work there i feel so drained, im ready to stop dreading the weekends. I just dont know what to say because i am a bit of a push over and i dont want to hurt his feelings or stress him out, and i dont know if i am okay to end my two weeks early or if i should stick it out.

t3_23ymsl,Yesterday afternoon was a little rollercoaster of emotions.,"You know how sometimes, when you discover something out of place, your brain will jump to horrible, terrible things? That happened to me yesterday as I preemptively placed my Diva Cup before starting W1D2 of C25K. In the process I noticed something not quite right with my labia... There were bumps, and not little ones either. Cue the brain jumping to horrible, terrible things.

I came out of the bathroom and told my boyfriend that I was pretty sure something was up with my genitals. Did I mention I started crying? I started crying. Not so much because something seemed to be going on with my body, but because of a conversation me and my boyfriend had had before we started dating. You see, we met online and got to know each other pretty well in the time leading up to my move to the same area he lived in. This included having some of the more difficult and important conversations such as what each of us want out of life and a relationship (we match up so well, it was crazy amazing) as well as STD testing and deal breakers. Sexual health is super important to him (score, right?!) so he had always been pro-active about being tested and ensuring his partners are as well since he never wants to wind up with something he could have for life (see why I was starting to freak out yet?). I divulged that I had been treated for Chlamydia in my past, but that I would get fully screened again to be extra sure everything was good (and I did...twice!).

Here we are now, about to celebrate our one year anniversary and I have it in my brain that I might lose him over whatever is going on. After I tell him what I discovered, he held me and told me he loved me and that it was probably fine and that I should make a doctor appointment to have it checked out. Instead of waiting, I decided that I would take advantage of having a Planned Parenthood a block away from where we live. He offered to come with me and after telling him no at first, he offered again and I took him up on it.

Before I continue, I must say that I loved the staff at this Planned Parenthood. I didn't feel judged or uncomfortable and they were just so helpful and nice to me.

Anyway... Genital warts. I didn't cry when the doctor told me about it, but I did when she answered my question about him probably being exposed to it, especially since we don't use condoms. She answered all of my questions: ""Is there anyway to estimate how long they have been there?"" (""Not really, but with how small a lot of these are it really could only have been a couple days"") ""Would this have shown on an STD screening?"" (""No."") When asked if I wanted to start treatment on them, I decided to go for it and have them frozen. 

Let me tell you, not fun. All in all, she said there were about 30 of them, most of them small and I had them near my anus as well. As she lit my bits on fire with q-tips, I thought about how I would tell my boyfriend when I went back out to the waiting room and how he might react. I had been in there awhile and he was probably worried. The doctor had given me a piece of paper with information on genital warts with treatment options and info on how to protect your partner. Essentially, there is a good chance that he now has this strain of HPV in his system (if he didn't already have it before, who knows?). Until mine clear up, it is best to use condoms to reduce risk and to help mine go away even faster. 

As we walk out of Planned Parenthood, he asks me what was up. I handed him the paper the doctor had given me and he glanced through it. I told him that I asked if this would have been something that would show up on a screening and what her answer was and that he was most likely been exposed.

His response? ""No big deal, honey. I love you."" And cue giant fears just  flying away. While he was in the waiting room, he read a ton of pamphlets, including one on genital warts, so he already had a lot of the facts when I told him.

I think the biggest downside for the week about this, aside from the burning genital region, is the having to put of continuing C25K until I am healed up! I am also pretty sure bowel movement will suck for awhile as well...",4,20140425112409,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23z1oe,Would love some female friendship advice!,"Get ready for a REALLY long story /r/TwoXChromosomes. I think this might be novel length.

So I've been best friends with this girl since the day she was born. No joke, I don't remember a time in life where she wasn't there. We've always been close, but my mom hasn't ever liked her much. According to my mom, she's always been manipulative. Anecdotal evidence: we're about 6 years old, she takes my drawing I was really proud of, tears it up, gets mad at me for crying. I end up going and giving her a hug to get her to come back and play with me. Obviously we were kids, but this just demonstrates how it always is with her. She does something, I get mad, she gets mad at me for being mad, I apologize.

We attended the same middle school (6th-8th grade), and our relationship completely deteriorated. I know middle school is just a bad time in general, but this was horrendous. Any time I made a new friend, she would tell that friend something so she would stop hanging out with me. Some time between 7th and 8th grade, I stopped talking to her. Made some of my own friends, and actually had fun. Then she decided to come back, ""apologize,"" and hang out with me again. Introduced herself to my new friends, and later spread terrible rumors about me. Didn't speak to her until after middle school ended, and we had gone our separate ways for high school.

At this point, I had wanted so badly to COMPLETELY get out of that relationship. She hurt me so many times, made me cry. I would have done it too, but we attend the same church and sunday school. Anytime one of the adults or our other friends realized we weren't speaking, we would get a lecture on how we shouldn't let such a good friendship go to waste for some little thing. Not to mention our families are really close, and it would get really awkward when they came over and we didn't talk to each other. I always got talked into being friends with her again.

High school was better, didn't see her as much as I used to. Had casual conversations, and kept my guard up. She would always ask me to hang out, and I would make some excuse. During 11th grade, she sent me a huge email, apologizing for everything she had done, and asking me to forgive her. I was a little wary, but I thought that maybe she had changed, and that she deserved another chance. We started off okay. I realized she was always lying to me, but they were usually petty things, so I let them slide.

Fast forward to now, 3 years later. In my opinion (I'm not sure how valid an opinion that is, since I tend to play things as safe as possible), she has super reckless behavior: driving all over the city a day after getting her permit (got in the car with her once, within 10 minutes she had nearly hit 2 cars), going hiking in abandoned areas by herself (this especially scares me, a girl was randomly raped and murdered in that area 4 years ago), walking around the bad parts of town by herself at night, etc. She told me she constantly picks fights with her mom so she won't ask where her daughter is going when my friend wants to go somewhere her parents wouldn't approve of. About a month ago, she texted me, asking how I would react if she died. I told her my world would fall apart, because everything constantly reminds me of her.

So two weeks ago, I got really angry with her. More angry than I think I've ever been, and I don't know if I was justified in my anger. I found out that she's been not only lying to me (I wanted to go out of town, she said she would come, said her parents said she could, bailed on me as I was walking out the door, saying she just asked her parents and they said no. Just one of many events.), she's been telling her parents she's out with me when she's not, telling our friends horrible, horrible lies about me. I had a total flashback of middle school, and walked out.

This is where I may have messed up. I'm always worried with her recklessness, but I was angry too. Three days later, I called her (very rational) sister out of state and told her about her sister's behavior. I said I didn't want to rat her out, but I wanted to make sure that someone knew what was going on, especially if something happened while she said she was out with me and really wasn't. Honestly, I was scared that if something DID happen, I would regret not speaking up when I had the chance. So I'm not exactly sure what happened after I told her sister, but the next day my friend shut down her Facebook, deleted me off Instagram, and stopped replying to my texts. I thought it was funny/weird how I was the one who should've been giving her the cold shoulder for lying to/about me, but she cut me out instead.

So, did I overreact? Did I do the right thing? I'm honestly exhausted with dealing with her, and I have no interest in rekindling our friendship. What should I do?

TL;DR: Bad relationship with lifelong bff, she constantly lied, I got mad and tried to get outside help, may have royally fucked up.

Also, I forgot to add that even when we were on good terms, she would randomly stop speaking to me for weeks at a time. When she would come back and I asked her what happened, she'd just say it was personal. Once though, she told me her mom compared her to me and she got mad, so she stopped talking to me because of that.",3,20140425135514,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23ynf5,Frustrated with my body type and sex,"I will start with saying this is a rant. This is irrational frustration, and does not reflect my day-to-day state of mind. I also don't mean to offend anyone, and I'm sorry if I do, or if I sound petty or childish.

Ok, my body is basically like this: 5'7"", around 145 lbs, small boobs, small waist, wide hips, big butt, thick thighs. From a fashion standpoint, I don't like it. Sexually, I sometimes love it, but most of the time I hate it.

I like having my breasts played with, complimented, you know, getting positive attention. It turns me on. But, since they're small, they don't stand out. So they sit there neglected during sex, or they receive a little attention during foreplay, almost as if it's common courtesy to acknowledge them for just a minute or two.

What is big and stands out? My butt, of course. All guys I've been with rave about my butt, they compliment it, they touch it, blah, blah blah! But it does nothing for me. It doesn't turn me on. It only makes me feel self conscious about a body part that generally is considered ugly among the collective female psyche.

The thing is, while I know communication during sex is important, I don't like asking for the attention. It just feels forced. And if a guy doesn't like my tits enough to go there on his own, then I will feel shitty forcing him to pay attention to them. It's like forcing broccoli on a child just because it's healthy, and they oblige because mommy won't let them play with their favorite toy later, when in reality they want chicken nuggets AND their toy.

My boyfriend is the same. He says he loves my body and I believe him, but that means, of course, that he likes my butt. He's always complimenting my butt, saying how he loves that it's big and my waist is tiny by comparison, etc. 

One would think he's a butt guy, but no... he's made (not really sexual) joking comments about other women's/anime characters big breasts, so I know he notices... I also remember when we were just friends hearing him talk with another friend about how some girl they both know has big boobs, and how hot they were, etc. So I know he notices, especially when they're big. However, I don't think he's a boob guy either... I like to think he's a ""I-prefer-whatever-you-bring-to-the-table(bed)"" kinda guy, because he's been with all kinds of girls... but still... my boobs feel lonely.

Anyway, I realize this is a case of ""the grass is greener"". It's petty, childish, frustrating... last night we had sex and he didn't touch my boobs, not even once. I kinda feel undesirable, with all the big boob love that society portrays and because I know he notices them. It's stupid. I know it doesn't mean anything. But I really like breast play. I know for fact that given enough love, my boobs can make me orgasm on their own. So yeah... I'm frustrated.",4,20140425113043,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_2409tv,Anyone have expirence with this? I(24f) may need to take custody of my sister. (14f) **repost from r/relationships,"Hello reddit,

I don't know if anyone can give me advice on this situation.
In the past year my sister(14f) has gone from living in CA with my mother her whole life to living with her father across the US. She has a bad past with her father, but was taken from my mom and ordered to live with her father.

Our home life was not good growing up, my mother is disabled and a drug addict. As a teen I left by choice due to being extremely depressed and her life seemed to change for the better. My sister had a much better life with my mother than I did, and I did not think I had reason to worry, because every time I went to visit things were fine and dandy. I still made it a priority to have a huge positive impact in my sisters life.

Last year it came out that my sister was depressed. She was in the hospital a couple days then required to have therapy. My mother did not follow through. At a counseling at school, it came out that our mother was using meth. I was not aware of this prior.
Long story short, my sister was briefly placed in foster care and a trial was set. My mother could not get clean and within 6 months my sister was sent to her father across the US. It's been 6 months.

The court required her father to move into a 2 bedroom from a studio, get her regular therapy, and have her in an activity she enjoys. He has done none of these. The case is closed, and there is nothing to be done because of this.
She has been in the hospital 7 times because of this. Is more suicidal and self harming. She wants to go to residential care.

I will admit that her fathers hands seem to be tied. He has tried to put her into a residential but his insurance will not cover it and he does not qualify for low income help. He is now touring a school this week that has therapy sessions any time the child needs; this school is for girls with similar issues.

He expressed to me yesterday that he does not know if he can do this anymore. He thinks she can snap out of it. He has lost his job and feels extremely frustrated that she is not willing to do her part. He mentioned possibly having the state take her.
I feel like part of that is because of his frustrations but in the back of my mind I don't know if I should make myself available. During court they would not allow her to be with me because he was a ""non offending parent.""
At the same time, I have a full time job and a toddler to raise.
Does anyone have any advice to give me?
Thank you.

I work 38.5 hours a week, I'm in school and I suffer from severe emotional issues. I'm in a dead end job, barely making enough to support us, and beyond a roof over our heads and occasional babysitting, I have no familial support.

I love my son. It breaks my heart that I can't provide for him the way I feel I should. I am always so exhausted. I read to him, I play with him, but I'm definitely not entirely enthusiastic about it. I try to be, I really try.

t3_240rbx,I hope you ladies can give me some advice on getting an IUD,"I am 20 years old and currently on the Progesterone only pill (Cerazette) and am unable to take any pills containing the hormone Oestrogen as it raises my blood pressure too high.

But I hate the progesterone pill I am on at the moment! It is seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend due to it's side effects (it makes me very dry down there and lowers my sex drive!) 

I have set up an appointment with my GP to discuss getting an IUD fitted, but I wanted some advice from real women rather than listen to someone who perhaps may have never personally had the device fitted. One of my main concerns (which may be stupid) is that I have recently started weightlifting and am frightened that squats and deadlifts might dislodge the IUD as I've heard they do move tampons! 

Also on the NHS website it says the procedure is quite painful, and I'm a big wuss! 

Any advice would be amazing from all you lovely ladies! Thank you :)",2,20140426042456,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_241bc1,[RANT] My marital status has nothing to do with my ability to do my job.,"As someone who's graduating on May 10th with my M.A., I've been scouring online and offline sources for work. I'm good for my May rent but I have no idea how I'm going to pay my other bills or anything past that. I found what I thought was the perfect summer job. I contacted the individual, and the first thing they asked me is my marital status. Not about my education or other qualifications-- my fucking marital status. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! What the HELL does that have to do with my ability to work?! 

Luckily I've since found another (more promising) prospect, (I have an interview on monday!) but I'm seriously so pissed about this. Is it even legal?!

**Edit:** Huge thanks to everyone who responded. I do indeed, live in Connecticut, where it is illegal to ask these types of questions, and I will be informing them of this. Ironically, I am 23, single, and do not have any plans (ever) to get pregnant or have my own children. ",242,20140426105021,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_241abo,I want to learn how to be happy alone.,"Almost 3 months ago, I broke up with my long term boyfriend after he was arrested for assaulting me in front of a police officer (yes, shamefully that’s what it took for me to leave after years of abuse, but that’s another story). For the first few weeks I felt surprisingly good, but then reality kicked in and I began to feel the full impact of being alone. The court date is coming up and recently I’ve been feeling totally shitty, so yesterday in order to try and cheer myself up I got in the car and drove 100 miles to the beach, with the intention of having a nice long walk and then exploring a nearby town, which is the kind of thing I used to do with my ex all the time. It just wasn’t the same though, and after walking around on my own I ended up standing in the rain, staring into the sea and crying. I can’t shake the feeling that nothing is worth doing if I can’t share it with someone, and walking along the beach where everyone else was with a partner or a group of friends or even just a dog, made me feel 100 times more sad and alone.

The fact is, I have nobody to share things with or socialise with at the moment - I ended up very isolated in my relationship, my family are several hours drive away, I love my job but my colleagues are almost exclusively men who are old enough to be my father and I can’t get a dog because of my living situation. I’m working on meeting new people, but in the meantime I want to learn how to enjoy myself without feeling like I need somebody else to be there. I love exploring new places but the idea of doing it alone always seems to be so much better than the reality.",54,20140426103605,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_241stk,Question from a (hopefully) future female scientist.,"I am a senior in high school and next year I am going to a science and engineering based university to study biology and math. I've been interest in science since I was a little kid, and decided I wanted to go into biology when I was in 7th grade.  

I've never really felt like I was discouraged from math or science. Maybe looking back on it I was one of the few girls to speak up in a science classroom, but I didn't really notice it at the time. I've had many amazing teachers who encouraged me to keep doing what I loved. I've also had some teachers who would tell me that I wasn't doing well, but that was more often dues to stress or lack of organization, my gender was never viewed as a predictor of my success.
My friends are mostly male. There are a few girls, but the guys do overwhelm the group. Pretty much all of us are either on a science or math team, or robotics, or are programmers, most often a combination. Once again, the fact that I am a girl never seems to be a major factor in our interactions. I am never looked down on for my abilities, nor do I ever feel as if I am being valued more for the way I look and dress rather than for my personality and intellect, I have also never noticed any of the other girls being treated that way. This is regardless of whether or not those girls are in a relationship.  
Next year I am going to be a biology major at Rochester Institute of Technology. I was fairly excited, not just about the fact that I am actually going to be have the chance to actually study biology, but also because of the atmosphere of the school I'm going to. I felt fully prepared to go to a school that was focused on science and engineering, had a high male to female ration, and was also kind of weird and nerdy, because that's what I'm used to. But lately I've been worrying about the fact that I may have a more difficult time there because I AM a girl who is going into a male dominated field (    maybe not so much in biology, but definitely in math). 
I've always been considered smart, but sometimes the combination of anxiety and not being very organized can get in my way. I am very passionate about what I do. Sometimes I will not understand something as quickly as everyone else does, but I will keep trying until I catch up. I'm one of those people who, if I want to achieve something, will put all of my energy into it. And I want to become a biologist. It's something that has been my dream for a long time now, and something I have always been working toward. But I'm worried that once I get into college I will be considered as someone who is less than everyone else because I am a girl, and I am not close enough to ""the best of the best"" to be deemed an exception to the rule. 

Questions:
Should I expect to be treated differently in college?
How?
Is it still common for women to be looked down upon in the scientific community?
Are students more likely to treat me differently or professors?
Is there a way to react to this/prove that I am just as capable?
Any other advice?  

tl;dr I've been interested in science for a long time and never really felt that being female effected my ability to become a scientist in the future. Going to a science and engineering school next year (RIT, if anyone has school specific advice, that would be nice too). I'm wondering what should I expect from college, or should I expect anything.",12,20140426142015,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24129d,HPV. Feeling bad. Help?,"Well, actually, I have two conflicting opinions from two different physicians about my HPV status. I'll explain. 

My ex boyfriend had a genital wart apparently before we met. He informed me of this, and had been treated and had no symptoms by the time we were dating. I also was fully vaccinated with Gardasil, and my doctor told me that my odds of contracting warts was basically nil. 

 One year after breaking up with my then boyfriend, I notice a tiny, tiny bump on my labia that I saw dermatologist twice about. She examined me thoroughly and said that it was not HPV (a wart) and to calm down. 

The tiny bump disappeared in a week, but before then I had taken a photo of it. When I went in for my annual exam with my gynecologist, I showed him the photo and he said it was HPV. He then examined me and said that yep, it was gone, but he still maintains it was ""probably"" HPV because of my history with my ex. 

There is nothing there to take a biopsy now. It's driving me crazy. I've been with my current boyfriend for over a year and he has no signs of anything. I feel terrible about this, and bad about myself. Any advice? What did I do? I can't get clarity with a diagnosis. ",13,20140426083649,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_241i8x,How do I trust my boyfriend?,"First off, I'd like to say that this is going to be really confusing. I don't know where else to post this but since you ladies are really intelligent I thought you could help me. 

We have been dating for 16 months, I'm 18 and he's 17. I do love him a lot and that's why I need to fix this. 

It's starting to seem like it's all in my head.. Everything that I *think* he does, or I *think* he lies about since I haven't found actual proof. However, with that being said, I still get very upset to the point where I have thought of suicide (that's a whole different problem I need to fix).

I think he does a variety of things that I fear, such as flirting with girls, cheating, to name a few. However, as stated before, I don't have evidence but I **still** feel like he does this and I don't know why. There are points in time where I know he doesn't and I'm confident in our relationship, and then there are points in time where I think I *know* he does what I fear. It constantly changes from those two thoughts. 

I get really sad all the time thinking about the stuff I think I *know* he does and as of the last 5-6 months, I've been continually in a ""fog"" of sadness or something. All we do is fight, I'm guessing because of me, and I want it to stop but I don't know how. 

I accuse him constantly of doing things. There is no end to it. At that time, sometimes it lasts more than a few days, I believe that he does what I have accused him of doing (without no **real** evidence- just the stuff I come up with) and I begin to sort of hate him. I've done this countless times in our relationship. When I do accuse him and we get into arguments, I break up with him and I get into this sort of phase where I say terrible things to him- that I know if someone said to me, I'd be devastated, so I know how he feels- and I'm fully aware of it. It takes me a while to cool down and after that I regret everything. He forgives me because he feels like we can eventually be happy together, which I want to. I want to stop this, I don't wan to do this anymore and I want to treat him right because he deserves it, not the way I have been treating him. He has so much hope for our future whereas I don't. He sticks by me and supports me because he loves me so much and wants me to be happy. He has done so much for me whereas I have not.

I want to fix this twox, but I don't know how. So please help me. Any advice is appreciated. 

Side note, I can't afford a therapist, I'm currently living in a women's shelter (another different story).

BUT it's important to make the best of the situation in order to be happy in life! Still, I have trouble with it sometimes.

Today I had plans to meet a friend and my boyfriend of 2 years was meeting his friends. We did the ""catch up with you afterwards"" parting which I understood as ""after we do the socializing we'll hang out but we haven't decided what we're doing yet"". I get in touch when I'm finished with coffee to see if I should join him or wait and see him later, only to be told that he's now made plans to have a guys night. Of course since he's polite he asks if I'd like to join, but doesn't specify which friends. I decline, saying that it wouldn't be a guys night if I was there, to which he replies that he ""might"" check in with me after whatever. Ok, fine so our tentative plans are cancelled. 

It wouldn't be SO bad if we hadn't discussed moving in together earlier and (despite him initiating the talk) he said that he would move in if he didn't have anywhere else but right now he liked his flatmates. Ok, so I'm second choice. I would prefer it to be more that he WANTED to move in than was forced to by homelessness, but what the hell. 

I dunno if this is more of a rant. Most of the time it's great. We're supposed to be doing something tomorrow, so I get to see him but... I feel like I'm the fall back guy. ",0,20140426132458,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_242rlj,[Update] On my academic job search and hiding the fact that I'm a mom... [venting] tl;dr - I landed my dream job.,"[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1kgtc0/on_my_academic_job_search_and_hiding_the_fact/)

**OP tl;dr** Last fall, I had a heart-to-heart with my most trusted mentor about what might be holding me back from landing a tenure-track academic position. He gave me two pieces of advice: (1) ""Remove all traces of your family status from your CV, webpage, and social networking profiles""; and (2) ""replace one of your letter writers"".

I wanted to update because I received so many kind PM's and replies to my original post. I was really frustrated and venting to you wonderful ladies (and gents!) was incredibly cathartic and gave me a lot of strength of resolve. 

I am delighted to say that the job search this round was a complete 180 from previous years. I followed my mentor's advice and replaced one of my letter writers and removed all traces of family status. I was invited to 5 interviews at R1 research institutions and received 3 job offers, one of which was from my top choice school. 

In the end, I think that removing my family status helped me, which is a bit annoying, but a reality. I also think replacing the ""meh"" letter writer helped even more. As one of my mentors said: ""*The application gets the department interested, the letter writers land you the interview, and your interview lands you the job*"". 

In times where the competition is fierce and there are 100+ applicants for each position, I think that every little thing that can set you apart from other applicants, as to be done. I still received a quite a few rejections this round, BUT I ultimately landed the job I wanted. I am feeling tremendously fortunate and excited and happy.

Now I need to think of creative ""thank you!!"" presents for mentors and letter writers. Any suggestions? ",77,20140426213550,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_242l7m,[TW] I just had one of the scariest experiences of my life,"I'm so shaken up right now and I don't know what to do. I am a little stressed out from finals so I tried to smoke pot out in the field. I have never smoked on my campus before and I therefore do not know people who smoke at my school. So, when a guy came up to me and asked me to sit with him and his friend, I enthusiastically agreed because naive me wanted to make friends. He said that he wasn't smoking because he got in trouble with the school.

He started touching me on my arm and one arm hugging me. He told me that he and his friend were from Mongolia and lived in a dormitory that has lots of transfer students. I asked him if he was a transfer student as well. He said that he and his friend were. When we sat down, he started touching my leg, slowly making it up my thigh. High me kind of noticed it, but still kept talking to him. He asked me if I had a boyfriend,  I said yes and that it was long-distance. He said, ""So he isn't here."" His friend sniggered and I said, ""Well yeah.""

In that moment, I realized how huge he was. He looked about six feet and three inches, and I am 5'2"". He reached out and grabbed the back of my head. I froze. 

""So you won't mind if I do this?"" He forcefully tried to kiss me while his hand went to my crotch, but never made it because I stood up. I said I had to leave and I bolted out of there. If there wasn't this event going on near by with about fifty people, I don't think I would have been able to leave.

t3_242kej,What girls do.,"Welp, I have a question. I feel a bit silly asking, but I feel like I've missed out on a lot.

**Girls, what do you do when you're alone?**

I've spent almost the entirety of my adult(ish) life in relationships.
There seems to be the unhealthy pattern of spending too much time together too fast and then sort of becoming inseparable. I've been so dependent on other people, that I've found myself going from partner to partner. **I don't know how to be alone.** I don't want it to be that way!

For the first time, I, a 24 year old woman, am alone. I live with my parents (who stay out of my way, for the most part), but this is the first time I've spent significant time without a partner.

And ... I don't know what to do with myself. It's not even that I have to ""relearn"" how to be alone ... because I really haven't ever been! What do you do? 

Even if you're not single, I suppose most healthy relationships still have ""alone time"". What do you during alone time? How do you fill your days? What are your hobbies? How often do you see friends or go out? What fun dorky things do you do to entertain yourself? 

Right now, I fill the ""void"" (I need to change my perspective- **it isn't about filling a void, its about enjoying alone time!**) by mindlessly and compulsively switching between reddit and facebook, watching Bob's Burgers, and occasionally reading. 

But *I catch myself looking at the time, thinking ""augh, its still so early. What am I going to do until it's time to sleep?"" That's not healthy!*

When does this change? Does it get easier over time? Do I have to make a conscious effort to push myself? 

Anyway, I'm going to Whole Foods now to get desert by myself. I want to get out of the house and enjoy myself. Wish me luck!",21,20140426200014,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

* dizzyness

* foggy/blurry tunnel vision

* syncope all day

* tingly fingers and toes

* feeling like my ears are full of wax

I do have mild to moderate asthma and panic disorder, but I have been masterbating since 6th grade and have always had these symptoms with it. I didn't have a problem with panic attacks until 9th grade, so I don't think its anxiety-related except for the fact that my anxiety does get worse  after due to the side-effects. I am carefully not to hold my breath and breathe regularly. It doesn't take me long to orgasm, so I know that I am not over-exerting myself... And I don't get any of these symptoms when I orgasm from sex.

t3_242261,I can't handle my boyfriend's negativity...,"Hi ladies, I was originally going to post this in relationships, but you guys just seem like a much more understanding group to me...

So my boyfriend and I have been together a little over a year and a half, (we're both in high school) and he was never this negative! He's always been a bit childish, but now it's gotten to the point where I don't want to bring him places or hang out with him anymore because he just mopes around. At school I don't want to be near him, and this makes him more negative, because I can't handle it! I've tried asking him what's wrong or whats going on/why he feels like this, but he always has an excuse about his parents making him feel like that.

For example, my friends and I went to hang out at a pool place one night and within 30 minutes of getting there he is sitting in the corner by himself sighing and moping. I'm trying to have a good time so I try talking to him and say, ""Hey, I invited you along so you could get your mind off of things, why don't you play some pool and try to forget about it for awhile?"" And he got mad and told me he ""didn't want to talk about it."" And pouted for hours until I took him home.

Another time he was struggling in math and my friend offered to help him with his homework and my boyfriend said, ""Well it doesn't matter anyways, I'm just gonna screw it up and fail."" This is a regular thing in school.

I want to go to college, he doesn't. I've told him multiple times this is a deal breaker for me, it's the way I was raised and I'm sticking with it. He doesn't take school as seriously as I do.

I can't handle this amount of negativity! I've talked to him about it so many times, and he doesn't change it, no matter what. I'm currently going to therapy and taking medication for depression and anxiety, so I'm trying to figure my own stuff out right now without his negativity and extreme clingyness (sending me 4+ messages in 10 minutes when I haven't responded because of whatever reason, missing me right when we get home from school, wanting to hang out ALL THE TIME, I like my alone time :( ...)

So my SO and I have been trying to look into different forms of birth control. Neither of us are a fan of condoms, so she has been on the pill recently (don't know the brand off-hand), but we both agree that we need to find something else. She has tried multiple brands at the moment, and all of them have had serious negative effects - ranging from impacting her libido and period to mood itself. We've talked about it, and basically, while she does agree to stay on it until we find a better alternative, we both are in search of the easiest and safest method possible with as little an impact on our relationship and selves.

We've also looked into the those implants (like implanon) and it looks like they often share side effects with the pill. At least she wouldn't have to take a pill every night, but it's still a serious consideration.

t3_242wto,How do you deal with street harassment?,"Tonight, my boyfriend and I were on our first date in a long time. I was wearing a cute short skirt and some asshole driving by yelled ""Nice skirt!"" at me - obviously he could have been a lot more vulgar but I think we all know what he meant. My boyfriend was very upset and angry at the guy and he kept apologizing for that happening and asking me if I was okay.

I think he was more upset about it than I was because I've been dealing with this for years just like any woman and I'm sort of... well, I'm not numb to it, but I try to be - otherwise my entire day would be ruined every time it happened. But my significant other was really bothered by it and I could tell he was upset about it for the rest of our date.

Which lead me to want to ask, how do you cope with street harassment? How do you not let it get you down, or not feel ashamed when it happens, or not have it ruin your whole day/night? I know that this is a problem I'll always have to deal with as a woman and I just wonder how on earth I can manage to cope when it happens and not just want to break down and cry.

t3_244mj4,"One week ago, I donated my ova anonymously to an infertile couple. This is my experience. (Quite long)","Before I begin, I will disclose a bit about myself:
I am a twenty-one-year-old soon-to-be university graduate of philosophy and public health, living in the Pacific Northwest U.S., working as a concierge, a maid, a tutor, and a sales associate before I enter graduate school. As someone with an interest and background in ethics as it relates to public health and other areas of social justice, the controversy of choice has always astounded me. I consider all decisions related to conception and childbirth to be of the parents' sole preferences provided that the decisions will not compromise the health of the mother or the total well-being of the child after he/she is born. I am pro-motherhood-by-choice, not motherhood-by-chance.
After having researched infertility and the demand for healthy, educated ova donors, I decided that I wanted to become one. The idea of helping strangers in such a personal way fascinated me. 

The application process:
In November 2013, I applied to a local fertility clinic to become a donor The paper application asked all about my individual and family health history, my education and work experience, my interests, and required that I submit photographs of myself as an infant, young child, adolescent, and of how I currently look. Within a week of submitting my application, the clinic's donor coordinator informed me that they would like for me to be an egg donor and asked me to come in for an interview and physical.
At this appointment I met with two different medical staff: one of whom was a nurse practitioner who performed a full physical and ultrasound, asked about my reasons for wanting to become an egg donor, and explained to me the whole donation process. Another member of the medical staff drew my blood for a Counsyl genetic test and for sexually transmitted diseases. I was informed that I would have to go off my oral birth control medication for two months before they could assess my base hormone levels. Three months go by fine and dandy (having sex relatively infrequently and always using a barrier method of protection), and I go back to the clinic for my follow-up appointment for the aforementioned testing. I learn immediately after my ultrasound that all my anatomy looks good, and a few days later they inform me that my hormone levels are normal. At this point, I am asked to submit a description of myself, my sister, and both of my parents to add to my donor profile. Once this process is completed, I was officially added to the donor registry, accessible only by prospective ova recipients through the clinic's donor coordinator. Included in the profile were the descriptions, my ethnicity, height, weight, education level, high school GPA, blood type, and a picture of me as an infant. Since I had the option to include an adult photo, I gave them one, as I look quite different than in my baby picture! Within three weeks, I was informed that a couple was interested in using me as their egg donor.

Preparing for donation:
From the phone call informing me of my having been picked up to the date of my ova retrieval, the entire process took roughly three and a half weeks. 
On the first appointment, I went in for another ultrasound and blood draw and was taught about my medication administration. The medications for the first two weeks were HcG and Follistim; by the third week I incorporated Ganirelix into the routine; two days before the scheduled retrieval, I took a trigger medication. In addition to these, I was required to drink 4 8 fl. oz. drinks of Nuun/water mixture; 3 whey protein shakes, and 4 8 fl. oz. glasses of water. I had to keep exercise to a bare minimum, refrain from using any drugs or alcohol, refrain from sex entirely, and was told to expect bloating and frequent urination. From the day I started my medications, I had to return to the clinic every two days for an ultrasound (in order to monitor my ova growth) and blood draw (in order to test my estrogen level.) Once I had multiple ova above 18mm diameter and the rest of my ova above 12mm, I was advised to give myself the trigger medication and stop using the other medications. On the final appointment, I signed all of the legal paperwork, and that was it before the retrieval!

The retrieval procedure:
My retrieval was set for 8:45 am two days after I administered my trigger medication. I was not allowed to ingest any food or liquid past midnight the day prior and could not wear makeup, perfume, deodorant, nail polish, or be near anyone who smoked the morning of the retrieval, as the eggs are extremely sensitive. Additionally, I was required to arrange for someone to drive me to the clinic, take me back home, and stay with me for the duration of the day. I asked my boyfriend to do this for me, as he has been extremely supportive of my decision all along and wanted to be there for me in whatever way he could. 
We arrived at the clinic an hour early, so my boyfriend and I were taken to what would be my recovery room. I removed all of my clothing (minus my knee-high socks for comfort and sass) and put on a surgical gown, booties, and a hair net. I waited with my boyfriend in the room on the bed covered in very warm blankets (I assumed to dilate my blood vessels?) until it came time to speak with the anesthesiologist. He turned out to be an incredibly sweet, caring, and soft-spoken young guy who double-checked that I had no allergies then brought me into the surgical room. At this point my boyfriend was asked to leave, so he wandered outside the building in wait for a call from a nurse to come retrieve me. The surgical procedure happened very quickly. I was asked by a nurse to sit on an odd surgical table with padded stirrups that locked my legs in. The anesthesiologist asked if I wanted to listen to anything on Pandora, as it was ""[my] day,"" which completely comforted and me and reminded me that what I was doing was a really good thing. Shortly thereafter, he placed an IV into my arm, administered a pain medicine, which immediately made me feel woozy. After, an oxygen mask was placed over my face, and I had to take big breaths. Within about five seconds, the anesthesia was injected into my IV, and I was asleep. The next thing I remember, I was back in the recovery room wrapped in a warm blanket on that same bed. My throat felt dry so I began to cough, which prompted a nurse to come in and check on me. She gave me treats and a drink, helping me as needed. I was instructed to continue to lay down for another half an hour or more, however long I desired. At this point, I really only felt slightly woozy, like I had just awoken from a long daytime nap--only a little abdominal cramping. After the half hour, the same nurse helped me get dressed into the pajamas I had brought and called my boyfriend to come back for me. I was provided a discharge sheet for my recovery instructions, given a check for my donation, thanked warmly, and off I went with my boyfriend.

The recovery: 
I was told to expect some vaginal bleeding, abdominal cramping, and lethargy for the rest of the day. I didn't experience much of the first two--certainly less than what I would experience during a normal period--but I was extremely tired, so I slept for the duration of the day. The next day, I was back at work with no symptoms beyond bloating. For the next week, up until today, I continued with the protein/water/Nuun routine as advised. And today, as I was told to anticipate, I began my period with a heavier than normal flow. Bloating has gone away, and I feel just as I did before I started the treatment.

Side Effects: 
I was nervous at first about injecting myself every day, twice a day with my medications, but it was actually easy and mostly painless. I bruised something fierce at the injection sites (in my belly fat) and could feel little lumps beneath the area, but that was it, really. Bloating was the only symptom I experienced, which I am told was a result of my having followed the supplemental nutrition routine.

My Overall Impression:
Through the entire process, all of the clinic's administrative and medical staff made me feel welcome, appreciated, and really quite human. Any questions that I had they answered promptly and made my health, safety, and well-being their number 1 concern. At my last appointment prior to retrieval, they even gave me a present for ""being so accommodating and sweet"" throughout the process, which included a thank you card signed by all of the staff that I worked with, a giant NY Times best-selling cookbook, cupcake tins, an an apron. Beyond that, the medication administration really wasn't that bad. The only negative aspect of the entire process was the time commitment, but that was to be expected. I am glad that the donation was anonymous, but I cannot help but want to know a little about the couple as well as whether the donation results in a viable pregnancy. Nevertheless, I regard this as one of the biggest and most rewarding decisions of my life and I would gladly do this again.

I hope that my story helps anyone who may be considering donating her ova, any infertile women thinking about trying IVF, or anyone who's just curious about the whole process. I am happy to answer any questions that you may have. 

Thank you for listening!

t3_243yn6,"A little rant, a little ""Am I wrong for feeling this way?""","Last night I was at a concert (there's a huge music festival going on in my city, it's a lot of fun) and the last band of the night on one of the smaller stages was this bluesy rock band, they were loud and amazing. Some acquaintances of mine were getting a little rowdy and started moshing. No big deal, I'm short and tucked away into the crowd. A couple of my guy friends jumped in and then right back out, just to participate, they got a kick out of being a part of a mosh pit for a little bit. 

I was clearly staying away from the pit, turning my back and bracing if they got too close. I'm barely 5'5"", I had a dress on, and a backpack with my things, including my nice DSLR. It was obvious (or so I thought) that I did not want to get into the pit.

Most of my friends are guys, I have a ton of friends here, this town is great, but I tend to be more relaxed with the guys, I bike around town with a small group of dudes, it's whatever. So I get that they see me as one of the guys. 

At one point I'm being pushed, so I push back thinking it was just someone making their way into the pit. Then I realize that I'm specifically being pushed, by one of my guy friends, into the mosh pit, another friend of our laughs and joins him. I shouted out, ""No, stop!"" and try to dig my heels in. One of them alone are definitely stronger than me, both are taller than me, and with both of them pushing me I definitely have no control. I grab whatever I can, in this instance it's a fellow concert goer, he's tall and built like a brick wall so he doesn't move, I can feel my hand grabbing his arm HARD. He turns and sees me, I shouted ""I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"" and he sees I'm being pushed and goes, ""It's all good!"" A girl next to one of my friends grabs my hand and pulls me to an empty spot next to her. She in an angel and later when one of my guy friends popped up behind us, she made sure it was someone I knew and not just some lurking guy. I need to find her again and buy her flowers or something, she was awesome.

So I am pissed at my two friends. They thought it was a joke. But I know they would have NEVER done that to any of the other girls in our group, just me. I want to talk to them and tell them why what they did was simply not ok. They don't realize how hard they were pushing me. That pit was made of a bunch of dude rowdy dudes, they can handle getting beat on by each other, but I'm shorter and weaker than them. I was pretty tired by the end of the night, and had had a couple beers earlier, so I was relaxed and I know I wouldn't have been about to keep my footing. 

I felt really threatened, I usually feel safe hanging out with guys, if we bike at night I have 3-4 dudes with me, but last night they breached that trust and sense of security. Am I wrong or going overboard in feeling this way?",67,20140427104530,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I've made some changes!

t3_244ja4,First time shaving,"Hi! Hope these kind of posts are welcome, because I need a bit of advice! 

Unnecessary backstory because I need to vent a bit (skip past this paragraph for actual question): 

Summer is coming quickly and soon it's gonna be too hot to wear jeans. Here's the thing: I'm 16, and I've never shaved. There's a couple reasons for that. Firstly, I'm a bit of a late bloomer and my body hair really isn't that thick. This ties into the bigger reason, which is that my mom doesn't support me shaving. She's awfully traditional and European, she never wears makeup, she's never had her nails done, and she certainly doesn't want her baby daughter to start shaving! It took until last summer for me to convince her to at least buy me some waxing strips or something. She's fine with waxing, but I'm kinda tired of it and just want to shave like everybody else. That's why I'm turning to you gals for some motherly advice! 

I've bought myself a Venus Embrace razor and it came with one cartridge. It wasn't the cheapest thing, but I wanted to get myself something that I hope is high quality. Now what I have no clue about is how many times can I use the cartridge? Is it usable only once? From what I gather, you can reuse it a few times, but I'm worried about overusing it. 

In addition, my friends have talked about how washing your legs with conditioner before shaving does wonders. How exactly does that work? Do I wash my legs, then dry them off, then just shave? Or do I shave my legs with the conditioner still on? And do I put moisturiser on afterwards?

I was upfront about the fact that I am asexual from the start, but it's created a mismatch in sex thats been a problem for a while.  Not wanting kids came out later (as it would), and everytime it has come up, he'd be annoyed that I was making a decision on that so early.

We hit a rough patch a couple months ago, caused by my inability to support him in the ways he needed (we're mostly long-distance, but I don't drive, which creates a lot of strain).  We've tried to work on things, and they were seeming to improve.

He is my rock and probably my best friend of anyone.  On Thursday, he told me that he didn't think it was going to work out.  Given that it was in class at the time, I thought I took it okay.  I wanted to go no-contact, but ultimately decided to keep speaking with him, as he had a change of heart on his decision about 12 hours later.

In the discussion we had, it transpires that he thinks that my not not wanting kids (and not wanting to budge on that), and not enjoying sex (I know it is possible for asexuals to enjoy sex; thus far, I'm not one of them) is an indication that I'm refusing to change and clearly just want to be alone for the rest of my life.

I don't know if I should go back to try and fix things again (or if he'd even be willing).  I don't want to feel like I'm lying the whole time, but I also don't want to be lonely for the rest of my life.  Outside of him, I don't really have any close friends.

t3_244elo,Birth Control Pill Recommendations Please,"
I'm considering going on birth control and would like to hear your recommendations on what has worked for you with minimal side effects so when I go into my OBGYN I have done some research and can have an educated discussion. I am really only interested in the pill (for probably paranoid reasons I'm sure but I'm sticking to my guns on just pills). Background info below if it helps.

I'm 23 and have never been pregnant but my biggest dream in life is to be a mother. I am so nervous about birth control taking that away from me (don't know why, just am) so I would like some suggestions from women who have had children after being on the pill if possible. I also am not interested in pills that you only have 4 periods a year for this reason. It just seems like its not so good for your body. (Not meant to be judgy. I would just be really paranoid about it for myself.)

I only have one ovary. A little over a year ago I found out (painfully btw) that I had a dermoid tumor on my left ovary which had cut off blood supply damaging it beyond repair. This all adds to my over protection of the ovary/eggs I do have left. I am not on any hormone supplements (the body is a weird but wonderful thing) and have had a regular fluid filled cyst already on my right ovary.

I have always prided myself on not being an emotional person so pills with little to no emotional swing side effects would be awesome--though I know each pill effects each person differently. Minimal weight gain would also be much appreciated.

TL;DR-- Ladies on Birth Control Pills. What has worked for you and why do you like it? What should I really stay away from? What are good questions to ask my OBGYN?",0,20140427134755,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_245i6w,Helping my daughter deal with the fact she's so tall,"My daughter recently turned 13. She's very tall (about 5'8), and will likely grow a good deal taller. She wears size 11 women's shoes, which suggests that she'll end up right around 6 feet.

She is fine with herself as far as most of her self image goes; she's intelligent, athletic, has plenty of friends, etc and she knows her strengths.... but the fact that she's so tall and will almost certainly get taller bothers her. She has said (quite often and with increasing frequency), ""I hate that I'm so tall"" / ""I don't want to be tall"" / ""I wish I wasn't so tall""/etc. The feet thing bothers her quite a bit, too, especially now that it's harder to find shoes. Didn't help that the sales rep suggested she look at the men's shoes....but I digress. 

Of course, I think she's beautiful no matter what... but I'm biased and she knows it because I freely admit to my bias.

Of course, as a typical Dad, my thinking is, ""There's not a whole hell of lot you can do about that, so why are you complaining? Make the most of it! Hell, it's why you're first string on the volleyball team!"".... but she's a 13 year old girl having body issues. I know that's not a particularly *helpful* response.

So, women of reddit that went through something similar..... What things did people do our say that made things better for you at that age? What things did people do or say that made things worse for you at that age? Any advice for me in general?

It's not that I don't care about my grades, or that I don't want to be in school. I am going into social work and want to focus my work on children with mental illnesses and autism. I am very passionate in learning about this field, but not so passionate about going to class, writing papers and studying. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've fought depression and anxiety for some time and tried several medications. My depression hasn't been so bad as of late so I have not been taking any medications (most medications have done terrible things to my sleep habits). I also work 24-30 hours a week at Walmart and suffer from Crohn's disease, which often leaves in me in pain and very very fatigued when my symptoms are at their worst. 

I cannot keep doing this. It's finals week and I put off so much of my school work that I had to call off work for a day just to do papers and assignments I slacked on. It's like I torture myself with this shit and fucking hate myself for it. I want to do well in school, but can't make my lazy ass get up and go to class, or write my papers, or study for the tests.

I seriously need to fix this problem and I don't even know where to begin. My entire academic life my parents and especially grandparents have pressured me to do well and shamed me when I came up with anything below a B and I feel like that has something to do with it. 

If any of you girls have been in a situation like this before, how did you get out? I have no desire to drop out of school, transfer or change majors. I am happy with all that, but have the hardest time motivating myself to do well and I feel worthless. Thanks girls. ",33,20140427160054,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_245stc,Job Interview! Yay!,"I just have to share because I'm both terrified and beyond ecstatic. An airline gave me a call about a flight attendant position I applied for. 

After struggling for years with health issues and being unable to work, and then the inability to get calls back because gaps in employment history looks bad, but they called me back! I love customer service, I love travel, and I all around love people. I know they get so many applicants and I may not even stand a chance at the job, buy my gosh they called me back! I answered some basic questions about how I'd handle some situations with people. After all that jazz they said they'd like to schedule a phone interview with a senior rep. I have no idea what to expect or if I'll sound stupid but my gosh I'm stoked. I apologize for the poor grammar I'm just giddy. I could just squeal.

t3_244xoh,I started taking birth control today and I am SO HAPPY.,"I've known since I was twelve that I never wanted children. My family is conservative, so I was never really able to tell my mom that I wanted to  be on birth control. Over the years, being on BC became this great thing that I would have *someday*, and be a real adult (ha!), and finally be able to have sex (after a couple pregnancy scares in my teenage years, I decided to be abstinent until I was on the pill). 

I also had no clue how to go about getting birth control, but it turned out to not even be an issue- last year I started getting acne, and it steadily got worse until I finally went to the clinic to get it looked at last month. The awesome doctor put me on tretinoin, and so I was actually *required* to be on birth control. I didn't even have to ask for it. I picked up my first pill box that afternoon. So easy! Awesome! I was told to wait until the first sunday after my next cycle, and so for the first time I was actually looking forward to getting my period. I took the first pill today, and I have a year's worth of prescriptions... it was (almost) worth dealing with acne just for this.   
I just had to tell someone. :) It feels so good to cross this off my list. ",17,20140427171229,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_245v6o,"What are your experiences as a female gamer, if you are one? A lot of my fellow girl gamers seem to get harassed quite a bit...","So I really hope this doesn't come off as gender-generalizing or inducing drama... I believe this is a legitimate issue. A lot of female gamers get harassed online either through private messaging or chat forums on the gaming sites - particularly RPG games. It feels like women are blamed for ""being beautiful"" and that they should like the harassment because they are getting attention. The most disturbing thing about the harassment of women online to me personally is when it's a minor. I was 17, a minor in Texas, and I posted that very clearly on my profile of a gaming site I had joined. Men in their 30's were still messaging me saying ""Hey beautiful, what's up?"" I was 17 years old, and hounded by mysterious guys much older than me. One guy from India kept trying to get me to marry him. I don't care if they are ""trolling."" It is harassment, and it makes me really uncomfortable to play online games anymore which sucks because I love gaming! I have gotten some obscene messages in my inbox before, as a 17 year old girl, and I still get them now. I guess I just wonder if any other female gamers on here have experienced this, and what were their thoughts on the matter?

I want to make a note now: I do NOT believe for one second that all men are out to prey on women in the gaming community. I just think it happens a lot more than it should - and I believe it is related to the way people view women, and I wanted to hear others' thoughts on it. ",6,20140427234026,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

The other week I was doing a project with some people I don't normally interact with and one of the women asked how many kids I have. I said something like ""oh I don't have any, I'm only 24, not ready yet"" and they all LAUGHED at me. One was like ""please I had my first kid when I was 16."" Ok that's great for you and all but I'm a little too old now to have my first kid at 16, and how does that even apply to me? Am I some kind of old hag for not having kids yet? 

I usually say I just want to be financially stable before I have children and of course EVERY PERSON EVER has to say ""oh you'll never be able to afford kids so you might as well just have them."" Wtf? I'm barely scraping by right now. My boyfriend and I don't make much more than minimum wage and are staying with his parents to save up for a house/eventual wedding. Down the line we will hopefully have better jobs and our own house. There is a huge difference in financial stability there and I am sure I will feel much better prepared to take care of a baby in the future vs. right now, where I have to juggle between paying my phone bill on time or my car insurance etc. Yet people just seem to act like it's not big deal ""might as well have one now lol you're getting old!!""

t3_245au3,"Recently lost virginity, been told I'm 'bad at sex' :/","I'm 24 years old and only lost my virginity a few months ago.

It was through casual sex with a guy who is pretty much all about the sex. However, he's respectful, we have chemistry sexually and I wanted something casual myself. I waited a long time to lose it because the right person never came along and well, needs got in the way and I decided to just do it - and he was happy to offer to do the deed.

I never bled at all the first time. Guess years of sports/gymnastics/horseriding sorted that out!  I was so grateful. Beyond that, it was sort of painful. It was actually too painful for me to let him enter me missionary style so I laid on my stomach and that felt a lot better.

We recently started having sex again. In the break between us not sleeping together for a few months, I never slept with anyone else. Now, when we had sex again, once again, found it way too painful to have sex with him on top, missionary style but we persisted anyway because I wanted to.   After we were done, we noticed BLOOD EVERYWHERE. I guess I was in pain because well, it was hurting me! 

Also whilst we were having sex, he found it really difficult to get 'inside' because I was so tense. He kept asking me if I really did want to have sex because my body was so tense/unrelaxed, it was making him feel weird as I didn't seem to be into it at all. He said I was bad at sex or maybe we didn't fit.

The thing is, I WANTED the sex. Mentally, I wanted it! I find him incredibly attractive and I was comfortable with our casual arrangement. I don't understand how I was tense and why my vagina was acting like a chastity belt against itself!

I guess I'm not very sexually experienced, even at my age. I was raised in quite a religious environment and haven't really sexually explored much.  Is this normal? Are most women tense like this? Just looking to see if anyone can relate?

t3_246dtd,I finally had some (subjectively) good news! Come have a whinge about your shitty week with me.,"I have had the worst 2 weeks.  
I travelled 9 hours to visit my FWB for a week, where I got my period on the second day. Neither of us like period sex, so there was no sex until the very last night.  
One of the nights I was there I had intense diarrhoea but I was too scared to go poop because it's a tiny unit and there were like 4 people there. I had to wait until morning.  
We had anal sex but he thrusted a bit too hard and my bhole hurt for like 3 days. The whole time we were doing it I was terrified of shitting myself because I've had fucky intestines for a few weeks.  
While I was travelling back home my ear got blocked up, and the day after I woke up with the worst flu I've had in years.  
The day after that, I was running with my dog chasing me and I crashed into a doorframe and broke & dislocated my toe.  
The antibiotics I got for the middle ear infection I ended up having gave me thrush. My FWB was home for easter and, again, we couldn't have sex because my nether regions were on fire from thrush. I tried to give him a BJ but couldn't breathe through my nose because of the flu.  
I think I scratched my clit off, it itched *so bad*.
I was having some weird pink discharge along with the thrush and nothing I read about it mentioned pink discharge. The only thing that said anything about pink discharge was implantation bleeding. Oh shit oh shit oh shit.  
I have Implanon and my FWB also pulls out so there was practically no way I could be pregnant but I was still shitting myself (figuratively, thank god).
The test arrived in the mail today and I'm not pregnant! And the thrush is clearing up! The pink was probably a bit of blood from the scratching. Finally something good.

Some background first: I'm 21 years old next week and due to vulvodynia (fixed now though!) I only stared using tampons 2 periods ago. I'm a swimming teacher so I'm in the pool 3-4 days a week either one or two times a day and I HATE wearing tampons. Over in the tampons thread someone brought up menstual cups and their amazingness. I've been skipping periods (on the Pill) in order to get away with not using tampons while at work but due to a blood disorder I have that's no good for me (my body hoards iron and it gets stored in my organs which is not good - my period gets rid of some this excess iron). 

The question/s:
Those of you that use mensrual cups, what is their effectiveness while you're in the water?
Does it leak at all?
Is it comfortable for lots of movement? (My job is very physical and I go to the gym ~4 times a week).

t3_246q8u,How do I continue to check-in on my friend who has a verbally abusive boyfriend?,"This past weekend a dear friend of mine showed up at my doorstep distraught and in tears. She is a very private girl, but also extremely sensitive, and she opened up to me a lot about her and her boyfriend's relationship. 

The gist of it is that he is very controlling, paranoid and disrespectful of my friend. When he gets angry at her, he yells and accuses her of yelling. He yells over her to make sure she shuts up and cannot get her point across. He will not let her be alone with other people because he is afraid that she will be talking about him. And he has been stealing  her money in various ways from getting her to pay his portion of rent/bills, all meals, and straight up lying to her about needing money for things, but not buying said things.

She spent most of the weekend with me and stayed at my apartment. During this time he (and his mother) called her phone over 100 times. He sent text messages threatening to kill himself, trying to guilt her into coming home. 

Eventually, she did return home, at her own time and pace. 

But when I texted her to check in, I thought the response was really peculiar. I'm afraid that she wasn't the one texting me back and that it was actually her boyfriend. I sent something very vague like ""how's it going?"" and the response was something like ""We are fine. We are resting in bed. We are doing great""

I didn't like that ""she"" used the we voice, and it seemed strange because she never has in the past.

So how do I check in with her in ways that he cannot intervene?

Please advise.

Thank you r/twoXchromosomes

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who has commented or sent me messages. I really appreciate the advice and it has opened my eyes to the reality of the situation.

I care for my friend like a sister and all I want is to see her happy. It sounds like it will take time though, and that I must be very careful to make sure her bf doesn't become suspicious of me (he probably already is since she chose my apartment to run away to). My plan is to be careful about how I outreach and how often I do so, but to be persistent and not give up on her. I need to be there for her the next time she decides that she's had enough.

t3_246v72,Maybe I just need some perspective,"Hi TwoX. This is a burner name because I'm not ready to talk to the people who might follow my real name.

This is a post about marriage and me questioning my actions. I am feeling alternately like a horrible meany and a doormat, and I need some perspective from the Collective TwoX. Here is the lowdown:

I am married to a guy who I really dig. We have been together 7 years total and have one kid together, I had one when we met who he loves and helps raise. Last October he tore his esophagus while eating and had emergency surgery, which was followed by a month in the ICU where he was on a ventilator and unconscious most of the time - he came close to death a few times. He recovered and came home in November. When this happened he was working as a contractor, so did not have FMLA protection, and lost his job. Luckily he had short term disability through the contracting firm, and he was approved through January. Once January came, he was not yet recovered enough to go back to work, but he never called his contracting firm or applied for a disability extension. Now he is more or less recovered, but is still not working or looking for work. 

We have talked about this once, and it was hard. He has a lot of very complex feelings about still being alive, and the after effects of being in the ICU for so long. That was about two months ago and at first I was very sympathetic. But that is wearing thin now. 

Since we have lived together, about 5 years, I have been the primary bacon maker. He was finishing his bachelors, then I had a baby so he was stay at home dad. He graduated last May, then got that job. I'm in grad school, and last year got the opportunity to start teaching - but that meant that I had to leave the bacon making job and take a job making facon - but with the promise of Big Bacon later on. The plan was that he take over some of the bacon making. Obviously, having a big scary thing happen was not part of the plan, but now I feel like I am the one carrying everything still, and that it is going to fall on me for a long time to come. Last week he said he was thinking of applying to grad school now rather than applying to jobs....

I am working two jobs and going to school and hardly making ends meet. I don't know if he just does not realize how hard I'm working or if he just thinks everything is cool...I know that I am not communicating well, but that is part of why I am here. I don't like confrontations, and when I start to talk about money and such, he gets all upset. Then it turns into a fight. I don't know what to say, and could just use some words of encouragement. Maybe some one has been here, and can tell me that everything will be alright.

t3_2470uh,"In pain from IUD insertion last week, support & stories would be greatly appreciated","Background: Age 23, Mirena IUD inserted last Monday, never had any children

I was previously on Yaz and was having wonky side-effects i.e. depression whenever I would get switched around on generics.

I've read both positive & negative experiences here and elsewhere on the webz and was seriously worried yesterday when I had sharp pains that send keeling over and crying.

The insertion was pretty painful, and I had on and off waves of worse-than-normal menstrual cramps but nothing that set off alarms until yesterday. As per the suggestion of my MD sister there's not much I can do but max dose myself on ibuprofen, unless I wanted to go to the ER and wait for a specialist and the most they'd be able to do is sonogram and then possibly remove it. I'm out-of-state at the moment for work and there aren't any urgent MD places around. I scheduled a call with a specialist today and an appointment tomorrow for a branch of my doc in the area.  

I've checked the strings and was able to feel my cervix that it's still in there because I'm on my period (never realized how low it sits during that time!)  

Has anyone gone through a week of hell with their IUD then have it be fine?  

**UPDATE:** Spoke to an RN and a specialist at my docs. RN was concerned that my sharp pain and nausea didn't sound normal and put me in touch with specialist.   

They both wanted to get me in to see an MD as soon as possible, they said it's possible it perforated during insertion and/or that my body is getting used to the new hormones/going off my old BC.  

Unfortunately I'm traveling for work and the timing is bad, so I'm going to go see someone when I get in. But specialist said if anything gets worse to go to ER. I woke up this morning thinking I felt fine, but sure enough like clockwork if I don't take ibuprofen, the sharp pain from my tailbone up my spine and nausea sets in.  

Specialist agreed there's not much they can do until the physically examine me then possibly ultrasound me. Fingers crossed that I just might need stronger pain meds for a week or so and that everything is fine. Have an appointment tomorrow will let you all know how it goes, thank you again for the support! <3  ",6,20140428110104,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_2477gt,My relationship is falling apart and I don't know what to do,"I don't know what I'm looking for here, maybe to hear some encouraging words and read some other experiences? Basically my relationship with my boyfriend of almost 3 years is falling apart. I know in my heart that this isn't going to work in the long term but every time I think about this, I just want to try harder but it all falls back to the same pattern.


We really don't have any ""major"" issues other than communication, not knowing how to communicate. Our entire relationship issues can essentially be exemplified by what happened this morning:


My boyfriend is allergic to our cat. He gave me the cat as a present knowing fully well that he is allergic but he has opted to deal with it. I was extremely happy and grateful for the gesture though we did talk about that owning an animal should require a more thorough discussion next time and should not be a ""surprise"".


Ever since we got the cat, he's been having stuffed nose which causes him to snore. The snoring basically got worse and worse so I suggested him to see a doctor. He was basically prescribed anti-allergy med, saline solutions and some nose spray.


This past weekend, his friends from out of town came to visit and stayed with us. We live in a small one bedroom open concept apartment. They slept in the living room. Essentially for the 3 nights starting on friday, his snoring became the worst I've ever experienced. It was so loud that ear plugs essentially didn't do much. I couldn't sleep elsewhere either because his friends were here. On sat night I literally laid awake for 7 hours straight listening to his snoring. I did not get even a hour of sleep and basically crashed the next day/slept after he got up. I tapped him a few times throughout the night when I thought I would literally go insane if he didn't stop. So last night, after his friends are gone, I basically slept in the living room with ear plugs (and can still hear him), but at least I got a few hours of sleep.


So this morning, after a weekend of reading up on snoring on the internet, I asked him to go see the doctor again and see if there's anything else they can do. I didn't specifically told him the things I read on the internet (like sleep apnea) but basically said he's not really sleeping well either snoring like that. His response, like always, is negative. ""It's no use. There's nothing more they can do. I've already seen the doctor. It's the allergies, it's the cost of having a cat. There are no other solutions. The only solution is to get rid of the cat. Do you want that?"" He then proceeds to tell me how his friend's snores can move mountains but his gf never say anything to him but just to leave the room.


At this point I just got so angry. I haven't had a good night's sleep in 3 nights. I haven't been mean about his snoring. I talked to him calmly about seeing a doctor and honestly all I wanted was him working with me to find a better solution, if there is one. But no, of course he doesn't. All he can do is say ""I'm sorry you have to experience that but  I'm doing all I can."" then shot down me asking him to see the doctor. (We live in Canada so health care cost is not a concern.)


I got so angry that we had an argument. I packed my stuff and said I would sleep at my mom's until he's willing to work with me. He then told me to ""not come back"". Then after seeing that I meant what I said, he started to say things like ""I'm not saying I'm not going to see the doctor. I'm just saying you may have to live with the reality of this. When did I ever say I wasn't going to see the doctor?""


At this point I was just so fed up that I left. I don't understand why we can just never have a productive and calm discussion. His response to any of my ""suggestion"" would be to be negative and defensive, then try to take back his words afterwards which made me even angrier. I know we both have issues but seriously I feel like I'm dealing with a child everytime I want to talk about something. 


This argument basically just exemplifies our relationship. I know I can't live with this kind of relationship forever. Everytime I try it just falls back to the same pattern. I want to break it off but I can never bring myself to it. ",4,20140428120648,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_246nfi,Help please on where to start with medical help for vaginismus :(,"Made a throwaway for this as too many friends know my username! I've been experiencing varying levels of discomfort/pain with sex for years, with different partners (so unlikely it's their size or anything, don't think either have been much different from the norm). For ages I just figured it was a mental thing, since when I was younger I was *terrified* of rape/intercourse for some random reason (no history of abuse, trust me, been asked that enough times!)

Anyway, this sub caused me to stumble across vaginismus, which sounds EXACTLY like what I go through so, so often. I just don't know where to start, as in, what kind of medical professional to go to. I don't have a regular GP as I've never had any need for ongoing medical support, just a random medical centre doctor has always been fine. Anyone have any idea how to begin on this?

A general thank you to 2X for making me realise this maybe isn't just my head screwing me over ... my poor boyfriend feels terrible whenever we have sex because he knows the initial entry is probably going to be quite painful for me, even if I enjoy myself eventually.

t3_24903q,I just got 5 years of birth control for free!,"After much research and thought (and lurking on this subreddit) I decided to get the Mirena. So I brought it up with my doctor on my physical, and she wrote the prescription. ""Oh, by the way, it's pretty expensive"" she says. I knew that, but had only heard stories from the US, so wasn't sure what to expect here (Canada). I ask how much, and she says ""it can be $400 or $500."", Oh, wow. Then she says ""Get it at Costco, I think it's $350 there, and that's definitely the cheapest."" I don't have a Costco membership. But! I learn, from her, you DON'T need to be a Costco member to use the pharmacy! You just walk in and instead of showing a membership tell them you're going to the pharmacy. It's so cool! Meds there are cheaper than other drugstores, the dispensing fee (or whatever it's called?) is less than 50% most pharmacies. 

And today, I learn, the pharmacists there are WAY more competent than any other I've dealt with. I have medical coverage through my work, and my SO has coverage for me through his work, but no other pharmacy has known how to put both through (they just give us the receipt and tell us to send it in to the second insurer. Which isn't always worth it, if the prescription didn't cost too much.) So the pharmacist scans the Mirena. $0.00. She scans some migraine medication. $0.00. She scans my antibiotics. $0.00 (the other prescriptions are unrelated to the Mirena, just they were all on the same page). I'm shocked and elated. I just got over $400 worth of prescriptions FOR FREE. I'll have birth control for FIVE YEARS for FREE. 

I was so excited, I had to tell someone. And my friends and family aren't really the type to want to know about this. And it was many of you ladies who helped me make this decision, so I figured I'd share here. Cheers :) ",618,20140428225429,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_248lx7,"My ex and I broke up about 7 years ago. Since then, he's lost 100lbs, started a company, and is getting married next week. Why is it so hard for me to feel happy for him?","Hi ladies, I need your help. And please, unlike the people who love me, be honest with me and don't sugar coat anything! My main question is, am I a horrible person for feeling like this? Just incase someone close to me knows what my reddit account is, I'm going to use a throwaway.
  
So let me explain my situation. A while ago I dated this sweet, loving guy that I met in college. We dated for the next 3 years and I can honestly say it was my most intimate relationship. I ended the relationship shortly before we graduated because, although I deeply loved him, I didn't see a future for us. I just felt like he wasn't motivated. For a long time he wasn't working, skipping class, I was paying the bills, looked after him, helped him with everything he needed. It's not that I thought he was lazy, just that he wasn't motivated. When I asked him what his goals were, he didn't have any. I just felt that, although he had a wonderful, caring heart...that I just didn't have it in me to spend my life with someone who was doing nothing with his life.  
  
We had an amicable breakup, although he didn't take it lightly at first we agreed to be friends. After college we both went our separate ways, I wished him luck and I meant it.    
  
A few months ago I kind of went through Facebook checking on random people I use to know, and ran across his page. Everything about his life is different. He looks completely different, he has his own successful company, and he's just...not who I was with. Every time I hear someone talk about his upcoming wedding and he plans on flying out his family/fiance's family, I would be lying if I didn't admit that part of me wished that was my life given my recent struggles.  
  
How come it's so hard for me to feel happy for him? I think he's a wonderful guy and I couldn't care less if he a millionaire or dating another girl, it's just a part of me asks *why* he didn't change when he was with me, but the other part of screams that he owed me nothing. I'm trying to work up the courage to just send him a message and tell him I feel so happy for him and am so proud of him (as we haven't spoken for years), but each time I try I can't help but feel like I'm not doing it for the right reasons.

t3_248c7g,How to deal with guys that are really forceful at clubs...that are my acquaintances/somewhat friends?,"Hi there, throwaway because I don't want friends of mine seeing this. Somewhat long.

I feel like people on this sub are really nice and provide some good advice so hopefully you guys can help me out! 

I'm a 22F and not a person who hits up a club every weekend, but I do go occasionally (maybe a few times per year for birthdays/special occasions). I've been lucky in that for the most part I haven't experienced inappropriate behaviour from guys at clubs. Within the last 2 months I've had guys that are friends of friends that have been a little too forward with me.

The first time I was dancing with a guy I had met previously, but he kept getting really close. 

Sidenote: I have a boyfriend, and this guy knows this (bf wasn't there that time). My bf is awesome and has no issues if I dance with other guys, however, I felt really uncomfortable with how close this guys was getting.

He kept turning me around to face him and pulling me close and it was just...I don't know...very awkward. I kept trying to pull back and at several points I was actually backing into things. He wasn't getting the hint but I was kind of at a loss at what to do/say. I've never really been in situations like this before so I told him I had to leave (I actually did need to go).

The second time was at a club for my friend's bday (with my bf, but he was elsewhere at the time of the incident). At one point a bunch of us were dancing in a circle and this guy that I had met that day (let's call him B) pulls me practically onto him and starts aggressively grinding. Pretty much as soon as he did that, a guy friend (M) pulls me off B, but he grabbed me again. It all happened really fast and I was kind of at a loss for what to do, but I just turned around and told B I had to go to the bathroom. It was obvious afterwards that B was totally trashed, but I still don't excuse his behaviour.

So, if you're still with me, thank you! My question is...how do I deal with situations like this? If it was some random guy I wouldn't have a problem telling him no, or to screw off, but these are guys that I will potentially be seeing in the future. How should I handle the inappropriate behaviour? I don't like having to run off to the bathroom because it doesn't address the issue and I don't want to leave because of some guy.

I also just end up feeling bad about myself. I always question what I should have done differently. M even made a point of saying ""you need to tell guys 'no'"", which I agree with, but how can I do this diplomatically with guys I know? I don't want to cause drama that may follow in the future. I hate that I always freeze in these situations or run off. 

Anyone have concrete advice on what to do/say to these guys without being rude? Or am I allowed to be rude? Halp.

TL;DR How to deal with guys dancing inappropriately with me when they are friends of friends?

Now, a few days after prom they are officially together again. I'm so sick of it I told her I was done trying to convince her to not be with him.

I recently had a guy come inside me after the condom broke. He told me after sex finished. I checked my ovulation cycle on my phone app and decided I was in the clear, since it was a week after ovulation. Why oh why didn't I take emergency contraceptive? I have been keeping track of my period and it has been exactly a 28 day cycle for the past few months. Until now. I'm FIVE days late! Whew.

t3_24arop,What would you want to ask a woman who had a baby with her HIV-pos husband?,"Hi everyone,

I'm new here, so please forgive any Reddit-newbie errors. And if this is the wrong place for this, let me know and I'll remove it immediately.

I'm just curious: I saw this article on the Washington Post website last week: Mixed-status HIV couples have babies the old fashioned way: http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/as-mixed-status-hiv-couples-weigh-risks-more-choose-to-conceive-the-old-fashioned-way/2014/04/24/8c8b11a4-b9d4-11e3-96ae-f2c36d2b1245_story.html

I started thinking what I would ask of couples who fit this description. If you had a chance to ask (respectful) questions of these women, what would you ask? What would you most want to know?

I think I'd want to know how they weigh the risk. Like, how do you get to a comfort level with the risk that you might get HIV? What does that mean to them? And did you always want to have a baby, and if so, how did you decide to marry someone with whom having a baby might be impossible?

I don't have kids, and I'm about to turn 40, and I'm really wondering if my current relationship is right for me, since she doesn't want to have kids. So I guess the last one is the most personal for me.

What about you?

We put to rest the blue and green Paisley Hanes, a younger lass who always was there to not show a panty line when the Thong Unit had been exhausted. The enemy came upon us swiftly and in the middle of a final. There was nothing she could do. She fought bravely. 

We also honor Watermelon Pink Hanes, with her colorful blue and green band. Getting on in her years and a little loose in the elastic, she should have been retired months ago. But alas, yet another surprise attack from the enemy brought her down. We had underestimated the heaviness of the onslaught, our battlements did not hold. She held off several waves, sacrificing herself in her ever-devoted mission to keep safe The Pants.

t3_24begi,"[NSFW][Possible trigger] After years of hating giving oral because it played a major part in my sexual abuse as a child, I enjoyed it for the first time.","I have always hated blow jobs. Ever since I was eight and made to do them. The very thought, for a very long time, made me gag. I had a boyfriend, and I couldn't do it when he asked. I choked and gagged before it was even in my mouth. I had a few flings and one nighters. Still couldn't do it. Another boyfriend? Still no. Then when I was a month shy of seventeen I got a more serious boyfriend. The only one where I tried hard to do it. But I was *always* reluctant. I *never* enjoyed it. And he had to ask or pester for it, and would try and take control and generally not respect me. He didn't respect me as a person either. And I was never truly attracted to him. We were together for years.

 I'm a few months shy of 21 now, and I slept with someone casually. Someone who I was extremely attracted to and vise versa. This guy seemed to respect me as an equal, and wasn't selfish in bed either. He didn't even have to ask. I found myself readily wanting to do it, so I did. And I *enjoyed* it. Guys, I *enjoyed giving someone a BJ*. For the first time ever. I never thought this could happen and it did, and I'm so happy.

All it took was time, maturity, real physical attraction and mutual respect. I know for others it may take more than that, and for others it may never happen. And I respect that.

I just had to share, I'm not really comfortable talking about it to anyone else but reddit, and especially TwoX, and this is a pretty major thing for me. It's something that has bothered me because I always wanted to work past it.

1) I've always pictured the guy proposing... but don't actually have a problem with 'stepping up' and doing it.

Women who've asked - does this stupid standard ever bother you in the back of your mind and you *kinda, sorta* wish you'd've waited for him to do it?


2) Will he be offended that I didn't wait for him to get the courage? 

He's very introverted but super romantic. I can tell he's genuinely thinking about it because of the glint in his eyes whenever the topic comes up (on tv, in our jokes, him *really* wanting my very intimidating dad to like him, etc.), but our first ""I love you"" story is of me stealing the words from him (I *knew* he was about to say it, he was teary eyed and nervous) and he says he was relieved. Not sure if proposing marriage is something he'd be relieved about if I beat him to it, too.... 


3) How did you do it? 

I love turning insignificant moments into important ones! So I'd probably do it during a walk, at breakfast, when he comes home from work, or right when we're waking up... 

Did you have a ring? Did you drop to one knee? Did he repsond the way you expected?

t3_24c6pi,I have an abortion scheduled for Thursday. I'm trying not to doubt my decision or become overly emotional.,"I've been on birth control for the last two years, always with a perfectly consistent period (almost to the hour). About a month ago I started getting blinding migraines. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Fioricet. I asked the doctor if the medicine would effect my birth control and she said ""no, not at all."" Then last month I didn't get my period. After trying to figure out what happened in the last month (I was never late taking a pill) I googled Fioricet and birth control and *every entry* talks about an interaction. I feel stupid for not doing my own homework, but I trusted my doctor.

I've had one abortion before, two years ago. I was in an abusive relationship. It was extremely hard. I wanted to have the baby, but knew it was not safe to go through with the pregnancy for me or the child that would grow up in that situation. I grieved for a long time, but I also felt very relieved. This time I am in a very supportive relationship with someone I will spend the rest of my life with, but we just aren't ready. The first time around my whole family was encouraging me to go through with it. I feel like if I told them I was pregnant and considering an abortion now it would just be...shameful. I feel guilty for being in this situation and angry because I thought I was doing everything right. A part of me feels like now that I'm in a good relationship, I ought to have the baby, that it's the ""right"" thing to do, that we would love it and do whatever we had to in order to raise it. But I have a very deep fear that it could come at the expense of mine and my boyfriend's relationship and our education/careers. It just seems smarter and better for everyone if we don't bring a child into the world right now. My boyfriend, though he is extremely supportive and equally rational, is also a devout Catholic, and he has a nagging guilt that us having an abortion would be grave sin. It doesn't change his feeling about what is right for us and for our future family, but knowing that he is feeling that kind of pain and moral conflict wears on my conscience as well. 

On top of those stresses, the abortion clinic in my town has within the last few years been bombed, in the past abortion doctors have been killed, and to this day there are protesters that stand fifty feet away from the door shouting at the women who go in. I lay awake at night imagining my boyfriend sitting in the waiting room while I'm having the procedure and the building gets firebombed. It doesn't help.

t3_24cozx,A Letter To Myself - The First Time I've Ever Spoken Out About Some Things - [Graphic] [Trigger Warning] [NSFW],"Dear tinyboldgirl,

I’m sorry that it’s taken me twenty years to get this out to you. This is by far the most painful thing I have ever done. I had to get up to turn all the lights out because even the act of typing these words out makes me want to throw my computer out the window and comfort myself by thinking of ways to die before I go to sleep. I’ve started and stopped this document periodically over the years, unsure of how to put it all out there; unsure of what words to use. Some people are able to poetically write their experience. Some people are able to make it tragically beautiful. I’m sorry that I can’t do that. I’m sorry that this is so painful. I don’t even know where to start.

I’m sorry that I couldn’t put words to the experience you had when you were six. I’m sorry that I suppressed the memories and told you that you were lying to yourself. I’m sorry that sometimes you still feel like you’re lying to yourself. I’m sorry that I have to write a letter to myself as if I am not myself because this is so fucking painful that using the word “I” instead of “you” makes me want to slit my wrists open and bleed out in a bathtub full of hot water.
This is so fucking hard to type out and I’m sorry that it is so raw. Tinyboldgirl, you were molested when you were six years old. I’m sorry that this is the only validation you’ll ever receive and I’m sorry that it has to come from yourself, but after twenty years of denying it – that’s better than nothing I suppose. You were molested by your best friend. She forced you to perform oral sex on her because if you didn’t, you weren’t her best friend. You didn’t really have many friends and you had a shitty, nonexistent relationship with your parents so you didn’t really know better. It’s not your fault even though it feels like it is. She made you lie there as she performed oral sex on you while her older brother video-taped it. When you threatened to tell, he duct taped her hands and your hands and then pushed you down the stairs. It was that day when you realized no one would ever listen to you and I’m sorry to say this but you were right.

You were molested for three years until they moved houses. She then began to masturbate in front of you with pens and pencils and other sharp things. I know you’ve been trying to block this out of your memory for years. I know this is why you don’t masturbate and I know this is why you hate oral sex. I know this is why you feel like you want to kill yourself when guys and even other girls shame you for not masturbating and not wanting to give blow jobs. I’m sorry, I am so fucking sorry that this is the way it is and people are just generally pretty terrible. I’m sorry that all I can say is I’m sorry.
When they moved to another part of Texas, I know that you were relieved. You tried visiting them a few times but you knew in your heart that you were really fucking happy that they were gone and that you’d never see her brother again. Your parents never knew and will never know.

I am sorry that when you were in seventh grade, you “dated” a boy who stalked you in fifth and sixth grade because that’s how you thought it was supposed to be. I’m sorry that you thought if you “just gave in” things would be better. He manipulated you and abused you and I’m sorry that when you think of movie theaters and the color red and black boots, you want to kill yourself. He stalked you for eight years after that.

When you were a junior in highschool, you fell head over heels for a guy with blue eyes and a nice smile. You thought if you could just put all of the ugly things behind you, things could really work out. You thought if you just treated this boy like the way you wanted to be treated, things could really work out.

It was late September, early November in your senior year of highschool when he raped you anally. You stood there in Memorial Park, pulling up your shorts, feeling the sting of ripped tissue, feeling the blood and semen spilling out of you. He stared at you in disgust, telling you to “clean yourself up”. You felt so embarrassed and ashamed that you wanted to die but you did as you were told and you told yourself that you liked it and you held his hand as you walked back to his car together. I am so sorry, I am so fucking sorry.
A week to the day later, you found out he cheated on you and you cried and cried. You still kept thinking that if you forgave him, if you were a good girl, things would get better. If you just shoved it under the rug, things would get better. If you tried harder, things would get better. So you got all dolled up for homecoming and tried to be a good girl but it didn’t work because he raped you in his car in front of your house anyway.

Your boyfriend raped you. He grabbed you by the back of your head and dragged your body over the console. Your face hit the steering wheel and he took his penis out and hit you in the face and in the eyes with it. He told you to give him a blow job, that he deserved it, that you owed it to him, that he’s been waiting patiently all this time. You kept begging him to stop, you kept saying no, please, no, I don’t want to do this. You tried to get up and he forced your lips onto his penis. You tried to say no and he forced it inside of your mouth. Your tongue was on the tip and it tastes so sour and bitter. You were so scared. You tried to pull back and he pushed you down. You couldn’t breathe; you felt like you were choking.

When he let you up, you asked him if he would walk you to your door and he said no because his mom and dad were probably worried about him. He told you to keep it a secret because it would hurt his reputation if people found out. He told you to confide in him whenever you felt bad because, really, he was the only person you had left.
He was mentally, emotionally and sexually abusive to you. He kept on raping you for two more years after that. I’m sorry that when you think of sex, you think of feeling scared and if it isn’t scary, then it isn’t sex. I’m sorry that when you think of yourself, you feel broken. I’m sorry that when people try to pay for your coffee, it makes you think of those words that he said to you: “You owe me this”. I’m sorry that I’ll be the only person who will ever apologize to you because people are generally pretty rotten and selfish and don’t really know what to say to rape survivors like you. 


But I also want to say that I’m fucking proud of you. You have nothing and no one but you still hold your head really fucking high and soldier through the pain. You’re 2 months clean from cutting yourself even though no one cared if you were cutting yourself or not. Even though you’re failing school in most areas right now and your parents don’t care to understand why, you’re ALIVE and that in itself is pretty fucking amazing.

I’m proud of you because you get up in the morning and you look at yourself in the mirror and you think to yourself, “Even if no one else thinks I’m beautiful, I think I’m beautiful.” I’m proud of you because you had the courage to get those tattoos and walk away from someone who was hurting you because you finally believed that you didn’t deserve that anymore. I’m not sure if ‘better’ exists but I know that you’ll never put up with anything like that ever again.
I’m proud of you because even though it’s hard not having anyone, at least you’ve had the courage to walk this path 100% alone. That’s a lot more than other people can say for themselves. I’m so fucking proud of you, I am so fucking proud of you.

I’m proud of you because even though every person who has ever loved you has hurt you in horrible ways, you still haven’t given up on the idea of love and being loved by someone. I am not sure that person exists but I do know that at least in my head, you’ll be loved by someone who accepts your past and won’t ever force you to give him a blow job. He won’t even ever ask about it. Don’t give up on finding that person and don’t hang around girls and guys who say that one day you’ll just “get over it”.

The life you have led is horrific and yet I’m proud of you because you try your best not to hurt anyone and you rescue every damn animal that you see. I’m proud of you because you’ve gotten rid of most of the negative people in your life and I’m proud of you because you stand up for yourself. I’m proud of you because you’re in therapy. I’m proud of you because you fight to give other rape survivors a voice, even when other people think it’s socially inappropriate. I’m proud of you because you want to become a licensed counselor for people just like you. 

I’m sorry that you can’t sleep at night because you’re plagued with nightmares and I’m sorry that when you think of men, a tiny part of you hates them. I hope that one day you’ll meet one that makes you think that they can be good people but I don’t blame you for thinking that they’re not.

Love,

tinyboldgirl

t3_24d3ic,I made an appointment with a genetic counselor.,"I've always thought of myself as high risk for breast cancer due to my family history. My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 bilateral breast cancer at the of 31, before it was even recommended she get a mammogram. She died at age 36 due to her cancer. My grandmother had breast cancer, as did her sister and her mother. It's always seemed somewhat inevitable.

My general practice doctor has been very dismissive of my concerns and has denied my requests for a mammogram as I am only 24, despite knowing my family history. 

So I finally made an appointment with a generic counselor. I know I won't find anything out in my first appointment specific to my genes and my prognosis, but I'm still terrified. 

I know there are many options for how to deal with a positive BRCA genetic mutation, but I am just stuck on the thought of removing all breast tissue, or as much as possible. I'm only on my parents insurance for 2 more years, and their insurance would cover the vast majority of the cost involved with a radical mastectomy and reconstruction, so that makes me feel like I'm on a timeline. 
I know it's too early to make a decision, but it's constantly on my mind.",13,20140430075734,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Broke up a major relationship beginning of the year. Amicable, guy was very good about it. All credit to him. Had a 6 week fling with someone, he broke it off, we remained good friends. 

House share I was in broke down, I am miserable. Second guy offers me to stay with him for a bit, till I sort myself out/know what I'm doing. It's fun living there, he's a good guy, and a nice person, we get on really well. He's charging me very little rent, so I can save up for a deposit/similar. He owns it outright (is older, had lots of savings and help from family). 

The problem is that I am a massive fucking sponge. I don't want a relationship, but him being around and having slept with him before means that it seems very strange for me not to do it now - I am a really base creature like that! We're spending a lot of time together, but it's such a laugh. 

I don't want to move out, I've got a good deal here and he's given me a massive gift, but I am unsure how to proceed. I've got it in check for the minute but if he starts seeing someone else I'm not sure what I'll do.

t3_24ee82,The first time alone in my own apartment,"I really want to share this with someone since it feels so huge to me! I'm a 20 year old lady and my parents just left me at my first apartment in another city and it feels so unreal. 

A little background: I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and I've had major depressive episodes in the past as well and for a very long time I felt very hopeless and lost and I had no idea how to get myself out of it and get healthy. I tried to take my life a few times, isolated from almost everyone and everything in my life, dropped out of school in grade 11, and was just generally a mess. My parents stuck by me, though, and kept trying to find help for me. Where I was, though, there were almost no mental health resources and definitely nothing that was equipped to deal with my issues. 

Last fall I was admitted into a specialized treatment facility a few hours away and I've been there until today. I completed two programs (one for stabilization and one for PTSD) and I've made such huge improvement it's, again, almost unreal. I got to read my chart while I was there which included some notes from my regional hospital and it was very depressing to realize how incredibly sick I was but I realized how different I am now. I've put in so much work and been so determined to get better. I'm pretty committed to life now, and to recovery, I'm much more aware and accepting of the special needs I have, and I'm working on not blaming myself for everything that went wrong. It's hard sometimes to deal with the anger I have for what happened to me in my past to set my life so far off track but it's another thing I just have to accept that I cannot change, but I know I can change my future. 

Which leads me to where I am now. The hospital said I needed to continue my treatment as an outpatient so my parents set my older sister and I up in an apartment in a bigger city that has the resources I need and I'm going back to school to complete my high school credits and hopefully be able to grow into someone who's skin is a little easier to live in. I'll always have the scars but maybe they're not quite so suffocating anymore. 

This was super long and probably no one will read it but I just need to share. ",507,20140430155604,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24dxxd,Healthcare denied my wife's claim because the diagnosis code was for female sexual dysfunction. Looking for advice. (xpost r/sex),"Quick Back story.  My wife has a history of kidney infections, she was also having pain during and after sex that started after a kidney infection. Went to see a Gyno/Urologist specialist, and she prescribed pelvic floor physical therapy for the pain and she's going to get surgery to fix the kidney issue.

She verifies that the therapist she picked is listed on the blue cross blue shield Alabama website as ""in network"" and starts going.  Fast forward 4 weeks, and the therapist says that the insurance will not cover anything, we have to pay out of pocket.  Therapist has never seen a claim just flat out denied, as even medicare covers pelvic floor physical therapy. (We are not in AL, but company ins is from there).

I am really mad and frustrated.  If my doctor prescribed me Viagra, even though I am not even 30, they will cover it no questions asked. But sexual dysfunction for women is not covered? What the hell? I get that one is physical therapy one is a pill, but this feels so misogynistic and wrong.

I called them and they are going to mail me an appeal form (ofc you can't download it).  I will fill it out and have both the PT and prescribing doc write notes with it but I am not hopeful.  Yes I don't want to pay 100% of this, but even more I am just really fucking pissed that they will cover men's sexual dysfunction but not women's.  Even ignoring that plenty of Viagra prescriptions are for guys who live unhealthy lifestyles and need it because their circulation and physical fitness sucks.  They have control of that and are still covered, but for women? GOOD LUCK.

t3_24ed7e,What I Blame Him For (TW: Rape),"I wrote this a few years ago now, but for some reason I am thinking about it a lot lately. I thought sharing it here might help me.
 
------------------

I feel bad accusing him of things, or calling it rape, but I don't know of another word for it. Instead, I will explain how things happened, for myself more than for the reader, in hopes that it will help me move beyond this. 

We talked about having sex long before we actually did. I thought I was in love with him. He knew I was a virgin. He asked me if I'd ever thought about how I'd like to lose my virginity, and I told him I never thought about how I wanted to lose it, but how I knew I didn't want to. I told him I didn't want to be drunk, and I didn't want to be on top. 

Cut ahead. He broke up with me, but I already made plans to go out and see him, so I went anyway. He kept giving me mixed signals. I get there, and we're having a great time. We agreed I'd stay in the same bed because regardless, he was a friend, and his bed was large enough I felt comfortable. The first of ten nights there, he was admiring my tattoo. He asked if he could lick it. I was so caught off guard and kind of weirded out by the question that I agreed. Somehow, this led to him fingering me. I never said no. I was shaking so much I could hardly breathe, but I never said no. This is not the rape I am writing about. I do not blame him for touching me on the first night. 

Cut ahead again, a few days later. Halloween. I had never truly been drunk before, and wanted to be a typical young person on Halloween for once in my life. Too much vodka, my head was spinning. Before I even visited, when we talked of sex and how I did not want it when I was drunk, I begged him to promise he would not let me talk him into it if I was drunk. I told him I would tell him I was not drunk, that I was fine and making rational decisions, but he must reject me. He did not. I was more drunk than I have ever been in my life, or ever will be again, and he suggested sex. I said okay. He said, wait, you're drunk. I said that it was okay. This is still not the rape I am writing about. I only partly blame him for initiating sex that night. 

We're in his bedroom. He's taking off my pants, and he tells me mine are the most boring panties he's ever seen. I should've stopped him there, but I didn't. My head and heart were screaming for me to stop him, but I laughed it off and let him grab hold of my ankles. This is not the rape I am writing about. I only partly blame him for insulting me on what should've been one of the most special nights of my life. 

He decides part-way through that he doesn't like how the condom feels. He does not ask me if it's okay before he rips the condom of and continues to have sex to me (I say to, because it was not with. I was outside myself by this point, disappointed for letting it get this far). He has an STD, and I am not on birth control, but he does not think of the consequences. I realize what he has done and my head starts swimming with worry and anxiety. My body aches from him resting himself upon me and the pain of him being inside of me. I do not want him there. I never did. He is not the one. I ask him to stop. I tell him to stop. I beg him to stop. He does not. I am shaking harder than I ever have before, and I feel like I am going to throw up. He is done with me and rolls over, says we should get Plan B, so we go to Walgreen's. I am ashamed. I know the woman behind the counter is judging me, blaming me, hissing ""slut! slut!"". At least he paid for it. The pills make me very sick, and mess up my periods for 3 months. The sex makes me very sick, and messes up my head and heart for a good deal longer.

t3_24eq40,Conflicted about pregnancy,"It's not that I'm not happy to be pregnant. It was planned, my husband has been fabulously supportive of my crazy cravings and icky morning sickness. 

It's just that I feel like there are so many rules and none of them are going my way. There's a ton of stuff I can't eat/drink because of the chance of listeria, or mercury, or whatever. Yet, I'm pretty sure our parents ate whatever, drank, smoked, etc. and I'm okay, you're ok. Did we really improve outcomes that much that I have to cut ALL these things out for the duration? 

And here's what bugs me the most. I can't get a massage for the first trimester. Ok, fine, whatever. I got assaulted by a patient at work. I'm a nurse, and a confused patient grabbed me by the front of my scrubs with both hands, held me in place and kicked me in the stomach. And my manager and doctor both said the same thing, you will be fine, there's so many things keeping that little one safe that one little kick from an 88 year old lady won't hurt the baby. If you start bleeding, then we'll worry. So, no fun, but getting kicked is ok? I understand, they are trying to calm down a hormonal, crying lady. But I can't help but feel that this is just another double standard for women. It's the same as expecting us to not want sex, because that's dirty, but we have to look sexy and attractive or we aren't worth anything. Now I'm pregnant and I puke constantly, only want to eat certain foods, but can't eat half of what I want, but have to eat something or else I'm hurting the baby. I can't do things that will make me feel good like a massage, but I can get assaulted and be just fine, stop crying.

t3_24erfc,I gave my opinion about representing women in the tech field and now I'm being put in a TV commercial and I can't refuse because I need to represent doh!,"I work for a big tech company where I am the only female tech on hand. Its quite a diverse company cabling, satellite, AV, IT etc. I am a systems technician/ consultant for IT. Anyway the company decided its going to advertise and asked for input on commercial ideas. I told them they need to put a bloke on the reception desk and a girl in a technical role just to show diversity in the company and stay away from stereotypical labels. Well they loved my idea however it turns out they want the real techs in the ad and since I'm the only female tech they want me to be in it. Ahhhh I hate being in front of more than a couple of people and now my face is going to be plastered all over my city.

But of course if I refuse then there will be no female representation in the ad except for the admin girls. Dammit :D",17,20140430180836,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24fm1a,false promotion?,"I work in a call center that has several lines of business. Last month I was promoted (based on what I thought was my numbers being almost double that of what goal was) to the final department before supervising/training/etc. This is a huge deal for me. I have been struggling with depression and have had issues with not being able to perform well under stress and so I felt like I was finally able to be a functioning adult in the real world.

Tonight my roommate and I invited a couple that we work with over to have cake and ice cream (they also live very close to us) and as it usually goes since we were work friends the topic turned to work. In the process of talking one of them mentions the ""only reason I was brought over was because senior manager wanted to work with roommate because he thinks shes pretty"" and then ""oh the only reason you didn't get moved to this spot was because you and roommate have to be on the same schedule"" this spot being a brand new team that is literally being set up for failure so that they can fire them.

I'm really hurt. I don't know how to process this. I'm mad that it's being seen as I didn't earn this promotion. Senior manager would consistently speak to my roommate about things and not me in regards to our schedule. She is more outspoken but I feel like I am just this barnacle attached to her now. That I need to separate myself from her for my success to be recognized, or if I do and make waves then am I going to be fired?

This is something that was brought up in my own home so its not something I can go to HR about. Or can I? I feel like this has deflated my confidence about everything I felt I earned since September and undermines my joy about being successful. How do I even handle this? I'm not ready to bring this up to my roommate because its not her fault shes conventionally pretty and very extroverted but this is really hurting me.

t3_24fhs2,To the girl who asked about sternum pain while sleeping with SO:,"I went to comment on your topic, but it wouldn't let me because it was deleted and your account was deleted too. I just wanted to let you know that I don't necessarily think it's as grave as the other commenters made it seem! 

I have the same exact issue when I sleep in an unfamiliar/new bed in a new position when first dating a person. For example, after sleeping on my side in my own bed, by myself, in a very comfy position, for months as a single lady, my body gets used to that. Once I start dating someone new, and try to put my body in a snuggling position it's not used to sleeping in (especially in a bed it's not used to), I get sternum pain just like you described. After a few nights of habitually sleeping in this new way, my body gets used to it.

I would guess it's a similar thing with you. If so, just wait a few more nights to see if it gets better. However, if you've been sleeping this way with your partner in this bed habitually for a while and it's still occurring, then it may be something else, and it wouldn't hurt to see your doctor.

t3_24fbhx,"WARNING: RANT. Friend of mine called me, I got shamed for an unintentional mistake and basically got blamed for a series of events that ""ruined"" her evening.","I'm very fed up with this! It's kind of hard to explain the situation but it ended in me getting a private class before her, she's usually first and then I have my class. The class was only an hour -I chopped off mine so that she could start earlier. 

So, there was some misunderstanding tonight and I somehow thought that I was supposed to be before her. (We have private classes once every week).

We have often before exchanged classes with *no* problems, even without calling each other first, because we were both free over these two hours that our classes are, so if the other asked to exchange, the other usually would just wait and get ready for her class while she waited.

Anyways, tonight I was supposed to be after her but for some reason my schedule said that I should be first, and that made it possible for me to accept a meetings afterwards. (work related, so I kind of couldn't skip it, but it would have been manageble and solvable if I wouldn't be free). 

So, I start my class, and suddenly she just rushed in, furious, saying that she has places to be and that she needs her class RIGHT THEN. She [friend, lets call her Y) then walks out, very upset and angry. (She's usually very down-to-earth and relaxed about things like that, but's she's been very up-high for the last month and has been acting weird towards me, like we weren't friends, almost as if I had done something that could have hurt her, **which I know that I haven't done, and I have talked to her about that, and she said that it wasn't so, she also said that everything was okay**).  

I realize my mistake and offer her to take my class (technically hers). She said no and walked away.

On with the class;The teacher somehow tries to find a way so we both can have at least some time each, and we talked together and decided that I would finish earlier, so she could start earlier and therefore quit earlier and be on time. Y accepted this idea and said that it would be alright to be late for this thing she was supposed to be. **I know that I made a mistake with that class and told her. I offered her to take the class, and said that I would change my meeting, she said no, that we'd do like the teacher suggested**. So we keep on with my class, with me thinking things were alright between Y and me.

Anyways, she comes *late* for her class, (I had no idea what the time was) and I have a lot of stuff to take out of the classroom so as soon as she walked in I started packing my stuff and in the meantime I'm talking with the teacher about next class while I'm picking up my stuff, while she get's ready. She's ready before me and I told them just to start and don't mind me while I finished. (I repeat; *I had PLENTY of stuff to take out*). I finish; I hurry out and Y seems to be okay with this and we say our good byes. She though refused to start with me in the room. I don't know why; that hasn't been a problem before.

Anyways, I'm home after the class, just getting ready for my meeting, and my phone rings. 

That's her to tell me what a terrible person I am, that I can't suddenly change classes like that and that I can't be like this and that and can't behave like that before calling her first. Saying that I should have hurried more out from the classroom, saying that I should have stopped the class earlier...etc She is going apeshit in the phone, almost screaming at me. 

I was so shocked that I couldn't even start to explain my side of the situation. The only thing that I could think of was ""she was late to her class anyway, why is she blaming it on me?!""

She keeps on, telling me how I ruined her evening, that she had TWO very important place to be right after that goddam class! **She only mentioned one thing to do, and she had said that it would be okay to be late for it**.

She then goes on saying how her evening was a complete disaster because of me. That she missed the first thing, AND ALSO THE LATER THING. Because her class started 15 mins later than usually! 

We live in a *very* small city and she was on car. There was no fucking way that she could have missed two things in a row. Unless she was supposed to be on the other side of the country!

At this point, I have tears in my eyes, trying to tell her that I was sorry for that, that it was a mistake that I made, I knew that and I had tried to fixed that earlier, so she could have everything like she needed. But she hadn't mentioned the second thing, said that it would have been okay to be late for the first thing **and** she also accepted the idea that our teacher came up with. I tried to ask her why she didn't just said straight away that she needed the class, right then. And why she wouldn't take my offer etc.etc.etc. She wasn't listening.

While I'm trying to explain myself, she's just practically throwing shit at me. Things like:
 
*""You are *so* terrible!"" 
*""It's **your** fault that my evening is ruined"" 
*""You cannot make mistakes like that EVER!"" 
*""I need *you* to call *me* when you make decisions like that!!!"" 
*""My evening sucked because of you and your decisions!""

These things were screamed at me. Like that I made the decision of making a mistake. Once. Like I had the intentions of ruining her little something, that she couldn't even tell what was, or why it was so important.

She wouldn't listen to me till I raised my voice a little and asked ""Why didn't you said anything?"" **Because she didn't**

This is such a silly thing to be upset with, but I did **SO NOT** deserved that! She's the one that has always been changing the classes, she's the one that's been getting a little extra time because she always goes a little into my class, and I've always been very relaxed about it. I have only once before had to change the class before, and I called her 4 days prior! 

I've always done my best to be nice, offer her rides (because, we live in the same neighbourhood) and stuff like that. I've never said anything mean to her, and I think that I have only been a good friend. And I cannot see, why on earth, she thinks that it's alright to call me like that and act like that. I don't feel like I deserve that. Yes, she would have been late for that first thing, because of me, but she said that it was ok! Also acted like that!


Oh, and also; when I tried to make my apology -just getting this case over and done, guess what she replied? 

""Yeah right, I'll consider it"". 

That was it, and I hung up.


I will see this girl at school tomorrow, and the day after that, etc. I'm still in a kind of a shock, she has never acted like that towards me before and I'm trying to figure out weather to talk to her about this and tell her how upset she got me, or if to ignore her, until she finds a reason to talk to me, either to shame on me or talk. 

**TL;DR** I made a mistake, tried to make up for it, reverse it, whatever. Friend acted like it was okay, we arranged things. Got a phonecall later from her, where she screamed at me and acted like I had intentionally ruined her evening. She would not take my apology. Also would not tell me exactly what I ruined. I feel like I did not deserve that kind of behaviour.

t3_24ezv3,Very intimidated by the prospect of Mirena. Help a sista out?,"Hi ladies,

I've been considering an IUD off and on for a few months now. I am 19 and in a monogamous LTR. I was mostly interested in Nexplanon, but they don't insert those at my university clinic. I had my annual gynecological exam today and mentioned that I was interested in learning more about IUDs. My provider was happy to give me the literature for Paraguard, Mirena, and Nexplanon. I've seen a lot of testimonials from the ladies here on Reddit as well.

Since I expressed interest in it, my provider went ahead and completed an STI test for me, since it is required for IUD placement. As I was checking out, though, the secretary asked if I wanted to go ahead and get my pre-IUD consultation out of the way. I had time, so why not?

I talked with another nurse about exactly what the procedure involves and what to expect. She told me about when to come in, what kind of drugs to take, all that jazz. Honestly, this worried me more than comforted me. My clinic will not prescribe Cytotec (the cervix softening drug). They will also not prescribe any kind of pain medication. I am the BIGGEST WEENIE. I get extreme motion sickness and I can't even have blood drawn without feeling dizzy and clammy. Might I mention that they want to do this next Tuesday, right before finals?

Overall, I'm just feeling very nervous about the whole thing. Just thinking about the procedure makes me want to vomit and cry. My friend (also 19) had Mirena placed as well, and not one week later, had it expel itself. Is there any kind of advice you ladies could offer? How was your IUD experience?

Edit: Thank you all for your experiences and responses. I have decided against the procedure, at least for the time being. I am not prepared to do this, especially right before finals. I am also not comfortable with the idea of no numbing or pain management done on their part.",1,20140430194124,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24f3p7,I lost my best friend. please help me...,"Ladies, 

You gals have helped me in the past and I am really glad that I have someone to help me with my problems. 

So I know it was long ago but in the beginning of the year my friend Alex left me. 

Me and him used to be on top of the world. Everyday we would talk and hang out. He was my shoulder to cry on and my therapist. 

We were friends for 4 years, and on year 2 he told me he liked me, you know like a crush. But during the time I liked him he didn't like me back and I had gotten rid of all my emotions for him and I never liked him back. 

So I practically ""friend zoned"" him for 2 years yet he still liked me and stayed by by side. 

Well in December me and him just started a little spark or whatever you want to call it. I started to fell crazy love for him and it was driving me nuts. When we got back from winter break I was waiting in my usual spot waiting to see him after not seeing him for two weeks. I saw him and he SPRINTED to me, and hugged me as tight as possible. 

After that I just started to like him. And by December 30th. we had our first kiss. and then we started holding hands and such and then I guess he just got to clingy because every moment he had to know what i was doing or where i was and I really never got any alone time. I stopped liking him and I started to miss my EX boyfriend. 

Well I wanted my EX boyfriend back in my life as a friend. just a friend. But then we started talking a little more. and a little more. and then we flirted. and before I even knew it. I had fallen in love with my EX boyfriend. 

my Ex told me that he wanted to get back together and I was really down for it. Alex on the other hand wasn't. He tried to talk me out of it so many times cause he wanted me. Well i just couldn't date Alex. I was to afraid of losing him of we were to somehow break up .

Well one morning i was sitting with Alex in the hallway and my EX boyfriend came up and held his hand out to me. I had all these books on me and I put them on Alex's lap. (dick move i know) But i took my EX's hand and he kissed me and we started going out. 

Alex and me kept fighting and fighting. But i cared about him so much. 

Well me and my boyfriend went into the library and that is where Alex usually sat and he hated seeing me and my boyfriend together and I can understand why. But Alex texted me that he was upset that we came into the library and i was so pissed off that day that i said some mean things and I guess Alex had enough. 

He stopped texting me and stopped all communication. and then it happened. . . 

On February 1st. . . Alex walked up to me. I knew this was going to happen. But he gave me a red box. A box I had given him on Christmas. It contained all the things i had given him over the past 4 years, including his best friend ring he had worn for 5 months straight. 

I was in tears and crying so hard. But I didn't say a word.  I gave him a goodbye hug and it was the hardest thing i had ever done in my life. 

I took in one last deep breath of his scent and then he left. forever. I still see him around in the school but he looks at me and gives me the cold shoulder. He can't look at me in the eye. and i hate to see him do this. 

I still care about him deeply. I'm to the point where i have to bribe his friends to make sure he doesn't do something stupid and ruin his life. 

I see him walking with other girls and flirting with them and it hurts me so deeply. 

I'm actually crying while I am writing this. 



I lost him... and I'm still crying about it.

He will come by our department to chat with me and the other girls, we IM each other periodically using our work IM program, etc. But lately I feel like he's been amping up the interactions and getting increasingly flirty. The final straw was this IM from today:

""You are awesome, you make the days brighter and it's awesome getting to talk every day so thanks for always making time to""

Now, this is nice and all, and I feel sort of similarly (I like chatting with him throughout the day. As a FRIEND!) but it makes me a little uncomfortable. I have a serious boyfriend who I love a lot. And yes, I try to mention my bf a lot. I even offered to introduce them since they're both musicians! I'm not interested in my coworker in that way and I don't want to lead him on. My problem is that he could just be being friendly, and I don't want to be presumptuous and shoot him down when he's not trying to make a move. I also like talking to him and if we can maintain our friendship without the flirtiness I would prefer to. 

Have you ever had to deal with something similar? How do you tell someone to back off when you're not sure they're really hitting on you? Is a very direct approach called for in this situation?

Him and I had met on a gaming server about two years ago, we quickly became friends and started talking over skype. Over the course of about a year and a half I went through many bad relationships and he was always there to help me as a friend. After  my most recent breakup we started talking more, calling on skype. 

I met his wife,a really odd person, found out how old they actually were (20 him, 28 her) and the fact that she was pregnant. Over the course of the month him and I started getting closer and I began to see what absolute mess his marriage and life was. You see Troy(not his real name) had found Molly(also not the wife's real name) on wow when he was 17, him and her had a long distance relationship and Troy left his mother's house to escape to Molly. 

They both work at a fastfood place working a little over minimum wage. Troy works on average 35 hours a week, Molly works 15. They both live in her depressive parent's house that's covered in mold and dog crap and the overall house is toxic to their health. Troy wants to do things with his life, get out of the rut he's in, while Molly wants to stay there and let mommy take care of her every need.

When I learned all of this, I was just appalled. Their marriage was dying and they decided to have a kid. Troy has scoliosis, Troy hasn't been to the doctors in years for it but suddenly Molly decides that they can afford a kid? They were struggling to make ends meet as is. Then I got to talking to Molly about the kid and possible adoption since they both can't afford the kid and it would probably die if left in the house. She refused to adopt. The probelms kept stacking up ect. ect.

I wanted to be there for Troy, to give him support, and while giving him that support, we fell for each other. Molly still doesn't know and it's been two months now. All I want is to make Troy happy, help him learn to live life and feel freedom. I want to help his kid have a good life and not grow up in a twisted household. I honestly love Troy and would stand by him no matter what he chooses. 

Right now he wants a divorce from Molly but can't afford it and the household is becoming toxic. I paid for a plane ticket to get him out to a friends house so he has a chance to breathe for once and to clear his mind about this whole ordeal.

I don't want to be a homewrecker, I just want to help the person I love have a decent life.

Edit: I guess I forgot to mention that he told his wife that he did not want to be with her anymore about two weeks before him and I started connecting. He hasn't been able to pay for a divorce since all their money is going to pay off all the debt she racked up.",0,20140430200657,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24fth6,One step closer to following my dream. I'm really proud of myself and I just wanted to share it with people who would get it.,"I'm a senior in college, just finished my junior year, and I had to find an internship. I'm a criminal justice major with a focus in victim services/victim advocacy. I was raped my freshman year of college but suppressed it for a solid six months. It wasn't in a dark alleyway, I wasn't drunk, I had invited him in to my apartment. A sudden and horrific panic attack made me face it and see it for what it was. Rape.
That's about the time I started learning more about feminism, rape culture, and many other facets in those areas. I had always known, coming in to college, that I wanted to help people. I just didn't know how. I was already a criminal justice major and I started looking into something dealing with victims. I had no idea how many resources there were that I could have taken advantage of, that would have been incredibly helpful. I found out that there was a certificate I could get. ""Victim advocacy"". 

That was it. That's what I knew I needed to do. There was no doubt in my mind and I could not have been more excited to take this next step in my life, in a positive direction. Jump forward to about a month and a half ago and I hear about internship opportunities opening up in the universities' victim services. I have never wanted anything as bad as I wanted this internship. It was the exact job I wanted to get in to and the experience I could gain from it would be invaluable. So I apply. First I send in my application, then I have an on-the-phone interview. They said they would call me back in a few days to let me know if I was picked for an in-person interview. I WAS!! So I go to that interview and it's me and another girl together with 3 interviewers asking us questions. I was so nervous! At the end of the interview they said they would let us know the next week if we got a position. 

This last week was probably one of the longest ones of my life. But they called today and I got in!! As soon as I got off the phone I hopped up and started dancing around, I was so happy.

t3_24fuqh,Is there an OBGYN here? I need help with foreign birth control pills!,"Hi!

I've been living in Japan for the past 2 years. During my time here I went to see an international doctor and he gave me Marvelon 21 birth control pills. Eventually it became too expensive for me to go see him, so I went to my local ladies' clinic to see if they had the same prescription I could buy here. They didn't, but they had a pill called Lunabell that the doctor there told me was exactly the same. He even gave me the ingredients leaflet because I was doubtful.

After some research, I've found that they're NOT the same (although maybe active ingredients have more than one name?), and there is some confusion over the internet whether or not Lunabell can be used as a contraceptive at all. It seems like it's mostly used to treat severe periods.

The active ingredients are Norethisterone 1mg and Ethinyl estradiol .035mg. I googled those two ingredients together and it seems like they're a contraceptive, but it doesn't list the amounts. I would really like it if someone came and gave me some confirmation, please! I've been using Lunabell pretty blindly for the past 2 months trusting what the doctor told me.

Please help me!",9,20140501023233,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24g2vo,How do I stop feeling so self-conscious about my legs?,"Hey there!  I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for this--if it is, feel free to remove it and I'll try in a more appropriate one. c:

I'm a trans girl, and I've just recently started to go basically full time, which is awesome! :D  I'm having a lot of fun finally wearing girlclothes (and getting overwhelmed trying to find what I like!  But that's its own issue c:).

However, I've also started to notice a problem I've been having.  I really love to wear dresses, but if I wear them (or anything else with an open bottom) without tights, I become really, really uncomfortable about my legs.

I don't really know why. D:  I do know I think my knees look a little weird, but I don't know if it's just that or something else.  Other people's reassurances unfortunately doesn't seem to help. >.<

I actually do really like wearing tights, so that's how I've gotten around this for now.  However, my friend suggests wearing the dresses without them, and it's also starting to warm up for Spring around here, so I probably can't keep wearing the tights forever.

Plus, I've noticed myself feeling the same thing when I wear some shorts. :c  When I'm not wearing dresses, I just wear jeans (which are again starting to be a little problematic due to the increasing heat).

I know this doesn't necessarily have an easy answer, but how do I stop feel so self-conscious about my legs?  I certainly can't keep avoiding this forever, and I just want to be able to wear a cute dress without being uncomfortable with myself.

t3_24h6hv,UPDATE: I am the first female field tech at my company!!!,"About 2 months ago I posted the original, i ended up deleting it because I don't want people to find this that I might be working with. 


So anyways, I am the first female field tech for a huge internet company. I get on roofs, run cables, and do some really scary things! I posted it before I started, so I thought you ladies would like a little update for those who are interested. 



I am actually typing this in a Subway about 200 miles from home, fixing some internets. SO I will write as uch as I can now. 


I work with all guys, they are all so nice. We all get along, and they all treat me the same as everyone else, which was my huge fear. They take me seriously, too! I had 4 days of trainging until they said I could propbably go out on my own. I picked it up fast, and I get very shoked faces when I show up to people's houses. Here is the most common conversation:

*i call them up about 20 minutes before I get there*


Me: Hi, this is iamkindacool, looks like we have an appointment to fix your connection today. Would it be okay if I head out here in about 20-30 minutes?  


Customer: Yeah okay sounds good ,just tell them if they need help with directions, to call me.  


Me: *ugh* okay, sounds good! Ill call you if I get lost, are you still at *address*?


Customer: Yep, just let them know it if the first house on this road.


Me: Okay sounds good, I will see you then!


Customer: Okay! I will keep a lookout for them!



Then they act all surprised when I show up. I get guys that come hold my ladder (I think they like staring at my bum.) I had a guy the other day sit in a lawn chair and watch me while I point their antenna in a different direction on his roof. I've had quite a few women tell me how awesome it is to see a woman in this industry. 


I have guys that can't lift my ladder. I have guys come on the roof and try to help me, and they can't even get off the ladder before they get scared and get down. I've used a 37 foot ladder to get up on a roof and have it break the gutter it was leaning against when I am 2 feet away from reaching the top, causing me to almost fall. I fell off a 6 foot step ladder onto a huge pile of snow, and I STILL get shit for it. 


I went on a roof that didn't even ""peak"" as in it was pretty much a dome, and on my way up (about 20 ft in the air) the ladder starts sliding below me, and thankfully soome guy ran and held it for me. I cried for about a day since I wouldn't have been able to use my legs ever again if he wasn't there. 


I've had a guy straight out refuse to let me get on his roof. 


I had a guy hit on me and start touching my back when I was sitting on his floor programming his antenna, I didn't finish the job. I left right after he touched my back and got in my truck and left. 


I went to a animal hoarder's house... It was really sad. I got out of there ASAP. The guy that owned the house couldn't even get out of the chair and he was on an oxygen tank. I couldn't breathe in his house. 



A tech came out to help me on a job, and a house was so gross that I decided to stand up. He sat down and it ended up being human shit on the chair he sat on. He threw up. 


I have SO many stories and EVERY day is a HUGE adventure, and I NEVER know what will happen. I just got out of being absolutly lost in the wetlands. 4 wheel drive baby!


Thank you all for the encouraging comments on my last post!!

I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks almost a year ago. My son's delivery was a traumatic emergency c section after 36 hours of labor. 

I am seriously struggling with this pregnancy. Everyday since I found out 2 weeks ago my doubts and sadness have grown. I constantly feel terribly sick and anxious. I'm crying all the time. About everything. I'm not able to properly care for my son due to how sick and exhausted I am. On top of that, I have awful anxiety about nausea and vomiting and can't seem to figure out where my real physical symptoms end and my anxiety begins. 

I feel like I would give anything not to be pregnant right now and find myself secretly hoping to miscarry again, even though miscarrying was awful. And I feel so unbelievably guilty and ungrateful for feeling this way. So many women would kill to have what I have. Why can't I be happy about this like I should be? Like I thought I would be? Is it only hormonal or do I really feel this way? What is wrong with me? And what the fuck am I supposed to do about it?

He is now married, has three kids by three different women and as far as I'm concerned, he is no longer a part of my life. 

He started texting me in the morning, and kept going through the day. He started drinking apparently, and his texts reflected it. He started saying he wanted to leave his wife for me, my response was a solid no. I told him that I was not interested, never would be, and that his wife deserved better than that. 

After a while, he gave up. I went to sleep, and woke up the next morning to a voicemail from his wife saying that if I ever contacted him again, she was going to slit my throat. I texted her, in order to have a record of the convo, saying that I was sorry he acted that way, but that I had rejected his advances. She snapped and called me, threatened my son and me again, and hung up.

They lived about four hours away. They just moved back to my area. Should I go back to the police?

Why, when a married man makes advances and then is quickly rejected, does it become the fault of the woman who rejected him?

t3_24h3b5,My dad died on Tuesday. We weren't on the best of terms and it sucks.,"My dad was an alcoholic when I was growing up. I didn't know it then; I am pretty sure kids usually don't. Looking back, I can remember the times after my parents' divorce where it should have been obvious to me. I can remember him falling backwards in a chair and smacking his head against the size of the house. I remember us getting pulled over by the police on a drive home and my dad tossing a blanket over his open beer. Didn't matter, I pointed it out since I was only 6 and didn't know what he was doing was wrong. Basically, most of my childhood memories of him aren't the best.

He wasn't a terrible dad; he tried. He was definitely a better dad to my sister. She was a tomboy and so much my dad's daughter, whereas I am more of a mama's girl if I had to classify us. Even when my dad had stopped drinking for his third wife (she was a former alcoholic and would not put up with any of it), he was still much more there for my sister than for me. That was mostly okay since his wife was nice and supportive of me, treating me like her own daughter, which was especially good for me since at this point my mom lived on the other side of the country. 

My dad's dry spell lasted only as long as his marriage. I can remember sitting on my couch during my sophomore year of college. He called me and he didn't sound right. I asked if he was drunk. He was and I hung up immediately. He had been sober for about 5 years and just decided to pick up again. His new girlfriend didn't help much as she was an overgrown party girl. His drinking this time around was different for me since I was so much more aware of what a problem it was. I did my best to encourage him to stop, to get help, but eventually I just stopped noticing. It was easy since I wasn't around.

Fast forward a few years. My dad is married to his party girl. She is nice enough, but I don't feel much of a connection with her and find her more annoying than anything, but I am polite. I find myself in the Peace Corps, 6,000 miles away when I get a phone call from her. My dad is dying. She is crying her eyes out as I tell her how to contact Peace Corps so that they can get me home to be there with them. I was working at a summer camp, so I wasn't even at home when I got this call. I pack up, jump on the next bus to my town so that I can grab my passport, and make a mad rush to the nearest train station thanks to a local friend with a car. I took me close to 60 hours to make it back home. Luckily by then my dad was no longer in a dire state, but he was sickly and so thin. All those years of drinking had deteriorated his body. I am not sure how he didn't expect this to happen. He blamed his brother a lot, rather than himself. He had seen his older brother, an alcoholic for a long time, drink and drink and drink, but he was ""fine"" he was ""healthy"". Thankfully, this was what it took to get him to stop drinking. I wish I could say it was for good.

He fell off the wagon last October. I found out when my step-mom called me crying saying he was drinking and threatening her. He later told me he ran out of his meds and didn't have any insurance to get more. He tried going to rehab, but they sent him home because it was a psych thing, not alcohol. I didn't believe him. I was pissed. He sent me angry e-mails, apologetic e-mails. I sent him an e-mail back telling him I was done and that I couldn't handle this back and forth. That I couldn't handle him putting himself back in the hospital and on the verge of death because he wanted a drink. I told him I couldn't handle listening to his wife cry on the phone to me not knowing what to do. It all just broke my heart. I vented all of my angry feelings that I had held against him for years. I ignored his e-mails, texts, and FB messages (I blocked him). 

I hadn't talked to him since. Come Tuesday, I found out that he and his wife had moved to Mississippi for work because he had finally found a job. I found out that I didn't have a working phone number for them. I asked my sister for his wife's phone number after finding out from my sister that when the ambulance arrived at their house, he had lost so much blood from internal bleeding that he should have been dead. I had just gotten to work and learned this. I broke down and lost it crying. I called my step-mom and found out that the surgery he was about to have was risky since he was took weak, but if they didn't do it he would die anyway. I came home as I was in no state to work.

Luckily, my boyfriend had worked from home on Tuesday and was here when I came home. Not too long after getting home, I get a call from my step-mom. He was out of surgery, but couldn't stop the bleeding, so it was only a matter of time. I hung up the phone and it rang again an hour later after he had passed. I didn't expect to be so upset. I really didn't. 
I thought I had convinced myself that it wouldn't hurt so much because we weren't that close, because he did it to himself, because ultimately he killed himself, albeit slowly.

I just needed to get this out. I was such a bitch to him in the months before he died, and while I do feel he deserved that attitude from me, it sucks that he might have died feeling like I hated him. My step-mom told me he really wanted to go back to work so that he could contribute to my sister's upcoming wedding as well as my future wedding. So as I was over here doing my best to avoid contact with him, he was still doing what he could to look out for me. How fucked is that?

t3_24hiai,I really need some support TwoX..,"First off, let me warn you: The following will probably sound like very immature problems, but right now, at 18, these are the worst things happening to me.

I recently got out of the mental unit in a hospital for suicide thoughts and attempt. Why did I want to kill myself? Because I've been severely depressed for years, have extremely low self-esteem, have wild mood swings and depended 200% on this guy for my happiness. Then I found out he was going to sleep with another girl, a few days after sleeping with me. Four years of knowing him, of loving him, and of thinking he genuinely cared for me, and this happened. I was, or am, in love with a jerk and I just CAN'T get over him.

This past week was my first week back from the hospital. He hasn't spoken a single word to me. He knows I was at a hospital, he knows the severity of the effect of what he did had on me. I go home every day thinking he will text me, like he always did every day, and I'm finding myself to miss him more and more each passing moment.

And a few minutes ago... well I just found out he asked a girl to prom. My ex-best friend, a girl I've thought has always been 100 times more beautiful than I ever will be. And it's like... two weeks ago he was treating me like I was the only girl he ever wanted, while he was planning something with another girl, and now, he's probably going to start talking to yet another girl. I've completely been erased from his life, in a matter of a week. And it fucking HURTS.

I feel like any progress I've made, I've lost. I'm right back to square one, where I'm feeling like an ugly piece of shit, undeserving of anyone, who's mental illness is what probably exhausted him and led him to go to another girl. I wish I could be normal and just say ""forget him."" But I can't. Every day I see him and I miss his voice, his touch, his scent. I miss him supporting me and telling me everything will be okay. I miss him.

I'm supposed to be getting better. I'm supposed to focus on myself and treating my depression. These meds are supposed to be working. But I'm losing it again, and I don't want to end up at the hospital.

I'm sorry if this was the wrong subreddit to post on. But I admire all of you and see you all as such powerful, confident women. Women I wish to be like one day. I'm 18, I hardly know anything, but everything I've known so far has destroyed me.

t3_24h75q,Abnormal PAP After LEEP last October - Insight Appreciated,"I had my first abnormal PAP when I was 19. I was told by Planned Parenthood not to worry about it, everything would probably clear up without interference so it promptly slipped my mind.

Fast forward to last July, I was 24 (25 now) and I had another abnormal PAP. This time (because of my age I guess?) they decided to do a colposcopy/biopsy. Came back CIN1/2. I had the LEEP done in October. My margins were NOT clear btw.

My first follow-up in January came back normal, but the one from two weeks ago didn't. I have another colpo/biopsy scheduled for next thursday.

For those of you who've had to deal with this before, how many rounds of biopsies and procedures did you have? Is there any correlation between reoccurrence and the eventual progression to cancer? 

I really like and trust my GYN, but the whole office seems to be very dismissive with my concerns. 

I don't have children, but I'm not sure I want them (and am certain I don't want to go thru the pain of childbirth!).

Long time lurker, first time poster. However I could really use your advice and/or opinion on my current situation. I'll try to keep the rant as concise as possible.

So there is this FWB I have, let's call him Chris. Last Saturday, Chris helped me with the preparations for a party I'd throw and at some point he told me about this semi-threesome he had had a week ago. It had been with two mutual acquaintances (a couple), it had involved making out and heavy petting and he told me he'd rather enjoyed it. Half-jokingly I said he ought to call me before their next session, because I'd like to join them. It sounded like fun and I had wondered before what a threesome (or in this case, foursome) would be like. However, we did not go into deep detail on the subject.
The couple showed up at the party that night and the guy talked to me a couple of times in a really flirty way. Chris had apparently informed him that I knew about the threesome-ish and this guy kept inviting me and Chris over for lunch and some board games some time. 
Yesterday evening I was on the phone with Chris and during the conversation I mentioned that I might have been a little oblivious (I am known for always being the last one to find out about something really obvious) but that the guy maybe had wanted to invite me to join their little circle of love sometime. So Chris laughed and said that yeah, he had told the couple that I wanted to join them the next time.
At first, I just felt a little uncomfortable. I really hate it when something is decided for me and I'm only informed in order to confirm the deal. But gradually, I became more and more angry and hurt. It wasn't just that I would find it harder to say 'no' now that they all expected me to go with it. It was the whole thought that Chris had proposed such a thing in my name without me explicitly asking for it. It felt like I was being pimped. And Chris initially really didn't see the point. He really didn't want to hurt me so he was sorry but I had to walk him through my thought process in order for him to understand. Which in a way makes it worse. Apparently it had not crossed his mind that it was none of his business to take such initiatives without involving me.

And now I'm having this huge mindfuck. Is it just me overreacting that I am so offended and hurt? I know I said I might be in for joining them, should I've seen it coming that Chris would tell them right away at the first opportunity he had without explicitly checking with me first?

I'm sorry for the rant, I am just really confused. I know Chris wouldn't want to hurt me or mistreat me in any way and I can't seem to wrap my head around why this shit has happened.",0,20140501091552,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24ih2l,I'm living with my coworkers and I'm going to lose my shit.,"This is long. Work and personal space issues. Please help. 

So. I recently left my home of 23 years to move to a city 5x the size for a better job. 

This job is stressful! Typically, 45+ hour weeks, long commute, and I have a decent dislike for my boss, but I make it through and do my job well. 

I've been working here for about 5 months now, and one of our big projects for this quarter involves a decent amount of travel. 

We got a short term rental house for the time we have to spend at our second office and I'm about to loose my cool. 

I'm a quiet, reserved person. I normally live with my husband, daughter, and since we moved one of our good friends.

 I've never had a roommate. Never shared my space with someone I didn't love 100%. 

Until recently, I had only ever spent 2 nights away from my husband since we moved in together in 2008. 

I've been away since Sunday, I'll have a week home, then two weeks here. 

I'm tired. Day starts at 6, it's loud. People are stomping, playing music loudly, and being generally aggravating. 

We're at the office from 7:30-6pm typically. Come home, and it's loud and stressful again. Around 7:30 everyone starts working again and stops around 11 or midnight. I can work that much, god knows I have stuff to do, but I can't be ON that much. I can't stand talking about work any more. 

I'm tired. I'm surrounded by people. I can't not participate (my boss, her boss, and the company president are ALL here), but I don't want to work 15 hour days, go hiking, go running, go golfing... 

For dinner tonight, all I wanted was a burger. I spoke up about it, planned it out with a few people, and we were down. I left to take a shower and they had ordered sushi while I was gone. I have no car here - can't go get a burger. I dislike sushi, but I'm not a complainer. I've eaten it the last THREE DAYS because it's what two people wanted. Some one offered to take me to grab one, but it was in a very ""ugh, I guess if we have to deal with you"" way. 

I'm hungry. I'm tired. I feel like my space is being violated. I've never shared a space with this many women before (10 others). I miss my husband. I miss my daughter. 

I'm the only one here married with a child. I don't bitch or complain about missing them, but some one said, ""It's probably hardest for you here!"" I agreed it was difficult and I missed my family, and my boss scoffed and rolled her eyes. 

I don't know what the fuck to do TwoX. I'm not a crier, but I'm about to rage on people. I'm not complaining - I'm smiling and laughing and being involved, but I just don't have it in me to keep going. ",12,20140501220454,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24ianu,How do you deal with unwanted attention (i.e. catcalling?),"Hey everyone,

Summer is approaching and with that, comes warm weather and a change of wardrobe. Where I live, it's been quite the hot week after having a cool spring, and I'm slowly getting readjusted to shorts, skirts, and tank tops. Unfortunately with the [skimpier] clothing, I've already experienced a fair share of unwanted attention and catcalling on sidewalks and intersections (doesn't help that I tend to walk everywhere and take transit). Of course, clothing, or lack thereof doesn't necessarily, directly correlate with street harassment, but it's undeniable that it definitely tends to spike in the summer. 



The perpetrators tend to usually be older, scruffier looking men (truck drivers, construction workers, etc.) who look like my dad's age, or greasy-looking womanizers, and thus I never feel comfortable or consider ""flattered"". It just makes me feel completely uncomfortable and kind of messes with my somewhat low self-esteem, not to mention making it difficult to pick an outfit in the morning as I become very conscious of myself and how I carry myself. 


There's been times where I've been extremely riled up and yell back at the perps, or show the finger. It can definitely be difficult ignoring at times, especially when you're a bit of a hothead like me. 

So, how do you all handle street harassment/unwanted attention?

t3_24i1bk,"Considering facial mole removal, my GP heavily discourages it because of the possibility of scarring. Tell me the truth, how noticeable/distracting is this mole?","I have a mole on my face that is a birthmark, it is not cancerous or shiny/bumpy. It is matte black and I always pluck any hairs that grow near it.  I have had it since birth obviously. I was a shy kid and a lot of people when I was in elementary school used to ask ""what is that"" which made me develop a self conscious feeling about it. I feel so uncomfortable knowing that there's people out there, that don't know me that well and have to refer to me in conversation, say ""that person with the mole."" There's just this general idea that moles are unattractive, and even if they are on an attractive person, they are just always brought up in conversation. I'm a shy person and I don't like the idea of having a feature that makes me easily distinguishable from other people. 

I feel as though people see it before they see my face, and that it's gaudy and makes me look old and gross. When I was 15 my parents let me go to the doctor to ask about the removal process. He said it would scar really badly and my parents told me to keep it because of that. Now 5 years later I go to the same family doctor by myself and ask about it again. He says that he can't do removal because it's extra risk for him or something, and was going to recommend me to a surgeon that would charge $300. He also said that the scar would be ""ugly"" and possibly a ""keloid."" He made the surgery sound very gruesome like they would cut it and sew it back together. I don't know what's behind his motivation to make the process and recovery sound so damn bad. 

I feel like there are other doctors who could do it for less and who would be more helpful, but there aren't many specialists around here who will take you without a referral. 

Is this procedure really as bad as my doctor describes it, or is it more simple and can heal nicely? I have a few cartilage ear piercings that never got scars, and any cuts I've had never left scars either so I feel like I'm not prone. I haven't had major surgery though. I wouldn't mind a flat scar because I can cover it with makeup. The doctor acts like this huge inch tall keloid is GOING to form.

I thought about whether I still want to or not, and I realized that this hasn't really stopped me from doing anything, I have had a lot of success at getting jobs that I want and I have a long term boyfriend. But I am always scared to meet new people that I have to impress because I feel like they're looking at this mole.. 

I have only asked my mom and best friend about this because it's embarassing to talk about extensively and I don't want people to lie and say it's okay, or tell me that it's huge and distracting to my face. That's why I would really appreciate your two cents. Don't be afraid to tell the truth! Is it the first thing you see? Does it distract from me? When you see me, do you instantly think ""girl with a mole?""

t3_24hr9k,Anyone here not have many (local) friends and are single? How do you deal/keep yourself busy?,"What's the longest you've gone without really interacting with anyone? I find myself being able to go almost a week without any quality social/human interaction and that's scary. I don't even want to count how many Saturdays it's been now that I've spent by myself. I mean, I guess it's a good thing that I fall more on the introverted side, but it still sucks. 

Despite my many attempts at expanding my social circle, I always find myself feeling very lonely because I just don't have that many friends. I don't need a lot of friends (quality over quantity) but the downfall to that is when my friends are all out of town, busy, or off doing things I'm not interested in (e.g. bar hopping or clubbing), I find myself alone, wishing for human interaction but not having anyone to reach out to.  I'm starting to dread the question, ""How/what did you do this weekend?"" I can fill my schedule with classes and volunteering to keep myself busy, but the interaction I get with people then isn't always enough. Even though I know I'm not ready to date, I find myself almost wanting to find a relationship just so I have a built in hang out buddy. I don't like that mindset, but it just goes to show how frustrated I am I guess. =/

Anyways, the point of this post isn't asking how to change my situation (and meet new people,etc.), as I already know how... but I'm more interested in how you lovely ladies spend your time, and how you deal/cope with being alone and/or the possible loneliness that can come with that.

t3_24hmju,I need advice.,"I'm in university and my housemate of this year is moving out to be with her boyfriend of 1 year, and basically told me what they were going to do.

 Back in December he told her that they were moving in together and I wasn't told until January, later we decided that I would move in with them too so the rent would be cheaper. That changed without my knowledge in about March. Then today they told me that he was taking the router. I'm in the middle of exams and they are just taking the internet away. Again they didn't ask me they just told me. 

So I tried to talk with my housemate about it but she wouldn't listen to me and kept interrupting and I yelled at her, which I understand I shouldn't have done. I just don't know what to do.

I feel like my opinion doesn't matter and that her boyfriend is all that matters. What makes things worse is that he stayed over a lot and doesn't pay rent and still is treated like he is the only thing that matters. ",0,20140501162558,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I stopped taking it due to insatiable hunger and some intense mood swings. The hunger stopped but now I feel so weird. Some new symptoms are:

1. My fingers and toes feel like they're on fire.

2. Not hungry at all. I get jittery if I don't eat but no actual hunger pangs. 

3. The worse one, crazy mood swings. I recently got back from school and I thought the reason for the dramatic changes in my mood were because of finals stress. It's not. I just ended up screaming at my poor parents for asking me to stop being snarky. I told my mom she must hate me and told my dad he was freaking out because of his PTSD (touchy subject). I ended up running to my room and hyperventilating in my closet. 

Before I started taking birth control I was a stoic, calm, person who never cried and who was joking referred to as cold by friends/family because I didn't let stuff faze me. Now I feel like all my emotions have been magnified by 1000 and if I'm not overly happy, I'm sobbing or pissed off.

t3_24i4yr,"I'm moving Saturday from the apartment that has been my home for 5 years. I'm worried but excited, and a little scared.","I own the apartment I've been living in for the past five years jointly with my parents. I live here alone (for the most part, see below) and I like it that way...We decided that it's time to cash in on the investment (Okay, they decided but I'm okay with it) and I happened to find an amazing, quirky loft space that I'm very excited about. It's only 15 minutes away by car, but that 15 minutes gives you a giant change - right now, I live in the middle of a major US city. My new apartment is just north of the city, in an...urban suburb (?). It has no buildings attached to it, it's on a busy road that doesn't lend itself to walking around (I have a car but have never relied on it for everything like I'm going to have to now). I have been able to walk 90 seconds outside my front door to go buy milk/cat food/toilet paper at 2am for the past 7 years. It's a big change. 

Being that I've lived in this busy (college kids, sports fans, marathon runners...) neighborhood for 7 years, I'm worried I'll become a shut-in or that my friends won't come to the new apartment or that it won't feel like home.

t3_24i3gg,"[UPDATE] Buddy system and advice needed regarding labels and ""good guys""","Hi TwoX! So I made a post previously about using the buddy system after I was left behind at the bar, got a ride with a ""nice guy"" who tried to take me home, had to walk back to my own house after being locked out at 3am, ended up losing my belongings that I gave to a friend and in the end was told it was my fault completely. I understand it may have been a miscommunication between friends but I took your advice that most (if not all gave me) and went my own way instead of continuing our friendship as it isn't the first time this has happened to me or to the others.

I've also decided to take it a step further and seek therapy (not just because of this issue) and so far, I'm feeling better. With that being said, since your advice worked the first time I'm back for round two.

Since that night (in which I overreacted) I've had some mean comments thrown my way, mostly stating I'm crazy. Truthfully it's getting to me and I'm trying pretty hard to get better and I don't know what to do.

To give a shortcut, that night at the bar I was talking to a guy for three hours just at a table and literally didn't move. I should have spent the night with my friends but considering they were doing the same, I didn't think it was a huge deal. My friends left without me, without checking, and I made the mistake of assuming that we were all going to get a taxi like we always do. Around 1am I started searching and realized they were gone and at 2am eventually I got a ride with a ""nice guy"" I went to school with.

I told him, along with his friend, that I had to go back to my other friends house and they assured me it worked out because my friend Alison's house was on the way to their own. I thank them and I hail a cab. I am drunk at this point (as it's St.Pattys day) and as I get in the taxi I not only repeat that I'm going to Alison's house and where it is located to them, but also to the taxi driver.

I'm pretty on edge at this point as it's coming on to 3am and you know, my friends have ditched me and I literally don't have anyone except these two guys- plus i'm drunk. Anyway, the nice guy Steve, tells the taxi driver to go to his apartment. I figured I would get dropped off on the way back and Steve briefly forgot where I was going as he was tipsy as well. They both get out, Steve and his friend Chris, and I refused.

Long story short, Steve tries to convince me to get out of the taxi and go back to his place for the night. I keep saying no. He tries to assure me along with his friend, I can go back to Alisons's tomorrow. It's coming on to 3:30 am and I say no, that's not what we agreed upon. They keep trying until the taxi driver tells them to go inside and gives me a free lift.

Now the kicker that sort of makes me think I'm possibly being targetted by these people and being victimized for ""talking down"" about nice guy Steve, is because when the taxi driver closed his taxi and began driving he deliberately told me multiple times how I made the right decision. He even went further to say that he use to do that when he was young and Steve knew the entire time, along with the taxi driver, where I was going and was just playing dumb/taking advantage that I was intoxicated in an attempt to get lucky.

Mentioned that it was a bit messed up he did it in the first place and he heard me several times not only say I'm not going home with them but give directions where I wanted to (I was correct that it was on the way to their house). Eventually I got back to Alisons's, was locked out, needed my stuff to get back to my own apartment, was angry, scared, sad and I did completely overreact. I was banging on the door crying when it sort of hit me I could have been raped (stupid I know) and I was angry my friends left me behind. Long story short, I got in a fight with the girl who lost my coat and ever since, pretty sure she, along with Alison's housemate who didn't know what completely happened, have been spreading some awful stuff. 

I overreacted but ever since, I'm labelled crazy for thinking Steve would even do such a thing. I don't know what to do, I feel like I am crazy which is why I'm getting therapy but apart of me also is considering that I'm also partially being victimized by these people. I moved away for a year and no one ever called me crazy (that I'm aware of). We all went to high school together and it's like no one ever dropped my label and they keep building on. I don't know how to escape it. How do you know when you're crazy? 

As said, I think I have an idea how all those girls feel who have truly been raped and had no one believe them due to their past decisions or responses. No one looks at the situation objectively but I think what hurts most and what's bringing me down, is that no one wants to take my side because it's so easy to blame these bad encounters on my ""crazy"". I wish someone would sit me down for once and really ask my side of what happened instead of just turning cheek. What does it matter. I'm crazy, nothing I feel or think makes sense to anyone.

tdlr; Bad friends left me at the bar alone, ""good guy"" Steve offered me a cab ride, tried to take me home, I'm crazy/mean weeks after for thinking he would ever take advantage of a woman

- People wearing summer clothes are still humans
- Staring and asking for people's time while they are wearing summer clothing is harassment

She makes me  wear extra layers, even in 80+ degree weather. She inspects my outfits every day now, and no one else’s.

Wanna know the real kicker? It’s because I’m a bit fuller. None of the other girls in my class are targeted by her. Only once has any other girl been told to cover up, and she was wearing an undershirt under a really cute dress. I’ve even asked her why my body offends her and why female anatomy offends her. I’ve even gone as far as to tell her that what she’s doing is unfair to me, and that I shouldn’t be punished for my body and the way clothes cover it.

She told me I look like I’m asking for something bad to happen to me if I was in China. **NO ONE EVER ASKS TO BE MOLESTED**

Now if I were honestly doing something crude or offensive, or just downright inappropriate for a school setting, I’d understand, but all I’m doing is wearing a dress with some unicorns on it. 
Tomorrow I’m going to wear this dress again and if I get in trouble for it, I’m reporting her. My parents are on my side in doing this too, and are telling me to record the conversations that may happen is she makes me stay in during break.

t3_24ivc0,boyfriend views daily sexism as an imagined first world problem and it's driving me insane,"Hey TwoX, I've been a little bit frustrated lately and thought to come to you guys. 

I'm currently in school, and it's been awesome. My first year I took a course on sexuality which had a brief feminism unit that I really, really enjoyed. It felt at once empowering and devastating to examine feminist issues. Anyways, I've been much more active on that front and enjoy discussing it with my girlfriends. However, I've realized that I absolutely cannot vocalize any kind of complaint about daily sexism to my boyfriend because he thinks it's some kind of first world problem!! I am not at all preachy about it (last time it came up, I told him I wished more of the movies we watched had leading female protagonists), and I've lately realized it's better not to talk about any kind incidents that might hint at inequality, sexism, oppression, etc in daily life because of how he reacts to it, but now he likes to ask me about it just so he can ""debunk"" modern sexism and turn it around to tell me that because I've lived a pretty nice life it's laughable for me to try to claim that I've faced any kind of oppression. To give you a better idea, in our last argument, I told him he would probably never really understand unless he spent the day as a woman, to which he told me I've ""won the lottery"" as an attractive and educated woman, and if I occasionally wish I had been born otherwise, I have some kind of ""messed up perspective on life.""

I'm almost at my wits end. Like I said, it's not as though I go around moaning and crying about having a terrible life...because I don't. I had a great childhood and am pursuing a great education, but just like any other woman I do experience daily sexism and really hate being made to feel as though I am actually just insane/spoiled/whatever. I've tried my best to recall what we went over in that sexuality class, and usually fall back on the [caged-bird metaphor](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marilyn_Frye) but he just isn't having it. I honestly would prefer to just leave it alone but, like I mentioned, he has taken to trying to bring it up from time to time and it's just exhausting. He is very facts-oriented, so if any of you perhaps had some kind of literature I could direct him to, or really just general advice, that would be great. He's very intelligent and I love him for every other quality but unfortunately his father is a bit sexist and I think it's starting to show in him. ",17,20140502013319,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24j5gu,Thinking about going off the pill,"I've been using one brand or another of birth control pill for about 4 years now.  

The first one I used for a couple years killed my sex drive.  I switched last summer, and that issue is better, but I feel like my acne and mood swings are way worse on this one.  Now when I PMS, I get so irritated and even straight up angry, it's ridiculous.  I also feel like my mood throughout my cycle and even throughout individual days fluctuates like crazy - going from perfectly content and happy to crushed and disgusted with myself and then back again just like that.

Soon after I switched to this new BC, I moved to a new city and started graduate school, so maybe stress and a new environment has something to do with these symptoms, but I can't really isolate the variables.  I've also been dealing with (self-diagnosed) depression/low self-esteem for a while now.

I just want to be in control of my emotions again!  I don't know which of my emotions are real and which are affected/caused by my medicine.  I feel like I don't know who I really am.

So, does anyone else feel like their BC affects their mood this much?  Does switching to a different brand/formula help?  I am a bit tired of shopping around though and want to give it up entirely.  How long does it take for your body to stabilize after stopping the pill?  I am going to study abroad for 7 weeks this summer.  If I decide to stop taking the pill, should I wait until I am back home?

Thank you for reading my ramblings, and I appreciate any advice you may have.

TL;DR: birth control affecting my mood too much (?); looking for advice/similar experiences.",2,20140502052241,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24isvr,"High-school just got a lot worse today, should I move schools?","Some back story, tonight was a farewell bonfire party to some exchange students. We are all 15-16. I bought the food, firewood and planned everything. The party is awesome for the first few hours then some kids who weren't invited showed up and everything went to shit. 

A brief overview.

* I was called a bitch for asking no one to bring alcohol (we would get suspended or expelled because it's considered school time)
* I was made fun of for having dark leg hair, which means you can see my hair follicles even if I shave.
* I was told I had small tits
* I was called fat because I didn't want to take off my shorts while swimming (I have really bad stretch marks and don't shave my pubic hair because I am lazy and have sensitive skin)
* My best friend told me not to be jealous of her because she was about to kiss a boy and I was not.
* My other best friend went off and flirted with the guy who made fun of my small breasts and dark hair. For three hours. Even though she said she hated him, though now it seems she loves the attention. This guy hash-tags his own selfies with, #handsome, #goodlooking. 
* Kids started lighting random stuff on fire. The 'random stuff' was my belongings I had brought for the party, i.e. bags of chips, tubs I carried the stuff in, some paper towels. 

This does not do justice to hell-hole that was disguised as a party. 

Everything that happened is so trivial but it adds up over time and I'm just worn out. My thick skin can't protect for this long. 

I go to a school that has maybe 40 kids within the grade, 12 of them being female. It is a K-12 private school and I have now been with these kids for five years (I transferred in grade 5.) I was hoping maybe I could just disappear, float away. But in a school this small it's impossible.

But my question is, with two years of high school left, should I move schools? Is it better in a bigger school where the kids aren't stuck up private schoolers who love to prove that mommy and daddy didn't shelter them? 

Have any of you changed schools this late in the game? What kind of school should I go for? Public, private? 

Any advice would be lovely. I'm sitting in my room right now just frustrated and over-whelmed, so much so that I feel like crying.",2,20140502004915,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24jsn0,High School Dress Code & Rape Culture Rant,"So I'm a student teacher at a high school (I'm a 26 year old woman). We've been having a heat wave, and the admin has been cracking down on student dress code. It should be noted that our school has no women in the administration or in the student management office. A couple days ago, a female student put up posters around the school to the effect that the dress code (which is heavily female-biased) was promoting rape culture, since it cited the distracting influence of female dress on boys. In my opinion, she's not wrong.

The principal punished the student who put up the posters, cracked down on a planned protest by several students, and had a meeting with some of the more vocal students about this. This morning we had a staff meeting so he could update us on what's been going on. He clearly thinks it's a joke. He said he didn't know what rape culture was - that he had to do some research - and made some comments that he thinks students are doing this to ""try to be feminist."" He went on to say that ""being a feminist means you shouldn't dress like that,"" and that ""boys wear inappropriate things sometimes too!"" He also made some classist comments about how our poor students (we're a high poverty school) don't know how to dress, because poor people don't know what's appropriate for the workplace. The district is re-writing the dress code with gender-neutral language, but the fact remains that the administration, and most of the teachers (largely men and older women), are treating this like a joke. 

It's not a joke. Part of our job as teachers is teaching and discussing appropriate socialization. Part of our job is to teach our students that they have a voice. Our job is to speak truth. Rape culture is not a joke. It's not something that will go away with re-writing the dress code or telling students they can't wear short-shorts. Punishing a student for speaking her mind about something that matters to her - and should matter to everyone - is disgusting. Expecting, and requiring! female students to be ashamed of their bodies (when our culture idolizes and fetishizes their young female bodies) is disgusting. Not having any female admin is disgusting and backwards. Blaming this on class and parenting is disgusting. 

I'm pissed as hell. I can't do anything - I'm a student teacher. I can't talk to the principal because I'd jeopardize my chances of getting a job (the principal is a required reference for a lot of districts). My supervising teacher - who's a woman - is pretty conservative, and I don't want to piss her off, again because of references, but also because I need a to have a working relationship with her for the next 8 weeks. I basically have to keep my mouth shut. I was going to apply for a job here, but I'm seriously reconsidering doing that. I don't want to work in a sexist, classist environment like this. I don't want to work in a place where student, and especially female voices are treated like they don't matter. 

Am I wrong to be pissed about this? Am I reading too much into it? Should I jeopardize my career to speak out about this (I'm considering it)? ",23,20140502105411,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I was the first person to be hired onto the team to do a certain line of work, but I've never been allowed to do that line of work because I ""don't have enough experience,"" but several of the male employees that we brought in after me had less experience than I do.  One of them had NO experience.  I've been dealing with this for more than a year and a half, and he still says I'm ""not ready"".

Every time I've talked with him and he's told me what i need to do to be ready, once I've done all those things, he says that I'm not ready and gives me a new list.  No one else has ever had to do anything of the sort.

Without prompting, more than one of my teammates has brought up to me that it seems like our boss is discriminating against me because I'm a woman.  I agree, because at this point, it's the only difference between me and anyone else on the team.

In August my boyfriend and I found out I was pregnant (big surprise) but when I went for a scan at 8 wks the doctor said I was going to miscarry. Because I was moving soon after that date I opted to have a D&C to get everything over with before I moved. I told my mom but not my dad (they're not together) and I even debated that because it wasn't planned, I'm still in school, etc. My mom is not a real source of support and we're not speaking now, and my relationship ended as well.

I didn't tell any of my dad's side of the family about this, but I'm living in the same city as them now so am closer to them than I was.

I don't know what to do, or how to talk about it with him. It's something I've tried talking to him before about, twice, and both times he told me that it was none of my business, essentially, and to ask him ""in the morning.""

I haven't properly talked to him about it during waking hours, partly because I don't know what to say, and when I begin to speak, the words don't come out, and I'm not sure what to say, and I always cry.

He says don't worry about him, etc, but I just... I'm at a loss. Have you ladies dealt with this before? Do you have any advice? How to approach him, what to say to him, if anything at all. I really, really feel helpless, and I know it's his disorder, so it's personal... but at the same time, I hate when he eats because I know right afterward, about twenty to thirty minutes, he'll be in the bathroom for about an hour. 

It's like this huge weight on my chest, and I don't know what the fuck to do.

I'm so worried, and I was curious if any of you have dealt with this or are in a similar situation. 

What should I do?
How should I act?
How/What should I ask (if at all)?

I'll type out my question and maybe you guys can point me in the right direction. 

On 4/21 my ex lured me to his apartment and raped me. Looking back at the messages earlier that day it seemed like it was premeditated. I went to the cops (a few days late... I was scared) and got a case and my phone messages/call logs copied for them. I also went to the hospital to get bruises photographed, poked, swabbed, and drugged up with antibiotics. I went in again later that week and gave them copies of messages from my facebook. He logged onto my daughters account since I had all of his accounts blocked and in those messages it states him raping me and his craziness... when I block accounts he makes new ones to message me. He's showed up at my work and home unannounced.  

My problem is it's been over a week and I haven't heard anything from the cop, detective, lawyers, anyone, about anything. I've gone in left papers, called and left messages, and in the meantime my ex is messaging me and driving around free and starting up a new relationship with another girl. He got a new car and new tv, and is living his life while I'm stuck being afraid every little noise is him coming for me. 

Who do I need to talk to to get him arrested? How long does an investigation of rape take when there's messages about how he's raped me? I can't live with him free to pop by at any time... Im at work alone a lot and there's no way anyone else can be scheduled with me.",10,20140502202022,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

But those dreams quickly turn sour from the struggles and pain my parents went through raising two special needs boys.   I suppose, as a defense and coping mechanism, I've decided that instead of pining away at wanting a child but being too scared, it's easier to just decide that I vehemently don't want a child, even though, that's the polar opposite from the truth.  

It's tough to talk about, and I don't have any sort of support system to talk about this to.  So, hurrah for the anonymity of the internet.  I needed to get this out in the open.",0,20140502212511,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24laph,"Please help me regain trust with my boyfriend. (semi long, please read)","I am 21 y/o and just moved across the country with my 30 y/o boyfriend.

Super long story short, I am not a cheater, never have cheated. I had an old boyfriend of three years who mutually broke up with around Sep-Oct. of 2013. I started reconnecting with my current bf (we were past friends) in November, even though he lived across the country we got along super well, and I recently moved across the country for him a month ago.

Fast forward to last night. I get an angry e-mail from my ex (who has a severe history with depression finding a drunken post I posted a while ago when I was down saying I wasn't interested in my new boyfriend and was lost (I immediately deleted it the next morning, feeling it wasn't true and I was being stupid). He told me I cheated on him, blah blah blah, making me feel like shit.

And what do I do? The dumbest, most regretful thing. I played sorry for him, telling him I loved him and missed him in an e-mail, that I made a mistake by moving, because I didn't know how else to comfort him. I definitely never cheated on him! We were over, and I guess he always thought things could rekindle. I moved on and didn't even start dating my newer SO until two months or so ago, (April 2014) and I moved on before our break up. 

So I delete the email, and hurt start crying to my SO saying what happened and how I wasn't a cheater. (It hurt me so much because I did/stuck around a lot for him, and that wasn't me. It made me furious along with having a low depression month after my grandfather's recent passing) I didn't tell him about the e-mails I sent back, because I didn't want him to know honestly. I didn't know what to do, I felt stupid and lost. And I know, I KNOW, it was wrong.

Fast forward a few hours later, my SO wakes me up hurt because he saw the e-mails. He was confused, thought I was telling the truth in them (of course he did, why wouldn't he) and we talked for a few hours while I balled my eyes out. Worst of all, he saw the reddit post about him which made me so so sad, because I deleted it so quickly and my ex got a hold of it and e-mailed it to me, I of course didn't want any one to see it, I felt like it was a journal entry. He forgave me when I explained everything, which was bold and mighty of him since his ex of three years cheated on him a ton with multiple men.

We talked more this morning, and things seem to be a little better. I am still heartbroken and in so much regret, I have been crying on and off. I also wrote an email to my ex saying the truth and that I wasn't coddling him anymore.

I don't deserve his forgiveness but I will do everything in my power to prove my love to him. This is a super summarized version, so if you need elaboration I will. I just want to know if anyone has ever been in this situation and how I can go about gaining his trust back? I know it takes time, but I want to show him I would never, ever, cheat on him. I just had a stupid mistake feeling low and vulnerable, but I would never touch, or kiss another man while being in a relationship.

t3_24lchf,Thrush,"So uh. I made a post in this subreddit before about [a problem I have](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jtpyg/i_dont_know_what_a_vagina_looks_like_and_im/) (I've forgotten the password for that account, it's been two years). I kind of haven't managed to overcome that problem since that thread, and I know that makes me kind of shitty and pathetic but whatever. 

Anyway, the big problem now is I think I have thrush. I've got an appointment with my GP next week because I've got a pretty nasty infection around one of my nipples which is no fun and the antibiotics I was on didn't clear it up at all. Really they just made my life a little bit worse. Anyway, the thought of talking to my GP about my vagina is horrifically daunting for me, and the possibility of having to actually show my vagina is already giving me panic attacks, but even beyond that I'm fairly certain the solution will involve putting something into my vagina and I don't know if it's something I can do, but I don't think I can explain that to my doctor without sounding like I'm insane. 

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me. Or... I don't know, I'm not sure really what I'm hoping to get out of this. In all honesty I'm hoping it magically disappears before I see my GP and I never have to mention it again.

Edit: Or you could downvote me. That's helpful too I guess. If this should be in a different subreddit, can someone let me know instead of just silently downvoting? Or I dunno. Whatever. I guess it's a stupid problem. 

Update: I haven't seen my doctor yet, but I got an over-the-counter cream to use on the meantime, though I'm not really 100% certain where I'm putting it which probably isn't a good thing, but hey, better than nothing, right? I tried taking a picture to see if I could figure shit out, but I couldn't even see any openings and now I just feel sick on top of everything else.

Edit 2: Okay, I guess I'll go now, people are just kind of downvoting everything I say so I'm pretty sure I'm not welcome here. I just thought I might be able to get some advice. Someone linked me to [this article](http://www.theperiodblog.com/2013/03/how-to-find-your-vaginal-opening.html) and I'm trying but I still can't find an opening and every time someone said that in the comments the answer seems to be ""Just stick your finger into it"" and I don't see how I can do that if I can't find it.",0,20140502211331,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24kvok,"Just had my first pap smear, and I'm a little confused with the results. I can't call the office until Monday. Help?","So I just went in a couple weeks ago to my university health clinic for my first pap smear. I only started having sex about a year ago, and have only been with two guys. Since going on birth control around 5 months ago, I've noticed a change in discharge, which can be normal at times I've heard. But after I let my bf come inside the first time, I immediately had what seemed to be symptoms of BV. I used some probiotic supplements, and as long as I don't let him come inside me I'm fine. Since we're long distance right now, it hasn't been a problem because we haven't been able to have sex very often at all.

So to the part where I'm confused. I went in for my pap smear, and they post the results online. At the top the note from the doctor states that my pap smear is normal. But below under the specific results it reads, ""a shift in vaginal flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosis"". Should I call my doctor and ask about this? Is it something to be concerned about? or does it simply mean my pH right now is a little high? I unfortunately had the pap smear two days before getting my period, so perhaps that has something to do with it? I'm worried about it, and the office is closed until Monday morning. I'm just afraid that when my bf comes home in a couple weeks from school that its going to start back up. And I thought perhaps some people here could help me out with some insight or advice.

A few months ago I started dating a friend I've had for years. Its fantastic! I've never felt so happy and supported through my whole life. However last night he dropped some heavy news. He might be required to move to the west coast for his job. He is looking to purchase the magazine he has been working at.  This is wonderful news for him and he has questioned whether or not I would be able to attend school in the province where he will be going. I'm about to start my second degree in a very competitive program that is only offered at a handful of schools in my country. There is only one that I could go to and it would be a substantial amount more money than I currently have and would be able to save. 

He won't know if he needs to move for another few months so it's all up in the air. I feel pretty choked and I want to handle this in the healthiest way possible but I'm just not that good at waiting! My last boyfriend told me he was leaving me when he left to go tree planting a month before he left and it was a very miserable month. I think I might be extra edgy because of this. My current boyfriend says he really doesn't want to have to leave me and his family and the wonderful support and community he has built in our city, but this is a huge opportunity for him and at 25 he needs to focus on his career.

Any thoughts or related experience are welcome. If you have any suggestions on how to be level headed about this and wait it out patiently I would so much love to read it!

For the last few weeks we've been planning my nephew's first birthday and the house has been in chaos. My mom, SIL and I have been super busy with planning and cooking on top of going to work and all the other crap we've had to deal with. Today while setting up for the party my dad started to yell at my mom in front of our in laws for not doing more to prepare. This is something that has been a regular occurance throughout my life. My dad has always been the type who's pretty mellow but the second he gets mad or upset he just flies off the handle yelling and screaming horrible things at all of us (in our family). 

Well today I had had enough and told my dad in a firm but low voice to just cut it out this once because the day was meant to be a happy one. Not only did his rage triple but he ran at me screaming at me to shut up. This time however he didn't just run at me screaming like usual, he held up his hand in a closed fist and threatened to ""beat me senseless"". I said ""Do it then!"" and he lunged forward and opened his hand but right before he could hit me stopped, turned, and stalked off. My mom is now upset because she thinks I need to just get over it and move on because, ""that's just how he is.""

I've never been so scared and angry and sad all at once. Writing this now and thinking about it I'm shaking. I'm a fucking 25 year old woman and I don't know what to do. My job doesn't pay quite enough to move out on my own right now and I don't want to tell my boyfriend what happened or he'd never come over to my parents house again. I don't know where to turn. Moving in with my boyfriend isn't really an option because right now he's out of a job and could be returning to his home country if he doesn't find work by fall. 

I need advice please please PLEASE. I can't think straight and every time I think of my dad's face I just want to vomit. I hate him so much right now and I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive him for the hell he's put our family through all these years. I don't know how I can be in this house with him after this or how to go about moving or running away.

After 6 months, I was due for my 3rd shot and after doing some reading online of horror stories people have with it, I decided to just come of depo and not risk anything. Well, that's when my horror story started. From the end of November, when I was due for my 3rd shot, to the end of January I went from looking like [this](http://imgur.com/fbcwb1X,pjjKwV9) to [this](http://imgur.com/fbcwb1X,pjjKwV9#1). I went from about 130-135 to 155-160 in 2 months, with absolutely zero changes to my eating habits. Well, I freaked out thinking my body needed the shot for regulating hormones or something (I don't know, I was just freaking out) and I got a third shot at the end of January. When I got the third shot, I also started working out heavily and tracking every calorie in MFP, staying between 1400-1600 calories. I completed the Jamie Eason ""Live Fit"" 12 week program last week and have had maybe 2 cheat days this entire time I've been trying to lose the extra weight. 

After 3 months of HARD work (harder than I've ever worked before) I lost exactly 0 pounds and 0 inches. It's so frustrating when before, I could work out for a month and see great results, and when I actually NEED to lose weight, and work very hard at it, I've had zero results. It's thrown me into a severe depression. I didn't have the greatest body image or self esteem before (it's always been an issue) and now that I'm packing an extra 25-30 pounds I rarely even leave the house. 

I don't know what to do. This third shot wore off at the end of April, now I'm terrified that I'm going to gain more weight coming off it again. But I want it out of my system, I want my body back. Does *anyone* have any experience and outcome stories with depo? I've read a lot online, but mostly it's a lot of people looking for answers about why they can't lose weight rather than having experience. Any help would be appreciated.

t3_24nje2,My baby sister just turned 8...and I think she's in the earliest stages puberty already. Help!,"So here's what's up. My baby sister just turned 8 not even two weeks ago. I'm 20, we're 12 years apart. She has always grown in quick spurts and been the among the tallest girls in her class. Right now, she comes up to my shoulders (not sure of an exact height measurement, but I'm 5' 2"" if you want to guess off of my shoulder height) and she weighs 70 pounds. For the record, her biological father is 6' 5"", which has to contribute to the height.

As of late, my mom and I have noticed certain changes about her physically and emotionally. For one, she been eating more than usual. A LOT. Thankfully it's mostly healthy stuff (she loves vegetables...and refuses meat, oddly enough. Youngest vegetarian I've ever known) with the occasional spoonful of Nutella and potato chips here and there. Either way, she is putting on weight faster than my mom can buy clothes that fit her. She is nowhere near overweight as she's a very active kid, but I remember going through a phase like that right as I began puberty. She's also become more...self-conscious? I guess? About being clean. My parents are fixing up a house currently and she was over there with them, the entire time complaining that she ""felt gross"" and needed to take a shower because she stunk. When we got home, she was in the shower before we finished unloading stuff out of the car. Just a few months ago you had to force her to bathe, and now she's persistent about keeping clean...another transformation I went through when I started puberty. She's also been having some sleep troubles too. She'll fall asleep at 7pm, be wide awake at 2am (when I usually get home from work) and go back to sleep until morning time. I know your body needs extra rest during those times, which makes me wonder as well if some things are starting to change.

Her emotional changes have been a disaster already! She's already beginning to have mood swings. She will just randomly start crying, and when asked why she's sad she just answers ""I don't know"" or ""I'm just tired"", then she will be perfectly fine 5-10 minutes afterward, like nothing happened. (She's a generally happy kid and is never persistently sad, so we're certain she's not depressed.) My mother and I always tell her it's okay be sad now and then and to cry even if you don't have a reason to.

I know this is all a natural process, but I am so worried for her. I have always been a tiny girl, so I didn't start puberty until I was 11 (at the absolute earliest), started my period when I was 13, and didn't get pubic hair or boobs that amounted to anything until 15-16. I felt as though I developed on the average timeline. I'm worried for my sister though...she's such an early bloomer. I'm afraid other kids might make fun of her at school (she's only in the second grade) or that she might start her period and not know what to do or bleed on her pants and get sad or something. :( My mother plans to have the period talk with her within the next few days and let her dad know to be prepared (she has visitation with her father every weekend.) 

I don't know what I should do as the big sister in the situation. Mom plans on giving her the talk, but little sis has always been my shadow and my partner in crime, and I want to be there for her when she starts going through all this craziness. I want her to feel like she can come to me with questions and be open with me, and I'm sure she will be. I'm just so nervous for her. I don't want her to feel like a freak of nature when all these changes start happening. :(

TwoX, were any of you ""early bloomers""? How did you handle it? What kind of support would you have liked during that time? And any mothers/big sisters of early bloomers/any girl going through puberty, how did you help them navigate the journey into womanhood?

It was a total blindside. I had just fallen in love. And he realized that he still loved his ex girlfriend... the girl he said it would never work with. I had gone to his house to comfort him after a bad day. And he referred to our relationship with the word ""was"". I asked ""So is our relationship in the past then?"" All he said was ""yes, I'm sorry.""

t3_24nrww,Advice/suggestions for how to talk to teen sister about self esteem issues,"Hey Ladies, as my title says, I need some help. 
My youngest sister, 14, is self harming/drinking/doing drugs. My parents immediately went to action when they found out and found a really wonderful therapist that specializes in girls her age with these exact issues, so that's not what I need advice on. 

The issue is this- she has really poor self esteem. She gets down about how she looks, and that manifests in aggression towards me/my mother and self harming. She is the youngest of 4 girls, 7 years younger than my twin and I, and 11 years younger than our oldest sister. She is really into fashion (think [Rookie](http://www.thestylerookie.com)), but does not dress her body type well. In fact, she dresses very poorly.  I'm not sure how to go about talking to about dressing her body type better when she talks to me about her unhappiness with her appearance. 

She gets EXTREMELY hostile if you even so much as mention that the way she dresses is in any way, shape, or form bad, so I don't know what to do. I think she would be happier if she dressed to her body type more, but I can't figure out how to talk to her about it. Any suggestions?

t3_24o38x,"I got fired for a stupid reason, but it's kind of a good thing. [Kind of ranty]","So, the woman who runs my department at my university has taken a severe disliking to me. I don't know why, and she's not dumb enough to admit anything about it directly. Suffice it to say, she has yelled/cursed at me, insulted me, called me things like arrogant, lazy, unprofessional, undedicated, mediocre, etc.

I recently had a departmental review, and several of the professors have said they felt bad about the things that were said there (by her.) I don't think her opinion of me is objective. That is to say, I don't think I really AM lazy, arrogant or any of the other things she has said. Granted, most people don't think that of themselves, but I've gone over and over it in my head and I've asked other people and begged them to be honest, and while I'm not perfect, I'm not as bad as all that.

Some people from outside the situation have said she might be jealous (I'm an art major, and although she has an MFA, we will pretty much be competing in the same shows after I graduate, at least in this my state). I think she might be offended that I taught drawing to some high school kids last summer at a camp without telling/asking her, but I don't need permission from the school to do that. I have also been known to be really harsh with a couple of my peers when they ask for critique on their work, but I usually realize it and try to apologize, and lately, I've been afraid to speak at all about other people's work for fear that she'll be even angrier.

When I got my work-study job, it was because she pressured my boss to hire me. She has used me to pressure other professors about department politics too, in very manipulative and vindictive ways. Since she has taken a disliking to me, she pressured my boss to hire her new pet student, so I've now lost my job and all the power and privilege and responsibility (and the paycheck) that came with it. I normally wouldn't be so bothered by it, but the thing is, the paradigm for my job was to hire someone at the end of their freshman year and let them work the job until their graduation. That's how it was with my predecessor and all the ones before me, as far as I know. I thought I had job security. But this is the end of my junior year, and now I'm jobless. No one else has ever been fired from this job, as far as I know. And while my performance hasn't been perfect, I don't think it was bad enough to have been terminated. I've always gotten everything done on time at the level of quality my boss desired. They didn't even tell me they had fired me or hired someone else or anything. My second boss just got an e-mail telling me to turn in my keys at the end of the semester, which I have never had to do before. This prompted me to ask my boss, and he told me he had already offered the job to someone else but that ""I would be the first to know.""

I am bummed. I am angry. I -almost- want to take it to an authority figure and do something about it, even though I'm not sure I have grounds to. I don't think I'm going to do any of that, though. Now that I've been fired, she doesn't hold any more power over me. I'm 21 years old, I'm going to pull on my big girl pants and get a real part-time job that will probably pay better and will be there after I graduate. I've got a job lined up for the first half of the summer, but in the second half, I'm going to come back to town and get down to business.

Do any of you have some wisdom for me? Tips and tricks on how to deal with a bully in a position of power? Ever been dropped on your ass and had to pick yourself up?",7,20140503221405,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24o185,Follow-up Post: Got my IUD yesterday. It kinda sucked.,"Original post is here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2350gk/wanted_to_share_my_30f_experience_with_getting_an/


TL;DR:  Got an IUD, it hurt in a way I couldn't have imagined.  Still cramping, but would do again.

Here are my stats if you don't want to read the original post.  I am 30, female of course, never had children, in a committed relationship (we're planning to marry).


So.  First, I had to misoprostol 8 hours before the procedure.  It's the generic for cytotec which is used off label to induce labor.  Within an hour I was having moderately painful cramps.  It wasn't bad enough to keep me from work, however, and I did not take any ibuprofen  However, I experienced the unpleasant side affect of diarrhea, which came on VERY suddenly.  


My appointment was at 2:30.  I knew it was going to hurt and the doctor recommended I take some ibuprofen before the appointment.  I have some left over darvocet so I decided to take one of those at 2 as well as 4 ibuprofen  Now I'm obviously not a medical professional.  I don't even know if this is a dangerous combination but I did it.


I got to the appointment and the room was already set up with all the tools.  They had me undress from the waist down.  They asked if I had anymore questions before we got started.  I didn't.  I did tell the doctor I was scared.  She said everyone is scared, even she was, because you don't know what to expect.  My doctor was very reassuring so that was really helpful.  She explained everything she was doing throughout the whole thing.  I got in the stirrups per usual but she had me splay my legs out.  Normally at a gyno appointment my knees are pointing up.  This time she had me point my knees to either side so I was completely wide open.


Usually at a gyno appointment, I don't really experience any discomfort.  Speculum doesn't hurt, getting the cervix cells sample doesn't hurt either.  


First she checked my uterus by having one hand in and one hand out and pushing her hands together.  Then came the speculum.  This actually caused some discomfort because she opened it pretty much as wide as possible.  I felt a lot of pressure and ...like, a stretching feeling.  Then she cleaned the cervix.  She did a couple quick swipes 3 different times with whatever it was she used.  It didn't hurt, just a little pressure.  However, she noticed that I had a polyp on my cervix so she cut it off.  This didn't hurt either.  I hardly noticed it was happening.  That will be sent out and tested.  She told me a lot of women bleed after sex because they have a polyp that is getting hit but don't know it.  (I was experiencing this so it explains a lot!)  This was kind of the only awkward moment because she called in her nurse to bring in a container for the polyp.  So there I am...as wide open as I could possibly be and this other girl is hanging out down there.  I was prepared for one person to be up in my biz but 2 was kind of disconcerting.


So first - she had to measure my uterus.  I don't exactly know what all this entails but something goes up in my cervix...and it hurt.  At that point I knew the actual insertion was going to be worse because the IUD was bound to bigger.  It hurt.  A. Lot. It was like these intense pinching cramps, like everything just seized up.  This was pretty quick though so the pain was over relatively quickly.


Next came the actual insertion.  Nothing could have prepared me for this.  I was mentally prepared to experience pain.  But this wasn't like any pain I've ever felt.  It didn't hurt in the way you think of something being painful - like a shot or a punch in the arm or something.  This experience taught me that there aren't really pain receptors in the cervix and uterus. 


She started the insertion and IMMEDIATELY my body seized up and i was making uncomfortable noises.  My arm went over my head and I started holding my breathe.  Again, it wasn't ""pain"" but more of a sharp, pinching, worst cramps you're ever going to have outside of childbirth type pain.  But it's a constant tight cramp if that makes any sense.  The insertion was longer than the uterus measuring.  I couldn't tell you how long really because it felt like time stood still.  I was really wishing my boyfriend was there to hold my hand at that point - I don't even care if it sounds stupid.  She trimmed the strings during this part and then it was done.


She asked if I wanted to sit but I said I couldn't because I was light headed.  At this point the doctor said to me that she actually almost passed out during her insertion but doesn't tell people that.  Even so, she would do it again and again.  After about 5 more minutes I was able to sit up.  I got dressed, put my panty liner in (was on my  period as requested and though it was light, I expected some bleeding from the insertion), and left.  


I really wish I would have had someone to drive me home.  It hurt. again, just a giant terrible cramp.  It hurt significantly enough that I thought I was going to vomit.  I felt like this for a few hours.  Every bump, even  my pants were hurting me because they were constricting my lower stomach.  I actually checked my seat belt because I though it was on my stomach really tight but it wasn't.  I got home, put on my biggest pair of sweatpants (actually my boyfriend's pants), got my heating pad, curled up in bed and put Mad Men on Netflix.  The heating pad was AWESOME.  It's helped a ton.

As for bleeding...panty liners weren't enough.  I bled through and onto my pants. Now it wasn't like I was gushing blood, it was just more than a panty liner could handle which I really should have thought of.  And it wasn't clumpy and mucous-y period blood either.  I'm pretty sure it was 95% blood caused by the insertion.  It was pretty watery which I'm sure contributed to the messiness.


Today I put in a tampon - which was terrifying - but it was good.  I'm still crampy all the time.  Ibuprofen helps but I still feel it.  I can tell immediately when the ibuprofen wears off because it starts hurting and I also start experiencing lower back pain.  With the ibuprofen it just feels like light period cramps.  Pants still hurt.  I went in to work today for a few hours and was really uncomfortable because of the jeans in my stomach while sitting up.  Ultimately, it's 90% better than it was yesterday.  I've already decided I would do it again - just not next week or anything :)


Tomorrow is my friend's wedding shower and I'm a bridesmaid.  I prepared them for the idea that I may not go but I'm going to be there---wearing a maxi skirt lol.  A lot of moving around makes it more uncomfortable.  I'm also not looking forward to having it come out but even now just the knowledge that I'm better protected from pregnancy than if I got my tubes tied is beyond comforting.  Mine will be in for about 2 years before we remove it to try for kids - Still worth it.  Now is not the time for us. I'm not sure how long the cramping will last or when I'll be ready for sex but I figure that we'll be doing it again by next week ;)


So yes...it sucks.  but being in pain for a day and then some mild pain for a few more days is worth it to me.  I hope I didn't scare anyone off but I wanted to be as honest as possible.  Also - I've decided I want the epidural during childbirth and that my boyfriend will be in attendance at all future IUD appointments.  

UPDATE: It's now the second day after the insertion and I'm not experiencing any pain or cramps anymore. I'm having just slight bleeding..but its more like spotting mixed in with the other stuff that normally leaks out.  Dr. said I could be spotting for 12 weeks so I'm prepared for it.

UPDATE: I was feeling around for the strings and could only feel one. Also...it's really long...as in nearly to the edge of my vagina long. I talked to my Dr.'s nurse. She said the strings are pretty thin but what I'm feeling is thicker. She advised it sounds like they are just stuck together. I'm not feeling any abnormal pain so she thinks the strings were left that long on purpose (Dr. told me she cut them long but that seemed too long). I can't feel anything protruding from my cervix so she doesn't think it's being rejected and I'm not in any pain. I'm still nervous about it being properly placed so I'm going to continue to use condoms until my follow up appointment in 6 weeks.",7,20140503214521,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I am in the middle of writing my application essay/Letter of Intent for a graduate program, and I've been working on it now for... over two weeks. It's a two page essay. Every time I go to write, I freeze. I know this is the right program for me, I'm pretty sure this is the right school for me (and there aren't many options for me to choose from anyway), and I know it is definitely something I want to pursue. Why am I having such a hard time with this? I almost feel.. undeserving? I don't know. I am in a constant state of anxiety/panic. I have taken care of just about every other part of the application, this is pretty much all that is left (and waiting on recommendation letters).

I think some of the trouble I may be having is that, with undergraduate applications, it was like ""ok here pick a topic, write about it,"" whereas now I am being given a set of questions to answer in letter form. I have tried to answer them each individually, but can't seem to make it ""flow"" in any logical way or connect them into one coherent piece of writing, the ""write a thesis statement"" approach doesn't seem to apply either. Additionally, a lot of my drive for wanting to pursue this program is from life experience, rather than my undergraduate education, but they clearly do not want my cheesy little life story and I don't want to bullshit this essay because this is really important to me.

Perhaps you ladies can provide some advice? Or at least tell me I am not alone in that I'm kinda freaking out here. Thanks for letting me rant either way.

t3_24oyzs,So I got a lot of shit for being a feminist AND an Asian women...,"This post is about my experience as a feminist, and how I got so much shit for it because I am also an Asian women. You know, because of the whole demure, submissive, china doll stereotype. Oftentimes you hear Asian women regarded as the epitome of femininity, thus why a lot of men are interested in us. I don’t see this as a compliment at all, but rather dehumanizing. Why? Because a lot of these men who subscribe to this stereotype are some of most misogynistic and possess ridiculous backward thinking. That me being a feminist somehow makes me less of an Asian women because I am not submissive and ""act like a men-hating feminazi"".  

For example, there are a lot of sexpats coming in to /s/Asiantwox (a sub for Asian American women) to creep on Asian women. They would always try to marginalize every discussion we have pertaining to racial and gender issues. Last time I tried to call out such troll, he sent me a long message about how we are overreacting and how “feminism has ruined us” (this is why I use a throwaway account, to prevent harassment). Okay, just because we don’t fit into your sexist stereotypical view of how an Asian women should act, then we are somehow no good. Then I dig into this guy’s comment history, lo and behold, he is a frequenter of porn subs with Asian women, a red-piller who thinks a wife cannot deny her husband sex under any circumstance, hates white women, a sexpat in Hong Kong, and a Men’s Right and White Right activist. I am not surprised at all, because I found that a good chunk of these men who have “yellow fever” are like that. That they are so misogynistic and backward thinking that no western women would want them, so they seek out Asian women, whom they believe is more submissive and “what a proper women should act”. Does this sound like men you would want to date? 

It doesn't help that often times they are treated like kings in Asian countries, because some Asian girls see white men as some sort of status symbol. Doesn't matter how much of a sexist pig the guy is, by being a privileged white men you would still have local girls running into your arm. I felt like these women are full filling the stereotype. 

In no way am I trying to lump together every guy whom has an interest in Asian women as sexist. It is just that in my experience, there are a lot of these men that are like that. There is a distinction between a guys who has a certain preference (in this case, racial preference) vs those who have ""yellow fever"".

t3_24pqyu,How can I learn to be OK with my life not being a fairy tale?,"I think I suffer from watching too many Disney Princess films. My dream growing up had always been to get married, have babies and live happily ever after. Now I realize that's impossible. Even if you find the 'perfect' guy, get married, and end up with a cute house and tons of adorable kids, it's still not a fairy tale. It's a hard journey of compromise, bills, arguments and heartache. Not to say life can't be beautiful, I just think I've set up unrealistic expectations for my dreams. 
My question for all of you women is, how do you accept the reality of not being a princess and learn to be so damn strong? 
My hopes is I can learn to look at life as an adventure rather than a goal. I don't want to strive for one silly dream forever only to realize it's a sham. I want to take pride in each day and live it to the fullest. Women, what can I do to make myself stronger?

Edit: I'd like to expand on how I think the Disney culture is kind of messed up for girls. Growing up as a Disney girl, I've seen almost every female character's life become better after she found a man. Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, Ariel, Jasmine, Tiana, Lady, Jane, Mulan, Belle (although it could be argued she made the Beasts life better), Giselle, Esmeralda, Meg, Nala, Maid Marian, Dutchess, Rapunzel, and even Anna. Even if they don't get married they all end up with a man. It almost seems like the end goal in life is to get a man and find romance. There is nothing wrong with love. The problem is there are very few Disney movies that promote a women having an adventure that doesn't involve men. Brave comes close by saying Merida doesn't need a man but the entire plot does revolve around men. Pocahontas is the same. She lets him go but the movie revolves around her relationship with John Smith. I'd say that Lilo and Stitch is the only Disney movie that shows a strong independent woman: Nani. Sure, Nani has a boyfriend but he doesn't solve her issues, he's just a side character used to add a bit of depth to the story. Nani also represents reality. She struggles to pay bills, take care of her sister and even has curves, which is a rare Disney trait. 
Anyway, that's just my little Disney rant. Still a huge fan of the films but wouldn't it be nice if they had more characters  like Nani?

Edit: Just remembered: Elonwy, Alice, Penny, and Jenny. All young girls who have no need for men. They're honestly too young for men but it's still important to note they are fairly independent characters.

t3_24qy0q,So I just had the most uncomfortable conversation about body odor with my boss.,"I've spent the past few months in a depressive state, I'm on an up and I've been getting the help I need. I work in an office, but I can frequently work from home. I would occasionally come into the office where I maybe knew I was on a rough day. So I could maybe see where I'd smell bad. 

But today, i stopped to talk to much boss and he apparently thought it had been brought up to me. I asked if it was a problem today, because I had showered the night before and basically just went to bed a few hours later. He said yes. So I guess i am just a particularly odiforous person. So it's something I need to be aware of. 

The reason I come to you ladies, is well. I have noticed something about my lady bits. I am constantly damp. Like I don't know if it's all sweat (I'm not extra sweaty anywhere else) or discharge or something. I don't have any stds my most recent pap came back normal. (less than a year ago) but I guess I'm just always... Oozing. Is that normal? (it probably is within the realm of normal) and if anyone has suffered the same sort of issue, how did you deal with it?

t3_24q27d,"New boyfriend, and now I have no friends! What am I missing here?","I guess the title doesn't really do my problem justice. I've been with my boyfriend, G, for almost 6 months. He's really incredible, he motivates me to be better and loves me with all my imperfections; he's handsome, funny, charming, super smart, everything I want in a long term partner and then some more! My issue with G is that we constantly bicker about my inherent lack of ""lady - like qualities"" and that I have few, if any, female friends.

To put it in perspective, I would LOVE to have a group of girls to hang out with, I've always longed for girl friends but it never happened. I work in a male dominated field (think 8 women to 115 men), my interests are sports and working out, I grew up with all brothers and played on the roller hockey team where I met my best friends growing up, all guys. My roommate is a guy. Every time I've tried to integrate myself into a group of girls I either try too hard and weird them out, or don't try hard enough and they don't include me. 

G is understandably uncomfortable with my ppredicament, so to make him feel more comfortable I've alienated myself from my life long male friends, become super b itchy to my male coworkers so they don't talk to or come near me, and blown off all men who come near me in general. Now I feel very... lonely. It's hard to be feminine and feel confident as a woman when all I know about being a girly girl comes from magazines and the Internet.  G likes to point out when I sit without my legs crossed or start discussing the NFL Draft, and it really wreaks havoc on my identity and confidence.

G also gets jealous when I talk to men. Today at the gym, for example,  there was a problem with android phones connecting to the WiFi,  so I helped a few (admittedly, all male patrons) fix the issue on their phones. I didn't even make the connection that they may have been approaching me with the intent to flirt with me until G pointed it out. I was just trying to help! I'm not the type of person to see someone with a problem and walk away! 

G is now frustrated with me for ""playing naive"", and I'm frustrated with myself for not removing myself from the aforementioned situation.  I want to be smart and friendly and feminine and girly, but I want to attract female friends, not male attention!  How can I get G, the most important person in my life, to understand that I'm seriously not trying to get male attention and that I am trying to make girl friends? 

I want my boyfriend to know he's the only man for me, and I want him to be secure in that.  However, I don't want to keep feeling like a social outcast. Any advice? Anything would help! Thank you, two X! ",5,20140504164208,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24q1jm,"Sometimes, I handle friendships like a guy would. :-/","This seems to be a real issue among some of my female friends, and I don't know how to handle it. This is probably going to be a relatively long post, and I apologize for that.

I grew up with five brothers, and have always gotten along better with those of the male gender. I don't know if that holds any weight with why/how I handle my friendships the way I do, but at least you have some background on me.

I've been having ""tiffs"" with my best friend lately. We'll call her Tina. Tina and I have been borderline inseparable for the past year and a half or so (since we went to Basic Training and AIT together; we also are now stationed on the same post). 

To give you all an idea of what exactly it is I'm talking about, here are some examples:

In Basic Training, Tina and Kayla* (our mutual best friend who is unfortunately not stationed where Tina and I are) got into an argument with two other females in our platoon over something that was ENTIRELY between the four of them. However, after the argument, Kayla and Tina were upset with me that I didn't ""stand up for them."" I just stood there flabbergasted until I finally (in a matter of words) said, ""The fight was between you two and ___insert other girls' names here__. I don't have a problem with them, and I don't need one. I'm sorry, but you two are grown adults. There was no need for me to 'stand up for you.'"" This pissed them off for the rest of the day, but then we just pretended the whole thing never happened.

In AIT, Tina was ""talking to"" (??? I dunno. Is that a phrase people use still? Damn, I'm getting old) a guy in our platoon that I had been cool with since Basic. I'll spare you the details, but essentially, she got mad at him for something he said to purposely upset her/embarrass her, but without context or knowing the background story, NOBODY would have known what he was talking about anyway. She told Kayla and me that she was upset with what he said, that he's an ass, blah blah blah. 

The next day in the school house, I confronted him about the situation, then once he had said his piece, moved on to just talking to him like I would with any other friend. Tina and Kayla both were upset with me again. Kayla even specifically said to me, ""Well, he hurt Tina and she's mad at him, so you should be mad at him too."" This time, I got a little more defensive than I had in Basic and told her, ""Kayla, that's retarded, and the most childish thing I've heard since high school."" Whatever. We all moved past it with an understanding that I should be ""more defensive of my friends in the future.""

Now, for my most  recent ""dilemma,"" if you can even call it that. Tina had been dating Jack, a friend I had made here on post prior to them dating. They broke up about 2 months ago, and I recently had a party where I invited both of them. Tina said she wasn't going to go since I had invited Jack, but the night of the party she showed up anyway, then left early because Jack was wasted and ""bragging"" about his most recent female companions. (I wasn't there to witness that actually happening, but Jack is not a malicious nor vindictive human being. I'm sure he wasn't ""bragging"" right in front of her to purposely make her jealous.) Tina is still somewhat upset with me for inviting him in the first place.

I've explained all these scenarios to my husband and have brought up the issues I've been having in my relationship with my best friend. I would hope my husband's response to my issues was to reassure me that I'm not a horrible friend, but simply a woman that handles things in more ""male"" terms, but sometimes I'm not so sure. This is how I've always been, but maybe I am doing something wrong. 

TwoX, what is your opinion on this? Is there something I need to change about myself to get along better with/not upset my best friend as well as other female friends?? Thanks in advance, and sorry that this post is ridiculously long.",0,20140504163440,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24qnk1,I lost my virginity last week and now I'm missing my period,"Hey Reddit,

I'm a 21 year old female (obviously) and I lost my virginity to my boyfriend of two years last week. We used a condom, lube, and he my boyfriend didn't even cum. We had messed around naked earlier in the month but he never penetrated without a condom. He was rubbing this dick on my clit to tease me.

My typical cycle comes about every 25 days, but it can happen anywhere from 24-27 days. My period was predicted to come yesterday but it didn't. I keep thinking I'm having cramps, but it feels more like ovarian pain than my usual cramps.I also think I'm having cramps but it's just gas. I know the odds of precum getting a girl pregnant are exponentially low, but I'm freaking the fuck out. I'm on the verge of a panic attack. If it doesn't come tomorrow, it'll be past the 27 day mark and I've never had a period that late.

I'm hoping it's just stress that's pushing my period back. I've dealt with finals during my cycle and the lost of my virginity, which I've been struggling with. I wasn't sure if I made the right choice and it's weighed on me. I'll take a test on the weekend if it doesn't show up, I know it's too soon to take it now.

For the past several months I've been on numerous antibiotics because of an illness,  giving me chronic yeast infections.  Even before the illness (since about a year ago) I've had this ongoing pain/burning on the ""bottom"" of the inside of my vagina. Back then I had a great gynecologist and he was actually able to look inside (!!!) by using numbing gel and having the nurses hold my hand, yet he told me that nothing was wrong with me and that there was slight irritation. 

Then I moved and my current OBGYN (the nurse for the main OBGYN) is pretty good,  but I cannot have anyone examine me or stick the Q-tip in there because it causes me to have the worst pain imaginable.  I ALWAYS stick it in there myself.  I can stick things up there just fine but when someone else does it it's extremely painful. 

Then last week the nurse wasn't in so I had to see the regular OBGYN. He couldn't get the speculum in.  He touched me and it HURT, like there was a cut there.  Then he got very angry at me. We did a q-tip and he said nothing was wrong even though I'm in constant pain and feel discharge all the time. I think he might be lying to me because he said there was nothing he could do.

I'm supposed to see the nurse again tomorrow but I'm very scared. They won't use numbing gel or anything.  They use lube but it doesn't help.  My vagina is my enemy and it's so painful.

Rant ahead.","I don't know if anyone will see this because it's so late (at least where I'm from) but it's seriously bothering me. I am 16 years old, and a sophomore in high school. This Saturday I went to prom, and I was super excited and spent all day getting ready with my best friend. Well, we show up, and of course I see how beautiful everyone looked and was running around complimenting people. 

I was standing with a group of girls talking about my dress and such, and mentioned the rib cage size was a little big on me and I was a little worried about basically flashing everyone. One of the girls then said ""you think your worried? I'm wearing a strapless, and you don't have to worry because you have no boobs."" 


I was naturally incredibly offended at that point and wanted to say something but decided to not let her spoil my fun. I also had a girl later on tell me she thought I had very high levels of testosterone because of ""how andro and boyish I look"" (I have short hair, but so does she) and how my ""body type is"" whatever that means. She said that because we were talking and I said something about jokingly about ""well maybe I have a guys brain, thinking about sex all the time"" (I'm bisexual)


Both of theses comments hurt because these girls were my friends, not close friends but we still hung out socially on occasion, and one girl looks just as ""boyish and andro"" as the next girl, and the other girl has more boobs because she's a bigger girl, it's her body type. But if I commented on her having a lot more tummy than me, I know all hell would break lose. 


I didn't let her ruin my fun though. I got hit on plenty of times that night by guys who don't seem to care about my small stature and short hair.

t3_24sw5k,So he cheated on me...(Update),"I posted about a month ago asking for support and advice for a breakup that seemed sudden after a 7 year relationship.  So I suppose this is an update on that situation.

The last month has been horrible.  Between trying to get him to move his stuff out to vacillating between hope that he will come to his senses and grief for a lost love.

Well I find out from a few friends over the weekend that he showed up at a party with his climbing partner.  A girl who I always felt threatened by and who I expressed concern over an inappropriate relationship. The last few months he would go on climbing trips and not contact me claiming there was no cell service. I would express my concern and he would reassure me that they were just partners, that he wished she was a man so I wouldn't worry. That I would never believe that there was nothing going on. He made me feel guilty for ever contemplating the possibility that there was something unsavory happening.

At the party friends told me that they were acting like a couple.  Yesterday I decided I wanted clarity rather than to just wonder. So last night I texted him asking for a straight answer. He didn't reply. This morning I tried again saying that I deserved to know. He replied saying that he started seeing her a week ago.

A seven year relationship that he moves on in two weeks. I offered him everything. I supported him financially, emotionally, physically. I helped him cope with depression. I helped him get through his PhD. I unconditionally loved him through quirks and forgotten birthdays. I have never done a single thing unkind or unthoughtful to him.

I'm not an idiot I know this started before we broke up. He sent her text messages implying that he couldn't wait to to be rid of me. I was just too blind to really see what was happening. I praised myself for being a trusting girlfriend. I let him go on trips and never asked him to stop the relationship with her. He most certainly emotionally cheated on me and while I don't know if he physically cheated it is enough.  

I just can't believe how wrong I was about this person. He has shown me no respect, no care and has proven how little he actually loved me. 

In the end I suppose at least it is a line. I can never be with someone who has that little regard for someone they were with for a huge portion of their lives. Someone who they claimed to love.  And to some degree I suppose they deserve each other because she had a long term, live in boyfriend too that she left to be with him.

t3_24sv1a,My friends are obsessed with their genitals and I don't know how to deal with it.,"The title pretty much says it all. Using a throwaway because many of my friends are redditors. 

This time last year, I made a great new group of friends. They were fun, went on adventures, and seemed to have hobbies they cared about. But over the course of this past year, things have... changed. 

They've become obsessed with their genitals.

Guys and gals alike, it's all they ever talk about and all they ever want to do. Topics of conversation used to vary; we'd talk about TV shows, current events, gossip, pretty much everything. But now, all they ever talk about is gender theory, getting laid, who they want to fuck, things shaped like genitals, how to become more sexual, why polyamory > monogamy (sex-wise), and pretty much anything having to do with their penises or vaginas.

And to be fair, there's nothing wrong with talking about these things. It's very important to create a dialogue about gender theory and polyamory, because the more people talk about these ideas, the more the rest of the world becomes aware of their importance and relevance. 

But seriously, they WILL NOT talk about anything else. Every conversation turns into a circles jerk about how they're cooler than ""normies."" Hell, I've stopped going to their parties because they all turn into orgies. 

I feel like I'm going crazy. These people are really the only friends I have right now and they're not bad people. They're really nice, smart, and funny! And I've tried changing subjects and asking them to speak less sexually, but nothing comes of it. 

I just can't handle this over-sexualized lifestyle. I have no hangups about sex (and I'm by no means ""vanilla""). I enjoy sex as much as the next girl, but it's not my life. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm being judged for my worth as a potential sex partner rather than as a friend. Everything is so shallow now. And it's making me feel so lonely.

I'm in my mid-twenties, and I have no idea where to make new friends. And I don't know if I should keep trying to make it work with the friends I have or if I should give up and crown Netflix as my new best friend.

I'm not sure what I want to hear from you guys. I just don't know what to do. I miss the days of childhood where friendships were just so easy.

t3_24snjd,Married for almost 1 year and feeling lost.,"Hi ladies. Throwaway account. Not sure if this is the right place, but I could really use some advice. Apologies in advance if this gets kind of long. 

I'm 24. I got married last May at 23. My husband and I dated on and off since high school, with a 2-year break from each other during college. We got together in the summer of 2010 after I broke up with a verbally abusive ex, and we started living with each other almost immediately. In 2012, we decided to move across the country together. Two months after moving, he proposed. 

Now, two weeks shy of a year into our marriage, he's thrown a complete curveball at me. He claims it's a quarter-life crisis, and though I kind of feel like that term is a bit silly, I would have to agree. Here's the situation:

Two months ago, he quit his high-intensity job with an abusive boss to work for a non-profit at a much slower pace and a much nicer boss. His high-intensity job was the first job he got when we moved out here, and for a long time, he was making it his life goal to climb the ranks, make a lot of money and earn a six figure salary by the time he was 30. After quitting, he had a moment of clarity where he realized how incredibly unhappy he'd been over the past two years at his old job. He realized that he hadn't taken any time to develop himself as a person, or to work on developing his relationship with me. 

Three weeks ago, pretty much out of the blue, he told me that he was taking a step back to re-evaluate his life, and that he was going to start doing things just for himself to find out what makes him happy. I was fine with that--I encouraged him to find the things in life that would make him happy. But he started to get distant. He started to act annoyed by me. He started treating me like an annoying girlfriend. When I started talking with him about our relationship, he confessed that he felt that he wasn't sure where I was going to fit into his new identity, and that he had started to question every decision that he'd made in the past five years. He told me that he felt like I was too indecisive, like half a person, and that he needed me to work on myself while he worked on himself. That he needed distance. 

He started contemplating buying a motorcycle. He started going out with friends and not coming back home until 2 AM. If I cried out of sadness or confusion, he would get angry with me for ""making it a tragedy."" I recently quit my own job and found a new one at a place I love, and instead of feeling celebrated, it felt kind of blase. If I try to be intimate with him, sexually or not, he pulls away because he claims that he's not used to me being intimate, and that it feels fake. He's told me that he isn't sure if he was actually ready to be married. He tells me he wishes we spent more time dating and living separately. This, after 4 years of commitment and love and growth together. And then, in the middle of the night, he'll cuddle up to me and say he's sorry, tell me that he needs me and that he loves me. Then, the next day, he's got his walls up again. 

No, we've never had a perfect relationship, and we've had our fair share of fights, but right now, it feels like he's negating everything we've built together because he's not sure what to do with himself. He's really confused and I'm getting pulled along for the ride. 

He and I decided--together--to go minimalist, and we've cleared out our apartment and donated 80% of our belongings. Now I'm sitting in our nearly empty apartment, glad that I've decluttered my life, but sad that it had to get to that point in the first place. And I don't know what to do. 

I love this man. I've loved him since I was 17. We may have been bad in the past at maintaining our own separate identities outside of the relationship, but we've got a very solid identity together, and it feels like over the past couple of weeks he's quite abruptly ripped himself out of that identity and out of the life we've built together. Although in the past week his mood has been better, and he seems like he's starting to calm down, I know we're not at the end. 

One thing I forgot to mention is that, at a young age, my husband was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He was on very heavy medication from age 13 until about 19, when he decided one day to just stop taking it. Fortunately, he made it through without any complications, and has been mostly stable over the past 5 or 6 years, but I feel like it's something he still grapples with, and it may be part of this recent upheaval. Like he had been coasting along in a somewhat depressed state for a long time, doing a good job of either hiding or disguising it and just recently, something switched the mania on. 

I love him to death and would never hold his diagnosis against him, but it's been hard to watch and deal with, and I don't know how to bring up the possibility to him that his disorder may have been triggered and is now fueling this fire, especially since it hasn't really been part of our conversations with one another for the past 4 years.

TwoX, I don't know if any of this really makes sense, but I'm feeling kind of desperate here, and I could use some advice. How do I handle this? How can I help him without seeming pushy? What can I do to make our first anniversary special, even if he is going through an identity crisis period? Some days I feel like more of a grown up than others, but when it comes to this, I just feel young, stupid and clueless. Sometimes, the amount of sadness I feel is overwhelming, and even though I'm working on building friendships outside of my marriage, I feel like I've got very few people with whom I can talk about all this. 

**TL;DR:** Husband recently found himself in a period of identity crisis, and has since ripped himself out of our mutual identity. He has a history of bipolar disorder and I'm curious if this may be a sign of mania. Lost and clueless; looking for advice. 

**edit:** spelling

**edit edit:** So I wanted to thank everyone for their input, advice, etc. I guess my fear that his BPD may be the culprit is more realistic than I realized. I sat him down last night and talked with him about what I've been seeing in him, how it makes me feel, and suggested that he talk to a therapist or see his doctor. He wasn't gung-ho about the idea that his BPD may be rearing its head again but I feel like our talk got him thinking pretty seriously about seeking therapy. So, thanks again everyone. Your comments really pushed me to realize that this situation is beyond my control. ",64,20140505133819,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24snps,"""Are You Straight?"" A rant about perceived sexuality...","Growing up, I was a tomboy. A hard core, no-hair-combing, anime-shirt-and-jeans wearing, dress-despising, barbie-burning tomboy. I loved playing with the guys as they made me feel comfortable. I appreciated their roughness and having fun with them meant less judgement in my little girl eyes. I could be dirty, have fun and play the games I wanted to play


As I got older and went to middle school, I knew I had to slightly 'conform' to girlish wear in order to get the attention I wanted from men. Around this time, my sister jokingly said she thought I was going to grow up gay. It kind of hurt my feelings but I took it with a grain of salt as I know she loves the hell out of me anyways. Middle school was a trying time and I was scrawny, flat (as most young girls are) and was completely acne ridden. My peers would make jokes about my sexuality and I never understood it. I loved guys and thought they were sexy. Why wasnt I straight based off of that?


Flash forward to now, I am 23 years old and I do enjoy things my 10 yr old self would hate me for. Not because of social influences but simply I enjoy looking feminine, make up is fun and I look amazing in heels because I have a track runners butt lol However, I still get asked this question constantly:


""Are you straight?"" ""Are you bisexual?"" How can you even GAGE that from how I look? I even had a guy tell me its because of all the jeans I wear and the books I was carrying in my facebook photos. Really?? Straight women cant read and wear jeans? Yes, I know I have a mohawk but I've only had it the last few years but the question has been prevalent my entire life. Its insulting because now 'straight' women cant be seen as women like me. I still have a good amount of guy friends and a GREAT amount of girl friends. Yes, I can be quite the pervert but what modern day lady in her 20s isnt? I MUST be a lesbian, I MUST be bisexual. I have nothing against the LGBT community and Im not 'hiding'  anything deep down. I've explored many aspects of my sexuality and I know that I am straight and I am proud.


Thank yall for listening and if anyone has any stories or anything they would like to share, please do. I sometimes get very down about it.

t3_24s6is,"Ond bad experience and now everything makes my spidey senses tingle...[warning, wall of text]","So a few months ago, back when I was in ""relationship mode"" I met a guy on POF and chatted, but never met.  Decided to stop talking to him because we wanted different things.

Fast forward to about a month ago.  I had just been laid off, was in hardcore ""find a boyfriend not just a f-buddy"" mode, and went out with a guy.  I made some bad calls (read: took him home the first night) and then spent way too much time with him in too short a space of time and got in this weird headspace around him.  Anywho, after nine days of feeling smothered and finally realizing that this guy was a stage five clinger and my weird headspaces were not my own anxiety but rather because my brain was trying to say ""danger Will Robinson!! red flag red flag.""

When I went to go meet him to ""break up"" with him in person (can you break up with someone after only 9 days?), he showed up wasted.  Like stumbling slurred words can't walk in a straight line wasted.  He called me a heartless c**t, and that I would be alone forever, was a ""classic bitchy virgo.""  Then he called me every 3 minutes until Verizon helped me block his number.  I had a full on anxiety attack, convinced that he would come to my house and harass my household, and all that (thankfully he did not and my roommates and call from my mama helped peel me off the ceiling).

Now I'm more in go-with-the-flow mode and have reconnected with POF guy.  He says he's cool with me going slow, which is nice.  We're playing pool this week. I'm truly awful at it but I think it's really fun.

I suppose my question (and my point) is wondering how to differentiate between being nervous after a bad experience and actual spidey sense red flags.  I want to give this POF a real chance, but I also don't want to not be careful.

t3_24th0x,SO says it's my fault I got sexually harassed,"I could really use a few words of advice/alternate viewpoints.

Last week I started exchanging emails with a classmate of mine. They were strictly school-related, until a few days ago, when he got really drunk and tried to ask me out via email. I told him I was seeing someone but we could be friends (we're in the same very small academic program). He said that he ""might be in love with me"" (only have talked to him four times max), ""wants to hang out forever"", etc.

I debated telling my SO about it, but decided he should know (and I thought it was kind of funny). He wasn't amused, and then went on to say that I was probably flirting with him and I should have been clear from the start that I wasn't interested. I had told the guy ""no, I'm seeing someone, I don't want to go on a date"", but my SO thinks I should have been clearer from the start.

Apparently this came down to my very ""flirty"" personality. I will admit that sometimes my personality comes off that way. I smile a lot, laugh at jokes, and my sense of humor can sometimes come off as flirtation.

A few years ago, I had an encounter with a coworker where he pushed me up against a wall, started making out with me, and tried to shove his hands down my pants. I said ""no"" about a dozen times, and was using all my strength to try to get his hands away from me. I was really shaken by the whole thing and lost my job over it. My SO brought up /that/ incident too, and says I probably gave the coworker the wrong impression.

I'm feeling kind of hurt by this, especially him bringing up the coworker incident. I know I have a flirty personality but I don't think that means I deserve to be harassed in any manner. We stopped talking about it because I was getting upset, and I feel like there's no real resolution to this.

I'm in a period of my life where I'm trying to meet new people. And the way I do that is by acting like myself. I just can't imagine meeting a guy and then automatically saying ""oh by the way I'M NOT INTERESTED"". That just sounds really presumptuous and stuckup to me. But my SO says I need to ""make the line clear"" because I'm leading these guys on.

He says he doesn't want me to change my personality but I know it's bothering him. I don't want to change my personality either. I guess I should ""tone it down"" a bit? In the case of the classmate, I never intentionally flirted with him. And apparently ""friendliness"" counts as flirtation.

So I don't know. I think he has a point, but at the same time, I feel like a creep is a creep. If they don't listen to ""no"" at any point, why would they listen to ""no"" at the beginning??",1,20140505183048,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I am usually completely happy to go out and do my own thing and then go hang out with him for sex and cuddles and video games, but I am feeling anxious about this going forward. It should be noted that I am kind of a homebody as well, and so I was initially totally psyched to find someone that didn't pressure me to go out. However the longer we've been dating, I find myself wishing that he wanted to do these things, and not that he was just okay with them if I bring them up. I hate the idea of forcing someone I love to spend their time a certain way, and kind of want to be able to be completely fine with the fact that this is how he is, but it obviously makes gatherings a source of worry for me. I also kind of wish he was more spontaneous and up for a good time, and more able to be as fun as he is when we're alone in his apartment when we venture outside, but feel like that may just be how he is and it's unfair to want him to be someone different.

I am a bundle of nerves right now due to school ending and the impending job search, and I know that this inquiry is partially motivated by that.  I'm just not sure what to do, and if this is potentially a big issue for us going forward.  I feel so silly for finding the one thing I don't love about this sweet, sensitive, kind man and letting it become a big issue in my head.  I honestly have moments where I think I want to break up with him because this is a big area of incompatibility, but I don't want to lose someone so wonderful just because he isn't ""fun enough"" for me when I need him to be.  

TwoXers, how can I learn to let this go? Or, how can I bring this up with him in a constructive way?  Any questions, comments, or advice is appreciated!!!",0,20140505191132,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

So any insight / opinions / suggestions would be much appreciated, ladies!!

---

I had an MRI performed last week on my hamstring to diagnose an injury.  In reviewing the films with my sports physician last night, she pointed out that the scan had also captured my right ovary, which had a huge (too many to count) number of cysts on it.

I'm 30f, 5'3"", and weight has fluctuated ~54-58kg since age 18 (within healthy BMI).  Healthy diet, healthy lifestyle etc etc etc.

Since I was 18, I've had roughly 5 or 6 internal ultrasounds looking at my girly bits.  Every single ultrasound has showed multiple cysts on each ovary (always 12+, sometimes 20+ per ovary).  The ultrasound technician has always expressed alarm at that, particularly as from 18-24 (when I had one of the scans) I was on the pill so shouldn’t have been ovulating, but none of the GPs or gynaegolocists I've seen have ever given a damn.



PERIOD PAIN
---
I have had incredibly painful periods since I was 12.  I was on OCP from ages 18-24 and that helped somewhat.  

I know that the heavier (fatter) I am, the worse my period pain is.

In August 2012 I had an episode of THE WORST PAIN I had ever experienced - literally rolling on the floor crying, unable to function.  Ambulance came, doped me up on morphine, okay!  I was referred to an gyno who specialises in endometriosis, who literally spent about 5 minutes talking with me, and then two weeks later had me on the operating table for a laproscopy where he diagnosed and removed the endo that he found.

Unfortunately since then, my period pain has been consistently getting WORSE.  I've had another morphine-needing episode, and monthly I'm on prescription painkillers.


ACNE
---
From ages 18-27 I developed horrific acne on my back and upper arms.  Doctors told me it was quite mild and nothing to worry about, and during that time I tried about 4 different versions of the OCP.  It got to the point where I was embarrassed to wear tshirts and dresses, so I finally put my foot down and demanded a referral to a dermatologist.  He revised the diagnosis from ""mild"" to ""severe acne” and put me on a 6-month course of Roaccutane, which was equally horrific but ultimately worked a dream.



--- 

So, to reiterate, I have a follow-up appointment with the gynaecological surgeon at the end of this month.  I am certain that he will try to convince me of one of two things:  another round of surgery to “remove more endo”, and/or insert the Mirena IUD.

The surgery did nothing the first time round even though he guaranteed me that he removed everything he saw.

I’m against having a foreign object inserted into my body, hormonal meds screw with my head and body at the best of times, AND mostly I’m concerned that Mirena would just be masking whatever is REALLY going on.

Is it worth pushing him to investigate the polycystic ovaries thing more?  I just don’t understand why no doctor seems to give a damn about my ovaries.

t3_24txho,"Friend unknowingly crossed some boundaries. Should I talk to him/make amends, and how?","Hey TwoX, you are my go-to for social situation/sexual harassment dilemmas, and this is both. Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks in advance for your time!


I’m a university student who will be changing schools to attend an institution across the country in the fall. A few weeks ago, I had to inform my extended group of friends that I would not be returning (I’d told a few of my closest friends a bit earlier). One friend of mine, whom I will refer to as R, sent me a facebook message later saying that he was upset that I’d told other people but not him, and that he just wanted to help and be a good friend.


To be honest, I reached out to those few closest friends then because I tend to self-destruct when I'm stressed and alone, and they were the only people I could reach immediately who I trusted to talk me down and listen without judgment. R has a good heart, but he’s a little socially awkward (he and several of our psych major friends believe he’s on the autism spectrum, though it's not official); on several occasions I’ve found myself in the position of being his outlet when I don’t have sufficient resources to do so, and I definitely didn't have resources then.


I didn’t see or hear from R again until our mutual friend’s house party a day or so later. I tried to avoid him, but eventually he found me, pulled me off to the side and apologized. I was kinda pissed and also unsure of how genuine the apology was because he was a little drunk, but to get him off my back I accepted and went on my way.


A few hours and a few drinks later, I passed by R sitting in the hall by himself, extremely drunk. He asked me to sit down because he wanted to talk to me for a bit, and I did. He started talking about how sorry he was, and also getting really touchy-feely – hand on my neck, forehead against mine like he was about to kiss me, etc. He was getting dramatic and I was getting uncomfortable, so I told him I had to go, but he grabbed my wrist and pulled me back down. Just then, though, one of my other big guy friends came around the corner, and when I signaled to him for help he came up with some excuse to haul R off to a different part of the house.


And now, a little part of my brain keeps asking, what if my other friend hadn’t shown up then? I'm a very small person, and even if I’d been sober I doubt I’d have been able to escape. I feel so unreasonable, because nothing actually happened, and rationally I don’t believe R would have done anything. But for a week after, I froze every time I saw R, and even after two weeks I’m still uncomfortable interacting with him one-on-one or with him touching me. 


I’m not sure if he even remembers what happened, but he’s noticed that I’ve been avoiding him, because he sent me another message the other day saying that he’d been a jerk and was sorry. I told him it was okay, and that the whole situation is a mess, and he just replied “Yeah, but still”. I didn’t know how to respond (someone said that it was R fishing for compliments, trying to get me to tell him that no, he’s been a perfectly fine friend) so I didn’t.


Except now, I always try to make amends with everyone whenever things end, and I’m wondering if I should talk to R, and if yes, what to tell him. I feel like I should tell him the real reason I was avoiding him, and that he should know that he becomes really inappropriate when he’s drunk (he’s gotten really physical with other people on other occasions as well). But I’m also not sure how productive telling him would be; he gets really defensive about things because he really does have good intentions, and also this happened weeks ago and he might not even remember it.


**TL;DR: To explain or not to explain to my friend before I move away that I’ve been avoiding him as an overreaction to his gropey-drunk behavior from weeks back: that is the question.**

I heard the news about your new opportunity and would love to chat for a few minutes. Will you have time to stop by at 4:30? Let me know. Sorry for the email – tried to stop over or IM but couldn’t catch you (smiley face).""

I then created a meeting invite for her and the only HR person we have on staff for next Tuesday (two days before my final day here). I made it clear in the email that I would only meet with her if HR is present. They both accepted the invitation.

He admitted to me, after 7 years together, that he hadn't been in love with me in 5 years. During that time, I had worked as the breadwinner and supported the two of us. He left when he finally got a job that paid more than me (working for my cousin).

Since I hit the one year of kicking him out, I got into a stupid frame of mind and unblocked him on Facebook. This lead me to learn that several of my close friends have stayed friends with him and still talk to him. I got upset and posted to a select group of people that I wasn't comfortable being friends with someone who treated me so poorly. 

In a turn that has torn out my heart, none of my close friends from high school (14 years ago) and on have agreed with thus statement. None of the people who have stayed friends with him have reached out in any way. 

Except one, who said I was twisting the past and putting negativity into the world. That thus was a terrible thing to do and that I never should have expected him to be honest or treat me well if I was sleeping with other people. Never mind that he knew about it, and also had sex with other people. 

She also said that I was throwing around serious accusations and that he has been nothing but nice since the divorce. 

I feel so alone. I have a new partner who is very loving, but I still haven't healed from my past.

t3_24upni,Hmmmm.. could I be pregnant? :/,"I'm soooo sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. I searched for a long time and it just seemed appropriate here. ;( I'll try to keep it short-- I'm just sick of googling all sorts of things and thinking EVERYTHING applies to me when it probably doesn't.


I'm 26 and have been on the pill for 8 years. I've never taken a break from the pill and while I have had those rare times when I would miss a pill, I would always follow directions properly and promptly in those times.


I'm in a long distance relationship and I recently saw my boyfriend a little less than 2 weeks ago. He stayed with me for a few days and of course we had a ton of sex. Probably about twice a day for a few days. As I said I'm on the pill but we've been together for 2 years and have decided not to use condoms, however he does pull out. This is mandatory for both of us. Pills + pull out.


The first day he was here I was on the last day of my period. We had sex twice that day; I was on my last sugar pill that day and he pulled out both times. The next day we had sex in the morning and pulled out, however it seemed some semen landed across my vagina. We cleaned it up and I took my first pill of my next pack that night. We had sex several times over the course of the next few days, while taking my pill on time every day and him pulling out (and almost having a hard time orgasming since we've been having so much sex).


Fast forward to now and I'm having period like symptoms in the middle of this pack of pills (not supposed to get my period for another 2 weeks). I spotted a light brown yesterday-- sorry graphic!-- and what seemed to be a little bit of a yeasty infection type stuff along with it. This only lasted a few trips to the bathroom before everything seemed normal again. I don't have cramps (I never get them) and my breasts feel normal, but I have that weird type of 'down there' heavy feeling like I'm about to get my period or something.


I was wondering, given with the timing and our methods, and what I'm describing just how likely this all is? Maybe semen entered me during the last day of the sugar pills or the first day of the new pack. It's apparently far too early to take a pregnancy test. I won't even know if I have a missed period for another 2 weeks.  :( Just looking for some support, advice, insight, anything. I hate reading stories on the internet and thinking it all applies to me too! I don't want to sit here over worrying everything.

Some of the things I've done (if you care): been in a vanilla boy/girl porn, been in femdom porn, was a well-known camgirl with 15K Twitter followers (in 2009-2011), and am now a well-paid phone dominatrix in NYC. Due to my location, I have no problem scouting good-looking guys with big dicks, beards, and tattoos. I will be the creative side of the production process.

Only spots where the locals tend to hang out and very hot people are often seen. We're speaking to a bar manager next week about how to put this together tastefully.** 

**EDIT 6: I can't believe this is happening so fast! A couple of hours ago, I spoke to the owner of a hot new cafe in Brooklyn that's getting a bit of local press (more details later on) and we're planning on doing an invite-only get-together for people who are interested in participating. She's really excited about this, as it will also be *their* first event ever! There will be good food, good alcohol, and good times.

t3_24vcr8,Being a short girl can really suck.,"First of all, I really don't want to offend other short women--I just felt like ranting about my personal issues with being vertically challenged. I know that society acknowledges that short men are treated unfairly, but I think that petite women also get the...""short"" end of the stick.  
  
I know there are some celebrities who defy this, but it seems like the women who are considered the most beautiful tend to be tall and thin, like models. It's frustrating feeling like, no matter how hard I try to look good, I just look dumpy next to my taller friends. Clothes NEVER fit right off the rack, and I get so sick of salespeople telling me to try the children's section. (I'm in my mid-20's!!) It feels like I can't look very fashionable, because clothes never fit my petite frame, and the ones in the ""petites"" sections that I find look like grandma clothes. (Being short also means that a weight loss or gain of 10 lbs, which would be pretty normal on a taller person, can suddenly push you over either side of the line of looking scrawny or overweight...which can make clothes shopping that much more frustrating.)

  I also don't think super-short women get taken nearly as seriously, particularly the ones who look young for their age like I do. I've actually posted about that issue on here before, because it gets exhausting being treated like a child, being asked, ""What do your parents think of that??"" and, god forbid, ""What grade are you in?""   
It's gotten a little better in the past few years, but I felt constantly overlooked for opportunities in my undergrad, and part of it was because I looked so much smaller and younger than my colleagues, even though I was typically about 5 years older due to starting school later. I rarely feel like I'm seen as an actual adult woman, let alone a strong or independent one.  
 
I've gotten so many comments and jokes about my stature since high school, that *most* of the time are supposed to be lighthearted, but it seriously gets old. Being called a 12 year old at 25 isn't cute anymore.

t3_24w1mu,"Unfulfilled with life despite ""having it all"" and don't know what to do.. Everything is awesome and I'm not happy","Ladies, I'm using a throwaway because I'm ashamed, embarrassed and confused. I've been a long-time lurker, upvoter and occasional contributor to this subreddit. This is one of the comfier subreddits out there and I feel like I can get some good input here. 

I have a pretty charmed life. I've worked hard and lucked out and have ended up with, what seems like a ""perfect life,"" at least on paper. This isn't meant as a brag but I'm 26 and so far I've got the following going for me:

* Great job with good salary, benefits, bonuses, perks, 401k, etc 
* Work for a top Fortune 500 technology company (think shiny silver...fruit)
* Fantastic team and manager & interesting and challenging responsibilities and opportunities  
* I own my own home in a desirable area with great amenities & schools
* Engaged to a wonderful man who I adore and we are excited to start our lives together and start a family
* Supportive families (both our parents still together, etc)
* Traveled the world plenty in my youth, through college & after
* Significant savings & trust fund 

I'm really struggling because I feel extremely unfulfilled with my life. I have everything that anyone could seemingly want and yet it isn't making me happy or fulfilled. I struggle with dealing with these feelings and then I feel awful about myself because there are so many out there that would kill for a chance at what I have... and I think it isn't good enough? What is wrong with me? 

I don't know what it is that I want, and I don't know how to feel fulfilled in my life. But I do know that whatever I'm doing now isn't cutting it. I'm in therapy (for anxiety and just because) but it isn't really helping. I tried anti-depressants but that just made everything worse. I think I'm just in the throes of a quarter-life crisis and I'm not handling it well. 

I don't even know if I'm looking for advice here or maybe it's just a misery loves company thing. But thanks for reading anyway.

t3_24v7yo,Throwaway. This is a safe community so I'll confess: I feel guilty about being fat and keeping postponing seeing a guy I met on reddit.,"Okay, so about a year ago I met an amazing dude on reddit. We met on his country's subreddit because I'm moving there. 

Anyway, I'm afraid to meet him though I desperately want to. Up until a few years ago, I was a high school athlete and in formidable physical fitness well into my college years. Then... crippling depression hit and I gained something like 60 pounds, which is a lot on my frame. I'm not a land whale by any means, but going from a size 8 to 16 is jarring and even though I am still very proportionate and did maintain my muscle mass, I just... I hate the way I look. My measurements are 41-32-44. I'm so ashamed of my body now. I used to be muscular, lithe and strong and now I'm just sad. 

I knew I probably shouldn't keep talking to him because I didn't want him to get involved with me knowing I would never want to meet up, but we did. And we Skyped, and sent pictures and stuff. And he's gorgeous. Tall and super fit and just... amazing. He's like a 10. I used to be comparably attractive but now for the past three years I just feel invisible and my self esteem is at an all time low.

I know he has feelings for me but I am terrified of meeting him and I am contemplating just never meeting him at all, despite the fact that I'm going to end up about a half hour away from him after I move. 

I keep buying clothes in my smaller size, but I just don't have the motivation to lose weight. I'm still depressed sometimes. I was supposed to meet him in December 2013, then March 2014, then June and now I've just moved my move back to September 2014 in fear that he'll see me and I'll disappoint him horribly. This is really affecting me.

I have four months to make a change, I guess. I just don't feel healthy and I need to do it for that too.

t3_24v7yu,How can I be a better friend to someone who doesn't want any help?,"Full disclosure: I have been in an abusive relationship before. I can recognize the signs of abuse and I understand that those people need help. I got 0 help. I eventually got out of it because I reconnected with old friends, but all the people who knew me, including my family, didn't say anything to me. I look back on that time and I still feel angry that none of my friends, family or even teachers (I was in HS) said anything or did anything to make my naive young self see what was happening.

I have a good friend, she has been my friend for almost 8 years. We have been through a lot together in that time and I consider her my family. Shes a bit of a late bloomer and wasn't ever interested in relationships until the end of college. When she did start dating, she didn't make very good choices. The guy she dated for a while was probably worse than the current SO. He called her names, told her who to hang out with, who not to talk to, made her feel guilty for doing things, yelled at her in front of people for no real reason, put her down in front of others, basically he was just a POS. I got fed up with it and as I was friends with them both, I cut my ties with him and explained to him why. I wasn't nice about it and I pretty much told him I thought he was an asshole and was ruining her life. Well, no surprise to me but she took his side and told me that I was wrong for yelling at him and she cut ties with my for a little while. Eventually they fought and ended things and she came back to apologize to me and I understood and forgave her. Fast forward 2 years and I feel myself in a similar situation with her. Every time I talk to her, she tells me horrible things that her current SO is doing to her: Manipulating her, showing aggression, threatening suicide if he doesn't get his way, calling her a bitch/whore/cunt/slut, accusing her of cheating, telling her who she can and can't hang out with. She will bring up several times in a conversation how she is ""ugly and fat"" and ""deserves to be called names sometimes."" She defends him by saying she deserves it, or that ""he was having a bad day."" I really don't know what to do. I, and some of our other friends, feel like we need to say something to her, but when we do she just gets mad and won't talk to us. I don't really want to confront her boyfriend because ... I've known him for a long time and I know saying anything to him is just as bad as saying anything to her. I don't want to, but I am almost ready to cut ties with her because I can't take hearing about it anymore and her getting mad at me!

t3_24w02c,Friend is Jealous When I Make Other Friends,"Hi all. I'm just looking to vent a little and seek some advice. I'll try to keep this somewhat short. 

Me: I'm pretty shy/timid and it's often hard for me to make new friends. 
J: She's very outgoing and talkative with practically anyone. 

I've been friends with J for around 4 years. When we first met she was super super sweet and really supportive. We had a similar sense of humor so we clicked really well and became close. I have other friends but J was someone who I spoke with on a consistent basis, usually daily. Once we got more comfortable with each other, I feel like J's real personality began to show and I learned she had a snarky/bitchy side (I guess everyone does though occasionally, I know I do). 

Anyways, over the course of our friendship J has made a lot of new friends. Maybe she would just get excited to meet someone new, but at times she'd hold newer friends on a pedestal while kinda treating her more long term friends like they're boring. Sometimes I felt like she was trying hard to make me jealous because she'd praise her new friend and go on and on about how wonderful and supportive they are. I felt a little annoyed at times but never really jealousy as I was used to how frequently she met new people. 

After going through a kind of depressive/weird phase that I kept mostly to myself, I felt a surge of confidence recently and began putting myself out there more and talking to people. I met someone new, I'll call her B, who I instantly clicked with and we shared a lot in common. B began introducing me to some of her friends who were equally as great as her. Anyways, J became super jealous even though I never ignored her or changed the amount of time I spend talking to her. Last Friday night B wanted to have a movie night at her place with a few people, she told me that I could bring J along if I wanted to (they don't really know each other but B is familiar with J). I invited J to come and she got totally bitchy with me and kind of shat on the idea. She later sent me a long message saying she was jealous and that she feels like I'm forgetting her and replacing her with someone else. She said she feels like I'm HER bestie and that it makes her feel weird that I'm getting close with someone else. She said she knows it's irrational to feel that way and that I should be allowed to have other friends but that she can't help the way she feels. I was a bit shocked that she said she felt like I'm forgetting her because I still talk to her all the time.

Another surprise too is that J hasn't really had much enthusiasm for our friendship for the past several months. I was having some health problems (nothing serious) and anxiety that made me a bit depressed so I wasn't my usual self but it wasn't like I was a downer either. I've always felt like I've had to entertain J or she gets bored easily. Sometimes it's exhausting. Perhaps I'm a bit annoyed while typing this and I feel it's a bit too one sided, but there ARE still things I like about J and we do have good conversations most of the time. 

In the moment, I reassured J that nothing was changing with our friendship and that I still liked her just as much. Honesty though, I feel really pissed off. I keep feeling like she is not someone who cares about my best interest. Especially since she knows that I've had a rough patch the past few months, this new friendship was something that really perked me up. I feel like any normal person would be happy about that for someone. She KNOWS I barely have any friends, why is she upset about me meeting more people? Especially since she is constantly doing things with people. Does she want me to be friendless and miserable forever?

t3_24whhb,Boyfriend says he probably won't stay with me if I have an abortion. I want one. Help?,"I(24) just found out I'm pregnant. I'm not ready for a baby. I don't have enough to support it, plus, my career is just kicking off. It's simply not a good time. I used the pill and condoms but somehow it still happened. 


My boyfriend (25) and I agreed before sex that if I were to be pregnant we'd abort. Two years later here we are. He says he can't bear the thought of it and that if I abort he's not sure if we can stay together. I love this guy to death. We were planning on getting married in the next year. That he would break up with me over a clump of (life ruining) cells hurts, but I know he doesn't see it that way. Still I feel cheated that he changed his views. I know it's different when you're actually experiencing it, but still. 


With our income combined we make over six figures, so whenever I say we can't afford it he brings that up. But ideally I'd want to have much much more in my savings before bringing a kid in the world. Plus like I said, the timing is awful. I'm not ready to be a parent. Three-four years-sure. Now-no. 



I'm very conflicted because I really want an abortion but I also love my boyfriend deeply. I try to explain to him why I'm not ready for a kid but he remains steadfast.



 On top of worrying about my relationship's future I also have to worry about getting the actual abortion, because my parents are pro-life and I don't really feel comfortable asking my friends to go with me to something like this. My boyfriend refuses to go. I can't go alone, since I'm getting anesthesia (unless I wait in the hospital for hours while it wears off.) I at least want him there with me, but he absolutely refuses. 



Sorry if this is jumbled, I'm pretty stressed. I feel like the clock is ticking and on one hand I want to get on with my life asap, but on the other hand I don't want to hurt my boyfriend, who I thought I'd spend my life with. Help?  



Tl,dr:


-Used 2 bc methods, got pregnant anyway (I was on an antibiotic for a few days and I think a condom may have broken once (*once!*). In retrospect it was stupid, but at the time I thought I was covered and it was fine.)


-I don't feel ready for a baby, financially and maturity wise. My boyfriend of 2 years does. 


-He says if I abort we'll probably break up because the thought of it disturbs him so much. I say I just can't have a child now. 


-I haven't scheduled an appointment yet. I know I want to but I keep waiting, hoping he'll come around (even though I know he won't.) What to do?",28,20140506171851,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_24wtve,"I have just started at a small law firm, but I want to quit due to a lot of red flags. Am I being over dramatic and all firms are like this? Sorry if wrong subreddit, but I am paranoid.","EDIT: I already have another interview lined up. Although some are whispering in my ear to simply leave without notice, I don't think I could do that unless it got way out of hand. Thank you so much for your kind and reassuring words. Telling him is going to be hard but I'm going to do it after my interview if it goes well. Thank you all again. I feel much better putting it all on the table and really analyzing the situation.

I was going to post in /r/LawFirms, but now I am terrified that he uses this site and goes on that subreddit. He has made me paranoid.

It's one guy. Somehow he has been running his firm by himself for months. I was hired spontaneously despite my utter lack of experience (I have education, but no practice). I know that it's important to not make mistakes since we're dealing with clients and court, but every time I make even a very minor mistake that would take a second to correct, he flips. He does not give constructive criticism, he tells me in a very annoyed/angry tone that I need to ""pay attention and get it together"" and by him having to fix my mistake (he makes me get out of my chair to fix it even though I tell him I can type it in but then he says he can't trust me) I'm wasting his time and then goes on a lecture of either how much other stuff he needs to do or why his system works.

He told me in the beginning that the people before me had quit on him. Now I find out he fired them. His whole team. At a law firm.

Also, he's paranoid. He goes on how other firms are jealous of him being able to do so much by himself so they're hiring people to call us and set up consultations they'll never commit to and ""waste his time"".

I am constantly on edge. I have only worked there less than a month, but I have never felt so stressed out in my life. I feel like I am making all of these mistakes because I am so terrified of making mistakes. I know my memory isn't that bad but for some reason when he gives me the simplest of instructions I completely freeze up.

Are most firms like this? There are other things I don't agree with, such as he is SO rude to people on the phone and cusses in front of clients. He does get the cases done, and he is rated very well, but the inside goings on just don't fit well with me.

I was paranoid that it was because I wasn't fit for this kind of job, and was bummed because I've wanted to work in a family law firm for a very long time.

I went back home for the weekend and talked with my dad for a bit. He mentioned that things with my mom and my stepdad are not going well. At all. A few weeks ago she came by to pick up my sister, and she had a black eye. Last week, Mom and Stepdad got in a fight, and he kicked her out of the car in the middle of an unfamiliar part of town; she had to walk around and find a church, no phone, no purse, nothing.

Both my mom and my stepdad have serious alcohol problems, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're both a danger to each other. But simply due to the size difference, I think my stepdad could pose a serious physical threat to my mom. He's also a hunter, so he has guns.

However now I'm at a point where it is safe to be honest, but my mind still jumps to lying first and I have to deliberately think about it if I'm going to tell the truth. 

So at work I have to apply to register for this federal scheme so I can get this paperwork which is important to doing my job. I had a total mind blank and didn't register before applying for the paperwork, so naturally I got back a polite rejection. 

My boss came in and I told him how I got rejected and would be reapplying, and he asked why. And instead of the sensible ""I forgot to register first"", I said ""I entered my registration number wrong"". I don't even know why I said that. So now I'm worried that this is going to ruin our good working relationship. 

So should I just let it slide and hope he doesn't find out, or should I go to him and tell him I misunderstood and here's the truth, or straight out tell him I lied, apologize, and tell him the truth. I'm just worried that the admin people will call work and he'll be caught out not knowing the whole story. Or I'm worried that my coworker will bring it up with him (if it werent for gossip this town would collapse) and then I'll look even worse.

Tomorrow my school is out for the summer.  There are a lot of cats in my school.  I was going to adopt [this one](http://imgur.com/a/v7zzq), I had named him popcorn.  Popcorn already used to come to me meowing, and he waited for his treats and food everyday. I had the chance to take him home last weekend but I didn't because I wanted to do everything right and talk to the school first.  They have been living in the same place for years, there was no way I could have seen this coming.  This morning, I went there to bring them some food and saw to my horror that their house (a hole on the ground) had been cemented and he was nowhere to be found. I started asking questions, first to the professors who feed them as well, and found out that they too were looking for answers.  I called / emailed the physical  planning of my school several times and no one took my call or replied to me.  I called the animal shelter to see if they had received any cats from campus, they assured me they haven't.  During the day I wasn't too worried cause I had hopes they ran and hid (but the hole *was* their hiding place), so I just stayed by the computer and the phone and went there several times to see if maybe they had escaped before the hole was cemented.  But none of them came back and they know that's where the professors and I put their food, so they should have come back by now, which means they were probably trapped there and are either dead or dying.  I was *so* sure he was coming home with me tomorrow!

The horror of it all just hit me, that they were probably buried alive, and it came along with another horror - the realization that people simply don't care.  I'm sorry if this is too silly, but I don't know how to handle it?  It seems like I should be doing something, cause I know that he (and the others) are there probably fighting for their life, but I don't know what else to do.  I told everybody, I asked for help, I *begged* for help.  He is probably dying and I know where he is and I feel like I **have** to rescue him but no one listens to me.  I can't just go there and break the cement on a private property and I don't even know what I am feeling right now when I imagine what he is probably going through.  Please tell me what to do.  I feel like I want to run away from my body and my mind I want to be someone else who doesn't know that this is happening.  I want to go back in time and I can't forgive myself that I had the chance to take him home last weekend and didn't.  I don't know if I am having an anxiety attack, a panic attack or what it is, but I can't breathe and I can't stop crying.  I am so horrified.  Please someone tell me what to do and how to handle this.  It is not like it is going to go away.

t3_24wovj,"Sexual Assault, Alcohol, & Attire: Giving Advice While Avoiding Victim-Blaming","Hi everyone, I'm looking for some guidance/constructive criticism (and hoping to avoid a flame war).

I help edit a blog for a local non-profit -- all bloggers are volunteers, including me, i.e., we're not all necessarily media-savvy pros. One of our writers put together a great post with advice for women going on vacation. However, there is one paragraph that is bothering me, but I'd like some input from other smart people before I go back to her with constructive criticism for how to change it.

She advises readers visiting other countries/cultures to avoid sexual assault by dressing in accordance with cultural norms and avoiding excessive drinking. I'm uncomfortable with those kinds of unqualified statements, as of course they can be interpreted as blaming the victim. I'm wondering if I should ask her to omit this paragraph completely, or if any of you think there are ways to advise women on ways to decrease their risk without entering victim-blaming territory.

I believe that the only people responsible for rape are rapists, but when we live in a world where most rapists are empowered by their surrounding culture to get away with their crimes, I think there must be ways to teach self-protection in ways that don't perpetuate these cultural structures.

Any insight would be appreciated!",0,20140506183959,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_24wjdz,I could really use some advice. I am a my wit's end in my current relationship.,"I am 24f, boyfriend almost 25 and is male. Been together 4 years, we currently live together. I have really been working hard to get better at communicating my needs in my relationship. I always thought it was my fault for not being clear, but I just recently emailed my boyfriend and I feel totally stuck on what to do next.

[First part of what was said](http://imgur.com/qomB3UQ)

At this point I regrettably lose my cool [and this is what I say next](http://imgur.com/K6WvsA8). At the end, I'm still left feeling like my problem isn't really resolved and only a few days later he again acts like what I said I didnt like in the email.it's like watching a 2yr old throw a tantrum the way he treats me when he doesnt want to talk.

I'm just so sick of not being able to find the right way to reach him, to have things made into my fault, to have my concerns completely ignored, to be treated like the problems in this relationship are all my fault.

Before you guys ask, I am with this person because we do have so much fun together and I enjoy being with him. But when I come to him with a concern it's like a switch flips and he's a totally different assholey person. Edited to add that he will not bring up concerns he has with me until I bring something up with him. He told the counselor ""I just feel like it's a good time"" and even the racist&sexist counselor told him that's not normal. After him doing that (feels like he's steamrolling me) so many times I feel like he does it on purpose, you know?

And yes, I have been to counseling a few times but it didn't work out and I am out of money and literally out of options in my area. The sessions were so incredibly unhelpful that I feel twoX is my last resort to figure things out in this relationship, at least for myself anyway.

I am 75% sure I am going to break up with him because after 4 years of the same ignoring me, being a jerk when he doesn't want to talk instead of using his words, making me feel like everything is my fault I am just so worn out.

So WW2XD? Could someone ""grade"" my activity in the emails I linked above? I.e. what could I have done better to get him to listen, tips to avoid letting the frustration show up.

**tldr: feeling stuck in a cycle in relationship with boyfriend. Could use some advice on how better to get him to understand and respect that I have feelings and needs- in fact I am going to sit down tonight and could use specific advice**

t3_24xck2,"When did TwoX become r/prochoice (or even pro-abortion)? Plus, the flip side of the Emily Letts video.","I am sick of clicking on to TwoX and being hit in the face with pro-abortion or pro-choice submissions.


The description of TwoX the side bar says ""Welcome to TwoXChromosomes, a subreddit for thoughtful content - serious or silly - related to gender, and **intended for women's perspectives**.""


Bearing that in mind, I have noticed that anyone submitting a pro-choice statement is pretty well left alone, or upvoted. 
Anyone submitting a pro-abortion statement is upvoted and supported, and anyone submitting an anti-abortion/pro-life statement is downvoted or receives backlash in comments.


Why is it OK to be pro-abortion and not pro-life in this sub? When did we decide that only one opinion could be had in TwoX? Isn't that what r/prolife and r/prochoice are for?
Is that the ""perspective"" we're supposed to have, abortion should be OK becuse I am a woman? That the choice not to agree with abortion is wrong, and goes against how we should feel as a woman?


And in regard to Emily Lett's video (the lady who filmed her abortion to show that it's not scary), I think that it sends a dangerous message. 


**While there are legitimate reasons for abortion** and it is much safer than it used to be, I think that this video sends the message that, ""If you get pregnant by accident, having an abortion really isn't a big deal.""


I feel that the focus should be on prevention rather than ""dealing with"" an unwanted pregnancy once it has occurred. As safe as abortions may be now, contraception is much safer, both physically and emotionally.

As much as we don't want abortion or unwanted pregnancy to affect our lives, and as much as we say it's our choice and noone else's, the fact remains that a pregnancy can affect others as well as yourself. If you are in a committed relationship, accidentally fall pregnant and don't want to keep it, there's a chance the woman's decision not to keep the fetus may be different to the man's opinion. And as much as it's YOUR body, it's HIS child too.


It oculd be that pro-choice is so massively supported in this sub because we feel that abortion is such an unpopular subject outside. In this day and age, while there is still a stigma attached to abortion, there is a lot of support for ladies who fall pregnant by accident.
We don't need to bash pro-life activists to support pro-choice. 

We have the choice to decide whether we do or do not want an abortion, and noone on this sub should be told they're wrong for not agreeing with someone else's choice. 

If a person can post about their pro-choice stance, a person should be able to post about their pro-life stance without facing backlash.",0,20140506231024,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

He did so with the intent to get me pregnant, thinking that is a way to stay in my life forever. He has self-esteem issues, but communication is big in our relationship. Obviously, with what happened, it's taken a backseat. 

I have voiced my opinion that should I ever become pregnant for the third time, I already have two children, I wouldn't hesitate to have an abortion. I already have too much going on in my life and cannot be slowed down with an infant. What makes matters worse, is that I'm a widow. I know people have different times of grieving and all, which is another reason I do not want to be pregnant and the partner knows all of this. I'm still trying to get the hang of being without my husband and finish school and provide for my children without someone else butting in with their bullshit.

He has voiced that he will not let me get an abortion because it's not something he wants. When he told me that, I immediately responded with, ""Well, I was never asked if I wanted to be impregnated, but it happened anyways.""

t3_24xwzm,I am really concerned about my 14 (almost 15) year old sister.,"She's five years younger than me. We didn't have the best family life growing up. Our dad is emotionally and physically abusive, and Claire (my sister) seems to take the brunt of the abuse. My dad loves our youngest sister (Elisa, 12 almost 13) and it's very obvious she's the golden child. My brother (Tim, 13 almost 14) seems to be okay. My parents seem to like him, but since he's a boy they've made him go to work almost every day he's been free, including after school, since he was two years old. I'm not exaggerating about how much he has to go to work on the farm with our dad. He has literally no free time to hang out with friends because he has to work so much. 

Anyway, back to claire. She's quite a bit heavier than us, and my dad never lets her forget that. He makes fat jokes about her daily, which I participated in until I realized how fucked up it was. Tim and Elisa still make fun of claire as far as I know. Example of a joke: we were watching animal planet and there was a whale on a sling that had to be transported to a hospital, and my dad said ""hey look, it's claire."" 

Claire won't hug or touch anyone, or let anyone touch her, which would be fine, but I think it's because she has never felt loved by her parents. She won't even tell anyone she loves them. She's very cold towards others, but I know how much she hurts. I can see it in her face when my dad makes fun of her. The only emotions she ever shows are fear, anger, and sadness. 

She has crippling social anxiety.. She can't even order her own food at restaurants, or check out at a store by herself. She won't go on school field trips or go to field days or anything. She never has friends over or goes to hang out with anyone. My parents told her she can't get a car until she's 21. I told her she can leave my parent's house and live with me when she turns 18, but she said she ""can't just leave,"" as if she has to be stuck there forever or something. 

During one of our dad's ""outbursts"" as I like to call them, Claire called me to tell me what was going on, and I called the police and told them the situation and that there was possibly going to be child abuse if they didn't go get involved and calm him down. The police got there and said there was a ""disturbance of the peace"" call, my dad said everything was fine, and the police left. That made me fucking furious. But I don't think he's had an outburst since, and it's been a year since that. Claire later told me ""thank you for calling the police. I'll go to that stupid therapist thing you were talking about."" Prior to then I had been talking to her about getting mental help. Not that my parents would allow it, but I told her when she's 18 she should go. 

I'm worried about her mental health and how she's going to function in the real world. I don't know what to do in this situation. ",35,20140507053856,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I made an appointment for tomorrow to get tested but in the meantime I'm really bummed out.

I've had some irresponsible sex in the past but of course never dreamed this would happen to me. I don't know what I'm looking for, just comforting words would be nice. I don't know what to do. If I do have herpes I'm just afraid of what the rest of my life is going to look like.

EDIT: So I went to the doctor and she almost laughed in my face and said ""there's no way in hell that's herpes."" So my google-fu is not as great as I thought it was. I'm really grateful I'm not infected, but thank you all so much for your insight, it really did calm my nerves and made me realize that even if I were infected, it wouldn't be such a big deal, and that I'd have a lot of people to turn to.

When my best friend and I decided to graduate a year early, that kind of left a lot of people behind. We both moved away as well, so while our other friends were still in HS we were out living our own lives. We always kept in touched and ended up living fairly close to each other. We had been best friends for 6 years up until probably 6-8 months ago. We both started getting a little more serious with the men in our lives. She moved in her with hers and I was usually staying with mine. Naturally we started spending less time together and more time with our SO's. We'd still talk occasionally. Then the talking and meeting up for dinner once a month stopped. I tried speaking to her, but she was so busy with her SO she didn't have time for me. So for the past 8 months the only person I've hung out with is my SO. Which I'm okay with, he's my best friend, but I have no other friends. I have co workers I talk to and hang out with maybe once every two months or so and he has friends that I see when we all hang out, but I don't just have a friend to talk to and hang out with. I'm moving out of state in January so it's almost pointless to try and make a new best friend here. I think it would be nice and just fun to have a pen pal. Someone I can write and tell my stories to, someone who can entertain me with their stories. If anyway is interested you can send me a message and we can exchange emails!

We are both poor but madly in love and I want to have a gorgeous ceremony without breaking the bank.

and the dress...I want a beautiful dress but I want a cheap dress and I don't really care about it being perfect. 

I also don't know what else to account for. 

we're both writing our own vows and we are not religious so the ceremony is mostly going to be about an exchange of words.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to make the ceremony even more special while minimizing costs? or what did you do at your wedding that you enjoyed that isnt too extravagant? I don't really care about the wedding itself, I just want to be married to the love of my life, but I do want the ceremony/ritual is slightly important to me, I want  it to be beautiful and memorable.

A little background: I have been working in this line of work for a while now (3 years at my present company, seven years total professional experience). It's a male-heavy industry, but I am one of two women in my specific department. The issue I'm confused about here involves being a 32 year old woman who looks approx 10 years younger than I actually am. Normally, I'm pretty pumped that people see me as younger, but my co workers are all below the age of 25. I've been thinking more about this lately, especially since we just hired a new person right out of college. He's 22. 

Aside from feeling a bit like Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused (I keep getting older while they stay the same age) I am wondering if looking much younger is hurting my career. I'd like to move up and be given the opportunity to grow, but feel like I can't because my superiors might think I ""lack experience"". Not everyone knows my work history. But I feel like I am to blame for letting my bosses think I'm a 22 year old newb because I'm viable parinoid about my actual age, rather then reminding then I'm been working for 17 damn years, and in this industry for 7. 

I'm also a little ashamed because  hiding my age is such a ""woman"" thing (ugh) that is to be expected. 

I'm sorry if this is not the right place, but it's such a weird situation and thought some other woman has had this sort of thing happen, and how the hell do I deal with this conflict in my head? 

I guess that I should mention that every time I bring up my age to anyone, ANYONE, they don't believe me. I still get carded at bars and when buying wine out. Last week when I told a fellow female worker in another department that we are, in fact the same age, after she condescended to me she demanded to see my damn drivers license. I have no idea how to handle this in my professional life, sorry for the rant. Please help :(

t3_24yk2c,"I'm on the pill and my periods have suddenly gone totally off the rails. Advice/Insights appreciated, ladies (also posted on r/birthcontrol)","Sorry this post is so long...!

I started taking Loestrin 24 FE in September of 2013. The first five months or so were perfectly normal (typical light spotting issues the first month or two as are common when starting the pill, so I consider that to be ""normal""). I still got periods, but they were significantly lighter than what I'd had before.

The fifth month is where things started to get weird. I normally take my pills at night before bed, but forgot to one night, so I took it first thing in the morning -- about 12 hours later. According to my pill, that's perfectly fine. Two weeks later, spotting, and I was 5 days away from the 4 placebo pills. Period came as normal.

Then, the next month, I spotted very very lightly in the first half of the pack... followed by no period at all during the placebos. Again, fell asleep before taking my pill just one time, but took it first thing the next morning, well within 12 hours.

After no period at all during the placebos, I started the next pack. 6 days into the new pack, I started cramping/bleeding... was light at first, then much like a regular period... and it lasted nearly a week. I've also been kind of queasy some mornings. Nothing that keeps me from eating, but sometimes I'm not as hungry as I used to be when I wake up.

My boyfriend (he's clean) and I just use the pill as BC. I've taken 2 pregnancy tests after not bleeding on the placebos -- both came back negative.

I've been a bit more stressed than usual the past 6 weeks, and I've changed my diet/exercise regime slightly the past few months. But I'm just a little paranoid that something could be up. Obviously concerned about the possibility of pregnancy even though the tests came up negative (the internet has lots of scary stories about this happening). I went to the doctor, told her all this, and her conclusion was to up my dosage starting on the next pack.

Any thoughts or similar experiences would be super reassuring to hear.

t3_24zaqd,Possible allergy to long-term Paragard? Thoughts please.,"Hi everyone. I've had a paragard for 3 years. I wonder if this is related or not. My question is as follows:

I keep getting infections. For the past 4 months, every month before my period I get a yeast infection or BV. Usually they go away when my period starts, but not this time. I'm actually itching *inside* (Also outside). It burns when I pee & I itch continuously.  

I also have begun to spot before & after my periods. Last month my period was 2 weeks late (it came the day after my husband came home from the oilfield, haha whoops), which I chalked up to stress. It started right after we DTD.  I had a really light (for me) period, but it lasted *12 days* (So no more fun times & then he had to leave again!). I use a Diva Cup & that's practically unheard of for me (I usually can't leave the house the first two days). 

A year ago when I got my pap the iud had migrated to the side (not sure why). The strings are so short I have never been able to reach them. When I went to the dr they brushed off my concerns & said it was just the iud adjusting. Since it is non- hormonal & it's been 3 years, shouldn't my body have adjusted by now? 

I am also very allergic to nickel (I break out & get a weeping itchy rash from copper plated nickel, silver plated nickel, etc). I know that the paragard has a nickel core (just a tiny amount). Could I have developed an allergy to my iud? 

I am not averse to getting it out, it's just really expensive w/o insurance. 

Note: I am not eating processed sugary foods & am eating a ""keto"" diet (basically very low carb paleo).

I don't use other form of protection, because I make perfect use of them (meaning, I take them every single day at the same time, haven't taken medicines that could interfere or had vomits or diarrhea). I never experienced any spotting nr disturbances with my period. Had it normally for two cycles, although lighter than it used to be when I didn't take the pills. Now, last week I was on the placebo week, and my period came on time thursday morning as always but it was a tad lighter than before and only lasted two days an a half.

t3_24yu0i,Depending on partner for money. Stress and panic has overwhelmed me.,"I grew up middle class until my father died... then I finished growing up in the lower-middle class.  Luckily, my mother had a great job that opened up doors to promotions and as I went away to college, our small family was pretty financially stable.  

As a child, I saw the financial struggle my mother was in and would joke around by saying, ""Someday I'll marry a doctor and never have to worry about these things.""  My mother was less than pleased with that statement and continued to stress the importance of financial independence, education, and finding a good job.  

I recently graduated with my master's degree.  During that time, I starting dating my current boyfriend.  We have an awesome relationship and I could easily see us together for quite a long time.  We've lived together for a few years now and every expense has been divided 50/50.  

Well, after graduating comes job hunting and subsequent huge life decisions.  Both my boyfriend and I had been searching for jobs throughout the country.  Luckily, my boyfriend was offered an awesome job just outside of a big city that I love.  Because they wanted him to start his new job so quickly, we've been living apart for the past week or so.  I'll be heading down to our new apartment this weekend.  The distance hasn't been a big deal (although I absolutely hate having to pack everything up on my own) but as I sit here, surrounded by our boxed-up lives and cleaning supplies, I'm starting to panic.  

I haven't been financially dependent upon anyone since high school.  Except for the small amounts of help from my mother throughout my college days, I've done pretty much everything on my own.  Now, all of a sudden, I'm going to be dependent upon someone else for my finances... at least for a little while.  I've been searching and applying to jobs in our new city, but have gotten nowhere.  I have a pretty marketable degree, decent experience, and a lot of passion, but no job.  

I think the panic I feel is coming from the worry that, for some unknown reason, my boyfriend and I will break up and I will be left poor and alone.  I am also finding myself equating a paycheck with self worth and am feeling pretty down about the entire situation.  He proposed getting a joint bank account and has set up direct deposit from his job into that account, but I just don't feel right spending his money.  

If anyone has experience with this, I'd love some advice.

And Sven is just like, ""I love my life....getting pics now...haha."" And Sven might've showed my boyfriend the pictures. I didn't say anything because at this point I'm falling asleep. 
I'm really pissed off about this. One it's really awkward if he was getting a boner while sleeping in our bed. Second, I'm mad at Sven because I feel this behavior isn't respectful. If Sven did show my boyfriend some of the pictures, then it is even more of an issue because the girl meant those as private pictures. I'm mad at my boyfriend for not saying anything.

I talked with my SO this evening. We ended up having an hour long conversation where I told him honestly that I didn't think I could be a parent today-some day in the future (with him hopefully) but now I was not equipped. I asked him for his feelings and he said he felt like I was rejecting a piece of him and abandoning a child-our child. (Which honestly made me feel very guilty. Not guilty enough to justify bringing a child into the world though.)



I told him I felt differently but that his feelings were valid. But I decided to get the abortion because I'm just not ready to be a mother now. I hope to be someday, and I don't want to have a child before I can devote myself entirely to it. He said he sort of understood but still felt as though we were abandoning a child. I apologized to him. 



I asked him again if he could go with me to the clinic because (I know it's selfish) I really want someone I know well with me. He said he'd think about it and get back to me. I made an appointment for next week. 



So I'm not sure where our relationship will go from here. He still hates the idea of abortion but I think he hates it a little less now. I'll have to see how he feels afterwards. 



I'm really glad I made the appointment though because the thought of being a mother scares me even more than him leaving, although that's a really hard choice to make. Thanks to everyone who wrote. I appreciate it. ",45,20140507200517,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_250lbe,What it's like as a woman having thin hair [a rant].,"I have thin hair. Not only thin, but fine and smooth. Let me define those terms.

Thin hair means I have not a lot of strands on my head. 

Fine hair means the individual strand width is not big around.

Smooth means each strand has little friction against the others.

I have my hair highlighted blonde because bleach damages the hair strands and makes them a little frizzy. This helps with body.

I never use conditioner.

So I have little hair which is small and lays like silk against my small melon (head). Not only that, the back of my head is pretty flat, so if I don't poof it out at the back I look sort of like a half melon stood on end. 

In addition, I have a wide neck. So if I cut my hair into a pixie cut I just look out of proportion. Like Zippy the Pinhead if you're familiar with that comic. The best look for me is a turtleneck (which have, unfortunately, fallen out of fashion somewhat) and during summers I am SOL. I wear v-neck shirts exclusively which helps, somewhat.

All of this means if I want to leave the house each morning looking halfway decent, I HAVE to wash and blow dry my hair. Every day. If I shower at night and want to 'get up and go' the next day it requires a hat. 

I am constantly asked why I keep my hair short. It's because I cannot grow it long. First of all, it stops growing when it gets to my shoulders and second, it gets stringy at the bottom long before that point. I would grow it out and put it into a ponytail but that exacerbates the smallness of my melon and the ponytail is only about half an inch thick. The Asian women at my work exclaim over how small it is. I have yet to come up with a witty comeback.

Google ""fine thin hair"" and you'll find photos of various celebrities **including Jennifer Anniston**. Are you fucking kidding me? She's GREEK. You'll also find a lot of photos of people with huge heads and thin necks which can make short hair look pretty good.

Everyone thinks they can give me advice despite the fact that I've been living with this hair for over 40 years. ""Oh, you should try this"" or ""My friend did that"", all of which assumes I don't know or understand how my hair grows and what looks best on me.  They all ""know"" what will look better despite never having worked with my hair, head, neck or face. 

When I had extensions they were so very pretty. People smiled at me, held doors for me, hit on me. I was dating at the time and I posted a pic online and within a day or two had over 200 responses. Before I had the extensions I had maybe 15 over a week. 

Guys who can't grow beards know my pain, to an extent. They understand what it's like to want something that others have but they cannot have. But... imagine if 99% of actors had beards. If every guy on a magazine cover had a beautiful beard. Imagine if it was universally accepted that beards were attractive and no beard was what older or less-attractive guys had. Imagine if every woman they met was taken with beards and most guys could grow beards and beards were the absolute norm. Yeah.

I do the best I can. /rant

Lately she's been having a rough time with school, friends and boys. There's also been conflict with her parents. I think some of the issues she's encountering are normal for someone her age but there are some other factors at play. She was adopted and has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

She has admitted to ""doing stuff"" with her last boyfriend but says they stopped short of having sex. Now she has a new boyfriend and recently told me (and her mom) that she doesn't understand the big deal about sex and doesn't see many reasons to wait until she's older.

She and I get along well and I feel she values my POV more than that of her parents because she sees me as more relatable (I'm in my mid twenties). She thinks her parents want her to save sex for marriage because they are religious so she discounts anything they tell her. I've tried talking to her about the consequences of having sex but I don't think any of what we discussed will deter her. We talked about pregnancy but she thinks the biggest negative would be getting kicked out of her house (I don't know how realistic that is). I tried talking to her about the emotional impact (what if they have sex and he decides he doesn't want to see her anymore? Could she handle that?). I don't think she has much foresight and I don't know how well she understands the consequences of her actions. 

She's been bullied at school and is very hurt that other girls call her ""slut"" behind her back. We talked about how unfair this double standard is (no one says anything negative about the male party) but it doesn't make this any easier for her to deal with. I'm really worried about the possible implications of her having sex (especially her getting hurt and the bullying getting worse). She doesn't have good coping skills as is and I'd hate to see her go through worse. I'm totally at a loss for what else to say to her from a sex-positive point of view (or am I not being sex-positive by thinking she's too young to have sex?). I welcome any ideas/suggestions.

t3_24zzf3,How do you exude professional confidence?,"I always love the advice this subreddit provides, and I'm not sure where else to ask. So thank you in advance to all the professional/confident women who may help me out.

I've just received a huge promotion and will be the assistant manager in a store with over 60 associates. I will be in charge of teaching, leading, correcting, and assisting these associates. I've been in positions of leadership before, but not to this level.

I was originally confident that I would succeed, but my training has shaken that confidence.  I am young, and look younger than I am.  Many of the associates I will be in charge of have worked in that building longer than I've been alive, and have a reputation for challenging fresh meat.  Despite that, I felt ready.

However, all the people who have been training me have assumed I am not confident, saying things like if I don't toughen up, I will be ""chewed up and spit out"".  This was based not on my prior leadership skills, because they haven't witnessed those, but based on how I present myself in my interactions. I'm shy, soft spoken, and very quiet until I feel comfortable. The people I've worked with for years have no doubt in my knowledge and skill, but there is a discrepancy in how I am read by those I don't know well.

My question is: what are some tips to exude the confidence I had without coming off as a know it all? What are some tips for addressing or correcting people old enough to be my grandparents, who know as much as I do about our industry? How can I not appear afraid, but not seem naive to the challenges I will face?

I already bought some professional clothing and am considering a haircut, but tips are welcome here as well.

How can I get my confidence to shine through?

t3_24zxp2,A few questions about our new status,"So I have a few questions about this now being a default subreddit. 



1. Is there anybody here, at all, who thinks that becoming a default is a good idea or supports it? I have seen nothing but comments saying that this is a terrible thing and that we are doomed. (I know the reasoning, I know that there are plenty of people out there who will not add anything relevant to the dialogue, but I think this can be a good thing as well)


2. I know that many men are already posting ""Oh but not all men are like that!"" comments, and it seems like people are already getting fed up with it. I am not sure why people are annoyed by this. It seems to me that you should be happy to clarify your view with someone if they are legitimately interested. Not be upset with them for trying to share their point of view with you. So can you please explain why this influx of new visitors who care about these discussions is a bad thing?


3. This is not actually related to our new status, but a question in general. And more of a curious ""how this place works"" than anything else. This will sound like I am trying to be a jerk, but I swear I'm not. At one point I saw a post on here about someone that had just accomplished something great. (I THINK it was graduating college, but I can not quite recall what it was. ) It was a great accomplishment, but it had nothing to do with being a woman (as far as I can tell). It was simply ""I achieved this great thing, just so you know"". I asked how this post was relevant in the guidelines ""4. Relevance: Please submit content that is relevant to our experiences as women, for women, or about women"". I did not get any explanations, just a ton of downvotes. 
Was I in the wrong for asking how this relates to XX?

Hey TwoX, this post was shared on the facebook group for a feminist club at my old high school and I thought this community would enjoy discussing it.  I thought her post was a very well written critique of high school dress codes.

Some points for discussion: do you agree with dress codes like this and why?  Is there a way to fairly enforce these rules?  The typical response is that these rules are unfairly enforced but I'd love to hear diverse thoughts.

t3_250d0v,"I need some advice 2X, I have a constant fear that my boyfriend is going to die/leave me.","I really need some advice. I feel like I'm destroying my relationship because of how I've been feeling about other things outside of the relationship.

I've been a member of 2X for awhile, but I'm a little bit embarrassed so I've made a throwaway account. Just a little context: my long-term boyfriend is honestly so amazing, attentive, helpful, and caring, he means so much to me. I've been upset with other areas of my life which doesn't help, but for the last few months I've been having nightmares of him dying of various diseases/disasters. I'm now constantly worried when I'm awake that something bad is going to happen to him. Being upset with other areas of my life, hes been a huge support, but I feel like me being constantly upset, I've been a burden to him. He's assured me that I'm not a burden, but I can't help but feel that I am. This feeling of being a burden has made me start looking into everything he's doing as a sign that he is getting bored, or can't handle me anymore and is going to leave. 

Its hard because I find myself relying on him more than I ever did, which doesn't help, because it makes me that more afraid of losing him. In the end I'm causing more damage than good by worrying. 

I'm wondering if any 2Xers have gone through a similar experience and if you know how to get yourself out of this rut? I feel like I'm going in this bad circle, and I just don't know how to pull myself out of this way of thinking. 

**Edit: Thank you for the help for those that commented :) It is nice getting a perspective that isn't mine. After reading the comments I realized that I have anxiety on just about everything, not just my boyfriend, he has been what I've been focusing on so its what came out on the comment.... but if I start thinking about any one thing I start to get crippling anxiety over it and also start to panic. I have done a google search as was suggested, and am going to start going through some ways to make this better.... as well as going to take up some other suggestions (exercise, yoga, distractions, lists, etc)**",0,20140507214728,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I am getting married in two months, and have a problem with one of my bridesmaids. Over the past few months, she has been blowing me off, and in general not talking to me that much. I get it, we're in college, I've probably played into that as well. However, she used to live with me and my other roommates, one of which is a now ex-boyfriend of hers (he is also the best man in the wedding). He ended up kicking her out for a list of reasons, and she took it out on my fiance. She never apologized for it, and he wanted her out of the wedding party. I said no, she's just going through a tough time. Today though, I just found out that she won't be going to my bridal shower, because she doesn't want to take off work. The weekend before she took off for her sister's graduation, so she said she won't do it again the following weekend.
Am I being crazy thinking that I should remove her from the wedding party? I'm really hurt that she wouldn't even try to make it to something that only (hopefully) once happens in my life. I feel like this is just the last straw, but I need level heads removed from the situations input...

Basically, I am confused about why my stomach protrudes most of the time. 

I am 5'7"" and 128 pounds, which is on the lower end of the BMI scale.  I  have always been naturally skinny, but I do work out for fun.  I'm 26.  Sometime in the past few years I've noticed that my tummy is always kinda bulging out.  It isn't fat (well it is a little bit), but I'm not really sure what is happening.  I guess it's bloating?

About 2 years ago I didn't eat much for a couple days (mental health issue, all good now) and my stomach was totally flat.  Does that imply that the issue is with what I'm eating?  Or do I just need to strengthen my ab muscles? 

I feel a bit embarrassed that at 26 I still have no idea what is happening with my body and it isn't something that warrants a visit to my doctor (I don't think).

t3_250xzs,I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone but I need advice please,"I've been with my boyfriend for a while and he has always been nothing but sweet and caring I love him and up until this weekend i saw my self with him for the rest of my life. My boyfriend and I went to a party with his co-workers whom I had never met. He never drinks a lot but that night he drank way to much so i had to drive him home to his parents. I thought it was very silly at first since I had never seen him like that so I was in a good mood walking him to the car. When I started driving  I wasn't exactly sure how to get home so  he told me where to go. After a couple of minutes I noticed we weren't going in the right direction so i told him he was wrong, he then got very mad and started yelling and yanking at my seat belt so I parked his car at a parking lot. I tried getting my phone to work but it died so I took his phone, he then started telling me to put ""the numbers in a computer"" I just ignored him since he wasn't being very clear and I kept telling him I was doing that. He then got furious and started yelling for me to look at him and since I didn't he grabbed on to my wrists and wouldn't let go. I got really scared specially since he had never done anything like that to me ever . I started screaming and yelling for him to let me go and I got one hand loose so I smacked him and he then slapped me back so hard. Then I started crying and I didn't know what to do so I called his mother and told her I was taking him then he tried to grab me again and the phone fell so I ran out the car and when he tried to follow me he fell and he calmed down. I then grabbed the phone and told his mother he hurt me but that he was calm so I'd start driving. On the drive back he kept yanking the seat belt and he tried to put it around my neck but when I yelled he moved back. He then started saying really weird things like how did I hurt you if you don't have feelings and ""is it OK if I rape you"". At that point I was close to his home so I felt like I was in a trance so I got off and helped him to his door. His mother answered the door and asked what happened but I couldn't even talk and the whole time my parents had been calling me so called back and they said they were on their way. His mother offered me a ride but I told her no since I didn't want to be near them. She then took him inside and he kept ranting about how he was afraid of me and how he didn't trust me and when I went near him and he yelled not to touch him, everything exactly how I had told him on the road moments prior. So she asked what I had done and I just walked out in time to see my sister in the front door. I ran to her and she hugged me and asked me what was wrong I told her my so had hit me and she them tried to run inside but so's mother wouldn't let her and she told my sister I had no idea what I was saying and she told us to go home. My father tried to talk to her but she said we had to hear his side of the story. So I went home with my family. My family was furious because they had trusted him and they were mad at his mother for her behavior towards me. The next afternoon he texts me that he's sorry but doesn't remember a thing and that his mother asked what I had done to him so I explained to him the same story and he felt bad and said he wanted to talk to my parents. I told him to clear things up with his parents because I thought it was unfair that they put the blame on me. He waited until the next day and he came over after that. Now I was raised to believe that men don't hit women and I always told myself I'd leave whoever laid hands on me. So he apologized and asked why I had let him drink so much and he said it wasn't him that he'd never do anything like that but I couldn't even bear sitting next to him because I was so scared and I felt like he didn't understand how terrified I had been that Saturday night so I told him to leave. Before he left my mother asked him to talk to her so they sat down and she (surprisingly calm) told him she was disappointed in him and that his mother owed me an apology earlier  he said his mother wasn't mean to me but my sister explained to him what happened and he said we were right. And this is where I'm not sure I did the right thing or not because even though he seemed sincere I told him I didn't want to be with him. My mother told him to try to get me back and now I'm sitting here in my bed not knowing what to do and I'm too embarrassed to ask for advice from anyone. sorry for the rant and thanks for reading .

t3_250zjw,My husband is a sexist asshole who harasses all the women that work for him.,"I usually browse more than post, but I'm going to use a throw away anyway to avoid being identified.

My husband and I have been married for a year. We're both pretty young - I'm 21 and he's 22. I'm in graduate school and he graduated from undergrad last year.

He opened up a restaurant 6 months ago. For those of you that don't know, the restaurant business is pretty terrifying. Like 99% of new restaurants fail. But he's doing okay. Business was really good for the first month and has trailed off some, but it's held steady for a while and it's good enough to support us comfortably.

The issue is he's a sexist pig. He treats all the waitresses very poorly. He's very belittling and treats them like they're idiots. Just as an example, some time ago he started calling the waitresses ""his girls"" and himself the ""pimp master"". It's gotten to the point where he purchased a purple suit and cane that he wears when he's at the restaurant. 

He claims it's okay because they don't mind because he's paying them well (they make $15/hr + tips). But that makes it worse - most of them are college students (we're located about a 2 minute walk from a very very large university. Most of the people that live/go here are students and it's where all the good restaurants/bars are), so they're just willing to put up with being harassed because, like most college kids, they need the money.

I figured that after a little while customers would see his behavior, get mad, and he'd be forced to not be a douchebag and that'd be the end of it, but it hasn't happened. The customers don't give a shit. 

His behavior is also a bad example for the customers. The average customer is a drunk 20 year old (the restaurant is right by most of the bars - literally 50% of the people that come in are drunk. Peak hours are between 10pm and 3am on Friday and Saturday, as an example.) Seeing him be an asshole to the waitresses encourages the customers to do the same, making their job even harder.

He's also an asshole to all the female customers, but to a lesser extent.

In high school, I met my friend and ended up getting along really well with her family. 5 years later I can hang out and the mom is pretty comfortable with me.

So I have spent the month here, because my friend just had her baby and she wanted someone around to keep her company at home. 
While being here my friends mother was talking about wanting to end her Marrige because she is very unhappy in it. He is emotionally abusive, extremely controlling and,  mooches off of her with no job an does basically nothing around the house outside of telling everyone else what to do and the ""right way"" of doing it. 
The problem is, she is afraid to do it. In the past he had a drinking problem and ended up beating her up pretty bad. He quit drinking and they ended up getting back together. She is stil afraid of him and during some arguments he kind of threatened her, IMO. For example she brought it up in an argument and he said ""that was mostly my fault and partly yours. I was mad and was drinking and you kept giving me mean looks like the one you are giving me now. You only bring this shit up when there are other people in the house, like you are trying to provoke me into hitting you. I only did that cause I had alcohol, I won't hit you. If I had alcohol it might be another story..."" and so on.

She really doesn't want to involve police or anything like that. She is stuck trying to think of a peaceful reason to end things. Recently a pretty shocking thing in his past came up which is pushing her at the edge. Whenever she brings it up he immediately dismisses it. 

TL:DR Friends mom wants to end Marrige, though due to past abuse she is afraid.

A really close friend of mine, someone I can open up to and talk to about literally everything, has been going through tough times recently, and I simply don't know what to say to her anymore. She is in a committed relationship with my best friend, and I have no intention of ever wanting to get with her, but I do want some advice on what to tell her.

So basically she is a fairly popular, musical theatre, Starbucks kind of girl, and insanely pretty, even though she doubts me when I tell her that. But anyways, she has some pretty bad.. Habits? For lack of a better word. She is bulimic, and anorexic, but some how maintains a healthy, sexy weight. But she also cuts and burns her wrists, legs, and breasts. I'm the only one that she has ever told, and I try to relate with her as best as I can, and spend as much time talking to her and hugging her through it, so she's never tempted to purge or self harm. However, I'm really running out of things to tell her. It doesn't seem like she's going to stop anytime soon, and I try to tell her that she's strong and to just fight it, but it's impossible for her it seems. I tell her that she's beautiful everyday, and that she has no reason to do this to herself, but she always tells me she just can't stop, and she's scared of gaining weight so she purges. And then to keep her mind off of how hungry she is, she burns and cuts her skin until the pain is unbearable and she has no choice but to think about how much her arms and legs hurt. She hates it when I tell her to stop, because it's not something new to her, she knows she should stop, but simply cannot.

To top it all off, she recently told my best friend ( her boyfriend ) what she does to herself, and why. He told her how disgusted he was with her, and that their entire relationship is now a disappointment to him, and that if he didn't love her so much, he would leave her. That sent her spiraling out of control, and I find myself now talking to her all night until 5am, or having someone knock on my door at midnight to stay the night, and all she does is cry her self to sleep in my arms. I feel like I've told her everything I can, and I've even googled some things that I find fitting to tell her, and this sub reddit seems like a perfect place to get some new POVs and things to reassure her with.

I love her to death, and it almost brings me to tears to see my friend of 15 years debilitating before my eyes. So I need someone to help me, just anyone who has an opinion, I would greatly appreciate.

**Original Post**

I really think this rule could help matters in keeping this subreddit from turning into a total shitshow in light of this change.

Sexism affects women on a personal basis. We all know this. But having uninformed new subscribers arguing hypotheticals with the intent to derail, claiming ""not all men are like that"", rambling about the man's potential/theoretical intent for the female OP's experiences that they themselves were not present for, ""why are you getting so riled up about this"", ""where are your facts""... (edit 4) **in personal experience posts in particular, not in news articles or opinion pieces, are damaging to this community and unnecessary.** I don't want to force all men to shut up forever by any means, I just want them to step back, breathe, think about whether or not their comment is necessary, whether the OP probably already knows whatever devil's advocacy point you are trying to make, if it will be constructive at all, and maybe x out of the page if it isn't. (/edit 4)

These dismissive comments of women's experiences are all inevitable, and it feels like several huge steps back for our pre-default community. 

If being default is permanent no matter what, no matter how frustrated the community is with the decision, which it seems to be, we need to mitigate the people who come in here totally uninformed for the sanity of the women who post here if we actually expect to keep any women around.

This rule could help in terms of how many women are jumping ship upon the sub going default.

Thoughts? Help with rephrasing? Agree / disagree? Why? Let's have a discussion - it seems more productive than me rambling to myself in the shower about how annoyed I am.

---

Edit: The operative words here are 'for the sake of it'. I have never taken issue with men participating in 2XC, but I do take issue with men potentially flying into personal issue/experience posts with those sorts of comments when they do not add much to the discussion at hand.

A lot of posts on this subreddit are not about news discussions, but personal issues or experiences faced by women. Playing devil's advocate for funsies in **those** threads is what I am most bothered by.

Edit 3: /u/AsteroPolyp made this suggestion that I think is very astute and much better phrased than my initial post.

>I ABSOLUTELY AGREE!! But say ""newcomers"" instead of ""men.""

>Some subreddits put big red boxes above the ""leave a comment"" box telling you about the subreddit rules. I think we need that. And the rule can really be as simple as you said: this isn't the place to be a smart ass and argue for the sake of it; this is a supportive place.

>Rule #1 says ""No assholery"" which I think was written specifically about the issue we're talking about. But it needs to be much more prominent now.

I honestly think that is a very good idea. However, right now we are in a stage where we need to throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks, and we need to protect the basis of this subreddit's existence - women's perspectives.

My kneejerk reaction to this thread blowing up and my less than perfect phrasing was 'oh god, delete it', but I'm keeping it up. This discussion is important and I want to hear other suggestions - otherwise we can't figure this out and move forward.

I do not want to discourage men from contributing at all, but this subreddit, despite it being a default, is not geared towards men. It is for women's experiences, and many guys get too excited about getting into a debate before they think about the emotional impact their 'devil's advocate' posts might cause the OP on, say, an abortion thread, a rape thread, a sexual harassment thread, a period thread... **where the woman is asking for advice, support or help.** I am not trying to hamper discussion over topics where both men and women could have a say, like news articles, opinion pieces, etc. I see where it sounded like that, but that was not my intent.

There are times and places for discussion between men and women, but I do not want women to lose their platform in our own subreddit just because we have become a default.

Edit 5: I get the feeling that if I try to clarify or delete the (admittedly) badly worded first part of my post, I will be accused of backpedalling. No idea why, guess I must be psychic. Regardless, I admit that my phrasing is dismissive of men as a gender and that that detracts from what I want to accomplish, and what 2XC intrinsically stands for. 

I wanted to spitball with you guys here, but I simply do not have the time or energy to reply to every single person. If you want to believe me to be sexist, that is absolutely your right to do so. At least the discussion is starting.",960,20140508131650,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I love this sub. It is a fantastic community and I really think it's one of the best ran sub that I subscribe to. That being said, I was at first really upset that we went to default. This community that I sincerely care about is being opened up to a massive audience, the heartfelt stories that I connect with are going to be met with pervy and misogynist comments! How could the mods do this?!?

But as I've thought about it, and from the content that's being submitted so far, I don't mind. Why shouldn't we be a default? Our experiences and our content is just as important as anything else that's on the front page, and if anything, I think we are doing more harm to our community if we all jump ship. As women, we shouldn't fear being heard. If we stop posting and commenting, all those who are out to do nothing but troll are getting exactly what they want. The mods have heard up their end of the deal, banning and deleting comments that don't follow our rules in the sidebar. And from the backlash posts I've seen, it just shows how much the users care about this sub. So it's going to take some diligence on all of our parts, report users who are here for the wrong reasons, and KEEP POSTING AND KEEP USING THOSE ARROWS!

t3_2529um,My ex thought I was repulsive and I don't know how to get past it.,"Throwaway because ex checks out Reddit.

Two years ago, I met a man online and we hit it off instantly.  He was in the process of relocating to my city, so the first couple of months were long-distance.  Soon we were talking on the phone at least an hour a day.  We had so much in common we both found it remarkable--similar temperaments and past experiences, same sense of humor, so many common interests it was scary.  Conversation was effortless.  He is very emotionally literate and it was amazing to talk with someone not only about our backgrounds and interests, but also about our thoughts and feelings.  After about a month he used the ""L"" word, which maybe seems crazy, and maybe it was.  But I felt the same way.  After several unsatisfying relationships with guys who weren't really compatible in retrospect, I'm not gonna lie--I had serious thoughts about a future with this person.  He told me he felt the same way.

After a few months, he had relocated and we made plans to meet.  We were both really excited.  We had exchanged pics; all seemed well.  But the day I met him turned out to be one of the worst, most humiliating days of my life.  We'd made plans to meet at his place.  When he opened the door, his face fell.  He was visibly not attracted to me.  But I was so caught up in all the feelings of recent months that I couldn't register his lack of attraction.  It just didn't compute that our romantic relationship, such as it was, was now over.  I went to kiss him; he kissed back, but without feeling.  We talked a little, and, god help me, we ended up in bed.  I wish more than anything that he had stopped me in my delusion and shut it down.  But there I was, undressing in front of this man I (thought I) loved, seeing but not processing that he didn't like what he saw, and losing what little scraps of dignity I had left.  

This craziness went on for the whole evening and into the next day.  We had sex several times (pity fucks, in retrospect); our conversations became increasingly interspersed with him snapping at me and literally cringing and moving away when I tried to touch him.  Eventually--it's so fucking humiliating that it took me this long--I asked him what was going on and he said, ""I'm just not attracted to you.""  I stood up, went to the bathroom and threw up, packed my bag, and left.  He called and sent emails asking to still be friends; I said no.  And that was it.  All I wanted was to crawl into a hole and die.

I'm the stereotype of the chubby girl with a pretty face.  I honestly thought this was clear in my pictures, which were current and accurate, but I only sent shots from the waist up, which obviously was the worst kind of mistake.  Apparently the whole of me, in the flesh, was not a package he liked in any way.  (To be fair, he sent similar shots, from years ago, so he was older and bigger in person.  I didn't care.)  We didn't Skype, I should have sent more pictures, I was an idiot, I've obviously learned my lesson.  It's so painful to think he was so disappointed and even that he perhaps even felt I misled him, which I didn't mean to at all.  Even now, it makes me nauseous to think about it.

I've had my share of failed dates and relationships but Jesus, I've never gotten the sense I was literally repulsive--I'm well-groomed, look after myself, dress well for my body type, etc.  Maybe you're thinking there's some gross thing about me I'm not telling you, but I truly don't think there is (and it's not like I haven't spent agonizing hours thinking about it).  Since this happened I've gone back to the gym and gotten into lifting weights in particular; I like that it makes me feel strong, I'm more toned, and I feel more confident in my day-to-day life.  But I just cannot get over what happened two years ago.  I feel so profoundly humiliated, as a woman and as a person.  He took one look at me and it was over for him.  I was so pathetically love-blind I couldn't see what was happening right in front of me.  I went to bed with him.  I took my clothes off, and can't bear to think now of what must have been going through his mind as he looked at me.  I became so repellent to him that he winced at my touch.  And then it was over.

My question is, how can I get over this?  I haven't been with anyone since then.  My romantic self-confidence, shaky as it was, is now shattered.  This has really broken me.  I thought a good man loved me, and then he saw me, and I was repulsive, and that was it.  I'm okay in my day-to-day life, but I still lie in bed some nights, and the pain is so electric I cover my face and cry.  Goddammit I'm crying now.  

I don't know what it will take to move past this, but I'd appreciate your thoughts.  Please don't be an asshole.  Unless you're blind you can see this is excruciating enough for me as it is.  Thanks.

Women are the minority here on reddit and making 2XC a default sub is bound to change things.  One of the issues we will face is that a lot of commenters on this sub will now be male, providing a male perspective on women's issues.  Personally, I like to keep my participation in reddit gender neutral.  However, since I usually come to this sub for a woman's perspective, knowing the gender of a commenter might be useful.  

Other gender-related subreddits (e.g. AskWomen) have the option for a gender flair?  Would this be a good idea for 2XC?",142,20140508144040,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_251p4a,How to normalize women on reddit; or why this subreddit becoming a default is a good thing.,"Hey, ladies and many-more-gents-than-previously.

Maybe this is redundant to make this post, but the other major default discussion thread here contains mostly anxious comments. So I thought I'd put up an alternative point of view.

A lot of the complaints going around are that this subreddit was a safe haven prior to it becoming a more ""publicly accessible"" default. It was a place for women (and men) to speak candidly about certain aspects of their lives. Now, the fear is that this outlet and culture is either bastardized or gone. Potentially vulnerable or sensitive discourse will be open to a wider, more unfamiliar audience than intended.

Well, perhaps the change is a necessary sacrifice. 

reddit has been [called ""anti women"" before](http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2012/07/why-reddit-so-anti-women-epic-reddit-thread-counts-ways/55080/). I think there's some truth to that. With the addition of /r/twoxchromosomes to the defaults, obviously the admins wanted to change the general perception of the site. They want to say that reddit welcomes women. Prior to this, there were no predominately female driven defaults. /r/aww perhaps came the closest, and even that was around a 50/50 distribution, if that.

So. My opinion is that /r/twoxchromosomes *should* change its focus in order to make reddit more open and tolerant, and just plain *more interesting*. Here's why:

- It can now can act as a broad net, catching a large amount of users interested in or curious about women's issues, and then direct them to smaller subreddits if they eventually feel something is lacking here. 

- Female oriented topics will more frequently appear alongside ""general posts."" Eventually, I hope they're normalized here. More men can contribute to the conversation, or just learn to ignore it rather than having a negative reaction from seeing it. Maybe they'll have their views changed through simple exposure.

- When you're showing your friends reddit, you can point Two X as a default directed at women. That wasn't possible before. Then tell them to check out the list of related subreddits, because there *are* many more. 

Of course there are going to be people who fuck with the subreddit. But the mods can handle it. If trolls prove too overwhelming, Two X can always leave the default status.

Really, the point of this post is not what's lost, but what reddit is gaining. In order to change how reddit works, things have to change. I don't know if what I've said above will happen or not, but either way, maybe this will settle once and for all whether or not reddit (*as a whole*) can be open to both genders.

It's worth a shot.

t3_251iny,"Boyfriend broke my trust in him, how should we salvage our relationship? (we have too many mutual friends for me to speak openly about this)","The other day I decided to download Snapchat. I had it on an old phone, but the only people ever talked to was my best friend and my boyfriend (whom I'll refer to as ""A"") . I was getting reacquainted with it when I noticed Snapchat has a feature I didn't remember: it shows a user's 'score' and the top few people they talk to. And I didn't recognize any of the three people A was apparently interacting with often. I had a feeling one of them was his cousin (spoiler, it wasnt) so I decided to Google them. 

One had a twitter account under the same name. She lived far away, was a few years younger than us, and one of those cute little petite brunettes that always make me feel insecure. Worse than that, though, was the fact that she had uploaded a screenshot of MY BOYFRIENDS FACE from Snapchat to her Twitter and it had the hashtag of ""man crush monday"". 

My first reaction was, naturally, OH HELL NO. 

I want to murder her, but to be honest she probably has no idea he has a gf. So I closed out her Twitter and popped open a bottle of wine (Line 39 Petite Sirah, if you're curious). 

After I calmed down, I texted the boyfriend. He immediately acknowledged he was in the wrong, shouldn't have done it, he kept saying ""I don't know what I was thinking"", and that I deserve better, especially with what happened between my ex-fiancé and I (long story short, he was constantly emotionally abusive, tried to cheat on me (but was kind of a stereotypical neckbeard so he never got out of his self-imposed friendzones) and basically tried to change me from who I am to some meek little girl who did his bidding. I think the worst part about this was that A knew all this, and still chatted with other girls without telling me. 

He crossed a boundary, one that we've discussed I am not okay with him crossing. So it isn't like it would've been a surprise that I'd be upset if I found out about it. He probably thought he could essentially stay anonymous and anyone he was talking to out of his real life. 

Now, there are two reasons why I'm not going to break up with him. 1) he has always been a little naive when it comes to relationships. He only has had two girlfriends and lost his virginity at 20, when most people I know lost it under 18. His first gf was a normal relationship, they just realized it wasn't working out after a couple of years and parted ways fairly amicably. The second was a ridiculously hot girl who has guys throwing themselves at her left and right. She essentially used A for half a year to drive her around, pay for her pot, and then ignored him for an entire winter, before coming back into his life for another couple of months before A realized what was going on. He has been picky about dating ever since, and somehow we never crossed paths until a year and a half ago, despite having quite a few really good mutual friends. We clicked instantly, and it's safe to say that he is pretty much me with a penis. 

That's actually why I can understand WHY he'd want to talk to other girls. I'm not gonna lie, I like attention. I dress really well, and I'm the type to get free drinks from bartenders. I don't think I'm beautiful, but I think I have a friendly disposition and a nice smile that makes people like me. I even did that stupid /r/rateme once because I was curious what other people would say about me (mixed reviews, and a lot of creepy pm's. Learned my lesson -  I don't need THAT kind of validation). The difference is my boyfriend is fully aware of these things. They aren't surprises. When a bartender bet a free drink that I couldn't do a cartwheel, I told my boyfriend what I was doing. The same with the rateme subreddit. It isn't that I wanted permission and I don't necessarily want to give him permission, but I want his honesty. 

And I consider lies of omission as dishonesty. I probably would be a little uncomfortable if I knew he was talking to other girls, but I think him making it clear he has a gf would have been all I needed if he had told me he wanted to connect with other people across the United States. I honestly think it didn't occur to him what he was really doing, and that it mattered. Or fell under the boundaries I previously set. 

2) He absolutely started bawling when he thought I was going to break up with him. He isn't the type to show or speak about his feelings really. He likes to touch me a lot, just nonsexually, a caress here, a little squeeze there. He says stuff like ""I love you"" and has expressed that he sees a future with me, and would like to get married and have children with me, but nothing poetic, emotional, etc. We've actually been working on that aspect of our relationship, to decent results. But I digress; so he burst into tears. He didn't try to gaslight me or act like he didn't do anything wrong, like other people do. I must admit it was pretty satisfying watching a 6'2"" semi-athletic manly man type break down and throw himself and his future at my mercy. 

My parameters are that he can never, ever do this before. He knows I've stuck to my guns in past relationships regarding  that concept. I also told him he'd have to really work at his communication, and we'd have to repair our bond quite a bit because of how overwhelmingly disappointing this infidelity was. I also warned him that it would likely be a while before we had sex again, because frankly once I've developed an emotional bond to a sexual partner, I can't remove that emotion from sex. And of course I'm still in love with him, and hurting too, so having sex with him is going to cut me up, no matter how good it is. I also said I was going to look into ways to rebuild our relationship (I'm pretty big into psychology, though I know it isn't a perfect science) and that if I found something that I thought might help, I'd want to try it. No idea what I even really mean by that, to be honest. 

So yeah. That was a terrible day. My relationship, once so very great, hit one hell of  speed bump. It can't be swept under the rug, but I'm not going to let it be the elephant in the room nobody talks about. He is more than willing to take the time and effort to help me heal. He accepts that it'll take time to heal. 

Mostly I just had to get this off my chest, and I was wondering how other relationships survive inappropriate flirting, cheating, and/or infidelity. I don't accept the excuse ""boys will be boys"", and I don't accept stupid ""biotruths"" that men are going to always want other women. I'm not saying that can't look, I certainly do, but I believe in communication and honesty, and consider this a breach of those. Considering that this sub is now a default, I'm aware this will likely get down votes, but I'm hoping that the normal audience of TwoX will see this and comment as well. I really just want support and advice on how to get through this. I absolutely do not think this is something I should break up with him, unless he does it again.

t3_251wcp,Why do you think there are so few women on reddit?,"Clearly from the amount of down votes this subreddit has seen in the last few hours, there are a lot more men on reddit than women. Or people who disagree with these views of women anyway. Most comments in default subreddits also appear to be from men. Could it be that the default subreddits are catered more towards men's interests? Or because women are more hesitant to make themselves known or express their views? Or is it that women don't see such forums like reddit as attractive and would prefer to browse websites that cater towards their specific interests? 

I can see why the mods and admins would make this sub a default. Maybe they're trying to make the readership of reddit equal in terms of gender and increase visiter numbers. Maybe they just wanted to stir up some controversy. However, I do think they could have picked a better subreddit to represent women or even create a new one. I used to lurk on this subreddit to see what the women of reddit were up to, to read articles where women were having their rights abused (i.e. Feminist articles) and read a comment section that was interesting and, where there were disagreements, people were respectful of others opinions and not aggressive and rude in their rebuttals. Also the illogical 'lock to open many keys' and 'what about the men's experience in this situation' and 'victim blaming' arguments were absent. Also it was great to read about periods and feminine hygiene, knowing you wouldn't be ridiculed. 

Many women would post personal problems on here, some that were related to their gender, others not relating to their gender at all. Most responses tried to be helpful and were sensitive to the poster's feelings. I personally would not post such a problem on this subreddit anymore. The readership went from 8000 to 170,000. The chances of someone identifying me and insulting me have now increased enormously. Anonymity of opinion was one of great pulls of this subreddit.  

The new default status of this subreddit brings up some interesting issues about the gender divide of reddit, so maybe it is positive in that regard. Thoughts anyone? ",79,20140508113152,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_251xe9,Husband and I have been arguing a lot lately. I scheduled an appointment to see a counselor.

Right now we are both under a lot of stress due to him leaving a high paying job he hated to one that pays half of that.  We are kind of struggling financially but we are doing our best, along with the unplanned pregnancy things have been really stressful.  

I believe our arguments stem from lack of communication.  When I ask him to do something sometimes it will come off as me having an attitude and he no longer wants any part in our discussions and will shut down.  This morning things got out of hand and things were thrown.  Not at each other...it started with me throwing a little food I was cutting, walking away, to him just going completely biserk and throwing food too.  I had never seen him that angry before.  He was yelling that he was tired of my shit.  I didn't say anything back really because I was just shocked.  We spoke again and we both agreed that we are tired of the same argument happening over and over again.  He is tired of me saying sorry and never changing my attitude so me saying sorry again doesn't do anything for him.  I looked up counselors that covered our insurance and told him about it.  He told me he thinks it is overboard, that I just need to work on thinking before I get angry at him.  I told him that that has been the solution before and it has gotten us no where and our fights have worsened.  I do not want to see it get worse from this morning.  I love this man and when we are good we are wonderful.  When we argue it is arguing for 3 minutes tops and then we go hours not speaking and I am sick of it.  I do not know what to do and I do not have ANYONE to talk to.  I already made an appointment and told him but he doesn't seem too thrilled.  I told him that I think it's good I will be able to talk to someone that will help.  He gave me no response.  Am I overreacting going to try to speak to counselor?  I literally do not know what else to do.  I have tried bettering my communication but obviously I am unable to do it on my own.

I was out of town when it happened so I only saw the aftermath - I didn't actually witness the fire or anything. They have the guy on a home security camera setting another fire and at least one witness who saw him in the vicinity of my burning car. He also lives less than a block away from me (though I don't remember seeing him around, I don't have much interaction with the neighbors).

I've read through the subpoena a bunch of times and it seems pretty straightforward - show up, get called, answer questions. But I get super duper nervous talking in front of more than like 5 people, and when I get nervous I start to ramble, and apparently you're not supposed to do that in court. And I guess the defense is allowed to ask me questions as well, which isn't what I expected.

Obviously it's been a rough week for me, and this whole witness thing is adding an edge of anxiety that's really hard to handle. I'm hoping someone can share their experience to take some of the fear out of this.

t3_2529l1,Can you lovely ladies help me with a roommate situation?,"Hello twoX, I need some help with a situation I am probably over-thinking. 

So, I have been living with my best friend for the last 6 years. Although (naturally) she gets on my nerves at times, I love living with her. We have a sweet apartment that we share with our cats (she has one, I have one) and life is overall very good. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for almost six years as well. He is at the point now where he wants us to move in together. He's been very patient with me up to this point, but this is it for him. And I completely understand that. 

I am ready to move in with him. I want to. I know our relationship needs to take this next step. 

My roommate and I have discussed earlier in the year that obviously at some point I am going to move in with him. She was actually the one (I'm pretty sure it was her) who brought it up. Just as a ""oh, well I've been trying to mentally prepare myself as I figure you two will end up moving in together at some point.""  I told her she's not wrong, and that it's probably going to be sooner rather than later, but that I would still give her ample notice and whatnot. 

So, what I need help with is, how can I ""give her my notice"" in the nicest, kindest, friendliest way possible?  Like, if your best friend that you've known for 15 years was to tell you that she is no longer going to be your roommate, how would you want to be told? What scenario or setting is best? What exactly should I say? I know this isn't going to be totally out-of-the-blue for her, but it's still kind of news. 

I'm not sure why I'm so worried about this. She is a kind and rational person. And she has stated that she will likely stay in our apartment even after I move out, so I know she doesn't need to worry about finding another place to live. I just...I don't know why I'm so afraid of telling her. And I don't know how I can deliver the news in the best possible way. 

I realise that this seems like a way bigger deal in my head than to anyone reading this, but please help me.  How can I approach this topic with her in the best way? What do I say? Should I bring a bottle of her favourite wine or something when I do it? Do I try to make jokes to make it less awkward (for me)?  How would you want to be told?

I'm really worried about one of my friends. I've talked to one of our mutual friends about this, and he's equally as worried. She's dating this guy, and he just seems really *off* to us.

She's 15, really pretty, really impressionable, a bit.. I don't know, I wouldn't say naive, but she's had some shitty boyfriends in the past and has some trust issues, so she tends to look straight past the bad in people and just get attached to them, if that makes any sense.

He's always calling her princess, comparing her to goddesses, and just generally being a bit of a try hard. If I'm understanding it right, they also started dating while he was also dating somebody else, which is when all this princess stuff started.

The way he talks to her is like something out of one of Shakespeare's plays, she gets all giddy and googly eyed whenever he's like that, and it just seems really odd.

The first time we heard anything about him was when he was calling her a goddess, saying that she was more than that, it just screamed player to us. There's a huge timezone difference between them, she's in the US and he's in Norway (I think? Somewhere around there) so they really only talk through texts/Skype, she said that he's ""busy"" for weeks on end and is barely around, too.

Are we being too paranoid? Like I said, she's had some shitty boyfriends, and we really don't want her to get hurt again. I've mentioned it to her, and she went on about how he was perfect, how he was different from other guys, that sort of thing. ",1,20140508091416,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_251ovr,Some perspective on the new default status of twoX,"I've been on Reddit for over a year now and while I don't post much, I spend a lot of time on the website just learning new things related to my interests or seeing interesting things that people have experienced. As a woman, it is sometimes hard to love reddit because of the frequent misrepresentation of women and the misunderstandings that happen so often about women. 

I'm well aware that there are subreddits like /r/feminism but I was afraid of subscribing because I didn't know if the subreddit was full of women wanting to support feminism or if it was a bunch of man-haters looking to circlejerk in the opposite direction. I had no idea that twoX existed until it became a default and it looks like exactly what I need in terms of a female perspective subreddit. I also find that it is probably what the entire reddit community needs in terms of a default subreddit to represent what women have to say. 

While it's true that putting the community on public display means that you're going to have to deal with trolls and misconceptions on a regular basis it's also the case that people that are not women will now have the opportunity to hear what women have to say. It's also the case that women on reddit will discover that there are many other women out there that they can relate to and talk with. 

It's true that its hard to talk about being a woman with people that are not women. Every person has lived a very different life from everyone else and sometimes it's hard to feel as though there are people that are actually taking your perspective seriously. While these conversations are extremely hard to have and often frustrating they need to happen. People need to stop perpetuating false notions about women (or all genders for that matter). This subreddit can help to do just that. And when trolls come along, report them. It will be hard to not take what they say personally but don't take it personally. That's exactly what they want you to do. 

Anyway. tl;dr I think this should be a default because reddit needs more women voices. And it's going to be hard sometimes but we should put ourselves out there. ",0,20140508101709,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

We were discussing a few days ago what we think marriage should be.  He was baffled and disgusted by what I had to say.  He kept telling me it was so wrong and horrible.

Here's what I had to say:

""I don't believe in premarital sex (he knows this, we've agreed on it).  So sex would be primarily for procreation (that's how I've been raised, it's a cultural thing that I firmly believe in).  If my husband asked, I'd agree.  I want to be a good wife, part of that is meeting his sexual needs.  I'd lie down, spread my legs, and let him do what he will.  If I don't satisfy him, I'd offer an open relationship.  He should be able to fulfill his desires to any extent, as long as he doesn't hurt me or anyone else.  This is because I love him and want him to be happy.  Marriage is about give and take.  I'll give him my body, he'll give me happiness and companionship.  (I mean, men get married for free sex, right?  Let's not kid ourselves here).  I wouldn't care much for foreplay or any of that after marriage, it's not about me.  Men don't need that to enjoy themselves, why should I?  Other than sex, our relationship would be fun, loving, affectionate, intellectually stimulating, supportive, etc.""

He kept going on about how awful that worldview is and kept going on about love and intimacy and mutual pleasure.  I told him to cut the crap.  I know how much he wants sex, I know all of this is BS to cajole women.  He was very hurt.

Is what I believe so wrong and perverse?  Is it bad that I want my marriage to be this way?  I'd like the perspective of fellow women.  Thanks!

t3_251ff6,Can we please give the mods the benefit of the doubt?,"I know a lot of people are freaking out, but can we give the mods the benefit of the doubt?  I think they’ve earned it.  Their hard work and diligence was a large part of turning TwoX into what the regulars know and love.  It’s not like they all plan to go on vacation and throw the sub to the wolves.  They realize there will be extra work for them now that this is a default sub.  I’m sure if it proves too much, they will get TwoX removed from the default list.  

Sure, there will be some growing pains.  I’ve seen a lot of people worrying about RedPill users coming to troll, but it’s not like they didn’t already know about TwoX.  Ironically (or perhaps not since I don’t know what irony is anymore, damn you Alanis!), I only know of RedPill from hearing about it on TwoX.  Having multiple top posts in r/all asking how to remove TwoX from default is just going to encourage trolls.  Also, downvoting into oblivion will also encourage trolls.  There’s no perfect solution, I suggest keeping troll comments and posts to 0 votes and reporting to the mods.  They’ve always done a good job removing those.  When trolls aren’t fed, they move on.

And lastly, you don’t have to ask everyone about related subunits.  There’s been a list of them in the sidebar for as long as I remember.

t3_253r1w,"[UPDATE] For those of you that have had an abortion, which option did you choose (pill or procedure) and what was your experience like?","Obligatory apology for the length of the post.



So recently you may remember me asking you all for advice about which path to take with my abortion after finding out that I managed to fall pregnant to my boyfriend despite being on the pill.



A lot of you provided some excellent, sound advice and I would like to thank everyone of you that contributed to the making of my decision.



Now that it is all over and done with, I thought that I would share my own experience as a lot of people were asking for me to update them if I was feeling up to it.



I reside in Australia so this is most relevant to other Australian women but overall the experience should be relatively similar.


So, I had my mind changed from initially wanting to take the pill to having the procedure. I also took the relevant advice on board and had an IUD put in place at the same time which was very easy.



I had my initial visit with a nurse and doctor and during this visit they explained the procedure, the possible complications as well as got me to provide a urine sample to check for chlamydia and something else (came back negative) and a blood sample to see what my blood type was as they have to treat negative patients differently to positive. However, lucky me, ended up with the most common type O+.  I also had a quick ultrasound to confirm gestation, of which I was 8 weeks, was written a script to get my mirena, was given a small pill which I needed to take 3 hours prior to surgery in order to prepare my cervix and had my procedure booked for 0815 Thursday morning.



On my arrival Thursday morning they told me my test results, gave me another quick run down as to how everything was going to go, put a wrist band on me and then ushered me into a large bathroom stall so that I could get changed into a theater gown.  We're coming into some cooler weather here in the more southern parts of Australia where I am and it was lovely that they had left a gown draped over a heater for me to put on. Once I was changed I rang a bell to let the nurse know I was ready.  They gave me a stretcher to lie on which was also lovely and warm before inserting a IV drip and giving me a couple of pain medications. Once all the doctors were ready, I was wheeled into the theater room and had to scoot over onto a different bed where I put my legs in stirrups much like those that they get women in labor to put their legs in.  I said ""cya"" and ""thank you"" to everyone in the room and that was the last thing I remember.  The anesthetist was amazing and had me out in less than 2 seconds after that.



The next thing I remember, I was being stirred by nurses in recovery and they said that it was time I got up and went to the lounge area to recover a bit more.  They mad me a cup of tea and gave me a couple of biscuits which I consumed quickly while my boyfriend had his coffee and kept making fun of my state of drowsiness.



My perception of time here was very skewed now so anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes later one of the nurses gave me my clothes back so that I could get changed and I had a final consultation with a doctor before leaving the clinic.



All in all I had a fabulous experience.  If I had to go through with it again I definitely know what I would do.  I know it's not an easy choice to make at all, and while I knew what I had to do, it wasn't emotion-free and I felt a little conflicted at times and cried a little bit the night before.



I do not regret my decision and I am so glad that I had my boyfriend and his wonderful family who supported me 100% throughout the whole ordeal.  The nurse and doctor staff were beyond amazing and incredibly professional throughout the whole process.



Women need to feel far less ashamed of what they decide to do with their own bodies and I would like to thank everyone again for their advice because I couldn't be happier right now and it's great to be feeling somewhat normal again.  



I've barely bled (yet) but post-operative bleeding is just part of the whole process and I've had the odd short-lived but pretty bad cramp (nothing much worse than an average period cramp) but my experience was still much better than I could've ever expected and I wouldn't have changed my decision if I had to do it again.




**TL;DR** Had a fantastic experience with my termination, as far as you can, when having a termination and am very happy with my decision.



Edit: for anyone interested in the cost, for me, in Australia, the procedure was completely free. If I were to have opted for the medication it would've been $50, otherwise about $15 with concession.

Every single time I step outside, I get either yelled at/catcalled or grabbed/groped or followed by cars with men hanging out of the window, etc. Or any combination thereof. 

Men will say terrible things. Disgusting things. Viscous things. Things I don't want to repeat.

I'm not exaggerating about this. No one seems to take this seriously if I mention it. I don't mention it much because the reactions from friends or family or SOs aren't nice. Sometimes they don't believe me. Sometimes they think I'm overplaying it for attention. Or that I'm like bragging in some weird way about the attention I get. They imply I secretly enjoy it. Or say I should find it flattering. Sometimes my SO says I'm exaggerating to make him jealous.

I don't live in a ""bad neighborhood"" where people expect this stuff to be happening. This happens everywhere. All types of people do it.

I'm sobbing as I write this. I just want someone to realize how fucked up it all is. I want someone to be on my side.

I've developed an aversion to touch. An aversion to people.

I have tried everything to get this stuff to stop. I dress very conservatively. I don't do anything but minimum makeup. I keep to myself. I don't make eye contact with people. All the stuff I can change. It's not like I'm incredibly attractive anyway.

I can't change my gender. Sometimes I catch myself hoping I could and I hate myself for it. 

The only solution I have of not getting harassed is to not go outside. 

It's affecting my entire life. It's ruining my life.

What's my fault for going outside? Why does this happen? Why am I faced with such malice just for existing in public?

Every time I think about going outside now, after years of this, I find myself with a huge amount of anxiety. It takes me hours just to get outside and then I'm nearly exploding as I'm making a beeline for wherever I have to get to.

I wear big headphones. I wear a hoodie. I wear sunglasses. I intentionally wear sunglasses that have mirrored lenses because I'm secretly hoping that when someone bothers me, they'll see their reflection in my sunglasses and be embarrassed about themselves.

I've talked to therapists about this and the responses I have gotten are not okay. One told me to ""just act crazy in public so then they'll leave you alone."" Another said ""look and dress uglier."" And another said ""don't put yourself in that situation."" These are their solutions to this issue. Two of these therapists were women themselves and the last one was a man.

Why do I have to change who I am in order to exist without getting harassed? I'm not even doing anything wrong. I try to live a good life.

If, on the flipside, someone complained of not getting enough attention from men, no one would ever say: ""act more normal, it's simple, change who you are"", ""look prettier and dress better, instead of what you want to look like"", ""put yourself in those situations, it's easy, just do it"".

I'm sorry for this incredibly long sob story. I just need any support. I don't know what to do. I'm not really looking for solutions or answers, I just needed to say this somewhere I wouldn't get judged. I hope you understand where I'm coming from.

t3_252vmy,Women and choosing careers over relationships.,"Hello ladies,

I have been suffering through a breakup with a man I loved (still do love) more than I have ever loved anyone. We were in a long distance relationship for about a year and a half, he chose to end it as there appeared to be no way to close the distance anytime soon unless one of us gave up on our career goals. 

He is the most driven and ambitious person I have ever met (one of the many reasons he's amazing!) and he wasn't going to give up on his aspirations. I am currently pursuing a PhD in a field I love, but I have never felt as strongly about my professional goals as he does his. And in the back of my mind is the desire for marriage and family one day, which are things I deeply want and cherish.

So I am left wondering if I made a mistake in choosing to stay on a path that I have questioned in the past over following my heart and a relationship that brought me tremendous happiness and a man I love and could see myself being with long term.

t3_252scl,"Request: Suggestions for educational links regarding women's rights, gender equality, etc.? [Serious]","Hey all,

So this is a comment I've seen a lot of today:

""Women's rights? Why can't they just be called gender equality rights? Things aren't always fair for men either!""

Instead of getting frustrated at these kinds of comments (which is my personal reaction, although I realize that not all TwoX users would react this way), or spending tons of time replying to them in an attempt to educate users on several decades (centuries? millennia?) of history, I was thinking we could provide some key links to educational websites/articles on the basics of women's rights and related topics so that users can educate themselves on their own. I think it would be useful to have good resources easily accessible for newcomers to this sub--they don't necessarily have to read them, but we can at least recommend them for the curious. 

I tried to Google for sites I knew I'd seen before, but nothing came up that seemed useful and I can't think of any off the top of my head. Any suggestions, folks? 

Apologies in advance if I've offended anyone--my intention isn't to call people out, but to provide streamlined access to basic information so this sub isn't flooded with the same comments/posts from newcomers. 

Also, I realize that any resources on this topic would ultimately be opinion-based, and that the range of answers/acceptable resources would vary even for regular users of the subreddit, but I still think that some basic links for people whose only question is, ""Why feminism tho?"" would be useful. 

Edit: [This article](http://bitchmagazine.org/article/everything-about-feminism-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask) about the basics of feminism is an example of what I mean. I understand that not every TwoXer wants to mix TwoX and feminism, but I feel like we're inevitably going to be fielding questions of that genre at a much higher volume now that we're default, and having resources like this one would simplify things for people who haven't learned much about it in the past.

On one hand, getting your colours done, advice from a personal stylist on hair and glasses and clothes,  and a makeover including free makeup is awesome and a nice mood lightener. 

On the other hand, it a bit bugs me that this is included in the training of the dept that's full of women.  I don't see the male managers and directors getting ""perks""  like a tailor fitting or a stylist session.

t3_252q6d,What do you want to see from 2X regarding the switch to default status? I'll go first ...,"Some of us are angry about the switch to default status. I personally am unhappy because I think it's a bad idea, but angry because of how the mods handled the change.

Given that the mods had no time or leeway to consult the community, I understand why the change was made so abruptly. I still think it was handled very poorly and without attempts to broadly engage the community here (e.g. A statement of why the change, why no warning, if there's a trial period, and how the mods envision 2X functioning in the future). So here's what I would like to see:

- A public announcement of what the decision making process was for this change, and what the decision making process will be in evaluating whether to stay a default

- A decision making process regarding default status that involves the community not just the mod team (i.e. a poll, a stickier post where people can give feedback, etc)

- A timeline for assessing whether or not this is working for the sub - I'd like to see a revaluation in a week and then monthly or bimonthly after that, if 2X remains a default

Basically, I'd like to see things change so that I could trust that the mod team is actually listening and engaging the community here, not solely defending a decisions made without community input.

But that's one opinion. So, 2X community, what would **you** like to see?",39,20140508162616,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_253jfr,A lead on my team (not my manager) is trying to get me fired by any means necessary,"
Hi guys. I think I need some help here, and you've always been incredibly level-headed and helpful when people come in, so I'm sending out my own S.O.S.

Like the title says, a lead on my team (that is not my manager, but is above me) has decided that he does not like me and is in the process of trying to get me booted. I work in the recruiting department of a large corporate office as an RC (I pretty much just set up interviews all day), and he has recently changed my entire process to something not conducive to being able to consistently keep up with my work because he doesn't think the corporate SLA (service level agreement, aka when I get things done by) is quick enough. These SLAs are followed by everyone within the company who does my job, and he's decided I need to change process to suit him and the team. By not doing it exactly how he likes, he has decided that I am wasting time with candidates and I am the reason (out of everyone on the entire team) that we are losing them (which, let me add, we haven't actively lost candidates unless they don't want to move or they just aren't interested), even though I AM WITHIN SLA AND DOING MY JOB. Everything that is wrong comes back to me being the culprit, and he's taken this ""data"" to my recruiting manager as evidence that I don't know how to do my job. Let me add that I've been with said company for almost a year and the other lead on my team fucking LOVES me (feeling is mutual, he's great). 

The lead that I'm having issues with is relatively new to the team and has decided I am dead weight, and told one of my coworkers that ""my time here is up."" He's done this to others in the past, so his capacity to bite down and not let go until he gets what he wants is not something I want to just ignore.

I spoke with my recruiting manager today and didn't go in with a list of things, I literally just verbally vommitted on him and started crying (I know, I know, dumb dumb dumb), I was just so flustered. Before going to him, I spoke to 2 other, very respected former RCs who both agree with where I'm coming from, and agree that he's being ridiculous. I had great info from them to present to my manager, and then I just lost it out of being so upset. The lead, unfortunately, spoke to my manager before I could and so my manager was slightly biased while talking to me (he was trying not to be, but you could tell he thought I was exaggerating/being paranoid). We have another meeting tomorrow to go over the ""data"" this lead has come up with, and whatever else comes up. Literally anything he can scrape from the barrel he is bringing into this meeting. Even the fact that I won't make international calls when I'm WFH.

I'm at a loss, guys, I don't know what to do. I'm not the only one he bullies, he does it to everyone on the team, but I'm the one he's actively trying to get rid of and I'm dreading going to work and I'm just so...Sad. I'm not even at the point of anger anymore, I'm just sad.

TL;DR: One of my leads hates me, is actively trying to get me fired.",6,20140508215423,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Concerned boyfriend here. My girlfriend keeps hearing from her friends about diet pills, and she wants to try. I am a really skeptical person and have to have all the information before I make any health decisions. I want to support her to lose weight, but I want to steer her to lose it in natural ways (proper diet, exercise) as much as possible.

She wants me to support her to take the diet pills, but from the information I've gleaned from the internet - they have a lot of nasty side effects, and make you lose good fats and water content in your body as much as bad fats.

So I want to know your experience of any good information you guys might have on it. So I can make a somewhat informed decision whether to support her or steer her clear and put a lot more energy into getting her on the right track lifestyle way.

Now I should note she also plans to change her diet and get exercise, but wants to use diet pills as kind of a boost for weight loss. She doesn't want to lose so much just 5-8kg.

You ladies provide me with so much good information that I wouldn't be able to find anywhere else- information that helps me be more comfortable in my own skin, information that helps me stay healthy and safe, information that eases my mind of almost all the fears that stem from being a teenage girl.

I've even been able to post here when I had questions about birth control and insurance (something that honestly caused me to have a breakdown because I didn't know what to do). You ladies actually helped me through a difficult turning point in my life! I don't know what I would have done without you all.

Now I know that a lot of you are upset with the influx of people. No, we are not an obscure little club anymore. No, we cannot freely post here without any worry of being challenged anymore. Yes, there will be more asshats in here. But you know, that's just part if bring integrated into a new community. More people means more chaos, always. That just means we'll have to work twice as hard to make it the place it needs to be. Downvote, report, redirect, inform.

Just because we have to put in effort does not mean we should just throw our hands up in frustration.

I say this because there will be more girls like me, either misinformed or lost. Those girls need you ladies, and now that we're a default we can help more of them and help them become more informant and confident in their knowledge.

Honestly, I find it a bit upsetting that some of you are angry that you can't just reap the benefits anymore and will have to work to keep the community supportive. It's like high school cliques all over again.

Mine is far from traumatic, since I have an amazing family, but it still isn't an experience I ever hope to repeat. tl;dr no regrets and my best friend is amazing

 I found out I was pregnant shortly before my 18th birthday and the father was a fellow High School student.  I immediately decided it needed to be terminated and I had to face my mother.  Telling her was scary, but once it was out and I had her support I felt much better.  She helped me deal with the guy's family although in the end I just cut contact and got through it with financial support from my grandmother.

I got in for my first appointment shortly before I was supposed to go to Louisiana for two weeks, so we scheduled the actual abortion shortly after I would be back, accidentally putting it on the same day as my prom.  I went and learned piercing, avoiding what would have been two hellishly long drama filled weeks of school.

The procedure was short and relatively painless.  One of the nurses held my hand and I had an old stuffed animal in my bag that I pulled out and held on to.  I don't regret bringing her either, wolfy was a very supportive companion since I asked my grandma to stay in the waiting room.

Afterwards was when things got bad.  The cramping was kinda awful, like my normal periods, and I had to keep heat on my lower back.  I spent nearly the whole night watching movies and texting.  This was when I started to get ""drama.""  My boyfriend at the time decided to dump me via text about an hour after the operation for completely unrelated reasons despite having been supportive of me and knowing exactly what I was doing that day.

  I had kind of shut down and was flunking out before the whole situation though, so it actually had a positive effect in school.  I had made so many people hate me by referring to the fetus as a ""parasite"" (partially a coping mechanism) and being entirely unconflicted about terminating the pregnancy that I was only talking to my best friend (who is very religious, but was so supportive of me, I love that girl so much) and a couple supportive teachers and counselors so I was able to buckle down and finish the year strong with more credits than I needed.

Edit: Just felt a need to add that for me an abortion was really the only sensible option, it was entirely my decision, and looking back I would not be alive if I had been unable to terminate the pregnancy.  I am adamantly childfree so if I was unable to abort (and failing that force a miscarriage) I would have called the police then taken a knife to my own uterus.

To start off I am 20 y/o and I am sexually active with my boyfriend of two years. The last time we had sex was about two weeks ago. This week I had some pain while urinating and suspected a UTI. I took some phenozopyridine because I've been a bit too busy and knew I would be able to get to the doctor Friday if symptoms persisted. Then I started getting yeast infection symptoms (itchiness, swelling, redness and dryness, which I experienced with my first yeast infection.)

Yesterday, I took an extra prescribed diflucan pill from my last yeast infection. And today things went really, really south. As if it wasn't bad enough with all the other symptoms, I started my period. I am using a tampon because the thought of a pad was even more painful with being so dry. I'm not sure if the tampon might make things worse either.

Then, tonight, I go to the bathroom to change and clean up and realized something horrifying. Skin is peeling from from my labia minora, my clit and my hood. I am in so much pain and itchy and swollen and I'm so desperate for relief. I tried miconazole cream but only had relief for about 10 minutes. 

I am tearing up right now because I'm just so uncomfortable and I don't know what to do to help myself until tomorrow. Can I use an icepack or would that make things worse? Is there some mystery home remedy I haven't heard of that I might be able to do?

**TL;DR: possible infection, don't know what it is, skin is peeling off my clit and labia and I don't know how to relieve the pain and itching until I can see the doctor tomorrow. Please help if you know anything that might help!!! :(**

t3_253vki,Sexual Harassment Needs to Stop...,"Hopefully this is the only feminist piece I will ever write in my life. My main interests are bio, hiking, and fun so feminism is generally pretty far away from where my mind lies. I had never experienced any form of sexual harassment until 8 months ago, but suddenly it seems to be everywhere. What changed? Sure, I’ve been traveling a lot, but I’ve been traveling before. Is it just that I’m older so creepers think it’s now socially acceptable to hit on me?

Here are some beautiful, well-thought-out letters to the men who have been creepers towards me:

Dear the mf**king bastard who physically harassed me on the trolley in Istanbul,
I didn’t move away from you when you were standing so close to me because all my energy was focused on how I would punch you if you touched me again. I wasn’t completely sure that you had pinched me and, having never had anything like that happen before, I didn’t want to move because “nothing has actually happened, right?” But when the train cleared out and you didn’t move away, that’s when you showed your true colors. Too bad I didn’t realize that your presence was the sexual harassment. You suck.
	
Dear dude at the airport that followed me to my terminal, 
I was really upset that I had to pay the baggage fee because my bag was overweight. My problem is that my mother won’t let me out of the house unless I have everything I could ever possibly need ever. So remarking about how you understand my situation because “women need more stuff” just makes you an idiot. Telling me how you noticed me because I was “so pretty, so beautiful” also just makes you an idiot. You suck.

Dear creepy guard dude who I need to talk to to get inside this building,
You should have noticed a couple months ago my complete lack of response to you calling me “precious” and “beautiful”. I am not an all-powerful ring of doom and I am smart enough not to take those words as compliments. The Nazi tattoo on your hand also makes you a shitfaced insensitive person. I am only nice and polite and talk to you because I need to get to the room I’m staying in and I am afraid of what might happen if you realized how much I hate your guts. You suck.

Dear the men that try to provoke me when I am running, walking, or existing in the park,
Really? Really? What do you think you are going to get out of going “tssst tssst” at me? Or saying “Hola/Hello” for that matter? Given the noise you make, I have decided that you are all a bunch of cockroaches that aren’t worth my effort to try to step on. You suck.

Dear the egotistical bastard who tried to put his finger up my asshole and brush his hand against my v-jj when I was wearing makeup to go to an interview,
You should have no self-respect at all. Wearing make-up does not make me a slut, a piece of ass, or anything for your amusement. I’m happy I didn’t let you ruin my day. You suck.

On a more serious note, I would like to comment on how these varying degrees of harassment have changed my perception of others. I am less likely to trust men in general and am sadly reduced to evaluating men walking past me on the street to see if they present a threat. The last thing I want to do is to reduce someone to their gender, but it is a method of self-protection. I feel weaker because of these judgements and lie to myself by saying that a truly strong person would not judge a person based off of experiences with other people. But then I remember that a wise person would use his or her past experiences in order to evaluate the present ones. So if you are a man walking past me on the street and I choose to move to the other side of the street because I judge you a threat, please forgive me. I just don’t want to have my day ruined again.

Cheers!

I'm not particularly sexually active, and on the safe side did take a pregnancy test which was negative about a month prior as obviously no matter how many precautions you take, you can never be too certain.

    The reason I'm posting is that my period has so far lasted EIGHT days, and it's making it's way well into a Ninth day.  I've had periods that have lasted a full seven days before, but usually I'm somewhere between five and six days. This is insane, it isn't' just a slow trickle either, it's a steady medium flow and slight cramping at times... Is this normal? Just build up from not having one for so long? or can this mean something else? 

   I have talked to a doctor before I started about my lack, and he did say that it was fine for me to not menstruate as long as it didn't reach the sixth month mark or so, should I talk to him about it again? I would just like some peace of mind or advice. I am not on any sort of birth control or medication of any kind.  Sorry if this isn't the right place for this, but I didn't know where else to post.

t3_254ab5,Apprehensive about starting the pill and also feel really pressured.,"Throwaway because my SO knows my reddit account.  

I have been with my SO for many years (both 23). I have grown up with the idea of sex being ""bad"" and not what a ""good girl"" does (my family is *very* prudish). It took me a long time to move past this and I finally started feeling comfortable having sex (some of the ""guilt"" still remains - gosh, I even feel kind of guilty admitting that I have sex in writing here).  

We only use condoms, but we want to be safer and he especially does. He's been asking me to go onto the pill for about a year now but I just don't know how I feel about it.  
  

 Here are my reasons why:    

1. I don't want to pump my body full of hormones. I don't want to have to take a pill every single day at the same time and I don't want to accidentally have my parents come across my pill packet where all hell will break loose (I stay at my parents home on the weekends and holidays, I am not moving out until I graduate I don't live with SO yet).      

2. I feel like shit during my pre-menstrual time. I have bad bouts of PMS, I get angry for no reason, I hate everyone, I cry, I feel fat, I get spotty. PMS comes about due to the high levels of hormones, surely going on the pill will result in me PMS-ing *constantly*. Is this true?  
  
3. Side effects!!! I know ""most women"" don't have side effects but who's to say I won't be one of the women who do? My main concerns are: weight gain, the PMS thing I mentioned in point 2, decreased libido, having a ""cloudy mind"" i.e. not being as sharp as usual (I actually read this on reddit, another user's experience of going off the pill and immediately seeing benefits mentally).    

4. I am confident with NFP. I know when I ovulate, I know when the safe period is.  
  

I feel very pressured that I must start the pill and my SO has withdrawn all sexual activity until I start it. TwoX, please make me feel better about starting the pill?",31,20140509054045,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_253zds,"Had a strange encounter with a (possibly homeless) woman seeking birth control outside a CVS, not sure what would have been the proper response or what to say if I see her again.","I live next door to CVS and run there at strange hours of the night for things. They also have a security guard there many nights since it's on a rowdy college campus, and I have a fairly friendly relationship with him. 


So the other night I stopped by and this woman came up to me in the parking lot, saying she had a weird question and to stop me if it was too personal. She wanted to know what the name of that ""thing that goes up inside women to stop them from getting pregnant"" was. I said, intrauterine device? and she said yeah, where do you get one? I told her I wasn't sure, but my friend had one and I'm pretty sure you needed a prescription. At that she looked really sad, and the security guard came up and stared at her and she walked away. 


Later the guard and I are talking and he says I should stay away from 'people like her,' because it looked like she hadn't showered in weeks and was trying to get her hands on an 'item' they carried, and was probably a thief. I was really uncomfortable with how he was talking about her, because she hadn't seemed dangerous at all, just sad and worried. I wish I'd pointed her in the direction of some resources for getting free or cheap birth control, but I'm not sure how to have that conversation, especially with a security guard hovering menacingly. I'm really worried that she was homeless and having to turn to sex work to survive, and won't have access to make that work safer. 


I feel bad that I couldn't help her out, and bad that I didn't challenge the guard for saying some problematic things, but that's in the past. Anyone have any similar encounters to this, and have any advice for possible future ones? I need to get more in touch with what sort of local resources are available for sure.

t3_2542eq,"Just need to vent, I guess. (long)","I don't know if this fully fits here, but I'm not really sure where else to go.


So, in February I started university and moved into on-campus accommodation. I've made a decent little group of friends since and overall, I've been loving it, but there has been some stressful shit happen that I don't feel comfortable sharing with people I know in real life. 

The first, and worst, thing to happen was one of my new friends was sexually assaulted, I'll refer to her as 'Jane'. It was the night of her birthday, we went down to the rec room and she had a shit ton to drink. I enlisted the help of one of the guys to help me get her back to her room, we got her back, got her settled and I nudged him out of the room in front of me. We went down the stairwell right next to her room, I went onto my floor and he continued down to his - or so I thought. The next day, 'Jane' text me and told me that he'd doubled back after I'd left and she - recognising the voice and having a certain amount of trust in the guy - let him in. I'm not 100% sure of the details, all I know is there was no penetration and she was fading in and out for most of it. This guy hadn't been part of the group for long. Our first impressions of him had been that he was kinda creepy - real smooth talker, charming and a heap of inappropriate jokes.
The next week or so, 'Jane became more and more anxious and felt unsafe - to the point where she was feeling suicidal. Later, she admitted that at one point, I had gone to her room and knocked when she was at a really low point and was about to seriously hurt herself. She decided to go talk to the on-campus counselors and asked me to go with her. Afterward, we approached the security guard we know best and let him know what happened; a report was filed and all of the on-campus security guys, as well as the accommodation staff, know him and are keeping an eye on him. The guard asked her if she wanted to go to the police, and after some consideration, she decided to file a report. However, she didn't want to press charges, she just wanted people to be aware of him, to prevent it from happening to anyone else.
Everything that happened freaked me out pretty badly. I feel really guilty and like I let her down - if I had've taken her back by myself, if I had've stayed with her a little longer, if I'd made sure he didn't go back, if I'd listened to my instincts, maybe it wouldn't have happened.


A few weeks later, we made friends with a few other people. One of them is a guy, 'Luke', who has since become quite close to 'Jane' and I. When 'Jane' admitted that I had prevented her from self-harming at one point, he brought up his history of self harm. That discussion, weirdly enough, left me feeling kinda panicky, and ever since if I get a message or see a blog post from either of them that seems 'off', I worry about them until I see them again and can reassure myself that they're alright.

'Luke' also uses me as a sounding board for venting about his family - they really don't get along and fight a lot - as well as issues he's had with other friends.


It may seem inconsequential, but throughout high school (and currently), my best friend struggled with a multitude of mental illnesses - a severe anxiety disorder, depression, and she nearly died from anorexia. Throughout this, I was one of her main sources of support, outside of her psychologist/doctors and family. 
When I moved for university, I selfishly hoped to get a chance to... focus on my self, I guess? The last five years have been revolved around constant worry about my best friend - I spent most of my time making sure she was okay and defending her from the assholes who seemed to get some sort of sick enjoyment out of triggering her into E.D behaviours or panic attacks. Whenever I attempted to talk to her about any problems I was having - even if it was something petty and I just wanted to vent - she'd spin the conversation into a 'well, at least you don't have to deal with x, y, z...'

I just feel so selfish, and like I'm letting my friends down for not wanting to be their support system all the time. I also feel like though I care about them, they don't give a damn about me. This last week, there was a death in my family and naturally I've been upset. The most I've gotten has been a 'my condolences' and the offer of a smoke.

t3_254wh6,"By being a default sub, TwoXChromosomes is inherently a less safe space for trans women. The two - being a default sub, and being safe space for trans women - are mutually exclusive.","As a trans woman, I've always felt comfortable in TwoXChromosomes. I'm primarily a lurker, but I occasionally chime in. All in all, this is a community that has been actively supportive of trans folks.

(I want to take a moment to distinguish ""tolerance"" from ""support."" Tolerance is passive: I won't kick you out. I won't beat you up. I won't fire you. All in all, I won't be an asshole. Support requires action: I *will* use the correct name and pronoun. I *will* defend you. I *will* support you.)

I don't expect that support to change now that TwoXChromosomes is a default sub. But the balance of power has shifted. Take [this photo post from today](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2540mz/iff_first_bikini_ive_never_been_comfortable/). A week ago, I would have been surprised to see *any* comments questioning the poster's gender. Maybe a random troll had found the post, but they'd be in a tiny minority.  Today, there have been at least a dozen posts of that nature. To be clear, the response was overwhelmingly ""OP *is* a woman. Get over it."" And, shortly thereafter, the mods deleted the offensive comments.

But I'm not convinced that's good enough. By labeling itself as an inclusive, welcoming, supportive community, TXC is implicitly making claims about the tone of the discussion that will happen here. Those claims seem at odds with the amount of traffic any default sub will inevitably receive. 

[And the shifting balance of power is not just impacting trans women,](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2542pr/guess_i_wont_be_posting_on_here_for_a_while/) even if I suspect we're going to be the most viscously targeted.

I've read a number of posts from mods and community members about the positive value of increased visibility. They all make good points, and I can't really argue with wanting the safe space of TXC to be as large and inclusive as possible. I would never want to - for example - exclude people who identified as male, or disallow *any* sort of questioning or ignorance. But this sub - by its very nature - encourages posts that will be foreign to the majority of redditors, many of whom will be hostile to *any* women, let alone trans women. 

Placing this sub as default invites them in.

**EDIT AND CLARIFICATION**: I'm also an artist and educator by trade. My job is to travel across the country and talk about trans identity, and to help make sense of something that most people have never considered: Our identity and our body may not match, and that's OK. I have no problem with honest ignorance; in fact, it's how I make a living. Likewise, I don't find questions about trans identity - about how someone can have a penis *and* be a woman - inherently offensive. We're not born knowing this stuff, and even the best sex ed or biology is incredibly unlikely to discuss it. 

I choose to be an educator. I put on my educator hat, and walk into classrooms and theatres, prepared to share a part of myself with an audience. I want to be crystal clear that my problem is not with ignorance, or with people asking well-intentioned questions. Both have a time and a place, and the only way to learn how to be supportive of trans folks (or *any* minority) is a willingness to say, ""I don't know."" But that's not, so far as I can tell, the purpose of this sub. And it's certainly not the purpose of an IFF post, or of an entirely unrelated discussion about identity, personal experience, graduation, dating, body issues, or any of the myriad of other topics this sub has so beautifully encompassed.

t3_254mpj,The most humiliating period,"So this happened to me last week, and I'm so embarrassed I can't even think about it without bursting into tears: 

So I was admitted to the hospital for a thorascopic wedge resection of a lung last week. Basically, that means that they deflate one lung, put a camera and some cutting tools between my ribs, and cut out some cancer-y bits. This was my ninth cancer-related surgery in the last three years and my second thorascopic resection. 

The morning after surgery, I was off the ventilator, but still hooked up to an IV in each arm, an insanely gross drainage tube coming out of my chest and attached to this weird clear briefcase thing (hilariously labled ""OAISIS"" -- if your oaisis is full of my bloody lung soup, you have clearly annoyed the God of the Old Testament), and, of course, a Foley (pee) catheter. I didn't feel too bad; the intrathecal morphine hadn't worn off yet, so everything below my collar bone was a little hazy. 

But then I noticed that my parts felt a little...soupy. More than sweat could explain. I hit the call button and sheepishly explained to the nurse ""I think I might have gotten my period?"" 

""Let's see."" 

There was blood everywhere. Blood had soaked through my hospital gown and my sheets. Blood down my thighs to my knees. Blood covering the Foley catheter. A bloody thumb-print on the call light. 

""Okay, so what do you want to do?"" the nurse asked. 

I had no idea how to answer. I want this blood off of me. I want to go home. I want to never have another period. I want to spontaneously combust and burn to ashes out of embarrassment. I want you to be stricken blind for having witnessed my humiliation. 

The Foley catheter made it so I couldn't even go to the bathroom and clean up -- I had to lie there, bleeding and trying not to cry, until the surgeon returned a page with an order to remove it. It took an hour. During this time, my Dad came by with a cup of coffee, turned pale, and said he would wait in the cafeteria until things were settled.  

Finally the nurse came back with the order and a tech -- a male tech. They didn't even close the door before flipping up my gown to remove the catheter. I wasn't allowed my own underwear but instead was given these weird mesh underpants, kind of a softer version of the crotch of a pair of fishnets. There was so little actual material there that the adhesive of my pad couldn't stick to it, so I had to get up every 45 minutes or so to make sure that I wasn't leaking -- usually, I was. The nurse and tech changed the sheets, the mattress cover, and my gown with a kind of grim-faced efficiency that made me feel like a 150-lb sack of extra gross meat instead of a person. 

This is not exactly my first medical-related humiliation (so many chemotherapy shitting-my-pants stories!), but this one, for some reason, is an absolutely gutting humiliation. 

TL;DR: Made an accidental blood donation while tethered to a piss catheter.

However, I'm seeing a LOT about how making this a default has 'ruined' the community and safety of the place. Because this is the internet. and people are asshats on the internet. 

So here I am, as a fairly average normal guy who is pretty upset about how this seemingly awesome place is being ruined by douche-bags, and I'd like to know: What can I (and people like me) do to help? I mean, I am refraining from being a misogynist jerkoff when I'm here, but since i do that everyday anyhow, that's not that hard, and it probably isn't helping a whole lot. 

Can I do anything here? Or should I just resign myself to sitting back and praying that God smite internet douchebags (probably killing off most of the civilized population as result)?

I'm basically just saying here- making this place default brought a whole lot of new people in, and a lot of them are horrible people making it worse.

Obviously, I want those Nigerian girls to be saved. But the people who took them are men and they are real. Just like the ""real women have curves"" campaign de-legitimizes girls who *aren't* curvy, it's a way to vilify these select assholes by dehumanizing (or actually, emasculating) them. The thing is, they are not exceptions. Human trafficking is so much more prevalent, and a lot of *real men* are doing it right now, outside of this specific issue.

It's great that the word is getting out, and, three weeks later, the US finally sent people over to help. But this isn't a singular issue, and this isn't an issue we can overcome if we treat it like an exception. *Real men* do buy girls, and it's a symptom of a much deeper problem. 

I don't think a solution will be found by dehumanizing these awful people because, well, they *are* human. It feels like they're writing off human capability to be that inhumane to others (which happens constantly in different forms all over the world). **We need to do a better job of teaching all men in all societies to humanize women, otherwise the problem will persist without abatement**.

""I brought in 20% more revenue in Q2.""

""I saved the company $2K in overhead.""

A woman will typically use ""we"" statements, or any way to remove herself from the statement specifically.

""My team brought in 20$ more revenue in Q2.""

""Our new procedure reduced overhead by $2k.""

And let's say the boss is not even subconsciously a little sexist. He hears these statements and thinks ""Why should I give HER a raise if it takes a team to do it?""

Then I read this [article](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-confidence-gap/359815/)

I'm tired of the ONLY 2X posts I see focusing on the most irritating and to my mind least interesting/enlightening/thought provoking aspects of womanhood. 

Let me be clear. I absolutely think women should be able to post those topics and frankly find the TMI designation unnecessary in a community devoted to females and female topics. But it all feels really contrived right now. And it shows only an extremely limited side of our community. And it doesn't make me feel supported, intellectually stimulated, or empowered. It just makes me feel annoyed. I joined this community because I wanted to connect with other women, not because I need to talk about my period clots more. I am a much more interesting, rich, complex being than my menstruation details.

t3_254qvy,Uncomfortable work situation,"I have been in my current position for going on 5 years. I truly love my job. Without getting into too much detail, it is in the social work field (which is why this is really embarrassing for me to allow to happen).

 

I have a supervisor who has been acting inappropriately towards me and two other colleagues. I shamefully allowed the behaviour to continue for the past five years .... well honestly I am not sure why. I guess I didn’t want to “make a big deal” and I was kind of afraid no one would believe me. When my colleagues share similar experiences/feelings I guess I felt more empowered to deal with it.

 

Examples of some of the stuff that he has done are him placing his hand on the curve of my lower back, firmly grabbing  my arms/shoulders, rubbing my leg (happened once) and making inappropriate sexual comments/jokes (talking about is dick).

 

I was kind of worried to mention this to our coordinator because non-related issues between staff have been dealt with poorly in the past (like having accusers sit in a room with accused and confronting them).

 

Finally I got the nerve to bring it up to her in passing and she said to me “Why haven’t you told him to stop?” Looking back, I guess I just felt uncomfortable. He usually does it when other people are there and I feel like it would embarrass everyone present. I should have fully said “STOP” but it has happened so many times it would just be weird. I have distanced myself greatly and he started telling my boss that I am unfriendly and telling other staff that “She has changed”.

 

Because I mentioned it in passing, she has requested that myself and the other two women meet with her this afternoon so we can discuss it more seriously. I am really worried about how this is going to go down. How she is going to deal with it. How this is going to affect how we are treated from here on out.

 

I have a feeling he knows this is happening because yesterday a very uncomfortable situation occurred. One of the other females used to work at another organization and made a complaint against him in 2010 (four freaking years ago). She didn’t know him but was advocating on behalf of her client. Well yesterday he started telling her “I take care of my staff, I am so nice. I let you guys leave early. But you guys complain against me.” She thought he was talking about our meeting today and just said “I don’t know what you are talking about”. Then he printed out her complaint from 2010 and threw it on the desk. She didn’t know how to respond and he just walked away. She said she felt very intimidated. It gave me a very uneasy feeling too, to be honest.

 

I guess I am just wondering if anyone else has been in a situation like this and how it turned out. I am seriously anxious and nervous. I am worried because it happened so many times but I never wrote down dates. The other girls have written down dates because they are new and it has just started happening to them. 

Edit: to add to the situation, the other women are turning to me as ""the strong one"" and the moving force behind the complaint. That's a lot of pressure.

t3_255awf,How to deal with harassment at work?,"I have a couple of questions about harassment and I hope I can get some honest opinions about the matter.  I don't have many female friends I can talk to about this, so 2x is the closest thing I have to girl friends. 

I work at a large U.S. based bank, but not as a teller. I basically troubleshoot customer's bank accounts and do anything from tech support  to refunding  bank fees and disputing unauthorized transactions. All of this I do over the phone so I never see any of my customers face to face, it's nice in some aspects (I can wear what I want!) and in other aspects, people treat me so much worse because I'm just a voice over the phone. 
Anyways, recently I've been getting a rather large amount of inappropriate comments. I'm not sure how to handle it.  

For example: Yesterday I had to deal with two different men remarking how sexy I sounded, which led to them asking if I had a boyfriend. I then had a guy, who was almost ten years younger than me call me ""sugar tits."" I didn't react to that one, because I was so shocked. 

It's not unusual for men to ask if I'm single or for them to call me doll, sweetheart, honey, baby, and/or a million other pet names. I usually don't say anything, but it's just becoming so common that it's getting extremely infuriating. Like dude, I just refunded you over a hundred dollars in bank fees a simple thank you would suffice instead of asking me how I look. 

I had another guy ask me what state I lived in because he was in a middle of a divorce and another guy tell me if he ever leaves his wife, he'll find me.  I am just not comfortable with any of this, I understand that there are hazards with working with the public, but I am so fumbling and awkward that I never know what to say when these things  happen.  I just give a half hearted laugh and quickly bring the subject back to banking. 

I really want to say something to these men, but all of our calls are recorded and we cannot talk back to customers.  If our calls get really bad, i.e. screaming and being extremely abusive  we can transfer them to our escalation group. Usually, when I think of something to say (it's normally after I get off work) it's a lengthy tirade filled with things that would get me fired.

I just want to say something, letting them know it's not okay to speak to anyone like that. I feel like shouting at them that my name isn't honey, sweetie, baby, or sugar tits! I actually have a real name which I told you in the beginning of our conversation!  Is there any way I could politely tell them please call me by my name? Or that me having a boyfriend has nothing to do with the fact that you are overdrawn by $300.00? Should I just work on developing a thicker skin and get over this? 

Any suggestions, advice, or personal stories about similar dealings would be welcomed. This is also my first time posting here, I hope I did everything right.

He married someone else with a daughter when I was 7. This woman never liked me or my two brothers. My dad never once defended us from her. He just stood by quietly. She did horrible things to us. I don't want to get into that too much. 


This woman always made sure my dad did not spend any time alone with him. Not that he was some defenseless victim, he went along with it. My dad became the perfect dad to my step sister. It was, and still is, devastating. My stepmother rubbed it in my face the last time I saw her. She was going on about my step sister's father in law and how good of a man he is. She said, ""She just must feel so good and secure having two wonderful dads."" She kept saying that. How great it must be for her to have a dad that loves her that much. I just left. I was shocked that she could  be that cruel.


Now, I'm an adult and have a baby. When I was pregnant I thought that he would try to have something to do with his grandson after he was born. I was wrong and I feel like a let down little girl all over again.

Unfortunately, I had some sort of allergic reaction so I've got some plaster-shaped scars. Bio-Oiling the shit out of those! 

Things I've done to try and sort it out: switched to waxing. Bought a shedload of TendSkin and use it every day. Been super-vigilant with exfoliating and moisturising - I'm a big Lush fan, so it's been Buffy all the way plus Dream Cream in between showers. It's getting better, slowly but surely. What do you use to prevent/treat ingrown hairs?

t3_254mvt,Finding it hard to be okay with my body,"I have very large inner labia. When  I was younger, I believed that I had destroyed myself by using the shower head to masturbate and thought I would forever be a freak. I hate my vagina. I feel so ugly and I don't think I can live with this much longer. Its not just an appearance issue either. I'm constantly having to adjust and tuck them back so they don't get caught between my thighs and pull. I can't be comfortable in half the clothing I wear. my sex life is shit. my boyfriend and I have been together for four years and he hardly ever goes down there. not because he doesn't want to but because I have made a point to just steer him away from it. 
   Sex is also sometimes very painful. If i have too much or if we go at it too long my labia swell up to a crazy size and I cant do much of anything but cry. Ive been to the gyno and she says it happens and to just keep lubricated but how much lube can one girl use before shes slipping off the bed?? lol. 
 We're in an open relationship (we're both bisexual so we can see other people of the same sex) But when I am presented with sexual activities with a woman I some how get in my bed I never take my pants off. I just please her and let her touch my breasts. one time I did take off my pants and she told me I was beautiful when I tried to explain what was going on down there. she said everyones different but I was SO uncomfortable the whole time. Ive talked with my boyfriend about possibly getting surgery to just make it go away. what I wouldn't give to be able to put on a pair of underwear and not have to adjust because my labia was poking out the side and hurting me. 
This is a giant wall of text and i'm sorry I just wanted to talk and now I'm crying and blah blah thanks for letting me lean on your shoulder for a minute while I tie my dignity back up

t3_254pjv,How's your mother-daughter bond evolved? (BTW: Mother's day is this Sunday),"My relationship with my mom is still strained by some of the abusive crap she dumped on me and my siblings when we were young. One of the biggest problems I've continued to have with her is her unwillingness to get to know the version of me who lives in the real world, and not just inside her head.

Lately she's been acting just like her usual self up until the point at which I stand up to her, then she caves so completely and utterly I am left standing there going ""wtf was that?"" Things like gay rights, vibrators, and marijuana she's seemingly turned from her very vocal conservative view in the face of very low-energy ""nah, I disagree"" all the way to offering to go to a pride parade with me, asking me to take her to a sex-toy shop, and saying she could get a weed card for her myelitis pain and we could try getting high together. In less time than it took you to read that sentence.

It's very hard to know what to make of it, and especially whether or not I can trust it. Actually, given she's in the past taken any information she can find and used it to try and hurt me when she's mad, I'm not sure I will ever really be able to trust it, but it would be nice to know if she's being genuine.

How has your mother-daughter bond evolved, and did any sudden changes actually stick? How do you determine the difference between someone genuinely changing and someone faking it for other purposes?",13,20140509093126,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_255lq2,MENSTRUATION: discuss how we prepare for the crimson fairy's monthly visit and all the curve balls she throws at us.,"On an average day of the week, when I'm not a menstruation-ridden zombie bumbling around the house, I normally wear panty liners. I discovered during my journey into adulthood that women often produce a boogery substance called discharge, and my mother introduced me to the life raft that is panty liners. They're like pads, only much thinner, and I use them to keep my underwear nice and clean. 

HOWEVER, on one day a month the crimson fairy arrives at my door. That sadistic bitch waves her wand and the hands of my body's internal clock hit *menstruation*. In my teen years my periods were fairly irregular, but now I can always trust they arrive on schedule. When this starts, the crimson fairy is courteous enough to warn me of what's to come with some light spotting. It usually appears in the toilet or in my underpants, and because I wear panty liners this isn't often an issue. But as I age, it almost seems like I'm developing a sixth sense for the arrival of my period. One day I'll get a feeling, and I'll reach for a pad. Then, a few hours later, the spotting arrives. 

I've come to think of this as the spotting day. Menstruation usually plays out for me like this: the first day is very light flow, and the second day is like a smelly, bloody tsunami. The second day is always the worst of it, and now that I have a sense for my body's workings I know what to prepare for. I take inventory on my pads, I stock up on dark underpants and I change my sheets. To prevent accidents from happening, I have a pair of old yet comfy pajama bottoms that I wear to bed. It's okay if I leak on these because they're made of a dark, thick, absorbent material. I get squeamish at the thought of tampons, you see, so pads have always been the way for me.  

But I can't put my life on hold for menstruation. I've got things to do, places to be. Warm days and summertime are particularly troublesome for me when I'm running errands, because it's difficult to tell if I'm leaking or if it's just sweat between my thighs. On days like these, I take advantage of mirrors to inspect my hindquarters for the tell-tale stains. Or if I'm with my mother, I'll turn to her and furtively whisper, ""Hey, can you look at my butt for a minute? Am I leaking?"" Camaraderie. 

Then there's that one thing that happens when we stand up after sitting for a while. You know what I'm talking about, right? I'll be sitting for an extended period of time and then, when I stand up, *that thing* happens. The dam breaks. It almost feels like I'm peeing my pants, and it's something I literally have zero control over. It's a terrible thing to endure in public, no matter how prepared I am. Not only do I bring two spare pads in my purse, but I also place no less than four wet wipes in a ziploc bag in case of an emergency. On that note, I'm curious to know how others cope with appearing in public when the crimson fairy pays a visit. Do you bring extra underwear? Wet wipes? Pads and tampons? 

I'm also curious to know about the quirks that other menstruating individuals have to put up with and the techniques they've developed to cope. Do you wear old, not-so-fancy undergarments or do you wear the sexiest undergarments in your possession to lift your spirits? Tampons or pads? Medicine, perhaps? Do you have mood swings? Do you have diarrhea or log shits? Scented or unscented? Cravings? Bloating? Cramps? Certain activities to improve your mood, like watching movies or reading books? Lay it all out right here: the good, the bad, and the nasty. ",4,20140509150855,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_254pmj,Currently in a pregnancy scare..,"I'm 19. I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend and we used the pull-out method. Some of the cum dripped down my crotch, and I honestly don't know if any actually got inside. That was 2 or 3 weeks ago. I've been on birth control for about a month now, but I'm using it to skip a couple of periods, so I won't have a period until next month or so. I did the stick pregnancy test and it said ""not pregnant"". However, I've been having some symptoms of pregnancy, such as thick, white, mostly odorless discharge on my panties, feeling tired throughout the day, my boobs hurt all around the area where they attach to my chest, and I had to get up twice last night to pee and I normally never need to pee throughout the night. Hopefully I'm just over exaggerating,  but I am beginning to get genuinely worried.

Edit: I'm taking Gildess FE 1.5/30 
I've taken this kind before and specifically used it so I wouldn't have a period because I was going on a 3 week trip and I didn't want my period to prevent me from doing anything. I normally have VERY heavy periods.

In the spirit of sharing stories that guys don't normally get to hear, I have a question:  would you care to relate your online multiplayer video game horror stories?

From my perspective and knowledge, most women gamers prefer to remain gender-unknown in online games, for fear of, well, us. Playing various MMOs over the years I've been guild mates with a lot of women, but general chats and random groups are almost always guys or unidentified. This has always made perfect sense to me, but usually when I mention this state of affairs to other guys, they typically just say ""lol no"" and say that there just aren't any girls playing. So I guess part two to the question would be, how often do you actually identify as women (or any non-male for that matter) in video games, if ever? ",6,20140509114731,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

This week I didn't balance things well, and I have two kids who are very opinionated (don't know who they get it from...) and talk ALL THE TIME. I live in a foreign (to me) country and I organise events for other immigrants to help them integrate, so I spend a TON of time in meetings, emailing, begging for space or resources or money. I'm currently organising a huge event for immigrant parents to learn about the school system here. Plus I just started my own business teaching kids programming, and ran my first workshop in April.

In short, I'm just completely out of energy, even for my kids.

Then yesterday I was waiting for the tram to come home and this drunk guy who's yelling at cars comes and sits next to me at the stop. He's rambling in his own language about Nazis and Aryans and then asks me what colours eyes I have. I ignore him. He asks over and over and *over* and I browse fb on my phone. He finally leans in and says, ""Blue eyes. Get out of here and go back to Germany!"" (hint, crazy lunatic man, not from Germany). Tram comes, I go home.

He was there today again, exact same place, same clothes, same cans of beer. Today he was harassing someone else, so I quickly fled, feeling bad for the older woman he was talking to but not wanting to get involved, either.

So this week has been a bit shitty, really, and my dear husband has banished me to the balcony with music, beer, ice cream and my laptop.

t3_255tv1,I finally called the police on my physically abusive partner. I want to share my experience.,"Warning: this is long!

A few months ago, my boyfriend held me against the wall and punched me several times in the side of the head, then pushed me onto the floor and kicked me while I lay there. I remember him going into the kitchen and I was thinking “he’s going to get a knife, he’s going to get a knife and kill me”. This was at least the 20th time this had happened in our 3.5 year relationship. He tried to stop me from leaving the house, and when he realised I might call the police, he told me he would kill himself. So once I was outside, I took a few deep breaths, dialled 999 and said exactly what had happened - my boyfriend had threatened suicide and I couldn’t enter the house in case he hurt me again.

I was an idiot about the whole thing - I begged the police officers not to arrest him, I even tried saying I lied about him attacking me, I refused to show them most of the bruising under my clothes, and I gave a witness statement but said I would refuse to give evidence in court. But while he was being arrested, I sat in the police car with a kind lady officer who told me that I absolutely had to end this relationship, that nobody deserves to be hit. She talked me through what was going to happen, made sure I would be able to stay in my house, and before they took my boyfriend away they gave me his keys.

He was charged with assault later in the day, and it was explained to me that I didn’t have a choice in the outcome of this - the police had enough evidence to charge him and didn’t require my consent to do so. I said again that I didn’t want to go to court, but by that point I was already beginning to change my mind and realising that perhaps it was a good thing that he was arrested.

I honestly wasn’t prepared for how good I would feel when he was removed from my life. I was absolutely terrified of living without him, of sleeping alone, of being without the person who I thought I loved more than anything in the world. But the feeling of freedom I had was so amazing it's difficult to put into words - just knowing that I had nobody to justify myself to anymore, that I no longer had to worry about making him angry, that I no longer had to feel guilty for making another human being want to physically harm me. I did a lot of research on domestic violence while I was still in the relationship, desperately trying to understand what it was I was doing that was making him do this. It’s true that you can never see the full picture while you’re still in the situation. I never saw how much power and control he had over me until he was gone, and only then, it was immediately clear.

He pleaded not guilty, and a couple of weeks ago I went to court as a witness in his trial. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. His lawyer said I made up the whole thing to hurt him, and brought up the fact that I hadn’t showed the police any injuries etc. The lawyers and magistrates kept asking me questions I couldn’t answer - “How many times did he kick you?” “Between 5 and 10” “No, we need to know exactly how many”. Well shit, maybe I should’ve been keeping a tally while I was lying on the floor being attacked, but I didn’t. Sorry.

He was found not guilty. So as of now there are no more bail conditions, nothing to keep me safe. No grounds to get a restraining order. He is innocent in the eyes of the law and can turn up at my address whenever he wants to. I’ve found this difficult to deal with, if I’m honest. I find it hard to accept that his lawyer (who knows exactly what happened, and knows how my safety will be endangered) can stand up in court and create a lie to get his client off the hook. I know it’s his job. I know defence lawyers have an important place in society. I still find it hard to come to terms with, as a person who tries to live by a strong set of morals. Everyone in that court room knew he was guilty, and he was still acquitted. In my borough we have a specialist domestic violence court, where the magistrates and other staff are trained in domestic violence cases and there is a much better conviction rate. My case didn’t go there. I don’t know why, probably budget cuts etc.

The biggest issue I’ve had from people I’ve had to disclose this to outside of the police is the assumption that we must have “had a fight” and the police became involved. I often hear a statistic that most domestic violence is mutual, and while I don’t deny that that might be true, I can honestly say that whilst I wasn’t the perfect girlfriend (who is?) I never hit my boyfriend back. I never shouted in his face, I never called him names or even swore at him in an argument. I never, ever had any desire to hurt him, only to protect myself and to try to show him how much I loved him in the hope that he might understand what a real loving relationship is supposed to be like. About a year before all of this happened, I confided in a consultant clinical psychologist, the head of her department, whose response was ""In DV situations we always need to look at the woman and what she's doing"" and (I shit you not) ""I'm sure if you start having more sex you'll find this will stop"". I decided not to make a formal complaint.

He grew up in a home where he both witnessed and experienced physical violence and other forms of abuse, and so did I. Whether that is the reason we both ended up in this situation, I don’t know. He always had an issue with accepting responsibility for mistakes - his violent outbursts were always my fault, for interrupting him, for taking a wrong turn while driving, for “not caring”, no matter how much effort I put in. I did everything he asked of me, keeping a constant list in my head of things which upset him or made him angry, but the violence continued, and got increasingly more severe. He genuinely believed, and convinced me too, that in our relationship, I was the (emotional) abuser, and he was the victim, lashing out because he had no other option. I’m sure he still believes now that I called the police because I wanted to fuck up his life, not because I was so afraid for both of our safety.

Anyway, this has got long. The main reason I decided to share my experience was because I’ve read so many bad experiences of reporting abuse and violence to the police, and I want to share how good my experience has been. The police were helpful, professional, supportive, and non-judgemental from the moment I called for help. Please, if you are in this kind of a shitty relationship, if your partner commits a crime against you, please report it. The police are there for your safety and protection, it is their job to help you. The UK has a proactive prosecution policy towards domestic violence. This means that the police will always arrest the person who has attacked you and where there is enough evidence, they will charge and push for prosecution whether they have the support of the victim or not. I believe now that this is a good thing - regardless of the eventual outcome at court - had my boyfriend not been arrested, as per my request at the time, I would’ve gone straight back into a dangerous situation with someone who now had even more reason to be angry at me.

I won’t say that I’m doing well now, because that wouldn’t be entirely true. I have good days and bad days. I’m trying to keep myself occupied and distracted, and not spend too much time alone. I know that time is a great healer, so I’m confident that things can only get better from here :)",436,20140509163508,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_255zg7,Question from a terminal dad about my wife and daughter,"Hey all, I'm a long time reader of r/all, so I've seen a lot of your sub before it became a default, and I've always appreciated the care you give each other.  With that in mind, I have some questions about how to help my wife deal with my upcoming death.  

Some background first:

I'm a late 30's dad with terminal cancer.  My wife and I have been married for 14 1/2 years (and dated off and on for 8-9 years before that) and I’ve been in treatment for 6 ½ years now.  We have 2 children, 1 girl and 1 boy, who are just about to turn 7 and 10 respectively.  I am lucky as hell to have survived as long as I have, but unfortunately things point to me not making it too much longer.

My wife is a wonderful woman, who has gone through hell with this, but is much, much more emotionally reserved than I am.  She went through some rough shit as a young girl, and as a result built some damn high walls to protect herself.  She very rarely cries, and even more rarely lets anyone in through those walls she (when we got the recent bad news, her mom came to me to ask how she could help her daughter).  

In addition to this, with me being diagnosed with cancer out of the blue (and being in good shape, healthy, etc…) then our daughter being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 3 years old, and no family history for either one, she kinda feels like the world is out to get our family.  Combine this with a strong type A personality, and you get someone who wants to protect her family from the world - a situation that is bound to fail. 

She has told me many times that a major coping mechanism for her is pretending that I’ll just go on living, and she doesn't want to talk about her fears, etc.. much, and I respect that as much as I can, but I worry about after I’m gone.  I worry about her crashing with all the weight she carries, I worry about her sealing herself off from the world emotionally, and I worry about how this will affect the kids too.  

Any insight from the other side of the gender aisle would be welcome.

Additionally, I also wonder what I can do now that will be meaningful for my daughter as she grows up. 

(As a side note, dying sucks.  Especially when you have a lot of people you care about.  My advice: Do your best to avoid it.)

EDIT:  Thank you so much for all the responses!!  I will get to all of them, I am having a rough time with chemo right now, unfortunately...once the itching, bleeding, nausea and muscle cramps are done, I will read and respond.

But I know that eventually it will go away. 

Today I was sitting at my desk and I got the real cramps. And they hurt pretty bad (still do, as I'm writing this). I work in an office that is normally all female, and we tend to just say whatever comes to mind. We have a colleague working here from another branch and he's a dude. No biggie. 

I told my co-worker that ""My uterus hurts"" and the guy colleague came out of his office and was grinning uncomfortably and motioned that there was an employee in the testing room and obviously that they could probably hear me. I realized that he was uncomfortable because I had said ""uterus."" And then him being uncomfortable made me uncomfortable. No, not uncomfortable, I take that back--it made me irritated.

t3_256o4b,My gynecologist won't give me an IUD - I'm in need of some advice.,"I've been having a tough time with hormonal BC. I've been taking it for about a year and a half, but I've only started to experience adverse side effects in the last 6 months or so. I've had bouts of depression, mood swings, and a crushingly nonexistent libido. Since these effects have persisted consistently, I decided I should try to switch to a non-hormonal method of birth control. I should mention that I am 21 years old, in a long-term relationship, and have never been pregnant. 

I made an appointment to talk with my doctor, and right off the bat I could tell that she was not going to budge her opinion. Before she walked in the door, her mind was made up. She was not going to give me an IUD, and certainly not a non-hormonal one. She said that because I have never been pregnant, I would be at a much greater risk of infection with an IUD, and that my uterus would be too small. No examination, nothing. She said my best bet for better emotional health would be changing up my hormonal BC cocktail. She said that basically no matter what, birth control will always affect my mood, and keep my libido low. She gave me a new pill pack, and sent me on my way. 

If these side effects were minor, I wouldn't have even gone in to see her. The thing is that I no longer feel like myself. I can feel horribly empty and very *wrong* to a point where it's difficult to function. 

My SO is going away for the summer, so I thought I'd go off the pill for a couple months and see how it goes. But after that, I'm not sure what to do. Do I get a second opinion? How do I find a good doctor? Should I just try the new pill pack?

t3_256i3o,I have no idea if I ever want to have a child,"I really have no idea if I ever want to have a kid. Argh. I'm at that age (28), where I'm being constantly bombarded with Facebook photos and pregnancy announcements. I'm honestly mostly immune to cute kid-baby fever, but I realize I probably should at least be thinking about a decision. I have some years left, but I no longer have 10+ years to mull my options. This, combined with ennui about not being as far along in my career as I'd like (ah, being a perfectionist), I'm suddenly panicking about my complete lack of certainty one way or the other. 

I'm married and my husband is awesome, but equally unsure. When we got engaged, we both thought we wanted to have one kid, but over the years, we've become less sure. I feel like we could be fantastic parents and absolutely could support a child financially. BUT, I've never been baby-crazy or a big fan of kids (though not rabidly anti either). I'm pretty sure my mother assumes I will never have children. I'm super passionate about my career. I love being independent and having hobbies and being my own person. All these logical factors seem to scream: don't have kids! But the analysis doesn't entirely convince me one way or another because I'm the awesomest at overthinking things. There's definitely a part of me that still wants to be a mother.  

We have four awesome bunnies right now, and they've been wonderful for us. In addition to being adorable balls of ridiculousness, I feel like they've made my heart grow, if that makes sense. If I were to have a child, I think that would be why--grow my heart some more. I absolutely know I could unconditionally love and care for a tiny person. But, I don't know if I want to make the sacrifices that being a parent entails. 

So, how do I become sure, pro OR con? Will I ever be sure? Is being unsure reason enough to NOT have a child? Is anyone else as completely confused as I am?

Do I have relationship/engagement anxiety?

Short version of my problem: A couple weeks ago, when I was aware my boyfriend of four years would propose in a matter of days and we were going to close on a house, I broke up with him because I was experiencing serious doubts about marrying him. I can't quite pinpoint why - we're best friends who love each other, we make each other happy, he's a great guy, we resolve conflict well, etc. But this doubt was overwhelming. I felt like I was walking to my doom. Suddenly, after talking about marriage for over a year, I was the opposite of excited to marry him - my insides were screaming at me not to do it, and I'd look at my guy and feel like he was the wrong person, somehow. So I broke it off and told him he wasn't the guy I wanted to marry.

Two weeks out from that, I'm not sure why I did it. I don't exactly want to go rushing back to him - I feel like the doubt would still be there. I did some internet research and read about 'engagement anxiety' and wondered if that could be a factor.

t3_256giw,My face looks manly.,"I'm mostly comfortable with my body. Enough anyway. It's pretty in it's own way, and I can recognize and appreciate that. But my face, I just don't see the good in it. I'm not a very feminine person in general, but I've been working on that and have made progress in everywhere but my face.

I'm relatively thin, but I have quite a bit of neck fat (inherited). My face just looks really flat and without any feminine shape. I have some upper lip hair and I don't wear makeup. I try my hardest to shape my eyebrows into an arch, but they just refuse to get any shape other than flat (They naturally on the thicker side, and they can be kind of messy looking, but I keep them thinner and try to tame them). My forehead isn't exactly *big*, I don't think, but it is, erm, wrinkly? My skin is also oily and shines (not sure if a result of my actual face or the lotion I use on it or something else), giving me an overall greasier look. Combined with my combination dry and greasy hair, it gives me an unkempt, messy/manly look. 

My hair is terrible and certainly adds to my face looking manlier, but that's a problem for another day.

All in all, I'm incredibly insecure about my face, but I don't really know how to fix it. I clearly can't change the shape, but I figure I can change my skin/eyebrows/etc. I use an offbrand of Vaseline's hypoallergenic lotion. I wash my face once daily--in the shower using Cerave (recommended by my dermatologist--I don't think it really helps at all, though). I've recently attempted using a different kind of lotion, but I think it was starting a breakout, so I stopped using it. I've also tried coconut oil which caused a breakout. I don't really have acne-prone skin--it's mostly zitless on it's own--but I guess my skin is just picky about products. Like I said, my eyebrows refuse to hold an arch. They also look ""piece-y"" and don't lay nice. I don't wear makeup and don't intend on it (both out of a fear of causing a breakout and because I don't think I should use makeup until after I'm ok with my appearance)--the exception being maybe mascara/eyeliner in the future. The upper lip hair is where my biggest issue is. I won't use makeup, so I can't cover it up. And I refuse to shave/wax/pluck/whatever it because I fear it growing back darker (or thicker--point is, it'll *look* darker and more noticeable as personally experienced with my stomach hair). 

Sorry for the amount of text, but I'm at the point where I just don't know what to do about it anymore. Any suggestions on ways to bring out the more feminine side of my face? I'm not necessarily interested in specific products (different things work for different people--plus, I tend to prefer using more natural products where I can), but *types* (Ex: ""lotion"", ""cleanser"", etc.) are helpful since I'm fairly inexperienced with facial/skin care. Or just something in general that I can change, I don't know.

I tried to fit in as much background here as possible, but feel free to ask more questions in the comments if I left something out!

Apologies if there's a better subreddit for this.

t3_2561qm,Thought Experiment: How to Achieve Equal Wages,"This is a thought I've been playing with and I thought we could have an interesting (non-confrontational) discussion about it. This is also like my first post ever, so if I did this wrong... sorry. 


So, lets make a few assumptions that may or may not be true but I dont want to get bogged down in link-wars:

1. women and men without children in similar professions make about the same. 

2. women with children tend to make less than men in similar professions. 

3. women tend to choose lower paying jobs then men, including child care, teaching, nursing, elder care, etc. 

And these 3 factors account for the fact that on average, women make 75(ish)% of what men do. 


For now, I don't have a solution to the women-with-children-paid-less-than-men-with-children. There are a lot of factors here. 


So, in my beautiful, utopian philosophically-invented society, in order to achieve fair wages, it's not a question of MORE WOMAN ENGINEERS (or STEM high-paying-career of choice), because there are many women who are not interested in that. Most women, statistically speaking, want to be care-givers, to make the world better by helping other people. And that's a good thing. The world NEEDS that.


So the best way to achieve equal wages, to give women and men equal economic power, is to raise the wages of caregiver jobs. This means higher wages (and thus more jobs and better quality of worker) in:

Early childhood education and daycare

Elementary and Junior High

Nursing and nurses aids

Elder care

Human Resources

Minimum Wage Jobs (food/sales clerk, etc)



Basically, give Pink Collar jobs the respect and funding they deserve, which would in effect create a more nurturing, well developed society, with better adjusted and educated kids. This sounds awesome, especially in a time when a massive amount of people are going to retire and require more medical and elder care. 


The amazing thing is that this would be fairly easy to do (for a given definition of ""easy""). Many of these jobs are under the education and healthcare umbrella, who's wages are (at least in Canada, I know less about you wacky yankees), set by the government. Minimum wage, obviously also set by government. A few strokes of a pen and BAM, mission accomplished (after months and years of wrangling and a few scandals, of course).

t3_257bsf,So I bought Plan-B for the first time...,"Let me start this out by saying I'm in high school.

I hate saying this story is a ""not me, it's for a friend!"" story but it is. Background: friend's younger and was scared of the judgement of buying plan b, so I offered to go with her or if she wants, I can just get it myself because it won't bother me at all. She asks if I can buy it myself and I obliged because I'm just buying some medicine, what's the worst that can happen?

I honestly didn't even think about people judging me because *I* knew it wasn't for me but when I couldn't find it and I had to ask a male worker, I saw the look of judgement on his face and realized exactly why my friend was reluctant to buy it.

I was getting dirty looks and second glances from kids my own age, middle aged adults, and old folks alike. I was mortified, which is ridiculous.

Why is bad that, for their perspective, a 17 year old girl doesn't want to have a child? Why should it be embarrassing that I'm trying to prevent a teenage pregnancy? Why is there a much bigger stigma around buying plan b as a girl than buying condoms as a guy? 

Maybe I'm just overthinking this but it was almost like a psychology experiment. What was their thought process? *that girl is so irresponsible for having sex in high school, she shouldn't be buying plan b, she should just have that child because she's so irresponsible!*

in the end, I don't regret buying it all. It was embarrassing at the time, but as soon as I walked out that door I remembered no one in that store matters at all. None of them know who I am. None of them know why I was buying it. Even if I was buying it for myself, none of them knew what led up to it.

Pros and cons?,"I used to be on the pill, but I have a terrible memory and just *cannot* remember to take it at the same time every day. When I brought this up as a teenager to my doctor and my step-mom whom I was living with at the time, they told me to suck it up and that it just wasn't that hard to take it, and that I was an idiot. (They were both awful people.) 

At first I was using the pill to regulate my periods, so missing a few days wasn't a huge deal, but eventually I started to become sexually active and I knew I couldn't be constantly worried about whether or not I was pregnant because I had missed a day (or three...). So when I moved out on my own I talked to my (new!) doctor about alternatives. I started on the Depo shot, which was amazing for the first while. I get the shot every three months and I usually only have one period a month, if at all. My periods are AWFUL so avoiding them entirely was a huge draw and I'm sad to have to go off of it.

But, I've gained a *lot* of weight and have been having other issues with it, so I need to try something else. I usually am about 15 pounds heavier when on birth control, which is fine with me because I'm really not all that concerned with being chubby, but this is more like waterweight - I feel uncomfortable and bloated and terrible and moody. And HUNGRY. ALL THE TIME. Hangry, if you will. It's decreased my sex drive somewhat, made me really crave starchy, carby foods, and really emotional and stressed out - which has made me break out a lot more. 

My only knowledge of the IUD is what I've been told by my one friend that has had it, and her experience was awful. She said that it was extremely painful to have put in, and that she had really bad cramps following the procedure, that it kept falling out of place, and that she had it removed after only a few months because she just hated it so much. I'm due for my next depo shot soon so I need to decide what I'm going to do within the next month, or I'll be stuck with these symptoms for another three...

I don't see anything shaming women who are the wrong race or body size or sexual orientation. Your posts are varied and interesting and it feels like this sub has scope. It takes a larger picture of the world and brings certain aspects into focus. It does all that and doesn't make me feel like a piece of shit just because I was born with penis, which is nice.

After receiving so much support I wanted to touch base and let everyone who cares know how I'm doing just over a week after surgery.

The hysterectomy was scheduled to last two hours, but took more than twice as long as planned and I have a 10-inch incision from hip to hip, which is going to make for some badass battle scars for sure. 

I was slated to be in the hospital for 5 days, but was discharged after two. This isn't something women my age undergo very often (fortunately) and the nursing staff and doctors were astounded at how quickly I was able to get back on feet after such an invasive procedure. This has, however, been the longest week of my life. I've been in far less pain than expected but was unprepared for how tiring this would be. I've lost 12 lbs. and have been eating as often as I'm able. Literally every extra calorie my body is taking in is being used up for healing right now. 

Unfortunately, pathology came back revealing that the surgery failed to eradicate the cancer. Despite my PET scan and MRI having been perfect, it's spread to my lymph nodes. I will require radiation to try and stop it but it's extremely dangerous to irradiate healing tissue so we have to wait. My family has decided to fly me home this week, as soon as the staples, drains, and catheter come out, so I can spend some time at home recovering with them before starting the next phase of treatment. 

On a positive note, I've been forced to spend quality time with my mother. Life often get's in the way and while I see my family several times a year, I haven't had the chance to sit with my mother and talk, cry, and just hang out as much as I have over the last few weeks. While I imagine there are thousands of things she'd rather be doing for her Mother's Day, she'll be tending to me, laughing over spilled catheter bags, how bad I need to shave my legs, and watching me roll around in bed like a pill bug instead. 

This is my life now and I'm determined to enjoy my life. Since ignoring the cancer isn't a viable option, I will do whatever I need to do to beat it or die trying. Thank you all for your love and support.

(Edit/FYI - I have always gotten a yearly Pap. The nurse who performed this one originally advised that I was not due for a Pap for another 3 years. I insisted and if it hadn't been done, my oncologist assured me that there'd been nothing they could have done for me. Cervical cancer can be slow-moving...but that's relative and also not always the case. Mine is aggressive and Paps are not fool-proof.

Anyone else get ""cuted"" when doing non-traditionally feminine things?","I'm not sure if I'm expressing this correctly, but it can sometimes be extremely patronizing.

When you are prescribed it not many doctors will actually walk through what it is, what it does to your body, what's icky but completely normal, and what are giant fucking danger signs that you need to be on the look out for. Below are some things I commonly see, please add your own. 
  



 *Women who are on the pill and also use condoms who go out and get plan b if the condom breaks.* 

> [Plan B is basically a mega dose of progestin, which will prevent ovulation and hence conception if taken immediately after sex.](http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/plan-b) Assuming you are following the golden rules of birth control then plan b is just a waste of money and will screw up your cycle.  




 

*Women who think that they need to take the placebo pills/have withdrawal bleeding*
>The reason the placebos are in your birth control pack is that the creator of the pill thought that it would make birth control more [palatable to the Catholic Church. Seriously.](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/05/06/the-pill-and-the-invention-of-the-monthly-cycle/)  The simulation of a ""natural"" period isn't doing you any benefit. You may experience breakthrough bleeding if you stack pills, and any change can be unpredictable, but the option is there if you want to take it. 




**Golden rules of Birth Control**

*  Take your pill every day within as narrow a time frame as possible. If you miss one day, be safe and use other means of protection until you have 7 days of pills under your belt.   

* Don't take antibiotics, or other concoctions like St Johns Wort - Check whatever medicine you put in yourself for contraindications with hormonal birth control. When you do need antibiotics, tell your doctor what birth control you are on, and make sure it is safe. If in doubt, use backup protection.  
  
*  If you vomit after taking a pill, you need to take another, or again, take 7 days of pills while using backup protection. 

 

**What is birth control even doing?**

For oral birth control pills, it basically comes down to the [mini-pill \(Progestogen only pills, POPs\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestogen-only_pill) and the [combined oral contraceptive pills \(COCs\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill)

Progestogen only pills require you to take the pill within a very narrow time frame for optimal effectiveness. They do not contain estrogen, so can be great for people who experience whacked out side effects on COCs. They work by thickening your cervical mucus, so sperm is less likely to penetrate the fortress of your uterus. They also may inhibit ovulation and chill out the growth of cushy cells on the lining of your uterus for any egg to implant on. 

The classic pill, COCs, have a nice combined dose of estrogen and progestogen. It will stop you ovulating, as well as all the fun cervical mucus thickening progestogen brings to the table. The estrogen  may be able to help with other problems, like acne and crazy periods. Can noticeably effect your mood - please talk to your doctor about trying other pills if the one you are on makes you feel horrible. 

**DANGER ZONE**  

Pills have been studied extensively and they are very safe. However, very rarely birth control pills lead to serious problems. The following are the warning signals to watch out for while using the pill.

    Abdominal Pain (severe)
    Chest Pain (severe), cough, shortness of breath
    Headache (severe) with blurred vision, weakness, difficulty speaking
    Eye problems-vision loss or blurring
    Leg Pain (severe)

If you have one of these symptoms, it may or may not be related to the pill. It is important to check with your health care provider as soon as possible.

Blood clots are a rare but possible side effect of birth control. If you have a family history, you need to tell your doctor. If you're a smoker, you are safer on the POP than on the COC, but quitting smoking is the best remedy. Women have died from untreated blood clots, so make sure you check out any symptoms that might occur.

t3_2581nt,(Off my chest) I'm really sick of people telling me I'm too young to know what I want.,"I've known since I was 8 years old that I didn't want to have biological children. My logic then was ""if there are so many children that don't have parents, why would I want to bring another kid into the world when all these kids need someone to love them?""

My logic hasn't really changed greatly, and the reasons I don't want biological children have expanded and enumerated. I would have to go off antidepressants for up to over a year, which would kill both me and the baby, literally. That alone should be grounds for actually listening to me about this choice. My career field means I would have to take leave really early along, and that is just no, forever no. My career field (and my boyfriend's) also means I will never make enough money to support my pregnancy.

Don't get me wrong, I like kids. I currently work as a nanny while I get my degree, and it's the best and most rewarding job I've ever had. But pregnancy and birth? No thanks. I won't even babysit kids under the age of 3.

The only time I waver is, surprise!, when I'm ovulating. And I know it's solely hormonal, and once I think about being pregnant, my stomach turns. Nothing about being pregnant or being a mom to a newborn is appealing to me.

I'm 23. It's been 15 years I've known what I want from my babymaking parts, which is nothing. But no doctor will even discuss it with me, waving me off as ""oh you're young, you'll regret it.""

So?! If I regret it, *I* will regret it. It is *my* choice. It is *my* decision, and you, as my doctor should not let *your* conscience color your treatment of me. Stop telling me I don't know what I want, because I know exactly what I want. It's to the point that I have fantasized about threatening my doctor I'll go to Mexico to get sterilized. Which honestly sounds better that arguing with doctors up here.

If you're here just to comment and tell me the same things my doctors have, I'm sorry but you can just screw off. I know you didn't want kids and had a surprise baby and OMG you love being a mom. But you and I are different people. I might love being a mom, I probably will. But I never, ever, ever want to be pregnant and mother to a newborn. And I never, ever, ever want to have to deal with a surprise pregnancy that I will absolutely, without hesitation, abort.

If you're my age and managed to get a doctor to agree to sterilize you, tell me your secrets because I am friggin grasping at straws here. /rant

Today I was at a dress fitting and two other women were there getting fittings as well. One asked if my dress was a bridesmaids dress and I responded immediately, with a smile ""Yes ma'am it is."" To which both of them hissed their breath and pulled out the standard - ""Don't call me ma'am! I'm not THAT old!"" They then went on about how I looked 17 (I'm 22) and just made me feel bad and uncomfortable for the entire fitting. 

Why is there a negative connotation with ""ma'am""? Why do we immediately feel the need to correct strangers by pointing out how young we are? Is this a habit I need to rid myself of?

t3_257s4s,Troubled by a possible sexual assault incident with my ex-boyfriend (TW: sexual assault),"Hello, TwoXers. Serious post, with a trigger warning for sexual assault. It might be long, for which I apologise, though I sincerely appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it to the end. 

I'm a 17 year old girl (England, so the AoC is 16), and I broke up with my ex-boyfriend at the end of January this year. He is 19. I'm going to cut to the chase about it: I feel as though on more than one occasion my ex sexually assaulted me. On one occasion, it was ~3am and I was almost passed out with tiredness. He asked if he could sleep inside me. I was reluctant, knowing he would try and actively have sex with me if I said yes, but was too tired and too weary of his nagging to disagree. As predicted, he began to have sex with me. I began to cry. He asked if he should stop, and concerned that if I said ""yes"" he would confront me and try and keep me awake with emotionally manipulative jargon - he was a big fan of ""Why don't you want to have sex with me? Do you not find me attractive? Why don't you want me?"" and such kinds of rhetoric). As such, I muttered that he could continue. I quietly kept crying until at some point falling asleep. I can't remember when it ended - whether it was with him finishing, or me falling asleep. 

This was but one occasion. On another, I was already crying and upset, with lots of oral pain as a result of a tooth in need of a filling. He started attempting to seduce me, saying that if I had sex with him, I would feel better. Despite my tears and negative body language, he tried to have sex with me. I continued to cry. Eventually I was allowed to climb off of him. 

When I was ill with a chest infection/spells of vomiting in December, he came over for a couple of nights to look after me. Rather than looking after me, he spent the entire time complaining that I didn't want to have sex with him despite the fact that I was in immense pain and could barely move. At regular intervals he would try and kiss me, and then would finger me or try and perform oral sex upon me when I was simply trying to rest and watch something on Netflix.

There have been various other occasions. These are just the most distinct in my head. I felt entirely violated. At the time, I excused his behaviour, because he loved me, and he was my first boyfriend, and I knew no better. I stuck with him because I convinced myself, by way of low self-esstem, that he would be the only person who would ever love me - a ridiculous kind of teenage hyperbole, I know, and also untrue.

My concern is that I'm just seeing assault where it didn't occur, and that people would not take me seriously were I to confide in them whilst knowing contextually what our relationship was like.

Firstly, I'm relatively into kink pursuits and we did act-out rape roleplays from time to time. However, these were always consensual and the parameters were agreed upon beforehand. (Caveat: on one definite occasion, I distinctly remember he slapped me in the face during one such roleplay, despite a lack of my consent for such behaviour.) In this sense, I worry that both third parties and my boyfriend would think that I'm just being dramatic if ""that sort of stuff"" was what I was into anyway.

Secondly, I didn't actively and assertively say ""no"". On occasions there was a ""get off me"", at which point he usually did, but when I felt pressured into continuing (i.e., when I was tired and crying), I didn't say no. He thought it was acceptable to continue, because despite the fact that I felt completely violated, I said he could carry on. 

I don't know if I'm being completely unreasonable to feel abused. I have had nightmares about these events, and sporadic panic attacks. I feel humiliated and violated - on many occasions when I was with him, my body didn't feel like my own.

I don't know what to think or how to feel, and I would appreciate any light any of you lovely ladies could possibly shine upon this situation. If there's any information necessary to clarify anything, I will be most likely more than happy to provide it (unless it is very personal).

t3_258cpi,My mom is going on her first date after two decades. Any advice for her? Or me if it doesn't go right?,"**TL;DR : my mom hasn't gone on a date in more than two decades, I need tips to give her to help her since she has some social anxiety**

My mom is in her late 50's and hasn't had time to date while raising me. Now that I've been out of the house for a few years she is super lonely and wants a companion. My friend mentioned to me that she works with a guy my moms age who is super nice and we set them up to meet for coffee tomorrow. He has seen a face picture of her and knows she is plus-sized, but i'm super nervous because everyone has different ideas of what plus-sized is. 

She has survived cancer and has fibromyalgia, so her hair is shorter than the picture and she walks with a cane. She tends to clam up to people when she is nervous because she has social anxiety. He knows she has fibromyalgia and says he is familiar with it. She is really smart and quick when its just me and her but if she is nervous with other people she can seem a little slow in her responses. I'm scared that the guy is going to be rude or awkward cuz of that. 

He works in a big old folks home and she told me that she's afraid he will think she's like one of them, instead of a date. He is a little more ""hip"" than her, he has a phone that can text and he gets a  lot of current pop-culture and jokes, my mom, not so much. She is very liberal though. But she doesn't like ""rude humor"" like fart jokes and beer? (although she has this weird soft spot for Borat???) My friend assured me that he is easy-going and wouldn't walk out if the date was awkward. Can you give me any tips to give her? Maybe conversation keys, or good phrases? 

Things in common: They are both parents of grown children, they both like outer space, apparently he is really into aliens, and my mom used to listen to Art Bell on coast2coast with me (its a radio program about the supernatural). She has lived all over the U.S. and it seems like he has too.  They are both in their 50's.

Finally, I'm scared that if there is no second date that she will blame it all on herself and think something is wrong with her. I would feel so bad and guilty if she was upset since I set this up.

t3_257r0i,I got Nexplanon/Implanon in September and have been having pretty much non-stop spotting or periods since. Anyone have experience with this?,"Lemme go ahead and say the reason I haven't gone to see my gyno is because I've been living with my boyfriend ~14 hours away from my home for the past few months and haven't been home long enough to schedule a visit. I also heard that spotting/periods lasting a long time is normal for nexplanon/implanon, but it's getting to the point where I'm thinking I need to look at some other options than just waiting. Due to medical conditions on my boyfriend's side, we haven't been able to have sex anyway. 

For the first few months I had light spotting, light enough that a panty liner a day was enough, and I was okay with that. In February the spotting stopped all together and I thought I had finally seen the light until it everything started up again a few weeks later. I thought maybe it was just a period but it's been going on pretty much non stop since March, and it's gotten heavier recently.

Now I'm looking for anyone who has had a somewhat similar experience, and asking what did you do? Did you have it removed? Did you switch to a different BC? I've also heard of women taking a daily pill to get periods under control, but that kinda defeats the purpose of why I got Nexplanon in the first place. I'm almost 20 and I have a history of being bad at remembering to take medications daily. 

Even before I got Nexplanon, I had awful periods. They lasted two weeks, were irregular, and very heavy. Am I just doomed to shitty periods forever? I know Nexplanon affects everyone differently but I just need some hope.",10,20140510111944,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_258cr7,A historical example of propaganda techniques and mass emotional manipulation of women,"In 1929, a bunch of women marched down the Easter Sunday parade in New York, proudly holding cigarettes. This was heralded as a success of the feminist movement achieving their equalility with men by smoking in public.

But, there was propaganda and emotional manipulation of women going on in the background. The movement was called **Torches of freedom**.

Quoting from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom):

""Before the twentieth century, smoking was seen as a habit that was corrupt and inappropriate for women. [...] Women’s smoking was seen as immoral and some states tried to prevent women from smoking by enforcing laws. [...]""


""Cigarette companies began selectively advertising to women in the late 1920s. In 1928 [George Washington Hill](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Hill) the president of the American Tobacco Company, realized the potential market that could be found in women and said, “It will be like opening a gold mine right in our front yard.” [...]


""To expand the number of women smokers Hill decided to hire [Edward Bernays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays/), who today is known as the father of public relations, to help him recruit women smokers. Bernays decided to attempt to eliminate the social taboo of women smoking in public. He gained advice from psychoanalyst A. A. Brill stated that it was normal for women to smoke because of oral fixation and said, “Today the emancipation of women has suppressed many of their feminine desires. More women now do the same work as men do. Many women bear no children; those who do bear have fewer children. Feminine traits are masked. Cigarettes, which are equated with men, become torches of freedom.”

""In 1929 Bernays decided to pay women to smoke their “torches of freedom” as they walked in the Easter Sunday Parade in New York. This was a shock because until that time, women were only permitted to smoke in certain places such as in the privacy of their own homes. He was very careful when picking women to march because “while they should be good looking, they should not look too model-y” and he hired his own photographers to make sure that good pictures were taken and then published around the world. Feminist Ruth Hale also called for women to join in the march saying, “Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!” Once the footage was released, the campaign was being talked about everywhere, The women’s walk was seen as a protest for equality and sparked discussion throughout the nation and is still known today. The targeting of women in tobacco advertising led to higher rates of smoking among women. In 1923 women only purchased 5% of cigarettes sold, in 1929 it increased to 12%, in 1935 the percentage of cigarettes purchased by women was 18.1%, this percentage peaked in 1965 at 33.3% and remained at this level until 1977.""

t3_259230,Reminder: Women can grow hair everywhere!,"Whenever I read about body-hair positivity, it's often about women having the choice to not shave the most common parts of the body that grow hair after puberty (armpits, legs, vulva). I'm supportive of these choices, being that I am a hairy girl myself, but what I find is that there is usually a disregard for the other parts of the body that can, and do, grow hair. This has made it difficult for me to feel that I can fully relate to this type of support.

My mother is Russian and my dad is Syrian, which means that my dark hair contrasts greatly with my white skin. I’ve been insecure about how I look underneath clothes, because I’d always felt that my body was deceitful. It gives off one impression when I’m clothed, but once my shirt comes off, I thought I became significantly less attractive. It's always seemed that even if someone understands that there are women who do not shave their legs/armpits/vulva, they would still not expect there to be hair anywhere else. This has prevented me from trying to get intimate with others, because I've felt that no one would be able to look past my hair.

For those of you who may have light or unnoticeable body hair, ""dealing"" with body hair everywhere is not as easy as it sounds. I will use myself as an example.

Think about it like this: I have hair literally everywhere on my body. Obviously, some places are darker than others, but if you name a part of my external body, there is hair there, and it is usually at least noticeable. Let's say I were to start off with getting all the hair on my back removed. Gone forever. And it probably looks and feels nice. What about the rest of my body, though? Now there are clear separations between my hairy and hairless body parts. It would kind of look like if you shaved half of your stomach. It would look dumb and weirder than having a hairy stomach. You either shave the whole thing or leave it hairy. I'm choosing to leave it hairy, because my skin gets terrible when I shave, but also because I am very lazy haha.

I’ve been learning to accept my body in its natural state, and accept that there are people who can like this body, but whenever I look online, I still have trouble finding hardcore body-hair positive posts. In fact, I really don't think I've read a single one. I've posted NSFW images of myself, and more often than not, there are people who are surprised that I have hair in the places that I do. This saddens me, and I hope to remind people that hair grows on every part of the body, not just the ones most commonly spoken about!

I mostly wanted to write this to show my support to women with hair that is noticeable on every part of their bodies, because when I was younger, I didn’t have anyone tell me that I can still be attractive and hairy, and so I didn't think I could be. Every girl or woman with the same situation I have had should know that she is still beautiful, and she that shouldn’t let body hair hold her back from being confident! I really, really do hope this helps some ladies feel more comfortable, body hair or not!

t3_258ul4,[Rant] Sex Ed,"I'm taking a required health class in my school  and I'm fairly distraught. I know I'm only sixteen, but I feel strongly about this. 

We've had three guest speakers come in to class so far this semester. Every single one of them preached the same thing, abstinence. We have never once gone over birth control or safe sex with our teachers or speakers in my high school career. This most recent speaker irked me the most. 

She told us that if a teenage girl has sex, that she will probably get cervical cancer. Most of them do, according to her. Condoms aren't effective, and they don't protect anyone from STDs or pregnancy at all. (I understand that they're not 100% effective, and nothing really is. But they're not useless.) They ""trick"" you into thinking you're safe. She didn't acknowledge oral BC or any other contraceptives. 

According to her, people that have sex before marriage are generally ""users and losers."" Essentially, if premarital sex makes you a bad person. If you marry a non-virgin, they will likely have an STD, which can (and likely will) kill you and your baby you'll be popping out soon. 

Having sex with more than one person makes you unable to love somebody. You lose the ability to love someone. It's compared to duct tape, you ""lose your adhesive."" She ripped duct tape off of a student's arm to demonstrate.

Sunday, we were shopping, and on Friday, we accepted there was no longer a sentient being inside her body, and took her off lifesupport.  in between, she lay in a bed in the ICU with a tube down her throat, so we never really got to ""say goodbye"".

When you lose your mother as a child, what everyone is concerned with is the remainder of your childhood, and the missed milestones: graduation, wedding, having children of your own, and the like.  But, now that I have been motherless nearly half my life, I realize that those things were not actually the biggest tragedy.  Yes, I wish my mom would've been there to support me through my first finals, and sit in the front row at orchestra concerts, and help me pick a college.  Yes, I missed her when I got married, and wish she could have met my husband.  Now, though, my perspective has helped me realize:  The bigger tragedies are the disconnect from my origins, and the fact I will never really know her.

I feel like I am missing so much context for my childhood, and there is no one to tell me the stories.  I don't know when I took my first steps, or what the circumstances were.  I never thought to ask when she was alive, and my dad doesn't know.  There is a picture of me as a toddler, dressed as a clown, standing full-on to the camera, grinning widely.  In the background, on her knees, is my mother with her forehead in her hands, and a huge exasperated smile on her face.  I want to know more about this picture.  Was it halloween? What had I done to cause her to look like that?  There are so many questions about my own past and my family's that I can no longer get answers to.

I will never know her as a fully-realized person: only as a mother, and through the lens of beatification accorded to the dead.  I want to know her stories, and what she hoped and wished for outside of her role as a wife and mother.  After she died, we found a box on the top shelf of her closet, filled with clippings of pictures and stories of ""someday"" dreams -- a super-modern house (in contrast to the rambly old house I grew up in), travels to exotic locations, recipes clipped that my father would *never* have eaten.  And looking through the box, I realized that my mother was a stranger to me -- a list of bullet points of likes: Mystery novels, quilting, baking, chocolate, children.  But that is a caricature, not a portrait of a real person.  I want to know about her own teenage years, and the struggles she went through in her life but that will always be a closed book.  In my dad's eyes, she is perfect; they had a perfect marriage.  She was always happy and there were never problems.  I know the reality is more complicated than that, and I wish I could ask her about it.

I did not have my mom to look after me for my few remaining years in the house, and that was sad, but it is over.  I did not have my mom when I graduated, or got married, and that was sad, but those events are over.  But everyday, for the rest of my life, there is an empty space where an adult relationship with her would have been.

t3_2597cc,Big booty and undies. Help!,"Dear TwoX, 

I am in desperate need of help to find underwear that don't get eaten by my large derrière.  I'm pear shape with a small torso(underbust is 30"") and my hips set very low and wide and my booty sticks out like a shelf in the back.  I think I want something like a boxer brief but for the ladies.  I have a few pairs of ""boy shorts"" style undies but they must be to small as they just slide right into a wedgie with 3 steps.  I can find briefs that cover my bum they have saggy fabric in the front from being to large. 


Any suggestions on where to look for full coverage, but still somewhat sexy looking, underwear?  Preferably cotton and not terribly expensive.  I'm in the US so places like Target, Kohls, Sears... Are easy to get to.

t3_258f5k,Labiaplasty experience? Help with healing process? (xpost),"I had labiaplasty 4 days ago and am worried about the healing process. I have a follow up appointment in 3 days.

At the moment I am still quite swollen, both minora and majora, there is very little bleeding, occasionally a small amount after urinating and drying myself, some itchiness but barely any pain. My main concern is what seems to puss seeping from the areas that were trimmed.
Being such a precious area I am not sure if I am over reacting or if this is a sign of infection and that I should get to my surgeon earlier than already booked.
I am also curious as to whether I should be showering yet as some testimonials I have read say that they were showering a day after surgery, whereas others recommend not until 10 days! I showered yesterday but the amount of puss has increased since then.

Honestly, I just need to get this off my chest and it may seem kind of insignificant to even make a post about it. But I just finished my second year of uni, and I don't think that college is or will be my prime/""best time of my life"". 

The odds were against me from the start. I go to college in my hometown and still live at home and will continue to due to financial reasons. There was never that ""Oooo new city, new me"" feeling. Trust me I've made the best of it and tried to make it as new and exciting as humanly possible and at times it was. But at the end of the day I look back and go, ""Meh, it wasn't that special"". Granted I have been too many parties so I'm no stranger to social gatherings. I have met some really great people who I think are admirable and entertaining to be around andchill with, but I don't ever feel close enough to them to take the friendship step. I also got burned a lot freshman year by kids using me for my car in exchange for what I thought was friendship. So needless to say I have no ""besties"" male or female. Only glorified acquaintances. 

Before I spiral into self-loathing (because I feel I'm not the norm for your average soon-to-be-junior in college), I should get to the point of this discovery. My prime (I think) will be when I'm out of college and finally doing what I want with my life. College is a means to an end for me really. My ""Oooo new city, new me"" will happen when I book my first tour, movie, or show out of college (I'm an acting major).

Have any of you graduates or recent university students felt/feel the same? I just feel i'm surrounded by facebook posts of people raving about how much they love college and I kinda feel outcasted that I'm not enthused by anything except learning part.

t3_258lno,Continuous period for three weeks on the Minipill - please help!,"Hi TwoX,

I don't know what to do. I have been having the worst period of my life for three weeks. I have contacted both Planned Parenthood and my normal doctor's assistant (my actual primary care provider is unavailable for weeks) and they have both given me vague answers. I've started taking the minipill on my period but this period has lasted for two weeks, bringing the total duration of this period to three weeks. I'm an otherwise healthy 24-year-old female, not underweight or overweight. The longest period I ever had prior to this was seven days long. I haven't had spotting since I was sixteen years old. I have never been pregnant.

I started taking the progestin-only pill when I had a slightly long but not terrible period. I'd been bleeding pretty normally for seven days and my period was, I think, coming to an end when I started on the minipill. I was prescribed this pill at Planned Parenthood. I can't take estrogen-only pills because I am prone to severe and frequent migraines. Implants are also advised against because of the migraines. When I asked about possible side effects of this drug, I was only told that ""you may see some spotting or breakthrough bleeding for the first three months. It's rarely a problem.""

I have been bleeding heavily for the last two weeks. My period has now lasted for 21 days. I am miserable and terrified. I called Planned Parenthood after I had been on my period for ten days because I was already frightened. The woman I spoke to on the phone was dismissive. She again told me that ""some spotting may happen in the first three months."" I asked how long I should expect to be bleeding. She repeated her previous statement.

I went to my primary care provider's office a week ago, when my period had lasted for fourteen days. My usual doctor isn't available, so I saw a doctor I've never seen before. She was more polite but also gave me no clear answer. I asked at what point should I contact her and/or Planned Parenthood again. I told her (as calmly as I could) that I'm scared and in a lot of pain. She gave me the same answer about ""spotting"" and ""breakthrough bleeding"" with no suggestion about when to get back in touch with her.

I'm scared and I feel like I have nowhere to turn for help. I've searched webmd, wikipedia and this sub. The only suggestion I've found is from the NIH (National Institute of Health) that says I should contact my doctor immediately if I have ""bleeding that lasts a long time."" I think that I was bleeding for ""a long time"" a week ago - at this point, I'm past thinking that this is ""bleeding for a long time"" so much as ""bleeding for what I think is an intolerable length of time."" I want to stop taking this pill even though Planned Parenthood told me to ""stick it out for three months if all you see is spotting."" I want to stop taking this because I'm miserable and scared. No one I've talked to addresses my fears. I was refused a pelvic exam even though I asked for one at my doctor's office. Has anyone experienced symptoms like this on the minipill? Has anyone stopped birth control abruptly and if so, was it as bad at Planned Parenthood made it sound? If anyone here has medical experience, will I put myself in more danger if I stop this pill right now? 

I'm sorry for posting another birth control question on this sub; I know you see a lot of them. I've read through the latest posts and searched for related cases but haven't been able to find anything. I feel like if I contact my doctors again they will continue to be dismissive and I'm in a lot of pain, frightened and alone. This isn't related to my medical problem, but my SO (the reason I started taking this awful drug) has stopped talking to me. I don't know why he's ignoring me but he did say that he thinks I'm lying about how long this period has lasted. My best guess is that he thinks I'm cheating on him but hiding behind a fake period. I have never cheated on him or anyone else. I hate this pill and what it is doing to my life.

TL;DR - Took minipill at the end of a seven-day period. Was told about ""spotting"" and ""breakthrough bleeding"" but never warned about the possibility of a continuous period that lasts for multiple weeks. I am having the worst period of my life and it has now lasted for 21 days. Doctors won't answer me. I'm scared and want to stop.",5,20140510172554,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_259xof,I have no friends here... I'm lonely.,"Hello TwoX,

This probably isn't the best place to make this post, but I would like some advice. I'm sorry if this is long!

I'm a woman in my mid twenties. I moved to another state about 4 years ago now, and I have no friends here. Not even male ones. I've always had some difficulty making female friends. It's cliche, but guys were just easier, with the exception that most of them want(ed) to get in my pants.

I do have some close relationships, but they're all long distance now. Only one of them is a woman.

I know everyone says to pick up a hobby or something, well I would love to but I cannot afford it at this moment. I am in the process of finding a new job (I really hate not having a job). This is a stress in my relationship with my boyfriend. He says I'm not interested in making friends, which isn't true! (Also, I find that hypocritical because its not like he's some social butterfly) So he feels like he has to be with me all the time, which I've tried to tell him I don't need him around all the time. I really don't. It's nice when hes here since he is my only ""real"" human contact, but I grew up in a solitary environment, I'm used to it. He just doesn't believe me.

There were two women I was trying to cultivate friends with, I thought I had succeeded, except now one of them doesn't respond to me (we used to have game nights as couples) and I don't have a clue why. The other... some stupid drama over not returning a game my boyfriend and I let her borrow. Besides that, she's too wrapped up in the rest of her life, which I understand.

I am lonely though. I want to be able to get out of the house and have fun with some people too. I find it hard to connect with many women my age, because they all seemed concerned with engagement/marriage/babies. I know not ALL women are like that of course (I have no interest in children as an example) but it just makes it so hard to connect with them, because those are major life transitions that we couldn't bond over.

Has anyone had similar problems? Is there any advice other than ""get an outside hobby!"" Believe me, I'm not a shut in by choice. Funds and lack of people is mainly why I am always home. I like to go walk in the park, and I go work out but these aren't really activities to find friends with, unfortunately.

Any advice would be appreciated!",33,20140511072642,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_259eup,"""It wasn't your fault, but you could have prevented it.""","Hey there TwoX. I need some advice. I'm tired of talking about this in person to anyone - strangers on the internet seems so much more appealing to me as I am worn the fuck out from social interaction. 

I was raped in October. I went to a friend's house, and he had sex with me against my will, knowing that I didn't want to. This really fucked me up. I'd only been with my boyfriend before that - I'd given him my virginity when I started to rebel against my conservative upbringing and we just happened to stay together. Suddenly, I wanted to have sex with a million people. I wanted to have a choice. I wanted to be free from God, from my boyfriend, from anyone telling me ""No you can't have sex"" and I wanted a choice because I had had my choice taken from me that night. 

So I asked my boyfriend for a threesome, for a girlfriend. He said no. I showed up at the peak of my mental ill health with sliced up wrists and said it was eating me alive. He said something ambiguous. I took it as permission. I had sex with someone else. 

Later, I realized he had not given me permission. Well fuck. This tore me up, too. 

He ended up finding out. He said I was lucky that he didn't leave me. That I was naive for going over to my friend's in October, and if I hadn' t been there, I would never have been raped. That it wasn't my fault, but at the same time, it was. That I could have prevented it. That it was hard to support me, because he had a hard time looking at me the same. Etc. Etc. Also, I had had sex with him a week after the incident - it was his birthday, I felt like I should, - and afterwards, he said I was cold and emotionless. He said sorry later, but that still bothers me. 

I feel pretty unhappy. There is truth to his statement. DUH. Of course had I not been present, I wouldn't have been raped. But..... But..... I don't know. I feel like these ideas are.... Bad. I don't want to break up with him, but I don't know if these are healthy ideas. If they are good. 

They hurt me.

t3_259np3,I don't know if I was raped or not (Trigger Warning),"A couple days ago, I had a nightmare about my ex-boyfriend trying to rape me. It was terrifying and in the dream, I was screaming for him to get out of my room and leave me alone. This made me reflect on our relationship and realize how unhealthy it was, and how towards the end, something that happened could or could not be classified as rape.

Even the first night that we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, he tried to initiate sex with me and when he was trying to make out with me, I kept pushing him off but he still kept trying to kiss me. He eventually started taking my pants off and going down on me but it was so awful and uncomfortable that I told him to stop. He did and I started crying, he said he was sorry.

I used to wake up to him feeling my breasts while I was asleep and feel really violated by the fact that he was touching me without my consent, because I was sleeping. But I never said anything. He also used to jack off in bed while watching porn on his phone while I was sleeping. Technically not a violation of my body, but just something that made me uncomfortable.

He was always groping my breasts and butt in public when nobody was looking. I told him to stop, but he never took it seriously. I honestly didn't know what to do or say because I felt like if I complained about it, people would probably just say, ""Well, you're his girlfriend..."" but I still felt violated.

We broke up because he yelled and screamed at me for the fact that we hadn't had sex after being boyfriend and girlfriend for two months. The way that he was acting me was really scary, the way he was yelling at me. He also started yelling at me and saying that we wouldn't have this problem if I wasn't so awful at blowjobs. I dumped him after that. He begged me for me to take him back, said he would change. I believed him and took him back. 

 We started having sex after we got back together. One day, he was on top of me and doing it from behind. I was bored and not into it so after maybe about 15 minutes, I tell him to stop and that I don't want to do it anymore.

He stops and gets off of me. He starts jacking off and I try to help him by jerking him off, as well. Then after about five minutes, he said, ""Turn around."" I didn't know why he wanted me to turn around but I did it. and he started penetrating me for a couple of minutes before he came inside me. I froze because I didn't even know what to do or say. 

I said, ""I told you I didn't want to do it..."" and he said, ""Whoa...I'm sorry..."" I just ran out of the room and went to sleep because I wanted to pretend like it didn't happen. 

I'm really inclined to say that I wasn't raped because one, I literally hadn't even remembered that this happened and also, I technically had consented at first. But this whole experience just doesn't sit right with me. Truthfully, it felt as if our whole relationship, I was just a sex object to him. 

I don't know what to do. Maybe I was raped and just have blocked it out of my head because I didn't want to think about it. Maybe I'm exaggerating the situation. I talked to my best friend about it, she's the only person who knows. She gave me what I think is pretty good advice which is that I have to decide for myself what I think happened and then proceed on how to deal with it. 

I guess that's true. I just feel really awful and confused.

It's like she knew she wouldn't be here to tell me the stories.","When my mom passed away, everything was chaos.  My parents had divorced, so it was just she and I.  One school morning, I woke up, and I went to wake her up and she was gone.  She died the night before of a heart attack, at the age of 38.  Everything after that was a blur of funerals, custody discussions, and moving.  In the move, a lot of my mother's things and my things were lost or misplaced.  This past Fall, I was cleaning out some boxes, and found my baby book.  It was one of the best days of my life.  My mother had written down the story of her pregnancy and my birth.  It was as if she knew she wouldn't be here to tell me the story.  I just wish I remembered what she sounded like, so that I could hear it in her voice.  

Upon hearing my heartbeat for the first time:  ""I believe that moment was the single most exciting in my life.  All of a sudden you were very real.""

My dad ""helping"" during labor:  ""They hooked me me up to the fetal monitor so they could graph out the contractions and monitor your heartbeat. Dad sat beside me holding my hand and giving me a play-by-play on my labor pains.  The stronger a contraction was the higher the reading.  He would say, 'That was only a 28, it couldn't have hurt too badly.  That was a 42!  You probably felt that one!'""

When I wouldn't cooperate: ""Doctors arrived and it was decided that an ultrasound was in order.  That was the first time I saw you!  I was so thrilled, I didn't even notice the look of concern on the doctor's faces.  The doctor explained the situation.  You were in a foot down breech position which would be a difficult and dangerous delivery.  This was the first time I felt scared during the entire morning, and looking at Dad I could tell he was too.""

On my birth:  ""You arrived at 12:57pm.  A beautiful and healthy GIRL!""

I miss my mother every day.  On my wedding day, it was particularly hard, but it really is every day.  On this Mother's Day, I wanted to share my story, and maybe connect with other women for whom mother's day is also bittersweet.

I have been dealing with the trauma of this event for the past two years. I filed a police report and nothing happened. I have decided to speak out about this because I am still suffering, and have had no closure. I still have triggers, I still have problems with sex. This is my story. This is my closure. Hopefully I have posted in the right place...

This guy sat down and was talking to my friend and me at a party. Eventually we left for the club. Originally, a bunch of people were going to go, but that didn’t happen. Several minors came to the party and they divided the group, so it was just me, the guy, and my friend going to the club. I didn’t suspect anything at the time, because I was under the impression that my friend and he were good friends. We arrived, and went over to a couch while he went to get us drinks. We were talking for a bit and I drank my drink, and then went to the dance floor. He was dancing up on me a lot. I don't know how long we were dancing for... I realized that I had been falling over almost, and that he was holding me up. I couldn't even walk without his support for a while. It felt like it had been a long time. Some more time passed and we went down the stairs to go back to the car...I barely remember getting in the car. Time went quick. We went back to the guys’ apartment again for a while. I remember looking in the mirror in their bathroom...walking to a bedroom. I fell asleep or passed out on the bed for a little while. I feel like I must have been drugged because I have NEVER been that inebriated and disabled from alcohol. I was slurring something and woke up with him there at my side. My friend came in and said we were going. He followed..I wondered why, but assumed he was just catching a ride to his home. He said something about needing to be in another town that morning for work and that it would be more convenient to catch a ride at night than to leave and get there from the party location the next morning. My logic and thinking was incredibly cloudy. The ride back to my friend’s apartment was a complete blur. I remember him kissing me at certain points. My friend was assuming this was all normal. Somehow we were then in the apartment parking lot and he was still there. This confused me and I felt upset and wierded out from it. Unfortunately, I had trusted all along that since he was a friend of a friend, there was no threat. Then we were in the apartment living room and he was going to sleep on the couch in the living room. I planned to sleep with my friend in her bedroom. I vaguely thought I'd say goodnight before heading to sleep with my friend. He kissed me, and I told him we were not going to have sex. I still felt really out of it, and just wanted to make it a quick goodnight and then go to my friend’s room. The whole time I was questioning why he was staying at our apartment in the first place. The next thing I know, he was down there, pulling off my pants, then going down on me and thrusting his fingers in me, asking me if I liked it.  I was completely out of it. Then my pants were off completely and he had taken his penis out and put my hand on it. I don’t know if I put my mouth on him or not. I remember him being on the couch at one point, and me being kneeled there beside him. I would suddenly and realize his penis was about to go inside me. I'd grab him and push him away. He would grab the base of his dick and pull his penis away from my hand, then move his penis down again pushing my hands away, as he was trying to penetrate. I said, “No, I don’t want to. I don’t want to have sex,” but I was so out of it, and struggling to do anything. Suddenly, I had felt the head of his penis touch the opening of my vagina, starting to penetrate. I grabbed his penis quickly, keeping his penis from penetrating or touching me again. I would realize I was successfully escaping from everything, pulling my pants back on and putting my socks on even. Quicker still, he would pull them all off again and I would be putting his mouth on me or his hands inside me. He asked me to call him Papi. I felt so disgusted but I couldn’t even move. After so many times of him trying, he finally started to give up, complaining about how I had lead him on, and I how I was a tease. I had been fighting him off the whole time while barely conscious! He was very persistent. I remember falling asleep just barely on the couch, thinking it might be over. He would pull my arm, pull me off the couch all together, or pull at my legs, begging me to sleep or snuggle with him. I kept fighting him off. I realized I’d been trying to fight him off for a few hours. Finally he slept and the snoring kept me up. In the morning I had a sinking feeling. My friend slept in, and he kept sleeping too. When he woke up, I wanted him to leave but he kept making stupid excuses for why he couldn’t leave yet. My friend finally woke up, and we got him to leave.

I worked with this guy ""Brad"" on a project as a peer. Two years later, I was a Co-Producer on a show and needed to hire an Associate Producer for just a month. Frankly, he was terrible and I was blamed for his sloppy work. I felt weird reprimanding him (which is a whole other issue). I had hired him because after we originally worked together he was hired onto a great show, making insane money.


A few months later, I ask for his resume to forward on to something he would be good at. I was so shocked to see
how he described his work on my show. He took credit for way more than he did! And he used such strong language to describe his roles. Where I would have said ""assisted the production team"", he wrote ""produced"". I felt like a fool for years of not writing strong language in my resume where less deserving people like Brad were out there getting calls for great jobs because...I mean even though I was his boss and worked on this for two years, the way he wrote his resume, he was the clear better hire.


I cant blame him because hes just doing his best to get work but damn if that isnt frustrating.

t3_25aeo6,Harassed on the elevator and not sure what to do,"Hi everyone,

I live in a pretty nice condo building that's close by to a school. A lot of Saudi students live here as well. I've noticed a lot of them being obnoxious/rowdy like typical college students before, but it's usually pretty tame. The exception is that one of this group had been arrested a few months back for raping a female student at the university they all attend. 

Yesterday I was waiting to go downstairs when the elevator showed up, with 8 or 9 Saudi guys in their twenties on it. At first, no one would move to let me on, until finally one of them did while the rest snickered and chattered in Arabic. Eventually one of them started trying to talk to me in English and when we got off the elevator began following me out asking me if I'd ever thought about what it'd be like to be with 8 arab men while his friends laughed and egged him on. I mumbled whatever and walked away and that was the end of it.

I get that this isn't a huge deal and it definitely isn't something that should bother me this much, but now I'm really anxious about running into them again in the building and even more stressed that it will be when I'm with my husband who was ready to go looking for them yesterday. I feel like I should at least tell the building management about this in case they've bothered other people. I'm not sure why I feel like I'm making a bigger deal of this than it really needs to be. I've had other guys do similar things, but for some reason this felt really predatory and all the previous times were when I was in a public place I could get away from. 

TL;DR: A guy made some creepy comments to me while he and his friends laughed about it. I live in the same building with them and I'm not sure what to do to deal with the possibility of running into them again.",34,20140511114335,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25ak2h,Relinquishing parental rights. Should I pursue it?,"My husband and I divorced right after our daughter's 2nd birthday. She's about to turn 5 in July. She loves her dad. In the near three years he and I have been apart, I would say he has spent a cumulative total of about a solid 10 days of time with her. We live in the same city, I have told him multiple times I would take her to see him any time he wished. 

I've received a total of 120$ in child support from him in the last (almost) three years. Half the time when he is watching her, I will get a call and have to leave work or school to go get her because ""He doesn't want to deal with her anymore."" He did this again yesterday and I snapped and went off on him (Not in front of our kid, I never talk crap about him around her). He basically told me, not exaggerating, ""You should just marry your boyfriend and have him adopt her if you think I'm such a bad dad."" I asked him (because I was curious and shocked) ""Are you saying you would relinquish your parental rights?"" and he said ""Yep.""

My ex husband is not dangerous, he's just lazy. He's expressed to me several times about how sometimes he just wants to be done with ""all of this."" Still, he won't actively try and relinquish his rights, he was just saying that if I perused it, he would not stop me. 

I'm getting a lot of conflicting advice from a lot of people. I don't want to be the reason my daughter doesn't know her dad. I also don't want him to keep jerking her around and hurting her. If he did give up his rights, she would miss him very much for some time, but eventually, she might start healing. Right now, when he keeps ducking in and out of her life, he re-opens those wounds and she has to start healing all over. At the same time, I don't want her to harbor resentment for me because I took her away from him. 

I honestly don't know what to do. Any of you had a similar situation? Any of you grow up not knowing your dad? Any of you grow up knowing your dad and wish you had not? ",23,20140511124453,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I'm hoping it's just perfect and she has it on mother's day baby today (even if mother's day is on different days each year...)

Then she asked ""What do you mean, good luck?"" And I, caught off guard, responded ""You know... that the baby is healthy and you don't die in childbirth or anything...""

I'm hoping you can help me win my side of an ongoing disagreement I'm having with my boyfriend. Namely, my boyfriend thinks that if you feel like you have to pee, you should go immediately. He gets annoyed because he says me and previous girlfriends he's had always say they have to pee but then don't go.

First of all, what do you think? Is this a thing? Do women often wait instead of going to the bathroom immediately? And secondly, my theory is that women have to pee more than men, (because we have smaller bladders maybe??) and so to prevent spending *way* too much time on the toilet, we just hold it more often. Does this seem true?

I just want to let my boyfriend know that it's OK if I don't rush to the toilet every time I have the slightest sensation of a partially full bladder.

t3_25algi,"2 months of Pain, possible Endometriosis, Cysts, weird Periods and 4 Gynos...","First off, I just married last year and I wish to have children if possible soon. Also I moved from Germany to the Caribbean last year.
I do have some diseases, like Absence Epilepsy, Asthma, Allergies, Tremors, Hypothyroid and have had Meningitis when i was 5 years old. I do take medication for those, though I don't take anything for my Epilepsy anymore since 3 years.
So I'm already not in a very good shape I'd say, I know that and I'm already trying everything to get better in any possible way I could.

So all this started I guess a few months back, beginning of January I didn't have my period anymore and I was a bit freaked out by it.
The months before that were already weird, as in only spotting and no real period. I do take the pill though and i knew that those things could happen from time to time.
Though, a bit more than 2 months ago I had a sharp pain on my right lower abdomen and it increased over 2 days. 
So I decided to go to a gynecologist right away.
The doctor used ultrasound to check and said the only problem she sees is that the bladder seems always full and I'd need antibiotics for a bladder infection. 
As soon as I took the antibiotics it got very bad, I couldn't even get up anymore from the bed or chair and the pain seemed to increase from day to day. After one week it got tiny bit better for a day or two. 
Then I had my period, which was unbearable and I didn't see much blood, but instead there was a lot of brown stringy stuff coming out. Right after my period it got better again and the whole pain started back with my ovulation, where the brown stuff came back with the sharp dull pain. 

I decided another visit by another gyno would be a good decision. Since the ""bladder infection"" never felt like one, there was never any burning when I had to pee. All it was, was that I had to pee all the time and whenever I used the bladder every organ around it hurt like a bitch.

So the next gyno checked also with ultrasound, he told me the right Fallopian-Tube was full with tissue, which might be scars and it's very swollen. So he said it's PID and gave me 2 very aggressive antibiotics for 10 days. So it was another 2 weeks of no energy and a lot of pain. Then my period was gonna happen again. I had cramps and pain and nearly fainted sometimes from it. The blood wasn't there again, but even more stringy brown stuff. Right after my period it got much better again, though the pain stayed. Another week of antibiotics followed. Which was my 4th and 5th antibiotics in 2 months now. I didn't help.

Another gyno I went to, said it's only stress and he didn't check on anything. Sooo 4th gyno after 2 month, she checked and said there's absolutely no swelling, not tissues and only 2 cysts on my right ovary. Though, those cysts weren't there just a few weeks ago. And I also couldn't see any empty and normal Fallopian-Tube on the screen like she told me. I felt the swelling and the pain just like the whole time. Both of them said it could be Endometriosis, though they aren't sure at all and it would only be visible if a surgeon used laparoscopy. 

After all this, I decided to go back to Germany in a week or two, to finally have a real result of all this. I can't take this pain, the waiting on a final result and depression I get from this. So my questions here are, does this sound familiar in any way to you? or do you think it's something completley different? What would you do in my position?

Basically what it says in the title - I find myself getting moderate to severe cramps that are literally exactly like period cramps - same place, same sensation etc - but regardless of where I am in my cycle.  This usually happens when I'm doing cardio in an upright position (e.g. running/on an elliptical), not so much if I'm cycling or doing weights-y stuff.  They can be REALLY bad.  A few times I've had to stop and sit/crouch down and just wait for them to subside before I can physically do anything.  However they always go away after about 10 minutes and then I feel right as rain again.

I have no idea how common this is, I've told both my closest female friends and they have never experienced it. I also don't know if its anything to be concerned about.  Interestingly, I came off the pill a few months ago and I feel like its been a more prevalent problem since then, although I've definitely experienced it when I've been on it as well.

Any advice/wisdom/shared experiences would be awesome!  If it sounds like something I should see a doctor about that would be cool to know (I'm only not doing it already as the wait times for an appointment are RIDICULOUS right now and the drop-in clinics are always rushed).

You can read the whole story [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/21r7sp/how_to_tell_someone_you_have_no_dating_experience/) He was pretty awesome about it. Last night, we hung out with two mutual friends at their house and I realized that he never tries to touch me or even invade my personal space. I make an effort to do those things to show I'm interested in him, even though I'm not sure what the hell I'm doing.

At the end of the night we walk outside and he says we had set a precedent to kiss at the end of dates (he was just joking). I was kind of taken off guard though because he seemed so uninterested earlier. I'm also unused to kissing people and find it very awkward. At our last date I used a bet with my sister as impetus to kiss him. As in I told him ""hey come here and help me win a bet."" He didn't respond to that so I figured he hadn't heard me. But of course he brought it up last night. And I felt kind of like an asshole. I'm not in lust with this boy (I'm not sure if it's because that's all out of my realm of experience or what), but I do like him.

There have been days I had to leave work from back pain. I've gotten check ups, exams, ultrasounds etc. Every time I try to explain my concern/symptoms- I kinda feel like I get blown off.

To start off, I'll tell you now that is about sex.  I've always been pretty cautious about sex, because I have been assaulted in the past, several times.  I finally found a man that I can feel comfortable with, and it's amazing and everything is great.  I've also had a few abusive relationships, and this relationship is nothing like those at all, ever.  He's so sweet and kind and works with me when I have flashbacks and nightmares.  We want to get married in the next few years.  Everything is great.  

A few months ago, we bought a vibrator to use together, just to shake it up a little bit.  It's been great, again, but then something happened about a week ago.

We went to a sex shop, and I bought another vibrator.  He bought a pocket pussy.  That's the part I feel uncomfortable about.  I know I shouldn't be uncomfortable about him using a toy when I have my own, but I am.  I told him this and he said that it didn't matter, and that I was being rediculous.

I feel like I am being stupid, but I just..  If he ever said that he felt uncomfortable with me using a vibrator, I would get rid of it right away.  But when I say that I feel like that, it's just nothing.  It's giving me horrible anxiety just thinking about it, too.  Like, panic attack level.  I just feel like my words and my opinion doesn't matter, just like I felt when I was in a past abusive relationship.

What can I do?  Do I just suck it up and drop it?  Am I really being rediculous or stupid?... Please help me, ladies, I feel like I'm going nuts! :(

edit:

t3_25bsaw,It was never suppose to end like this....,"Last Saturday my husband committed suicide.  He was 32 years old.  I am completely lost.  He was my whole life and we had been together since I was 18 years old.  I feel like my life has been taken from me in an instant.

I am not sure why I am writing this, I just so lost and confused right now.  Anyone else know how to pick up the pieces of a shattered life and try to move on?

EDIT:  Thank you everyone for sharing stories and understanding, as well as the suggestions for help and moving on.  I never expected this to get this much attention.  To give a little more information, my husband had struggled with depression and anxiety for most of his life.  He was taking medication for both as well as seeing a counselor.  But, he did not do this because of the depression.  He was on some kind of drugs at the time (uncertain at this time exactly what), but he was not himself when I got home that evening, he talked like he was in a different world all together.  I called his parents to our house for help in getting him to the hospital.  My mom also came to help.  We called 911, but when they got there they were not very understanding and unsure of what we wanted their help with, so I told them, he is not himself, he needs to see a doctor.  Finally, he said that he would come with the paramedics, so we all walked out of the bedroom (me, two paramedics, and a cop) when he slammed the bedroom door and shot himself.

Many of you are suggesting therapy, being with friends and family and luckily I have a very large family support network around me.  I have been staying with my parents and seeing a therapist.  I appreciate all of the stories and support, its very helpful.",1209,20140511212025,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I took on some extra responsibilities at work some time ago, but had been working part-time hours as I had other commitments. Long story short, things got too much and burning the candle at both ends left me exhausted. 

One morning my boss came into my office to talk about my performance. I just lost it and started sobbing, saying I was struggling to keep up. He offered me a significant raise to accept more hours and I was so shocked I couldn't say anything for a moment. I literally sat with tears running down my face, when he increased the offer yet again. I regain composure, thanked my boss. Told him I'd consider the offer, and accepted the next day.

He's very supportive and it wasn't a big deal. I'm not really embarrassed, but part of me realizes this is not usually how salary negotiations take place, and I feel like my emotions betrayed my gender's reputation in a way (the other part is like Zing!

t3_25bh36,"First time posting here- since it's Mother's Day, I wanted to share a short piece I wrote about how my mother and I were finally able to understand each other before she died.","My mother had delicate wrists, something you would never know by that audacious signature of hers. God only knows how many school demerits and failed tests of mine she was forced to put that same signature on or how many times I tried to forge it.

She was, by no means, meek or shy, but the filigree of her finely-wrought frame, genteel demeanor, and her angelic soprano voice were a stark contrast to the clumsy, booming impenitence of her younger daughter. Especially when I was little, people never quite believed we were related, and, as I grew rougher around the edges and endlessly stubborn, it also became very hard for us to see eye to eye, especially about my desire to become a musician.

She was a braver woman than I could really understand when I was a teen. She looked death in the face with tireless compassion during her days as a hospice nurse. She studied forensics and law ravenously and became a PI to help protect those in danger and right the wrongs of the world around her in the best way she could. Even at that age, I couldn't help but think she deserved her name to be carved into the face of the earth, that her soft voice and her dainty wrists couldn't do her own story justice.

The last time I saw her, I was 18 years old. She had never heard any song I'd written before and she was perched upright on a terrible foraged sofa in my dilapidated shack, with impeccable posture, a glass of red wine, and a look on her face that read, ""Allll right, Lily. Let's see what it is, exactly, you've thrown your college education away for.""

I played her a song, a song about how I wished people would stop trying to ""fix"" me. I was so terrified, I could barely bring myself to look at her while I ham-fistedly beat out my very primitive rhythms and wailed in a tone I knew she'd never heard from me before. When I finally looked to her, I saw her posture had broken and her eyes were full of tears. 

She came to me and said, ""there *is* nothing to fix."" She said that, this time, she truly heard my voice and finally understood why I had never quite fit into the life she saw for me. She said that she knew, then, the life she wanted for *herself* was one in which she got to hear me sing, just like that, always, in a way she never could.

It was was through her acceptance, and her devastating passing, I realized how wrong I had been about her. Her voice, while different than mine, held a magic I could only hope to, one day, attain. Her story never *was* in danger of being lost. Her charm, her grace, her unstoppable wit, and her flare for performance had never even left *this* realm or all the lives of the people she had changed and helped, even in the next.

Rosalind Nelson Jewett, I am the flicks of your hand in your cutthroat capital R's, the sharp peaks of your curling O's, the conviction in your lowercase D's, the flourish and triumph you used every time you struck through those final two T's, blooming from the tip of your pen, streaming from your delicate wrists, onto all of the detention slips you had to sign.

You were the most beautiful woman I ever knew, in every way possible, and you loved me for who I really was. I promise I will spend the rest of my life forging your signature, this time, out of steel, for all the world to see.


Thank you to anyone who read this. It means the world to me. Happy Mother's Day to you all.",7,20140511190800,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25c14l,Prom Drama: Advice Please?,"This is actually my first post onto reddit. Long time lurker, first time poster.

Anyway, last night was my school prom. I go to a small school with roughly 50 per grade. The only after party that was being held involved lots of alcohol and drugs, which neither my friends of mine or me felt like dealing with. So I asked my parents if I could have a small one at my house. Just me, my boyfriend, my best friend, her boyfriend, and a good friend. 

We go to my place after prom. We decide to watch Frozen. We began watching and my boyfriend, single friend, I are so tired that we fall asleep within 20 minutes of the movie beginning. At the end of the movie, I wake up and my best friend and her boyfriend are gone. So I begin wandering around looking for them. 


They are in MY bedroom making out on MY bed. 



Now, this upset me for multiple reasons. 
1) My parents and in the next room, along with my brother, and roommate across the hall. 
2) Both of them knew that boys are not allowed upstairs. I made this very clear to them before. 
3) My parents trusted me to have friends over without supervision. This betrays the trust of them and could cause them to say no more friends over without constant adult supervision. My father is strict and I would not put that past him. 
4) She and I have been on thin ice lately because she told her friends everything sexually that my boyfriend and I had done, which made me really upset.
5) She constantly does things that hurt me and uses the excuse ""I forgot"" or ""I didn't think about it""

So I walk in and they pretend nothing happened. I tell her boyfriend to go downstairs because it's against the rules. He does. Once he leave, I help my best friend get her makeup and hair products together. Here's out direct dialogue:

""You can't bring boys up into my room, while I'm asleep, and make out with them. My parents would be upset and it's not okay.""
""Yeah, sorry. I didn't think about it. He was helping me get my things together. We were only up here for a minute.(Nothing was cleaned. Clothes and products were everywhere still)
""Still...my parents aren't okay with boys upstairs.""
""Okay, but you know when there's just so much sexual tension? There just needed to be a release of it"" (I'm not kidding, she said this)

I was too tired to argue. Everyone leaves soon and I sleep. The next morning, my mom comes in and asked me what happened last night. She heard rustling in my room. I didn't want to lie to her. I tell her exactly what happened and she was very angry. She decided that she would call her parents later because it's obvious that my friend has no respect for rules. My relationship with my father is rocky as it is, and when he asked me, I didn't want to make it worse by lying.

So here I am, upset and confused. She hurts me a lot, and what she did hurt me. She doesn't realize that her actions affect others. She made me choose between telling my parents that truth and risk my privlege of unsupervision taken away, or to lie and have them possibly find out later and make me feel bad for lying. Plus, how can I trust that she hadn't been there for much longer than she said? Everyone was asleep and she's proven that I can't trust her anyway by her telling people my personal information. Also, she tells me that it makes her uncomfortable when my boyfriend kisses me on the cheek and tries to cuddle with me when we are in my home, but I'm supposed to be okay with her sneaking into my bedroom, bringing a boy who I don't know super well with her, and making out with him on my bed?

She's a close friend, but I can't handle her betraying me anymore. She's had second chances and she's blown all of them. I feel like she doesn't give anything to the friendship when I've been giving 100% to make things better. I'm so torn on what to do and I could really use some advice. Sorry for the wall of text also....

I went straight home after the event. When I got home I wanted to just hug him, kiss him, and be with him because I really missed him. He was not as excited. I don't know what happened, but i told him i missed him a lot. he blocked my hands from hugging him and he started saying that if I missed him so much then why didn't I come straight home to see him, why did I go to the event? I started telling him how I felt like I needed to support someone and how it was part of my job. There was no obligation for me to go, but I wanted to support someone there. Anyway he started saying how I was lying, that I said I could blow it off and now I was saying that it was an obligation! I don't like arguing over things that get you nowhere. So I stopped trying to argue. Eventually I started crying. He asked why I was crying. And I told him that I was eager to come home and be with him and how he does not believe me and I don't know what to do. He didn't reply. He is passive aggressive. This was last night. I slept from about 6pm-8am. This afternoon he started getting ready...and then about 5 minutes before leaving, he asked me if I wanted to go to lunch with his mom. I said no. I feel like every time I see him be so cold with me I cry, so if I go I'm just going to cry. I really just needed to vent and wondering if anyone else has been through a similar scenario? Usually these things blow over and I can't wait for it to blow over because I still just want to hug and kiss him.

t3_25c4qe,Wanted to share an epiphany I had relating to how we police each others bodies and how it probably relates to the fact that so many women and men get raped,"so I was standing at the buss stop the other day and a little boy with his mother was standing next to me.  A girl walked past with curly, bright blue hair.  


THe kid: ""mommy, why is her hair blue?""

Mom: ""because it is.""

kid: ""But WHY? it looks bad""

Mom: ""well she likes it, so she dyed it blue""

kid:  ""but it looks funny!!!""

mom (getting annoyed):  ""so what if it looks funny? She likes it and it's her hair.  She can do whatever she wants to it.  Stop worrying about it.  It doesn't affect your life and it isn't hurting anyone""

Kid: ""why is that person fat?""

mom: ""because he is.  Now stop worrying about that stuff and enjoy the nice sunny spring day.  Doesn't the sun feel nice on your skin mason?""

Kid ""cool!"" (reaches out to touch a the sweater of another man who was waiting for the bus)

mom: ""NO! You can't just touch people without asking them, mason!  Remember like in daycare?  Everyone has a bubble....""


Kid: smiles mischievously, laughs, mom gives him a stern look and he mumbles ""i know i know but it was soft and fluffy looking....""



Then the bus came and everyone got on.  I sat down and overheard two college girls discussing someone in one of their classes: ""omg did you see her hair the other day?! you can totally tell that she has extensions.  She's kind of a skank I hear....""


Then I realized that people seem to think that other people's bodies, particularity women's bodies, are public property, and that we have a right to have an opinion on them, to judge someone's character based on their body, and even to touch their body.  How many times have you over heard people criticizing celebs for getting plastic surgery?  


And then we wonder why people don't seem to  know what consent really means when it comes to sex?


I'm glad their teaching the bubble thing in day cares.  Of course they also teach about teamwork at daycare when I was a kid and that didnt seem to help us - everyone at my office always seems to compete with each other instead of working together to get shit done. :/


I think that what people don't understand, is that PEOPLE DO NOT OWE YOU EXPLANATIONS FOR THEIR ACTIONS/EXISTENCE/PREFERENCES/ETC, UNLESS IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS YOUR LIFE.  I get asked all the time why I dont want any children in my life - badgered about it, as if I owe someone an explanation for a personal decision that doenst even affect their life!!

TLDR: People think that other people's bodies are public property, and that they are ENTITLED to an explanation for other people actions/decisions/ beliefs, even when none of that affects their life personally.  People are individualists in all the wrong ways - ie team work is for 'suckers', taxes are for 'socialists' but they still think that other peoples bodies or thoughts are communal and up for discussion.

Well I walk in and there's people taking pictures under the stall door, so I ask them to stop taking pictures of my friend and kindly fuck off.

She comes out and is talking about how she's upset she wasn't able to throw it up and will have to live with the guilt now. I had no freaking clue what to say, I didn't want to make her feel weird about it so I just kind of... kept nodding sympathetically and said I was glad she was okay.



I have no idea if my reaction was alright, or what I should do when hanging out with her in the future. She said her roommates already know, so I don't feel a huge burden of responsibility, but I'm worried about saying or doing something triggering in future interactions. Like is it insensitive if I talk about how I'm having trouble gaining weight lately? Should I react any differently when she wants to go out and get food, or is encouraging others to buy lots of food so she can share it, or if I notice she's purging again? I haven't really known someone with an eating disorder before, and I don't want to treat her weirdly because of it but I'm also afraid of doing something wrong since they can be so dangerous.

I am livid.  I confided in a few close friends and they all are telling me it's not a big deal.  ""He was confused.""  ""That's just how gays are.""  ""He probably just wanted a quick hookup.""  He's my friend, that's my boyfriend, I don't really see where there is any gray area.  If this were one of my girlfriends it would be completely justifiable if I didn't want to talk to her anymore.  I don't see how this is any different just because my friend is male.  Also he put my boyfriend in a very nonconsensual situation. Nobody sees how this is so wrong.  Am I completely unjustified?  I feel like everyone is really underevaluating the situation.  My boyfriend only came around after I made him picture one of his friends doing the same to me.",303,20140512124530,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25dvv8,"My dad choked my mom last night, what now?","Does anybody have any guidance for how to handle domestic abuse between your parents?  I am 26 years old, I don't live at the house anymore, but my younger brother and sister do (edit: they are 23 and 20 years old, not underage, sorry for not clarifying before).  We have heard them arguing for hours on end throughout our lives, so it's something we generally tune out.  However, last night my sister heard my mom yell ""stop choking me"" and walked in their bedroom with my dad straddling my mom with his hands around my mom's neck.  My sister yelled at them to stop and left the room.  They eventually calmed down, and after a few hours of anxiety attacks, my sister felt comfortable enough to call me and tell me what had happened.  My sister has heard hitting before, and has seen my mom with torn shirts, on other occasions, but this is the first time any of us has been an eye witness to physical abuse.

I immediately got my brother to come home, and the three of us went into their bedroom (me via facetime actually) and saw my mom crying and shaking, sitting next to my dad on the bed, splotches of blood on the sheets and both with a cut or two on their faces.  My brother starts ripping into my dad, while my dad sat there and either downplayed or flat out denied everything.  I threatened to call the police, and to this moment a large part of me still wishes I had.  We eventually got my mom out of the room and she said down with us in another bedroom.  She claims this is the first time he's ever hit her (I don't believe that) and that she had to hit him in defense (I have no idea, she might be an instigator as well).  She spoke like a textbook domestic violence victim - she gave excuses, said it wasn't going to happen again, said we were welcome to call the cops if it happened again but just not tonight, etc. I pressured her and said things like ""you're afraid he's going to retaliate, which is even more of a reason to get a police record...in ten years will you THANK ME for not calling the cops..."" etc.  And she kept pushing off police involvement.  My hands felt tied. I told my sister afterward that the next time she hears them fighting at this level (not even waiting until one of them threatens violence), to call me immediately and I'm going to call the cops and say that my parents have a record of domestic abuse and they are arguing in such a way that I feel unsafe letting them continue without police involvement.

In addition, my dad is a massive alcoholic (averages 8 drinks a day if I had to guess).  He generally becomes dimwitted and acts like an annoying 5-year old, but doesn't get verbally or physically abusive to any of the kids.  I'm not sure if the alcohol was a major player in this event or if it was just a nudge in that direction.

I have no idea what to do from here, especially because I live 3 hours away.  My mom thinks what happened is serious, but is obviously not at a place where she thinks it's worth it to make any major changes.  My dad has refused alcohol therapy for decades and makes excuses to no end when shit goes down when he's drinking (for example, traisping blood around the house for twenty minutes when he was so drunk he didn't realize he needed stitches after dropping a bowl on his foot, to which my sister had to make him get in the car to go to the walk-in clinic).

Can you force somebody to go to a detox clinic?  He's already seeing a therapist (non-alcohol related) but who knows if he's lying to them - family counseling?  Can you get the state involved to force him to take bigger steps?  How can I get my mom to take this A LOT more seriously instead of just talking with him about it after the fact?  I'm at a loss, but I don't want to let this continue without a fight.

TL;DR: My sister witnessed my alcoholic dad choking my mom last night, my mom was extremely hesitant to get the cops involved, where do I go from here?",62,20140512144712,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

What heroine did you identify with the most as a kid? Preferably the main character of the book/movie/tv show.
Why?

For me, I guess Alanna from the Song of the Lioness series by Tarmora Pierce. I liked that she was into a male-dominated activity (knighthood) and didn't let that stop her. I liked that she was intelligent, compassionate, tough, and had a temper. I liked that she was willing to work extra hard in order to not just survive, but excel. I also liked that she struggled with and ultimately accepted her femininity. As a geek raised by a very anti-pink mother, I actively denied my girly affinities for a long time, and the fact that Alanna learned to enjoy wearing dresses really helped me.

t3_25dpxd,I went to the doctor today to get an IUD. OUCH!,"Okay, first off I have never had children so I was prewarned: it will be way more painful to get the IUD inserted because of that. And yes, turns out everyone was right. I couldn't even get past the measuring of my cervix!!

Well, the place I went to told me to take a few IB Profens beforehand and I'd be good to go. Well, that wasn't the case...I really have no pain tolerance at all apparently. Which I thought I could handle it since I've gotten a Colposcopy before and that wasn't too bad. But, this was WAY WORSE.

So, now I get to come back next month (so I'm doing the pill thing until then) and I've been prescribed Percocet and Xanax which I""m supposed to take an hour before I attempt to get it inserted again. My wonderful fiance has agreed to drive me there for when the time comes. 

My question, ladies, is will it hurt as bad with the pain pills as it did without them? I know pain is relative, but has anyone here ever gotten the IUD inserted without having children before and having taken prescribed pain meds beforehand? I really want to go the IUD since it is so effective and I won't have to remember to have pills on me at a certain time every day. 

I feel like a big pansy, but I couldn't handle the pain of even getting a measure of my cervix and that wasn't even supposed to be all that painful lol, the IUD was supposed to be worse, but I stopped the procedure before it got to that point. 

I am looking for the truth so I can use this month to prepare myself, because I still plan on getting it during my next period. I am hoping that with the pain meds beforehand it will be rather less painful. 

Thanks!!! 

EDIT: THANKS EVERYONE FOR THE WONDERFUL ADVICE!! I am much more ready and informed for the IUD than I was prior to today and next month I'll be all set and good to go! I appreciate the responses :) ",13,20140512135129,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25d6lq,"I need some friendly, non judgmental, lady to lady advice.","Okay, I am using a throwaway because my boyfriend knows my redditaccount, and even sometimes reddits from my account so I would be a little embarrassed if he saw this. Anyway, on to my desperate plea for ya'lls help. My boyfriend and I have been dating for about two years now. He is 30 and I am 26, we live together, have a dog, we know each other's families well (we have traveled with them, gone to holidays with them, done weddings, reunions, etc.). We have discussed our future at length, including buying a house and getting married. We are very happy together and we both know this is what we want. 

So now I guess what I am coming to the group for advice with is not all that unusual a ""problem"" but I really am at a loss as to how to deal with myself (as in, the problem is me and my own self)

1. I can't stop feeling a little tinge of jealousy when it seems like every person I have ever met, younger, older, or whatever is getting engaged every 10 minutes. -what can I do to just feel happy for everyone else and stop feeling like there is something wrong with me?

2. (and more importantly) How can I stop putting an expectation on every nice, romantic thing we do? I would especially like to remove this association habit with our upcoming summer vacation. I really don't want to think ""is this it?"" during our whole trip, and then feel any sort of disappointment when I don't come back calling my boyfriend ""fiancé.""

I am happy with our relationship, I don't have any reason to believe he is ""dragging his feet"" or won't propose when he is ready to. I know this is just something I need to stop obsessing over, and I really think part of the obsession stems from the fact that we are both at ages where a lot of our friends and relatives are getting married (we have been invited to 9 weddings over the course of the next 6 months). I know that it *will* happen, I just need to somehow distract myself and stop thinking about *when*. 

**TL/DR:** How can I stop googling engagement rings? Any advice would be so appreciated.  

**ETA:** thanks to everyone for your advice and suggestions. It seems like most comments have been focused on telling me to talk to my boyfriend about getting married/get on the same page about marriage and getting engaged/propose to him. I appreciate all the consideration, I really do. I just want to point out that we have very openly discussed *everything* from life goals, to timelines, to cake, locations and color schemes (all hypothetical of course). I am in no way worried about what he is thinking, whether we will get engaged, if we will get engaged, or if he wants to or doesn't want to. All I am really looking for is ways to live more in the moment and, as I analogized it in one response, stop behaving like a kid looking for Christmas presents in my mom's closet. Thanks everybody!!

t3_25d4g5,Friend was almost murdered by her fiance-- refuses to file a police report and is taking him back. Advice?,"What can I do in this situation? I'm terrified for her. They were arguing in their basement and he beat her to the ground, grinding his knee into her neck. She took picture evidence of the bruises and showed me in person so there's definitely enough documentation for a report. But she's refusing because she ""doesn't want to make a scene.""

Apparently he's claiming it was all alcohol and he'll never drink again. Grovelling. Having grown up around physically abusive alcoholics I know that this is an extremely dangerous situation for her. Promises do not mean recovery.

The guy only has a job through her mother (he's an illegal immigrant, so not many options for work) and I'm tempted to drive over and speak with my friend's family one evening regardless of her request for discretion. I think everyone who associates with this abuser should know what he really is. I'm also tempted to call the police over to her house while I'm there-- she might be more likely to file a report if they're present.

t3_25cw2l,"My relationship just ended and I'm lost and hurt and confused, I don't know what to do.","My now ex boyfriend and I had been dating for 8 months. We met online and clicked immediately. Our first date was beautiful and lasted for almost an entire day just because we didn't want to leave. For six months out relationship was great. We went out together all the time, discussed plans for the future (including kids, careers, where we wanted to live), and although we both had very busy schedules and lived in separate states (NY and NJ), saw each other as often as possible and never had any apparent problem with the distance.

Two months ago we took a vacation together that he described as ""the best week of my life"" simply because we got to spend the whole time together. He said he felt more at peace than he had in a long time and wished we had a place together so we wouldn't have to travel so much. We discussed budget and the search for an apartment began.

Not long after this, maybe two weeks, he started to spend more time with his friends from work. This coincided with my boss becoming very ill and me having to work more hours, so I had no problem with it and encouraged him to go out and have fun. We were still looking for apartments and discussing the future.

This was around the first time he mentioned her.

A friend of his from work (R) was sort of seeing a woman named (K), and they would all go out drinking several times a week together. K brought her friend G one time and my boyfriend (D) mentioned her when talking about how the night went. I expressed some concern about him drinking so much because he had admitted to using alcohol as an escape and would get blackout drunk almost every time he drank, but he assured me that he wasn't drinking much and everything was fine.

Around this time, he began asking me more and more often to take sexy pictures for him and if he could film us having sex. I hesitantly agreed to the photos, but never actually got around to taking them because at this point he was seeing his friends so often, I was only seeing him maybe once a week.

The drinking and going out increased. He started drinking more often by himself at home, and calling me at all hours telling me that he didn't know what he wants to do with his life besides just have fun. He was rethinking having kids, all of his work friends were telling him it was too much effort and life should just be about having fun. He stopped talking about the future (""I don't want to worry about tomorrow, I just want to enjoy today!"")and seemed distracted when we saw each other.

One night he got very drunk and we got into an argument. He grabbed at me several times and said he never wanted to have babies, that I was a bitch trying to control his life and he missed being single because he could do what he wanted. I cried and said if he wanted us to break up then we would, and he began to cry and apologize and say he didn't mean it. We agreed to discuss it in the morning when he sobered up and I went to bed while he stayed up to watch tv for a little while.

I woke up to the sound of him on the phone, talking to G and saying he wished he could have gone out. I got up and asked who he was talking to (I don't know why, I had heard it) and he waved me off. I heard the woman on the other end ask what he was doing and he said he was just hanging out. I asked why he wasn't mentioning the fact that he was at his girlfriend's house and he ended the call, told me to fuck off, and went to bed. I sniffed the cup he had been drinking from and it was pure alcohol, he had snuck off to my liquor cabinet after I went to sleep.

The next morning I confronted him and he said G was just K's friend and he had wanted to go out with all of his work friends the night before and had forgotten we had plans, so he was bitter and angry but didn't mean and was sorry. I accepted the apology but told him if he ever treated me like that again, we were through. He accepted and things seemed to go back to normal, almost.

He complained about being so busy with the end of the school semester that he had no time for anything. I went to him more often to try and make things easier, but sometimes last minute he would break plans because of his final project. I tried to be understanding, but my stomach was in knots. His phone was always on silent now and he would take a long time to get back to me, but always had it at the ready when we were together. We used to show each other things we were doing (playing games, reading articles), but now he put his phone away if I looked. On his twitter account, G started following him but had no posts of her own. He made a snapchat and said it was so we could chat more, but his top friend was always the same as G's twitter handle. When I asked he said she sent him stuff when the rest of them went out without him. I never saw any pictures and didn't know how to push more, so I let it go.

At this point we found an apartment and were going back and forth with the manager about setting up a viewing. He was excited, I was worried because it was near him and I would be uprooting my whole life to move there. After a couple of days of contact, D told me he thought it was a scam and told me to stop contacting the manager, so I did. This was maybe 2-3 weeks ago, now.

A little over a week ago I was at his place and on his computer was a folder with my name, he said it was all the pictures I sent him. I looked in the folder and there was another one that said sexy [my name], which he said was anything that showed more cleavage or he thought was hot. He sat on his phone and I looked at the photos, making little jokes until I found pictures of me topless and naked. During FaceTime conversations, I would sometimes get changed for bed. He took screenshots of that and saved them. I was upset and said I wanted them gone, he said he wanted to keep them because I still hadn't taken sexy photos for him. He ended up deleting a couple but I was still upset. I felt like I was making a big deal and he was getting upset, so I let it go. 

From then until just a few days ago, we decided to wait until our schedules were a little less hectic to continue our search and discussed plans for another vacation and my upcoming birthday. Thursday he came over and we went out to eat, said cheers to the semester being over, and talked about plans. When we went back to my place he grabbed a couple of things I had been asking him to take home, since I had work early and he wouldn't be staying over. He seemed distracted, but when I asked what was wrong he said he was just tired from doing double shifts at work and going to school at the same time. Again I let it go, but on the way to the train station when I dropped him off he wouldn't speak to me, wouldn't hold my hand and when I went to kiss him goodbye he pulled away and claimed he wasn't feeling well.

When he got home he called me and we finally had the conversation that I had been dreading. I told him I wanted to know what was wrong and I wanted an honest answer. He told me that he had fallen out of love with me a long time ago, that he had been planning this for a very long time. He wouldn't outright say that he was breaking up with me until I asked if this was his way of doing it. I asked why he wouldn't do it in person and he said because he was afraid of me getting violent, that he was actually afraid of me. I never even raised my voice to him let alone a hand.

Finally after some back-and-forth I asked if there was somebody else. He said it didn't matter if there was. I persisted. He admitted that he had met somebody else and I demanded to know her name. Again he said it didn't matter that I didn't need to know her name and I said I already knew her name but I just want to hear him admit it. He said G. I asked him how long it had been going on and he said for a while. He told me that he really cared about her and that she was special and he wanted to be able to give her a fair chance, not sneak around anymore. I told him something along the lines of they deserve each other, I don't quite remember because honestly I was so upset I couldn't even see straight anymore let alone keep my hands still. He said he would ship my things to me and hung up.

Now I'm left with this problem. He still has those pictures of me. He still has my things. Saturday I asked him when he was going to send them and he said that since he hadn't been home since he left my place that I would just have to wait. When I asked if he had been with her the whole time he wouldn't respond. I asked if they had been having sex and he said no, not yet. I asked if they had been doing other things. He said I didn't need to know that information because we weren't together anymore. I asked again and asked if it had been going on while we were together. He refused to give me a straight answer. We never used protection. I'm on the pill and we both said that we had tested clean, and me being an idiot took his word for it. My friend says that I should warn this other girl, especially about the pictures. I'm torn. I just want to get my things back and move on with my life. But I don't want somebody else to go through the same thing that I did. But at the same time I have a feeling that she knew about me the whole time and just didn't care because I know that he talked about me on Twitter and she did definitely follow him.

So what do I do? I told him I want those pictures gone and he said it wouldn't be a problem, but I can't believe a word that comes out of his mouth anymore. I want to know the truth about what was going on between them but I don't at the same time. This is the third relationship in a row that I've been cheated on and I'm giving up on the chance of ever finding somebody who will be faithful. I'm definitely getting tested but I'm going to be losing my insurance and I'm not sure how I can go about getting tested again in a few months time to be sure. I'm afraid of those pictures getting out. I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid of the fact that I still love him.

t3_25d1x9,I need some XX advice on how to deal with a female friend.,"We use to be very close during our school years and she really was my best friend, however when I got a new boyfriend we became distant. This was partly due to me being 'loved up' and wanting to spend my time with him, and meet his family etc. She soon began giving me the cold shoulder, and bad mouthing me to our mutual friends. Once I had clocked on to my bad friend behaviour, I sat down and apologised to her and explained I recognised what I had done was wrong. I made a real effort to try and rekindle our friendship, meeting up with her lots, just calling every now and then and checking how she was, and I even  tried not to be with my boyfriend in front of her when we were together at social events because she got so funny about it. *She has a boyfriend too by the way*

It is now 3 years down the line, and me and said boyfriend are still together and very happy. But me and my friend have never been able to rekindle our friendship. She is very judgemental, and has not been supportive of me when I struggle with anxiety and panic attacks. I feel like our relationship is very fake. I know that I am to blame for the start of our friendships downfall, but I apologised sincerely and really tried very hard to make things right.

t3_25dod6,Losing weight without exercise?,"Here goes another weight loss post.

To make it short.
I'm 22 years old. In my senior year of uni currently working non stop on my thesis. I am also running 2 of my father's companies that are currently at the peak of their success. I work 9-5 and go to uni at night most of the days of the week. My weekends consist of working on homework and my thesis which is to be finished around october this year. So basically I have no time for anything other than my education and career. And in the free time I do have, I am just so exhausted that I don't want to even think about exercising. 

So due to this amount of stress and no time for exercise, I have been gaining weight. 
I refuse to take a break since I am so close to finishing and I honestly can't leave my job unattended. 


However, I really need to do some changes to get back to where i was. 

I am not a heavy eater. The problem is that I am so busy that sometimes I forget to eat lunch, and then have a big dinner. I know that it is extremely unhealthy and probably the main reason for my weight gain.

So does anyone have any advice on how to deal with my situation? 

Any advice is appreciated.",0,20140512133621,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25eaxw,I regret my abortion.,"It's been a month. I've regretted it since the next day. 

When he came inside me I knew. We always used either a condom or he pulled out, and we've never had this scare before. We got too much into it and couldn't lift me off him on time. He came inside me, and I knew what it would lead to. 

For days afterwards I wondered how to tell him. I hoped he'd be happy and love it as much as I already did. I'd wanted a child so badly. He'd mentioned to me that he wanted one, too. Even though when we started dating he said he'd never have one. He thought I'd make a good mother and that changed his mind. 

It wasn't until a month later, March 17th that I got the test done, because I was about a week late. I took the test he had from the dollar store in his bathroom ""just in case"" for years. Positive. I ran out to Rexall and bought a $20 test. 4+ weeks, it said. 

I drove to my sisters house with the test, beginning to panic now. No one would be happy for me. Everyone would say 21 is too young to have a child. My family would disown me. 

My sister was so happy for me. She touched my belly and coo'd. And for once, I felt like this might happen. She offered me all her baby hand-me downs and told me if I needed anything i could count on her for support. My others sisters reaction was the same. She came over to my house and sat beside me on the couch with her hand on my belly. And even though it wasn't big enough to even show, the little thing still had presence in my heart and mind. 

When my boyfriend came home I told him, hoping so badly that he'd want this as much as I did. He didn't. He told me he thought we should abort, and I sadly agreed to it. I'd always promised him I wouldn't be one of those women who don't care about the fathers right. I promised him if we were to get pregnant, he had just as much say as I did and I was not going to go one way while he wanted the other. 

I did a lot of crying. He kept telling me ""I had to make a decision"" and I'd yell back at him that the decision was made, even though I was clearly against it. He told me he'd support me in anything, and even though he didn't think it was the right time that if I had to have it, he had to know ASAP so he could quit schooling and find a career that could support us. I told him no, that I wouldn't go back on my word and that I was just sad. 

We went to the appointment to see how far along I was. They wouldn't do the abortion without knowing for sure. I wasn't asked to see the monitor and I didn't want to ask, but I was angry that he was allowed to see and I wasn't, from where he has. All the movies the mothers get to see the monitors. They point out features, they smile at you and tell you it will be okay. But this wasn't like the movies, and there were no smiles. 

The abortion was planned for a month later. Scheduled by the clinic on his birthday, April 11th. He seemed indifferent to that, just mentioning that it was an odd birthday present. 

The next month was unbearable. My morning sickness was so bad I needed to go to the doctor for a prescription to help it. I threw up all morning all day. I couldn't get out of bed, and I couldn't go anywhere in my house because somewhere, a smell would set me off. I started to get angry at my body. It didn't have to prepare for the pregnancy, it was going to be done soon! I just wanted it all to go away. I got severely depressed, my boyfriend supported me in any way he could but i just stayed in bed and slept. I had to miss a week of work. I work with food, and couldn't smell anything strong without puking. I was driving to the store and had to pull over to throw up. Got it all over my legs and steering wheel because I couldn't get out the door on time. 

Near the end of this I passed out in a bank. I woke up on the floor with women surrounding me asking if I was all right. I was led to a chair, given cookies and water and the first question the lady asked me was if I was pregnant. I said yes. She told me I should go to the doctor just to make sure the baby is okay. I started crying and told her it wasn't necessary. I was due to terminate in a weeks time. People were a lot less thoughtful then, and I drove home. 

My sister drove me to the abortion. I was 9 weeks by this point. My boyfriend held my hand during the whole two hour wait. He had to go to the bathroom before the ultrasound, so I got to ask for a picture. I wouldn't have asked if my boyfriend was there. 

The questionaire they had me fill out asked me who's decision this was. I wrote in big letters ""MINE."" It didn't feel like mine. 

The procedure was painless. He held my hand for the needle and I remember feeling very uncomfortable with her seeing my vagina, but I don't remember anything else. Then they brought me to recovery and had me sit with a pad to soak up the blood. I felt immediate regret. I ate cookies and water until they needed the spot and sent me home. My sister drove me. When I got home, I went to bed. 

All evidence of what happened to me is gone. All except the birth control pills they had me start the next day. Each time I take that pill, it's a counter of how log it's been since I lost that chance at a child. Each night I have to hold back tears. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm fine. I'm not. At work I see babies all the time, and I feel immediate regret all over again. Mother's Day was so difficult. My step dad was mocking me the whole time- ""this will be the new mother next year, huh?? Your turn!"" He doesn't know about the abortion or he would be more careful, I'm sure. 

I miss the fetus. It would have been about 13 weeks by now. I think I'll regret it forever. Counting down my destroyed baby's would-be-birthday and milestones. 

Sorry for the long post.  Just need to vent.  ",106,20140512171008,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25esx6,Small victories are sometimes the best,"As a female only child, I was expected to do certain chores around the house growing up.  I did the laundry, put away the groceries, and some other odds and ends.  My father did everything outside.

He was not the best father and never bothered to teach me things like how to throw a football or fish.  And he certainly never let me near any of his tools aka man toys.  So I never once mowed the lawn or trimmed the hedges.  The thing is I'm not at all a girly girl and I would have loved to do that stuff.

My father passed away last November.  I'm absolutely fine with that since we had a terrible relationship.  Life is actually better now for both me and my mother.

The only issue is, now there's no one to take care of things outside the house.  He bought a brand new push lawn mower last year.  Used it exactly once and just left it in the garage.

My mom was ready to call up and get a landscaper to take care of the lawn.  But she's on a fixed budget and there was that brand new mower in the garage.  So I thought about it and decided, what the hell, I'll do it.

So today I drove over, opened the garage and pushed the mower over to the lawn.  I tried the push button, nothing.  I tried the pull cord, nothing.  It would sound like it was about to start and then just die.  A quick check and I realized it needed gas.  Ok, that's easy.  Came back and started trying to start the damn thing again.  Nothing.  It sounded like a car with a nearly dead battery.  It would try to start, then just die.

Of course the man didn't keep the manual.  I'm on my phone trying to google how to start a mower.  I felt like the stereotypical helpless female.  I HATE that feeling.  I'm far to independent to fail at something as simple as mowing the lawn.  

My mom is standing in the door telling me to go to one of the male neighbors and ask for help.  UGH!!  NO!!!  I was determined to do it myself.  I had gone inside to help her with something, and cool down a bit.  When I went back outside I jokingly said, ""say a prayer"".  We are the least religious people around.

I walked over to the mower and tried to start it and again the fucking thing would just not start.  I was literally ready to give up.  She's standing in the front door laughing at my frustration.  Finally I pushed the start button one more time.  HALLELUJAH!!  The damn thing started and stayed started!

So I managed to mow the lawn, or the weeds really, on my own for the first time in my 40 years.  It was one of the most satisfying things I've ever done.  Was so inspired that I went home, grabbed the cordless drill and hung a new window shade.  

Now to learn how to tile a floor.  That will be my next victory.

TL;DR I mowed the lawn for the first time in my life.",68,20140512201740,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25epgq,My experience with an (almost) date rape,"In our time, it is not uncommon to meet someone and form an almost instant friendship. You've either met them in person or online, and upon carrying a conversation you think to yourself ""This person seems really cool!"" Next thing you know, you've exchanged numbers or agreed to hang out.

In my case, I met him at the park while we were both jogging the trail. He was attractive, college age, and shot me a friendly smile. As I came around the trail a second time, we met again and he asked if he could jog the trail with me. I was in a public setting in broad daylight, so I agreed. He asked for my name and carried on a small talk conversation about fitness. 'What a pleasant jog! What a pleasant conversation!' I think to myself. He has now earned my trust and offers me a ride to my car, which was parked further away. Hot and tired, I agreed. During the ride, our conversation continued. He parked his car next to mine and asked about my interests. He played a few songs from his band and asked for my feedback. He asked for my number and hinted on a future date. Then, he started telling me how beautiful I was and what a great time we'd have on our date. He commented on how I was a shy girl and he would get me drunk on our date to get me out my shell if need be - wait, what? PAUSE. I let out a nervous chuckle ""Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen."" Feeling slightly uncomfortable, I start searching for excuses to leave. He then asks me for a kiss, making the situation more uncomfortable. Feeling completely uneasy, I firmly tell him I have to go. He begs me for a kiss on the cheek, to which I just respond a firm goodbye and head for the door. On my way out, he forcefully reaches out and grabs my breast sitting there with a smirk on his face. At this point, I am making the most frantic exit back to my car as possible. The fool has the nerve to say ""I guess that means you don't want me to call you, right?"" All I can think of is how lucky I was to get away and speed the entire way home. It's easy to feel guilty as if it was my fault for being naive and getting into his car. It was my fault for trusting him. It was my fault because I was initially attracted.

NO. I want you to know, it's not your fault. Since when does getting access to a ride mean access to your body? Just because you've earned my trust enough to get me back to my car on the other side of the lot a few thousand feet away safely does not mean I trust you enough to touch me. Situations like this go about unreported because it is easy to feel at fault. This happened about two months ago and I let him get away because I thought the police would just dismiss it as nothing, besides, I also had a warrant for my arrest at the time for a traffic violation I haven't paid. I got away from the situation, but to this day, I wonder how many other women have fallen victim to his act.

Edit: Not all rapists are unattractive and creepy-looking older men. Not all of them attack right away. The definition of sexual assault is an unsolicited sexual act. If this happens to you, do not hesitate to call the police.",53,20140512194011,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25egsm,I didn't cry when trying on new clothes today.,"Hello. 

I'm a fat 19F. I've spent most of my life hating myself and how I look. I yoyoed from 360 to 230 to 280 again. Now I'm at 270 with a light diet, but unfortunately have developed an eating disorder. I cant eat more than once a day without having horrific self hatred.

However, with my clothes on in certain outfits I feel like I look nice. I carry my weight well and my legs are muscular from sports as a kid plus walking several miles a week. My boyfriend lovingly insists he finds me ravishing and regularly kisses my belly when I feel glum. But in general, my clothes are old, ill fitting, and ratty. Not something a young starting business professional type person should were. (I'm considering myself an entrepreneur and an artist) 

Today, another plus size, older friend of mine took me clothes shopping. I had no idea what I was doing and she helped me pick out bright, workplace appropriate clothes that I felt pretty in. I sold my 3DS and pokemon X [ :( ] and had some money to play with. She took me to a thrift shop called 'one more chance plus' an d she helped me pick out cute business professional clothing since I had got a very awesome internship at a very notable art gallery in my city. And I got so many pretty things to wear. Two button ups (with no gaps on my boobs), light, flowy shirts, a perfectly cut to my size plum blazer, a black pencil skirt, a black a line dress and pearls. In total 8 or 9 garments that I can mix and match with my exisiting wardrobe to have a fun, business casual look that I so desperately want to achieve, all for about 100 dollars. 

And while trying on those clothes and looking in the middle, I hardly let my eyes linger on my stretch marks, or my floppy boobs in ill fitting bra (I know I'm not a DD, but I can't afford bras that fit), or my arms and the way they swelled.. instead, I saw how these cute outfits I thought girls like me couldn't wear, totally wearing it.

And I didn't cry in the dressing room for the first time in 3 years. ",19,20140512180820,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25f3kw,When I'm unable to orgasm it causes me to cry,"Ladies please help: 

When I'm having PIV sex I sometimes reach the point that I can feel myself building up and getting close to having an orgasm. However, whenever this happens my boyfriend almost always ends up finishing before I can climax.

For some reason if I can't orgasm (and I'm close) it feels like a wave of sadness crashes into me and I involuntarily start to tear up and...cry. It's not because I'm consciously upset that I couldn't orgasm - I love my partner, and I love having sex, and not finishing is something that I'm used to. It's the act of *almost* getting there, but not being able to that makes my body react this way.

I attribute it to the build up of hormones and not being able to find a release, but I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else? I can't be the only crazy one out there, right?

I end up feeling awful because of the emotions I can't help but feel, but also because I need to comfort my boyfriend and tell him it isn't his fault. It's the worst of both worlds - I've reached the point that I would almost rather not try for an orgasm than almost get there and experience this.

We have great conversation and the sex is even better! A couple weeks ago I asked what he was up to and out of no where he texts me ending our fling claiming I'm ""too college for him"". Now there is a 9 year difference between us but it really doesn't feel like it when we're hanging out! 


Now I was definitely taken by surprise by this and I felt kinda bummed about it, but I didn't and still don't want any kind of relationship with this guy. We have a good time and I know he enjoys my company.


Well, the other day he texted me again out of the blue, commenting on one of my snapchat stories. We texted for a solid 2 hours and sex didn't come up until the last maybe 10 minutes of our conversation. I proceeded to ask him why he was talking to me again as he said he felt it was ""time to move on"", he responded with ""I was with a 28 year old and she was really boring in bed, and in general we should have some fun."" I wasn't thrown by this because I know exactly what we are to each other, booty calls for sure. I was actually kind of excited that I was so good that I stuck out in his mind!


I have yet to hang out with him since he started texting me again even though I'd really like to. But my friends have me questioning if it's in my best interest to see him again! He's a great fuck and we can actually talk to each other! Unlike some of my other FwB. Am I being too ""easy"" (I hate that term) returning to him so quickly? Or am I truly being ""too college""? Getting with him again wouldn't mess me up, emotionally, I know that is for sure. I would just love some opinions from ladies outside of the situation!

I am writing to say I for one am super happy you have become a default sub.  Although I have an account, I often don't sign in because I often like to see what's happening in the main stream of reddit.  [Today upon opening up the front page I found this TwoX story about abortion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25dh62/tomorrow_i_am_driving_my_ultraconservative_anti/).  And it reminded me of how hard it is to be in this world for women.  So I clicked on the TwoX link and started reading some of the other stories here.  I laughed and felt grossed out by [dog and the tampon story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25c3eq/oh_god_my_dog_ate_my_tampon_and_then_shat_it_out/). Read with horror about the couple of domestic violence stories and many of the other stories in here.  

My point is that the more that we XY people hear from you about your lives and what you go through on a day to day basis, the more women's stories become human stories.  And I know that there will be a spike in troll activity, this will soon die down.  And reddit will be on it's way to becoming even more of the humanist site it is, where many different groups of people can have a strong representative voice.

t3_25f0qo,I don't believe my new FWB actually got STD tested,"I may be completely wrong on this and I really hope I am. But I do not believe the new guy I am dating went and got tested even though he said that he did. Backstory: I have been seeing this guy for 3-4 weeks and the condom breaks and neither of us noticed until he was finished. I could immediately tell that there was cum inside me and asked him to check the condom. He told me it was fine but I said that he needed to check again because I could tell. He comes out of the bathroom and tells me it was split when he looked at it. I tell him he needs to get tested and he says he will. 5 days later he went to planned parenthood and got tested. He told me they charged him $160 and would not take his Humana insurance. I find this strange because all of my friends and I have never been charged more than $100 even without insurance. Am I just being paranoid? How can I confront him about this. PP does not give you a paper copy of the results so I can't ask to see that. 
FYI: I am on BC and was STD tested 2 weeks prior to incident. Also I plan on parting ways with this guy once he gets his results. My gut just does not trust him.

Edited: I will be getting tested myself too. I would just like to know his results so that I don't freak out while waiting for the incubation periods to get my tests.

EDIT 2: As previously stated, I plan on breaking up with the guy because I don't trust him.

UPDATE: After 45 minutes of calling, PP answered the phone and informed me that testing IS $160 for new patients. So I feel a lot better knowing he at least told me the correct price. And they will print results if he goes back in and signs a waiver. Now my question is, how do I ask him to go and get me printed results without offending him?? I am not worried about losing the guy, but I would like to have proof before/instead of him getting pissed off and ignoring my request.

I would love to contribute and be a part of this community. I want to learn from women who care about and are affected by these issues, and I want to contribute my own thoughts, as someone who is making an honest effort to be aware of problems faced by women today.

If I'm being honest, though, I've been too scared to post or comment so far. I'm afraid of saying something that might offend someone, or coming across as misogynistic by not using sensitive/appropriate language.

We live together, and plan to do so for the foreseeable future, but we are both open to the idea of having sex with other people as long as we practice safe sex and communicate with each other. I have a long history of low self-esteem and self-harm: I have been raped and I have used meaningless sex to make me feel better about myself. 

My partner is fairly anti-authoritarian and has a great disdain for police officers. I am currently employed as a 911 dispatcher, so I spend a great deal of my time in communications with police officers, ensuring their safety in the field. This has led me to get very close to an officer with whose ethics I greatly identify, a quality that is rare for me to find in the police officers I dispatch. He also happens to be single, attractive, and very much interested in me. I would like to start seeing this man outside of my job (he hangs around the dispatch center when I am working and he is not busy), and I know my partner is okay with me sleeping with other people, but I think he would take issue with me sleeping with a police officer. 

I don't know if I want to sleep with this man simply because he wants to sleep with me and I am going back to my old habits from before I met my partner. I respect him a lot as a person and it is refreshing to work with one officer that I can really identify with. The officer knows I am not single and has not backed down, so I'm not sure if he is trying to pressure me to leave my partner (absolutely not an option), or if he would be okay with sleeping with me without me leaving my partner (possibly an option but only with my partner's consent). having said all of that, I do not know how to explain to my partner that I want this man partially because he is a police officer and I have no one else with whom I can connect in that part of my life. My partner is the most loving and compassionate person you could ever look for, but it takes a huge toll on him to hear about my day at work because what I deal with is often darker and heavier than anyone outside emergency services can really grasp. I need someone with whom I can have sex and share in the darker side of the job. I truly believe that I could have that with that one man I work with, but I don't know how to explain to my partner that I want to have sex with a police officer.

**TL;DR** Committed, semi-open relationship with one man, intense interest in another that my partner may not approve of. Unknown if pursuing the other man would be return to old ways from dark and twisty past, or if it would be helpful to deal with the stress of my current life that I can't share with my partner.

Please help me,
Desperate(ly), devoted dispatcher

**Edit** -ed to add that sex with my partner is generally good. I don't think it's the two and a half year itch, ,or anything like that. We are communicative about our sexual needs with each other and understand each other's need for sexual experiences outside our relationship (i.e masturbation, sex with other people). My only complaint about sex with my partner is that his own past issues often lead him to ejaculate prematurely, and that's not really a big deal usually, but sometimes I just need longer PIV sex than he can manage so that can on occasion get frustrating.",0,20140512172328,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25eg1y,Vaginal and abdominal pain (F18) HELP!,"My girlfriend is not a redditor so with her permission I am asking you for her. She is 18 and is on birth control.  She is sexually active. 

She has been to her regular doctor who prescribed her antibiotics, this did not clear it up.  She went to a gynecologist who gave her anti-fungals, this didn't clear it up.  While there they tested her for STD's and she came up negative for all of them.  Her urine was tested and there was blood, white blood cells, and some sort of bacteria.  After the antifungals didn't fix the problem, she asked for antibiotics again and the gynecologist said no.

After the first gynecologist failed to fix the problem, she tried another one today that said nothing is wrong with her and that she's fine.  She's hit a wall now and we have no idea what to do.

My girlfriend is having abdominal pain as well as vaginal pain.  It comes randomly, some days she feels it only once, sometimes she feels it several times a day for hours.  She describes it as a burning feeling, sometimes sharp and stabbing.  Peeing burns, and the pain comes during sex to the point sex is impossible.

Her urine is cloudy, and sometimes there is some blood.  Most days there is some blood in her underwear at the end of the day.  Once when we were having sex, I noticed she was in pain so we stopped and when she stood up blood literally fell out of her.

Do any of you have any idea what this could be?  We've hit a wall and don't know where to go next.

t3_25fpgm,Don't know what to do about my math class.,"Hello, 

Well I'm taking a math class for the second time and got an A+ and a A-  on the first exams. However, I got a big fat F on the last one. I've had a terribly rough semester. I experienced the death of a loved one for the first time, my family problems escalated to such a height that I began feeling more and more sad. And I've been losing the desire to do well in school over the last few semesters. Honestly, it got so bad where I could not even push myself to study for the past month. Somehow I was able to go to work though, albeit very bitterly. Finals are approaching. My friend told me that I should notify my professor because I show signs of depression and post-death effects. But I don't know, do you think my professor will grant me leniency on this one test? She does not drop a grade unfortunately. 

EDIT: I'm also doing poorly in two of my other classes but I think I will still be able to pass. Honestly, I never would saw myself doing so poorly in college. 

UPDATE: Thank you all for your lovely help! I really appreciate it especially with everything I'm going through. I spoke to my professor and all she told me was she can't really do anything and to try to get a 90 on my final (She even told me to calculate myself what grade I need in order to figure out what to do Thank god I did that beforehand). Something I already knew so I can't really do much at this point. She even said that she knows I'll have trouble getting that grade. So she wasn't helpful at all. But at least I got up and asked her, the attempt counts. I'm going to speak to a counselor tomorrow so maybe she can help me learn how to concentrate better for finals week.

t3_25fomv,I'm going on a date and I'm so nervous. [kind of a ramble/also looking for advice],"I'm going on a date this weekend! And for the first time in a long time, it's with a guy I like. I've been on dates, but it's usually ""just because"" and not because I actually feel something for him. And I've liked men, but it's never worked out where we actually go on a date. So for the first time in years, I'M GOING ON A DATE WITH A GUY I LIKE. He's a smart, funny (and ridiculously sexy) dude.  
  
I'm just super nervous and a million thoughts are running through my mind. What if he doesn't really like me? What if he only wants to have sex with me and not actually start something worthwhile? I want to have sex with him so bad, but if I sleep with him on the first date, will he get the wrong impression? What if I can't think of things to say and we end up sitting in awkward silence? What if he's a super conservation, pro-life, misogynistic dude and really good at hiding it? What if the weekend comes and he just decides he doesn't want to go on a date anymore? 

I'm so fucking nervous. And it's so embarrassing I can't speak to my real life girlfriends about this. So, uh, my internet girl friends, how do you keep yourself cool on dates?

I used a tampon today, for the first time!  It didn't even really hurt - it was just a different experience than anything I've felt before.

I've never done it before due to anxiety and pain issues...  I went to physical therapy to help see if it was a physical issue or a mental one - turned out to be a little bit of both.  My physical therapist gave me some dilators to help with the physical difficulties, and she also gave me some ways to cope with the anxiety (breathing exercises, ways to focus on the feelings of pain and notice when they subside).

Because I've never been able to use a tampon, I've never felt like a normal woman.  It feels great overcoming that hurdle.  :)",37,20140513130635,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Her HPV test also came back positive.  She declined a follow up colposcopy.

She has stated that this is the 'single hardest thing she has ever gone through in her life'.  She feels shame, anger, distrust, unworthiness.  She feels like she fucked up.  She feels like the Western Medical system is *not* set up to make people healthy, but to make people feel like there are things wrong with them.  The doctor does not feel like a safe place to her.  It has taken a toll on our sex-life, we have had sex maybe a half-dozen times since her result a year ago.

Now, a year later, I encourage her to *at least* go get another Pap.  I know that they are uncomfortable tests, and that I cannot really know that discomfort.  I know that she feels shame, and that I cannot really know that shame.  I worry about her health.  I feel uncomfortable not knowing what is going on with her body.  I feel bad for pressuring her to do something that she does not want to do, for asking her to do something with her body that she is not comfortable with.  I feel like her behavior is self-destructive.  I feel like I should have encouraged her to get another Pap six months ago.

t3_25gwat,Was it rape? What do I do? *trigger warning*,"Last night, I went out with some friends. I'll give them fake names here. Jacob and Kristen, a couple, who I work with. I am best friends with Kristen, and my ex, Sean, is best friends with Jacob. 

Jacob, Kristen, and I went out to drink, but we were all a little drunk. Jacob said I could stay with him and Kristen didn't mind at all. I had also taken a benzo per my prescription for anxiety, so I was loopy and very tired. Jacob was very drunk.

We went to the same place, and he insisted (even Kristen who trusts us fully) that I just share the bed with Jacob to get sleep and not drive drunk.

I did, thinking nothing of it. I've been going through a lot and Jacob is a good friend. I passed out next to him and he had his arm around me, but I felt safe because he was my friend and my best friends boyfriend. I feel into a deep sleep almost instantly. However, I started to stir because he was stirring, and then all of a sudden he was pushing himself into me. I looked down and my pants were at my knees and he had be pushed up against the wall. I didn't know what to do, I was still so heavy and tired and confused. I didn't tell him to stop, not right away. he moved me around and put himself on top of me. I started to think I was somewhere else, that this wasn't happening. But I still didn't say stop. Until i did. And then he pushed harder, so much that it hurt so I screamed but I think he thought I was enjoying it. Finally, he does stop. And then he starts slurring that he thought I was Kristen.

I know he was really drunk, but he was lucid enough to tell me not to tell Kristen. 

I don't know if this was rape, but I didn't want it. I also didn't really fight it. I feel disgusting and scared and I don't want to tell anyone. I'm so confused because we are all a close group of friends.

I came home and took a shower and self medicated until I couldn't feel anymore. Today I called out of work because we ALL work together (Kristen, Jacob, and Sean). 

I need someone to talk to. I need to know if this was rape. I need to know what to do. I've been sexually assaulted before, I can't go through this again. But was it assault?

t3_25gets,Do you Care to Stand up for Women's right to Body Hair and the inherent Femininity/Womanliness that it Embodies?,"(Kind responses only please) EDIT: this doesn't mean I only want to hear people that agree with me, just be nice about it if you don't, because this issue is about body shame and I would like a thread of comments that don't contribute to more shame.

I am a woman who loves and leaves all my body hair, but then I am not too hairy. I am not concerned about myself, but rather the many woman who feel they have to remove it to be accepted. I am interested in hearing from both women who like and keep hair, but also from woman who may love to remove it, but are still able to stand up for our rights to be ourselves and who can speak positively about their bodies even when they prefer another option, in the effort to support everyone. 

As hair restrictions become more intense, people have become less comfortable with all their body hair. When I was in High School in the 1990's, bikini line waxing wasn't a thing, and we all let it hang out, just like our mother's and aunties had done. Do we need to exercise our rights to keep them? Is this a use it or loose it situation? I let my few hairs that stick outside my bikini line (like 30 of them), stick out because I care so much about standing up for this right. Even when I waxed bellow, I made sure to let some hairs stay from my mons so that on my special trip to Hawaii with my husband, I could proudly brandish my bush flag. 

I do this because I know there are women hairier than I and I want to say - this hair is OK. You are OK. I believe it is time for a hair revolution, not to stop waxing, but rather to say WE CA DO WHATEVER THE F WE WANT TO and WE ARE STILL WOMANLY AND BEAUTIFUL because HAIR IS NATURAL ON WOMEN AND THUS IT IS INHERANTLY FEMININE. 

Is there anyone who does what I do, wears their hair like a badge of honor, and are there more of you willing and brave enough to do it sometimes?

Who is confident enough to do it with pride?

Is there anyone like me who feels their body hair is soft and beautiful and sexy and prefers it?

Are their any hardcore waxers who are willing to speak only positively about hair, even on their own body, or in the privacy of the bedroom with a lover, so that body love is spread rather than body hate.

Again, this isn't anti waxing or shaving, it is just pro freedom of choice.

Last year I saw a young girl with hair that grew from her temples onto her cheeks and towards her chin. It wasn't like beard hair, but rather more like soft head hair that extended way down her face. I thought she was exquisitely beautiful and that her hair was super fitting. She kept it trimmed short, but not shaved off. I wanted to tell her I thought she was gorgeous, but hesitated because I didn't want to put her on the spot. Have you had experiences like this and should I have said something to promote positivity?

Am I alone in my interest in creating a world in which our natural bodies are accepted and cherished as beautiful, even while we maintain our rights to choose to do whatever we like to them?

t3_25hapz,"Need some POV on my bf's ""hobby""","He's always been a car nut.  Fanatic.  I thought it was cute.  Last year he was finally able to afford a nice flashy car that he adores.  Keeps it in showroom condition and has sunk money in for new tires/wheels, exhaust, with plans to do more.  This is money he sets aside from his paycheck plus he has taken out two loans against his 401k.  We're not married but tentatively talk about saving to buy a home, although we're not doing much of acting on that plan, obviously.  I put my entire check into the bank, aside from what goes into my 401k.  

He does a kind of racing (time trials only, no wheel to wheel) EVERY sunday, driving all over the state to participate so he has entry fee plus gas, plus occasionally hotel.  I frequently work weekends so it is not an option for me to go all the time, nor do I want to...I am not a car person, plus it isn't really a spectator sport.  Its out all day in the sun on asphalt watching cars go through cones.  We barely see each other when he isn't racing anyway.  He does well, but I don't feel I should have to go to every one.  He wishes I would, but he understands.

So I don't know why, but I feel kinda resentful about this in some way, because having a full weekend together with him is pretty much not an option.  He's even said as much...barring a vacation out of town or whatever, if there is an event, he wants to go.  It makes him happy and he shouldn't have to not do what he loves.  I agree, but I don't feel that asking for a Sunday every now and then is too much.  I don't know why he has to go to EVERY single one.  He says ""Because I enjoy it.""  He says we get plenty of time through the week and Saturdays, why am I begrudging him what he loves to do?  

I wouldn't ask him to stop for me, or to choose me over racing, but I'm feeling neglected here.  He never forgets a racing event, or scheduled things for his car, but our anniversary was a month and a half ago and I have yet to receive anything - and I mean anything - dinner, flowers, even a card.  This is the first one ever that this has happened.  This is a man who always has been really thoughtful and sweet with special occasions.  

As a side, I don't have any large scale hobbies myself - I like photography and reading and travel - but no one obsession like he does.  I would gladly go out and do my own thing on Sundays, but the thought of him NEVER being willing to give up his time for us, is...unsettling.  As in, rethinking my future with him unsettling.

Thoughts?

TL; DR:  BF obsessed with Sunday car stuff, how much is too much?

I had a large ovarian cyst in early December and when I went for a checkup in late January it was gone. When I was at my checkup I was on day 16 of a ""period"" that was a fairly steady flow. The practitioner at the clinic recommended I do a pause on my pill and let it bleed out. I followed her advice and it eventually stopped a few days later. 

Ive been taking a break from the pill since then. Also haven't had a period since then, but know they can be irregular after the pill. Monday the 5th (8 days ago) I started spotting. After a few days it got VERY heavy and I was going through like 5+ tampons a day, which may be usual for some people but definitely not for me. 

My boyfriend and I went shopping the day before yesterday and we were gone maybe an hour and a half and I started bleeding through my shorts... I stayed in the car while he finished, maybe 20 minutes... and by the time I got home the shorts were pretty red in that area. 

Then yesterday my puppy got into the bathroom trash while I was napping (boyfriend forgot to close the door) and when my boyfriend woke up I guess the puppy had scattered tampons and bloody toilet paper all over the house. My boyfriend didn't mention it until today cause he said he didn't want me to be embarrassed that he saw all that and cleaned it up. I mentioned that I'm annoyed its taking so long to end since we have a wedding to go to in three days and doesn't seem to be letting up  and that its a lot of blood and he agreed. He said he is worried about blood loss from what he saw (was only two days worth, but it filled my little bathroom trash. He's also a nurse if that matters, but he probably has no clue about periods lol so not sure what to think of his comment).

I had a mutual breakup with this guy, we'll call him Dave, a little over a month ago after dating for 4 months. We broke up because it was bad timing and I felt like he was pulling away from me. All I wanted to do the day we broke up was tell him I loved him, which I had never said before, but didn't because it would only make things harder.

Fast forward a month and he tells me he wants to talk. So we meet and he tells me that the reason he was pulling away was because of timing (he is a graduating senior in college and I am a junior) but mostly because the relationship he used to be in, which lasted 7 years, was with someone who was not only emotionally abusive but once hit him so hard in the face it fractured his jaw. And so when he started realizing he really cared about me and loved me, it brought all that back and started to scare him so he tried to pull away to feel safe, even though that wasn't what his heart wanted. 
 
So, it is finals week and I am stressing about grades super hard and now I'm hanging out more with Dave and he tells me he loves me but he is leaving in less than two weeks to probably live at home as he is not yet employed.

Now, I called PP to ask if I needed another EC, because I think my guy had sex and came in me, but not sure...

t3_25h1ij,Life just keeps kicking me when I'm down.,"The last 4 days have been absolute hell. 

On Saturday: My SO and I tried to have sex twice, and our communication completely failed, leading to our only huge fight in months. There was yelling, crying, and a shit ton of distress all around.

On Sunday: My SO and I had an 8 hour drive up to a city where he had a job in framing to start on Sunday, where I go to college during the school year, and where I plan to start working ASAP. We'd had some car troubles (just some vibrations), but had them checked out by TWO mechanics, who both said they couldn't find anything wrong and sent us on our way. The vibrations started up again during the drive, about 4 hours out, and we spent four hours trying to find a mechanic, driving away from our destination in no-man's-land, WV. Nothing. We put on a spare tire. Didn't fix it. We pulled off again and decided to switch back to the regular tire. While the car was jacked, we looked underneath and saw a HUGE chunk of plastic falling off the bottom of the car, such that it would hit the ground and cause the noise we'd been hearing. We cut it off and the sound was gone. 

That Sunday night we were supposed to move in together, into a room in a townhouse that I had checked out a few weeks earlier. I had noticed the house was a little messy and dirty, but I thought it wasn't too bad; we only needed a place to stay for 3 weeks. Well we walk in and it is absolutely filthy. There's hair everywhere, there are bugs, there's dirt, people's shit is all over the bathroom. We unpack as best we can at 11 o'clock at night. 

My SO was royally ticked at me. I was supposed to look at this place and give it the okay, but I didn't look for warning signs and now we were fucked. So he didn't touch me, look at me, or talk to me all night, while 3 hours earlier we were perfectly blissful in the car.

On Monday: He gives me a kiss on the cheek before he leaves for work. Progress. I spend all day unpacking even more and 3 hours cleaning the bathroom trying to make it a livable place for us. He gets home and he's sunburned (he's working for a construction company), sweaty, and miserable. We half-heartedly hug, and I give him some food that I ordered. We shower together, and he finally touches me when we switch who is in the water. Yay. The rest of the afternoon was miserable; we tried some ice from downstairs, and I swear, I think it actually poisoned us. Our throats were irritated, we couldn't stop coughing, he even threw up. So we said fuck it, and got the hell out. We went to a nearby park and talked in the car for hours about why he'd been so cold to me. We worked through it (though he's still angry with me for betraying his trust when I gave the apartment my approval). 

We get to bed that night around midnight after cuddling (at this point we haven't had sex since Friday, while our norm is daily). He shakes me awake around 1 am (keep in mind he has to wake up at 5:30 for his job) and there's FUCKING WATER dripping out of the ceiling onto him. We hear a huge thunder blast, knocking out the electricity for a few minutes. The water is still dripping out of a bubble on the ceiling. So we move the bed, stick some towels under the leak, and get some sleep.

Today: Today was looking up. We found another room to rent (much more expensive) that we will move into tomorrow. We are staying in a hotel tonight. We also scheduled for me to meet him for food 15 minutes from now. Unfortunately, I just went outside to my car, and lo and behold, the battery is dead. My SO had turned on the lights inside the car when we were unloading on Sunday, and he had left them on. I didn't notice either for the past 2 days. So now my car is dead, the one we need alive to move our stuff out, the room I'm in is hellishly hot and filthy, I haven't felt clean in days, I'm horny out of my mind, I'm guilty as hell about all of this, and I haven't eaten anything all day because we haven't had time to go buy groceries.

So yeah. Life just won't leave me (and my SO) alone. WE ARE DOWN. WE ARE MISERABLE. STOP FUCKING US OVER, LIFE.",1,20140513142106,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25gjc9,Im not quite sure what to do about this.,"Using my throwaway for this...

So to start off I am 23F and in a very happy relationship with an amazing guy. We have been offically together for about 4 months but have been very close for about 10 months, and Ive known him for over 7 years.

The problem I have is that he is waiting until marriage to have sex. Now I admire him for this, the amount of resolve he has to keep his morals is amazing, but I feel bad because I cant keep my urges under control.

For example, if Ive had a bit too much to drink I accidently try to take advantage of him (and my inhibited sense of judgement) and try to get it on. Usually it ends up with him sternly keeping me at bay and me being an emotional wreck, crying and whatnot. And we all know that feeling of when things get heating up and common sense and decency get pushed aside. 

I dont think any of this would be a problem if my previous relationship wasnt so different. I was in a relationship for almost 7 years, he was my first (pretty much first for everything), and we became sexually active with each other pretty early on in the relationship. Because if the length of the relationship and the amount of commitment we had for each other, it wasnt rare to have sex more than once a day. (that relationship though is entirely over)

**So my question now is** how do I deal with myself? I want this relationship to work out so I dont want to compromise it just because of this one issue.

All questions and comments are welcome! Thanks for reading!

I'm a condom-only girl precisely because I can see exactly when it's failed and can take steps to deal within hours (I know the emergency pill isn't 100%, but it's a step you can take, y'know?). I know most birth control has 97-99% success rate, so theoretically I'd be fine, but if it failed you wouldn't realise until you were into abortion territory (if you even noticed that early - what do you do if you have a ""silent"" pregnancy with a BC that stops periods and don't realise until you're out of the legal termination window? Or am I being crazy?). My boyfriend mentioned years ago that he'd like to go without a condom just to see what it's like, and when I explained why I wasn't keen he said it made sense and hasn't asked since. We've had a couple of failed condoms, but a morning-after pill later and it's all good (though I was shitting myself a little until my period started). I kind of want to be trusting enough to go for it so he gets the full effects of sex, but... eep...

Have any of you ladies ever had similar doubts/worries about your birth control? And if so, how did you get over it to the point of ""the thing's in my arm now so I don't have to worry""? I'd be constantly peeing on sticks if I was on the pill/implant/etc., I'm jealous of anyone who can be that relaxed about it.

Please read this with an open heart and know that it doesn't come from a place of anger, I'm just expressing something that bothers me, and I wonder if anyone feels the same.

When reading posts, it bothers me that it seems to be one brand of feminism here. I don't want to go into specifics really, but lately while reading through posts and comments, it's felt like if you're not this way or you don't think this way, then you're doing it wrong. If you don't agree with this point of view, then you're a misogynist, a rape apologist, you're doing women an injustice. For example, I got downvoted pretty hard here once for just expressing my want to take my husband's last name some day, why is that a negative? Traditional values are not equivalent to wrong in the same way that a lifestyle that is more modern is not equivalent to wrong. I don't want to turn this into a rant, because I really do respect different points of views, I just haven't felt the love here as a welcoming community for all women lately. Has anyone else felt this way? I would really appreciate some insight and healthy discussion here.

Throwaway, for fairly obvious reasons.  

I very recently moved to a new city with my boyfriend (for work) and neither of us knew anyone here.  We're both quiet, introverted, and are not very social.  But since we moved away from all our friends we decided to explore the very active Reddit scene in our new city.  Last weekend was the third meetup event, and we had a great time doing a pub crawl with people we were becoming friends with. About four bars, six drinks in, my boyfriend and I are well toasted, as is everyone else in the group.  People start to head home.  Five of us are all walking in the same direction to a major street where our cars are parked.  My boyfriend was not ten feet in front of me talking to two of the guys, and I was sort of drunk shuffling (not quite stumbling) behind with the guy who sets up most, if not all of the Reddit meetups.  We had spoken to him at other meetups and he seemed like a friendly sociable person.


 We were speaking pleasantly (slurring?) until lo and behold I feel his hand on my ass.  I know I registered it was there but I was so stunned, and so taken aback that I couldn't for the life of me say a thing.  I don't remember if he was as drunk as I was.  He might have only been buzzed, he might have been wasted, Or maybe he was completely sober.  I know that that doesn't change what he did but I also know that alcohol can make people do *incredibly* stupid things.  His hand stays there moving around for what seemed like 3 blocks. He chatted lightly but his hand keeps going back and fourth on my rear and again, I couldn't muster any words.  I was just in shock.

I have told my boyfriend about it and he's adamant on not meeting up with these people again.  I agreed, but reminded him this really limits us in terms of socializing, since his co workers are almost all settled with families and I have not yet found work/co workers.  I almost want to go to another meetup to call the guy out, and see if I can somehow work past it.   If he were to apologize sincerely I can see us *maybe* going to smaller meetups that are in the daytime, that don't revolve around getting shitfaced.

t3_25hmgx,Need advice: confronting sexism from a professor?,"I am a PhD student at a large university. This most recent semester, I was enrolled in a small physiology course with an older (65+) male professor who made several remarks that I found very upsetting. When referencing the ovaries, he would often make remarks such as ""this is where progesterone is made - which is why women are so crazy,"" and when referencing the uterus, he once said ""we can tell by the immune infiltration here that most women must be lying about menstrual pain."" He would frequently make remarks along the lines of ""this discovery was actually made by a woman!"" and ""some women don't like my class because they say it's too early, and disrupts their beauty sleep."" 

I was going to write all of these things in his course evaluation, but I became intimidated because the evaluations were due before we got our final grades, and it is a VERY small class. However, all of the things he said (those listed above are just a few examples) have really been bothering me lately. The lab I work in is on the same floor as this professor, so I'm not sure if it's worth confronting at all. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Or have any advice?

UPDATE: thank you everyone for the advice and discussion! It's validating to hear (especially from other professors!) that the situation is not ok. I like the idea of going to the department's chair to have a discussion about it. I am also actually considering starting off with an honest conversation with the professor himself to address a few of the comments.

She didn't like how her body changed, she didn't like that she ""turned into a bitch"" (her words), and she hated that she lost her sex drive.

She is also not sure that her doctor is aware of a gall bladder problem, and warnings on birth control pretty commonly advise against it under those circumstances. She's planning on calling her doctor tomorrow to address all of this.

t3_25i4ow,Self-conscious about something I know doesn't matter.,"Hi TwoX, I'm feeling very self conscious about something that I know shouldn't matter, and just need to pour out feelings, rant, get advice, etc. 

I am 17 years old and am currently dating my first-ever boyfriend. I have had absolutely no previous sexual experience except for kissing. We have been together for about seven months, although we were friends for a while before that. We have a really great relationship, and he always does his best to make me happy and comfortable. I am fully confident that he loves me for who I am and not my appearance, however I've been super nervous about progressing sexually due to the appearance of my vulva. Stupid, I know. I have basically the opposite of the ""ideal porn vagina"" in that I have SUPER LONG labia (like really really long) and they're also very brown at the ends (although I have very light skin). I know experienced guys know that women's anatomy can differ greatly and it's all normal, etc, but my boyfriend has had close to no previous sexual experience and I'm pretty sure he probably watches porn, being a 17 year old guy (the fact that he might watch porn doesn't bother me in the slightest, but it just means he's only been exposed to perfect labia-less porn vaginas). Anyways, I have yet to remove my underwear. He has gently suggested we take things a step further sexually a couple times before, but being the nice guy he is, when I said I wasn't ready he totally respected that. However it's getting to the point where I really want to move forward, and I'm sure he does too. It's just that one insecurity that is really holding me back. I look in the mirror and think it just looks weird/gross, even though I know that's not logical.
I know that if a guy cares that much about your vulva he really isn't worth it, and I agree. I'm about 99% sure that even if he did find my vulva unattractive he definitely wouldn't say anything. So I'm not worried about him being a jerk about it. Just for some reason the idea of him finding me unattractive in any way, or being disappointed in some way about how I look REALLY bothers me. I know that some men love long labia, but I'm worried he doesn't. Especially since what I'm worried about is so private and intimate. If I had what I considered an unattractive nose or something I wouldn't care so much because there are no surprises and he would know from the beginning. It's weird because I'm not self conscious about pretty much anything else but this one particular part of me. 
This has created a really big fear of taking off my underwear and letting him see my vulva/vagina. I think we're both silently getting more and more impatient, and I'm totally ready to move forward if it weren't for this huge irrational fear.
Can anyone give me any advice on how to get over this? I really want this relationship to last and everything is so perfect except for this one thing.

Thanks so much for any advice you can give me.

PS: I want to stress that I do not want to offend any women on here with large labia. I am not saying there is anything wrong with you, or that you should be insecure about it or anything. I really wish that I could be like a lot of you and get over being so worried about it.

t3_25htyv,Validation from strangers [a rant],"I've been with my boyfriend for 8 months. We're good together because we communicate effectively: if something bothers me, I bring it up with him and we work through it. I have told him to do the same, and he does. There is one thing I keep thinking about and while it doesn't bother me enough to keep me up at night, it just reinforces my shaky self-esteem. 

I'm 21 years old and I've never had a proper relationship until now because of my high standards/pickiness. Objectively, I don't think I'm unappealing lookswise but I feel that I crush on guys 'outside my league'. I go for a very specific 'type' of guy (I'm Asian; my type resembles a Kpop idol so conventionally good looking, nice hair, good dress sense, thin). My boyfriend is my type exactly and the first guy I've both crushed on and asked me out, so naturally I was over the moon and said yes. 

In the course of our relationship, I've witnessed my boyfriend get hit on so many times. It usually happens at work, where he's a barista so he's nice to customers in general and I don't take that to heart even though it's unsettling to watch when I'm having my drink and I see girls try to flirt. The worst is when we were at a beach once, and my boyfriend asked this stranger to take a photo of us. They have a short convo - mind you I'm right next to him but I don't speak because I'm shy and I don't like talking to strangers and after taking it, she looks at me and asks me directly, ""Are you his girlfriend or friend?"" Ouch and wow, so inappropriate. 

It just crushes my self-esteem because no one ever hits on me when I'm with my boyfriend or very much in general. I don't know if it's the gendered thought of 'guys don't hit on girls who are with other guys but girls can hit on guys whether the guy is with a girl or not' or if my boyfriend is just so much better looking than me. I know it's not a game either, but it still annoys me to a point. 

To be clear, this is not affecting our relationship, it's just something I think about from time to time and get bothered by it. I've also been to counselling before for my self-esteem issues. This is just something I want to get off my chest, gah! ",5,20140513190540,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25iahf,Possible Trigger? I feel guilty every time I'm sexually aroused...,"...and it's really putting a dent in my mental health.

I'm a very sexual person, sarcastically or not. My major (engineering) is basically all men except me so I'm pretty good with the sexual innuendos and laughing at penis jokes. I'm not discriminated socially at all; the guys accept me as an honorary guy and things just go swimmingly in public.

In private, I'm also very sexual. I enjoy masturbating and having sex (monogamously). I've never had sex with a guy I'm not dating, nor have I kissed or hold hands or flirted with anyone I'm not dating. Not that it's bad, it's just the guilt I feel when I get horny around males. Just recently I broke up with a guy and now I feel guilty when I hang out with anyone. I think everyone's attractive and I get aroused easily. It just happens, especially when sexual jokes are thrown around 24/7.

I like sex, I like masturbating. I like pornos of all sorts. It's just when I start to think about anyone sexually, I'm overridden with guilt. Enough so that I don't want to hang out with that guy or even look at him. I don't want to be a whore, but I sort of am, aren't I? I think about it often enough and isn't thinking half the doing? I think sex is good, and if I know the guy well and we're both into each other I don't see why we shouldn't have sex. So why do I feel guilty thinking about these things? How do I stop it? Should I be guilty about it?

Ladies, please help me out here. I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling guilty about sex, but how can I deal with it? Is it bad or good to have? Should I be having sex with anyone or should I only have sex with one guy that I'm serious about? I mean, it is college so shouldn't I have a bit of fun? Or is that uncouth? So much conflict!

I know it's going to hurt. I'm really small (5'0, ~90lbs) and I have issues with all kinds of medical equipment. I leave the dentist with my mouth feeling like I've chewed barbed wire because even the children's sized stuff is too big for my mouth. I also have had a lot of painful sex because above-average sized penises are literally too big for me, and if a guy sticks more than two fingers in my vagina, it hurts at first (even if we're using lube, and even if there's been a lot of foreplay/I'm really aroused). I can't even imagine how much it's going to hurt when a doctor sticks a speculum up there. 

I'm also worried about how I'm going to be able to handle it emotionally. I've had some sexual experiences that were not entirely consensual on my part, and I'm worried that the pain I'll be in plus the general discomfort of medical exams will trigger something in me. I would really not like to be traumatized during what should be a routine visit.

This is long but if you can get to the end without crying I'll give you something. And forgive me I've been drinking. Okay so, my dad and I have always had kind of a strained relationship. He was a long road mover and so was gone 3 weeks out of the month. 

When I turned 12 he offered to take me on a move out to California with him in the truck. The trip was great, other than some mishaps like him leaving me alone in the truck all night in Nevada while he gambled. And I'm not trying to sound bitter or anything, I realize he had/has a problem. There's just no other way to say it, really. But one thing that kind of got on my nerves was he was constantly asking me to sit up in the front with him and look out the window. I was little so I was SUPER stoked about being in a bed, but in a TRUCK. Omg. So I actually didn't spend a lot of time in the front seat, but lying down, watching traded videos (and, consequently napping).

Over the years we've alternated between feuding over family drama to talking once every six months. But here's the conversation we had today via text:

""You know what's like the biggest regret of my life ever /
when you took me on that awesome trip out to california in the truck and i was too busy being a stupid kid in awe of there being a bed in a truck to sit in the front like i should have/

Shortly after taking the fluconazole I had foul smelling discharge and some of the itching came back. I called by doctor and she just prescribed me another fluconazole. She said if that one didn't work in 5 days, to take another.

Like me those that read threads on this sub-reddit when not logged in may feel compelled to log in to comment in a fashion that may be contrary to the intent of this sub-reddit. this means that the overall quality of this sub-reddit declines. Even this post can be construed as being derogatory towards the sub-reddit simply because it disagrees with the ideals of this sub-reddit. It seems that the old subscribers of this sub-reddit do not enjoy hearing opinions other than the ones they expect to hear when posting to this sub-reddit. I don't disagree that there are occasions during which the idea of being validated by like-minded individuals is very appealing and sometimes required, but opening a sub-reddit that previously had a very defined set of beliefs to the general public detriments that congruence.

t3_25iq52,Recent surgical abortion,"So I'll admit, I have been a lurker on Reddit for awhile. I was looking for advice for my recent surgical abortion, and I can't say enough how grateful I am to have this wonderful community in supporting me through this unsure moment in my life. I wanted to give back by giving my own recent experience.

I first found out with my SO about the pregnancy within maybe 2 weeks of conception. I felt sick to my stomach and my boobs hurt like hell. I had all the signs, so i took a pregnancy test. Obviously, it was positive. We finally came to a decision to go through with the procedure do to financial issues and recent events in our lives.

The harder part was the wait I think. In the process of making the appointment and getting an ultrasound, made it feel like forever. I had to wait 2 weeks before I had a set appointment for the procedure. I will say nothing makes the process harder than making you wait all the while your hormones are having a crazy party.

By the time I was scheduled for the procedure, I was 7 weeks. I walked into the clinic and sat down. There was some random plane crash movie on, so I sat there and read some game of thrones all the while secretly freaking out. I think my SO knew, so he just tried to make me laugh about the shitty movie.

We ended up waiting 3 hours until they finally brought me into an office, gave me antibiotics, I paid for the procedure, and gave me sedatives. After that, I went back into the waiting room and waited another hour. When I was finally called into the doctors office, I was sat on a table ( like at any gyno exam) and given an IV. I think after they put the IV in, it became a bit fuzzy. I do remember a little sharp pain at first (5-6 level), but by the time I finished processing that pain, the procedure was done. I think the entire procedure was maybe 5 minutes. 

Afterwards, I was instructed to put my clothes back on ( they had put a pad in my underwear for me before hand). They helped me walk into a waiting room with a recliner and heating pad. I stayed there for 30 minutes and had minimal bleeding, so they let me go home.

Afterwards, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I went home and watched some anime, had some pizza, and slept for 12+ hours. I will say though (as they will tell you), in the recovery process the worst happens after day 3. 

I had minimal bleeding for 3 days and wasn't having any problems until i started feeling bloated and having crazy cramps. The pain level was at a 5 or 6. I was prescribed vicodin, so I took the recommended amounts, which seemed to do fine. Then on day 5 (night of day 4), I had extreme cramps at levels 9 or 10. I decided to take an extra half of vicodin, and eventually the pain went away. The next morning, I called the clinic and they said it was normal and almost immediately after, I passed a few medium sized clots and the bloating seemed to disappear.

For the next couple of days I had light spotting, and I am now 1 week and a few days past the procedure and back to feeling great. I have no spotting and able to do light workouts again. 

Nothing can take away the emotional experience, because even now I do question the ""what ifs"",  but what I do know is that I made the right decision for me, right now. 

I wasn't able to tell anyone or talk about it, so I understand how hard it is when you feel alone. I hope that maybe this can comfort someone and help them through their decision. I just want them to know that people do care and understand what they are going through.

i feel really terrible about it, and i realized lately that maybe i'm really lonely deep down, even though i have great friends and go to a great college. there's this void that i didn't realize i had, and i don't know why i have it or what can fill that void. but i feel like a slut, which is awful and fucked up that i think that bc i slept with an asshole that i just met and i don't think i should think of myself as a slut just for wanting to be sexually liberated but after this instance i do. i really regret it and i feel like this is a low point for me but i don't know what to do with this overwhelming feeling of loneliness. i don't even want a serious committed relationship, so i have no idea where this is coming from.

in addition, every time i hook up with a guy, i always think about and wish it was this particular guy i hooked up twice with, even though 1) the age difference is really big//he lives in a different city and 2) he's probably not even interested in me anymore or doesn't even value me as anything more than some girl who's 8 years younger and hooked up with twice

i don't know, i guess i'm just posting in hopes that someone relates or feels the way i do 

EDIT: the point that there wasn't enough information to warrant me thinking he was an asshole was brought up, so somewhere in the comments I have more detail. I had the intuition that there was something not quite exactly nice about him, but if you disagree that's fine too. Also, thank you for taking the time to read as well!

edit2: okay well the thread was hidden but here is more information for those who want it to make a more accurate judgement --

If you want other information, I guess I should've listened to my intuition when he texted me (as we were planning to hang out): ""This better be worth it"". I replied, ""And what if it's not?"" and he said, ""Then I'd waste a ton of gas"". I was like, ""well if you think you'd waste a ton of gas/want more than to hook up and smoke weed then maybe you should play it safe and not come"". He ended up coming, obviously but when we were fooling around, he asked for head which I did, because I do like it/the response it gets but he started pushing my head faster even though I was gagging and it was clearly uncomfortable for me. He came after like 45 seconds and went to put another condom on because I guess he was embarrassed for finishing early but then he said, ""I can't get hard with a condom on"" and implied sex without condoms. At that point I was like noooooooo way. But I don't know, those things to me make me think someone is kind of an ass but if you don't think so, that's okay too. I just didn't particularly enjoy it
I say he's sleazy, because even in conversation and etc I realized afterwards he, and his personality, was just like the type of guy that I would avoid in general--sleazy and looking for cheap fucks. I'm not saying I'm above that, clearly I was just looking to hook up too, but I guess I expected better behavior/more intelligence from guys in general. Which is my fault too.
But you're right, I think because of my previous mostly positive experiences with hook ups (all of them were with older guys who were more my type) I expected this to be a positive experience and the lousy sex was definitely something I didn't think would happen. At the same time, I don't think lousy sex is the end of the world. I realized something bigger was happening here, the fact that I did this signaled to me that I was at a pretty low point in how I was feeling, so no I'm not whining about some lousy sex.",3,20140514031823,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25khlk,"After nearly a year of transition, I am amazed at the difference between life lived as a man vs. as a woman","I am 11 months on HRT this month, and I have got to say that transition is by far the most fascinating and continuously surprising journey I have ever been on.  I am posting this with a throw away since this sub has gone default and I want to minimize my possible exposure to harassment, etc, but many of my cis gender friends are always interested to hear about my experiences with transition, and I thought it would be interesting to put this out on this sub to see what you ladies had to say.

I'd like to put a couple of caveats to this post: none of this is really me complaining about anything. I'm very happy now, happier than I've ever been in my life. I love myself, my appearance, and just the simple feeling of being more than I ever thought possible. It's just that sometimes it's really freaky to think about how different my life is now.  

The thing is, absolutely none of these things are things that, at any point, I thought I would have to do or experience to be a ""real woman"".  None of these changes do I feel I purposefully tried to make in order to adhere to any sort of standard ""necessary"" to be seen as a woman.  They all just kind of...happened.  How much of them can be attributed to hormones, and how many can be attributed to living as a woman and truly experiencing the social pressure, etc, of that role?  I can't be sure.  Certainly, I feel like hormones had a large effect on many of them, specifically those that deal with my own interior experiences and reactions to things.  

But I don't like to say it was *all* hormones, if for no other reason than I know plenty of cis women who have had estrogen-driven bodies all of their lives who don't necessarily have many of these going on in their lives.  But, for whatever reason, they are a part of me now, and a part of my experience of the world.  It changed far more than I anticipated.  

Also, in this post I am speaking in very broad strokes, *very* generally. There are many exceptions to every thing I list here. Please don't think I am being absolute or saying this is the way for every woman (or man) every where, all the time.  Nor am I attempting to speak for all trans folk.  This is definitely a ""your mileage may vary"" kind of thing.  This is just me, and my experience.

The changes I am most interested in aren't physical, necessarily, but more mentally and personality-wise.  I suppose, before starting, I was much more focused on the physical aspect of transition. I'd heard, of course, of attitudes and whatnot changing, but I suppose that kind of change is a much harder one to observe in others or anticipate in yourself.

And, while of course I had heard from women all my life about subtle (and not so subtle) misogyny -- and I believed them, I never really thought they were exaggerating -- it's very much a different thing to experience something than to just hear tell about it.

For myself, I very much thought I would end up being a huge tomboy-type girl. And, truth be told, I do still have some hobbies that are more masculine oriented...but damn did I get ""girly"". Friends comment on it sometimes, women and men, cis and trans.  I can be more than a bit giggly, and I just love being held. I absolutely melt when I receive loving attention, and am generally much more submissive in my attitudes and behaviors. It's a very weird thing to experience, though by no means unpleasant. It just feels so good to feel safe and ""protected"" by someone, physically and emotionally. I also realized the other day that, at some point, the state of my hair gained the ability to practically dictate my enjoyment of a whole day.

Though I am still very much attracted to women, their sex appeal is no longer the first thing I see when I look at another woman. I'm much more tuned in to how she is dressed, and what I think that says about how she felt that morning or what she was trying to put across to others that day. I ""feel"" different in more subtle ways as well. I feel calmer, more grounded and practical in my mindset. As one example, due to circumstances I have a decent chunk of money coming my way this year that I've known about for many years. I used to have all sorts of plans of things I was going to buy when I got it. But, more and more, I want stability and the ability to plan in my life. My plans for that money have changed almost completely over the last 3-4 months especially. I feel like having it in the bank and/or properly invested will give me a sense of safety that will be worth far, far more to me than any thing I could possibly buy with it. Under the influence of testosterone, I never had that kind of ""need"" to have stability in my life. I was far more ""good times"" oriented, even at pretty considerable possible future cost.

At gatherings, now more than ever I find myself gravitating to the women because the behavior and typical topics of conversation among men just doesn't really interest me, unless it is a definite shared hobby. I'm coming to really understand how little I ever understood men. I may have matched their behavior at times, but I'm finding that my reasons for acting that way were more like ""well, this is what guys do, and I don't want people to know I want to be a girl, so I want them to have no reason to question me, so I better act this way as well"". But men seem to have different reasons for acting the way they do, reasons I can't really understand. So often, I'll see or hear about a guy doing something, and just be like, ""WHY would do you that?!"" When I hear guys talking crudely about women, or when they make crude jokes amongst themselves or to me, I actually cringe.

Speaking of men and their behavior, I'm getting to where I generally blend in these days -- and the more men see me as a woman, the more they tend to kind of talk over me and/or listen in a placating sort of manner before they go back to talking to each other. If a conversation has 2 or more men involved, it becomes hard to really even get a word in edgewise. They'll just talk away while I sit there, and if I venture to add to the conversation very often everyone looks at me while I'm talking, gives a sort of ""oh yeah, I know what you mean"" or ""uh huh, that's interesting""...and then they turn back to each other and continue on almost as if I didn't say anything, like my participation in the group conversation was almost an interruption of a talk they were having. Again, like they are more humoring me by listening than actually taking anything I say.

Now that I exist in this new social atmosphere, I look around and see them doing exactly the same thing to other women in the conversation. As often as not, the girls and I end up having our own little conversation that spins off the main conversation, because we are the only ones actually listening and responding to one another. The guys just want to talk to themselves. It's really a little startling to realize this is probably been going on my whole life, but I didn't notice because I was previously accepted by the men as one of them, and so what I had to say was given more weight. I totally think this is a subconscious thing on their part, the vast majority of the time. I don't think they do it purposefully. But it does happen, and it's really uncanny (and more than a little annoying).

I also didn't quite properly anticipate what a difference the loss of strength would make to my life. I've now reached a point where, sometimes, I literally have to wait for my boyfriend to get home to do some things. I physically cannot do them myself. I can't help but think back to times that girlfriends of mine would do the same thing (wait till I got home to get my help with something) that I couldn't help but think, ""You really could have done this yourself if you'd really tried."" Simply because, when I would do it, it wasn't that hard. I couldn't fathom that the difference in strength was so great that it wouldn't be possible for them.

Well, now my boyfriend does the same thing. He'll come home, and I'll have spent time trying to do something without him and found it to be literally not possible. He'll come along and just be like, ""Oh, you need help with this? This isn't that hard. Look."" And, voila! He does it and makes it look like it was little effort, typically making fun of me the whole time. =P

Much more of my previous affectation was a facade, it seems, than I'd ever guessed. I'm getting to know the ""real me"" in a profound way now. And speaking of profound, I am finding that being a woman is a much more profound thing than I'd known. Being forced to watch from the outside, of course it isn't surprising that my initial thoughts about what it would mean to live as a woman were very superficial and surface-level.

But nevertheless, it is surprising to discover what a deep ocean womanhood is. If that sounds cliche, so be it. That's how it is, for me.",346,20140514154520,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

But the one thing that always irritates me without fail; being called 'girl'.

Generally this is done as a way of thanks after I've helped a customer find something, or advised them on a product and they will say, 'good girl, thanks'. Very occasionally I get 'good woman' but much, much rarer. It is also most generally men who say it.

 I asked my husband who works with me and one of my male employees and they say they will once in a blue moon get told 'good man' but never, ever 'good boy'.

 I also realise that its of no use to be irritated by it, but I can't help it, it just grates on me. I know it is nice, and that they are doing it as a way of saying thanks but I am not a girl.

t3_25jhs8,Women of Reddit: What did you feel ashamed of as a young girl that you realize now was not shameful at all?,"Seriously ladies, our society needs to stop pressuring young girls into feeling shame about their bodies, their thoughts, their womanhood. What shame memories do you have that you realize now are utter bullshit? 

Edit: as per the suggestion of a commenter, i've added a pared-down version of my comment below:

Somewhere around the age of 12, I realized that if i touched myself a certain way, an AMAZING thing would happen. My mom had this little vibrating accupressure tool (and yes, I really think she used it for this because she is a serious, old school, east asian immigrant) and I would...well you get the picture. It was FUCKING AWESOME. It felt great and it was also incredibly relaxing and for a high-strung kid like me, it was a total godsend. Then my little sister found out what I was doing and told my mom...which is when I learned what the word ""masturbation"" meant, well, sort of. I was told that what I was doing was disgusting and wrong, and that girls should never, ever masturbate. Being the defiant little shit I was, I basically said fuck the man and kept on doing it. I got ratted out a couple more times but eventually I got too old for my mom to keep having that talk with me. 


Im so glad I didn't let the temporary shame surrounding my first adventures in masturbation to turn me off to it permanently. It was one of the most important things I ever learned to do because I learned to explore my sexuality on my own terms and internalize the fact that I didn't need a man, or any other person for that matter, to experience pleasure. All I needed was something that buzzed a little, and a nice, soft surface upon which to lay (not a fan of the showerhead technique, just doesn't work for me).  I think all young women should be given a vibrator and a basic anatomical diagram from a woman in their life that they trust. 

TL;DR: I was ashamed (for like..a month) about masturbating, but then I got over it and realized how important it was in the development of my sexuality. ",20,20140514095122,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

So I met a guy like 4 years older than me (I'm 18) back in January, right after my boyfriend and I had broken up. I told him right away that I only wanted to be friends and while I didn't really pursue the friendship, he did. 

He was constantly pestering me to hang out and the few times we did, he would get all touchy feely and insist on paying for my coffee or whatever, which really was not necessary. 

After a few times of him making me uncomfortable like that, I started to answer his texts less and less. Now once every two weeks or so he'll text me a long version of ""I miss you, did I do something wrong? Let's hang out!"" And I never know what to say, so I'll usually say I'm just busy, but I know that's not a solution.

I don't really want anything to do with him at this point, not only for the reasons I stated above but because I honestly don't enjoy his company. Also, I know this isn't his fault but he reminds me of a really unhappy time in which I was really hurting because of the breakup. 

He texted me again two days ago and I still haven't answered because I don't want to be mean. I know how shitty it is to be ignored and I don't want to make him feel bad, but I really would be happy to never see him or hear from him again. How do I make this happen in the nicest way possible?

t3_25k0iu,I went to get tested for STDs/STIs today for the first time...,"...and it went *okay*. Throwaway 'cause I can. I'll try and make a long story short. I'm 21 and have been sexually active on and off since 16. Been on the pill, used condoms, and recently got an IUD, so I've been protected and smart about my sexual encounters. I've had pelvic exams where they've tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia, which have come back negative every single time.

Anyways, my appointment - they did a urine test (test for pregnancy - negative! wooh!), vaginal swab, rectal swab, throat swab, and blood draw. Yup, the whole nine yards. I spoke with the first nurse about my sexual history. She asks how many partners I've had and I reply 14. Am I proud of that? Meh, kinda. A large majority of which were only one time things and never at the same time as others. I had dated the same guy all through high school and when we broke up before college, I went a little crazy with the boys during my freshman and sophomore years. At the end of our conversation, she hands me a pamphlet on abstinence. She showed me a chart heavy on ""if you've slept with X amount of people, you've slept with everyone they've slept with."" Chart showed that if you've slept with 12 different partners, you've actually slept with more than 4,000 people. She's like ""yup, and you're off the chart."" Despite me telling her that the people I've slept with used condoms and had been tested themselves, she was pretty persistent about the whole ""it only takes one time"" ordeal regarding pregnancy and diseases (I'm not dumb, I know this). Not to mention that I told her that I'm in a monogamous relationship now so that number will not be getting any larger any time soon.

At any rate, I have my results appointment next week. Even though I'm well aware that some diseases show no symptoms, I am feeling A okay with zero symptoms of things that can show (HIV, etc.). Despite this, I'm a nervous wreck about getting my results back. I have a feeling that this fear was instilled by the nurse handing me the pamphlet on abstinence and maybe the concern I thought she was showing towards me was actually judgement. They had an optional survey to take at the end of the appointment and I wrote down that I wasn't sure I would recommend this place if the person going has had a lot of sexual partners.

I guess I'm just looking to get this off my chest and read stories about other peoples' experiences if any of you are willing to share. Thanks for listening/reading!",6,20140514130115,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25k7pm,I'm terrified about what's happening in my family and I don't know what to do :(,"Hi. I'm writing this semi anon post that I hope just doesn't get too high on the list. I am really stressed right now because of a conversation I had last night with my mom. My mom and I don't talk very much. I live in a city about 3 hours away from her. She lives in a small town. She has been going through a divorce with my dad since last September that I don't really know much about. I could say a lot about the divorce (though I don't know much about the details), but I won't because I want to get to the most distressing part.
In her text messages to me she tells me prety much that she has given up on life. She says the cats are her only reason for living, and that she can't find a place to live with them. It seems obvious that she should give up the cats so she can survive. She works a decent job, but she commutes 40 minutes by car from her house, and it would be difficult for her to lie closer to work (small towns). But she says she has given up. After my dads mother kicks her out of the house she had been letting her stay in, she says she won't even look for a place. she will live in her car and then she is done... It makes me so sad to hear this. She told me that something in the last 3 weeks has made things so difficult she doesn't want to go on living. I asked what and she said ""it's not the right time"" and that soon I will know. She doesn't have much money and wants to buy me things to help me out all of the time. I'm barely, barely scarping by in the city and taking loans to pay rent while in college.

while in the middle of writing this I had a realization and understanding that the cats are very vvery important to her because her kids have fled. All of us are very distant with her, and the cats are the only things she has. Maybe she's like me and wants to talk to someone but doesn't know where to look. At least I know of the internet where possibly someone will read this (and possibly no one will).

Does anyone have any experience with these effecting your period?  I don't usually get my period outside of the usual nonhormonal pills at the end of each month - it happened once when I had forgotten to take a pill.  This month I started bleeding a week early, even though I've taken all BCP at the regular time.  The only difference has been the SSRI and benzo.

t3_25jq71,"Have the terms ""Feminist"" and ""Feminism"" lost most of their descriptive usefulness in western societies?","I initially wrote a longer post, damned near an essay, but it was really too much. Basically the questions boils down to the usual problems with using a single term to describe large groups of people with views that in this case range from the basic definition (those in favor of gender equality specifically as it relates to women), all the way to the the ""All sex is rape"" crowd (my personal idea of where the fringe is), and everything in between.

Since this ambiguity leads to strange outcomes like women themselves saying they no longer identify as feminists (and keep in mind they're not driven away by the fringe I just cited since that fringe makes up a fairly small population), I was wondering if people here see this uncertainty as a problem or just the realities of ambiguous language. Since XX seems to have a decent cross section of women and men, both activist and non, represented, I figured this might be a good place to post the question to gain insight into other people's perspective on things.",0,20140514112016,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25lcu0,"My father's sexism really bothers me. I don't want a ""girl bike."" [Rant]","Today my father took me to Costco to buy bikes for us.  He taught me to bike when I was four, and since then, things have been fine and dandy.  Well...today I learned that Costco has ""girl bikes.""  

Basically, ""girl bikes"" have a lower bar so that you can get your legs over the bike without making a large, swooping motion.  Whatever.  I thought the bike looked weird and I wanted the standard bike...which has now apparently become a ""boy bike.""

My dad pretty much insisted I take the girl bike.  When I asked why, he said it's easier to ride, as well as lighter.  So I proved to him I could lift the boy bike.  Then he said ""no, take the girl bike.  You're a girl.""  

We had a pretty loud debate about it in the middle of the bike aisle, and I eventually won out, insisting that I had a human body shape, two arms, and two legs, and could therefore ride either bike (they were the same price to, so I don't get the big fuss!).  

Now my dad keeps saying I'm going to regret my choice, and that the girl bike was made for riding with a skirt.  But I don't wear skirts!  And even if I did, why would I wear a skirt when I want to work out?

I'm really mad that my father tried to push a product on me just because I'm a girl and apparently can't operate anything other than girl-specific items.  It's dumb because I've been riding the ""boy bike"" since the early 90's!

I want equality for myself--to be seen as capable.  I accept that society can dish out some nasty sexism, but I didn't expect it to find it so close to home.  Doesn't my father want the world to see his daughter as strong and independent?

t3_25kvfy,Would anyone else be interested in starting a 2X book club?,"Some of the topics that I've enjoyed the most in spite of the recent chaos are those in which a lot of us get together and talk about characters we like in stories, books we like, and so on and so forth. To this end, I was wondering if anyone else might be interested in trying out a book club.

I have two possible ideas for how this could work:
(1) People could recommend 1 book per reply they make, and maybe give a sentence or two telling us what it is or why they like it. People upvote books they think they would want to read and discuss. And then the person with the most upvoted post makes a thread in which we discuss the book for the next month or so, depending on reading speeds, size of the book, etc.
(2) We could just start making more posts talking about our experience with women in books we read, author recommendations, etc.

I don't know how well a formal-ish book club would work with a large (and rapidly growing) community, but I wanted to gauge interest nonetheless.

For what it's worth, I would be very interested in hearing it if anyone had recommendations for where to start in reading Octavia Butler or George Eliot.

t3_25li9o,I donated my hair for wigs. This is my experience.,"Hey Twox, I've been having a bad day so I thought I'd share something I feel... mostly good about.

I have been trying to grow my hair out to donate it for wigs for cancer patients (and other treatments that can cause hair loss). I spent about five years growing out my hair. In that five years someone close to me was affected by breast cancer (she had a double mastectomy). She was my babysitter growing up but had at one time been like my big sister. When I found this out this mission became a personal one for me. I hated having hair past shoulder length, it's unwieldy and gets in the way (its windy where I live, it gets in my face and is tangled too easily).

[Here are my before and after shots](http://imgur.com/a/uaGwD) of what I went from and to. I raised 60 dollars. Unfortunately I also heartbroken to find out that it takes 4-6 donations to make a single wig.

Anyway, here is my experience, in a nutshell.

I didn't cry when I lost it. I'd heard lots of women tell me it felt wonderful and that everyone should shave their head at least once in their lifetime. It came off, it was fun. And then the self-consciousness crept in. As someone who colours their hair (I kept all of my length virgin hair, I just dyed the bangs which were too short to donate anyway) I shouldn't have been surprised that much of my identity was caught up in my hair.

I haven't had sex with my boyfriend in the two weeks since I shaved my head, every time I feel the urge to initiate I feel ugly. I know I'm not, I know I'm probably above average in attractiveness for a bald girl. People tell me I rock the look. But inside I feel so hideous and sexless. Sure it feels cool to pet and I'm getting more confident with the look as the hair grows back (I had it shaved right down to the scalp). I just can't easily get past the fact that I have no freaking hair.

When I go out and people stare I assume it's because of my hair and not because I look good. It's nice to not have guys leering at me, but it's still weird that when a cute guy is on the till at work and I know he's not thinking I'm pretty because of my hair. I feel unfeminine and awful.

And this is the best decision of my life. I feel no regret about this choice. Living like this has helped me realise how much a cancer patient has to go through. I can't imagine feeling sexless and unattractive on top of having a life-threatening illness. At least for me this was a choice. I can now properly empathise with alopecia sufferers and sympathise even more with cancer patients. This hair is doing something important. Besides, its just hair, it will grow back.",37,20140514222118,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25kztt,I guess I'm just looking for some advice,"Right now, I'm just really upset and I really need to vent. I'm so fucking done with creeps and guys who seem to take friendliness as a sign of interest - despite the fact that I'm happily in a 3-year relationship with an amazing man. I know not all guys are like this, it's just some recent interactions that kind of make me upset with these certain types of people.  
  
Last night, a guy who I *thought* was just a friend texted me, asking me if 'hypothetically' I would have sex with him if I didn't have a boyfriend. Obviously, I shot him down immediately and told him that, despite it being a hypothetical question, I have absolutely **no** interest in even considering sleeping with anyone other than my boyfriend. Then he revealed to me that he's depressed and that ""some feelings are hard to kill"" as well as self-deprecating texts like  ""I'm not really the person that most people think of having sex with."" FML.   
  
I knew this guy liked me in high school, but I figured that after *three* years and only seeing him *once* during this time, he was over it (I *know* he's had girlfriends in between). We don't even keep in constant contact (we just text each other once in a while and, often, our conversations have day, if not month, long lapses in between). Even in high school, I always made it clear that I had absolutely *no* interest in dating him and that all I was interested in was a friendship. 
  
I feel sort of...betrayed...? I mean, he's suddenly putting me in this awkward position and I sort of feel like maybe he's trying to make me feel guilty for not being interested in him (hence the ""I'm not good enough"" texts). It's not the first time I've been in this position either...  
  
My cousin's best friend who's 10 years older (kind of borderline creepy, in my opinion) developed feelings for me in January and started getting *super* clingy. I tried being nice, but he just would *not* take no for an answer - despite the fact that he knew I had a boyfriend. Every time I blew up at him, he would bitch to my cousin about how mean I was being and, of course, my cousin takes his side because, *despite his creepiness (my cousin is aware he's a douche and a total creep), he stood by my cousin when no one else would.* It got to the point where he would blow up at me for 'ignoring' him despite the fact I'm currently balancing work, university, and a social life. He **told** me that there were sparks between us (we *literally* only met 4 times...). When I told him that I was not going to talk to him if he kept bringing shit like that up, he got mad and told me not to ""threaten our relationship."" WTTFFFFFF....   
  
Of course, my boyfriend got pissed and intervened, telling him that he was a fucking creep and to stop contacting me, he *again* went to my cousin and I had to *apologize,* while listening to this fucking asshole talk shit about my boyfriend and him going on about how immature my boyfriend is (right...**he's** immature).   
  
I *only* got out of the situation when he got mad that I was 'ignoring' him (no shit) again and told me, ""Fine, I guess I won't bother you again!"" and I called him on his bluff, but in a nice way so he can't bitch about it (""Ok, thanks for understanding!""). So far, there has been 2 months of peaceful silence on all social media fronts, but it still makes me so fucking mad when I think about it.

I'm not currently sexually active, but have an LDR, so sometimes I am. I didn't lose my virginity till I was 22, and had an STD test a year ago saying that I was clean. I just had another test during my yearly physical, which came back normal. My primary doc also tested my blood, cholesterol, kidneys etc and they came back normal.

So, today (May 14, a week and a half later) my doc leaves me a voicemail saying that my results came back abnormal and she wants to discuss them with me. Of course, I immediately start crying and get anxiety. My mom told me she'd had one before, along with her sisters, and that they had this freeze thing and cleared off the bad cells, and all was good.

From what I'm reading, abnormal results aren't uncommon, especially in younger girls. Many said they had another test done, some a biopsy, the freeze test etc, and had checkups every 6 months until all was normal. The problem is I'm leaving for an 11-month teaching job in Colombia in about 6 weeks. I will have health insurance down there, so if anything I could see a Colombian doctor to have the test done, or fly back home during my school break which is around the 6-month time...

t3_25l65q,Terrible Communication. Please Advise?,"I'm having a terrible time communicating with my roommate and best friend of many years and I'm at the end of my rope for what to do. I'm hoping if I can explain what's been happening, someone will know what to tell me.

So, I've known the aforementioned friend basically since puberty. We'll call her Sam. Sam and I have been through a lot of shit together. Her parents are both emotionally and physically manipulative. Mine are emotionally distant and cold. We've done high school, college, all that stuff. So it's a pretty invested friendship, just for background.

The problem (and it's been a problem for a long time) is that I would say 98% of the time, I'm the one initiating communication with her. Maybe even more often than that. I'm not just talking about making big plans for outings either. I'm talking about stuff like knocking on her door to have a chat, sending links and things to make her smile, running across each other in the kitchen... Really any kind of contact at all, I'm the one coming to her. 

It's to the point where if I want to even talk with her casually, I feel like I am practically stalking her, waiting until I hear her out in the common area of the apartment and then ""casually"" walking out there myself with the excuse that I'm getting food or water or whatever just so I can see how she is.

She's also extremely weird about stuff like gift giving holidays. Now, I have to admit that I'm pretty good at presents. Like, I try really hard to put together something to make the recipient smile. I know that I'm in a somewhat privileged position in that I have a little extra money to throw around, but I don't expect presents to be big and flashy. Hell, a really cool drawing of a thing I like would make me smile. And Sam has gotten me some presents I have liked over time. But here's the weird part. She's really odd about letting me have them. I'll give her hers whenever and then sometimes I'll have to wait for months to get mine, even though she says she's had it since before the holiday/birthday. I've had multiple times where I've opened birthday and Christmas presents on the same day (when they would be half a year apart) because that's how long it took to convince her to give it to me. That's weird, right?

And because she never communicates with me, I always get super insecure that I'm bothering her, only she assures me that I'm not. She claims that her brain ""just doesn't work that way"" and that when people don't make plans with her, she just doesn't think about doing it. Yet, when I asked her if that meant she was forgetting about me (because I sometimes think of her during my day), she says that's not what she means. It's almost like she wants me to just let her get away with never showing me any friend-affection unless I sort of prompt her to.

Am I wrong to be confused? Saddened? Frustrated? Sometimes angry? Am I missing something that's going on here?

She claims that part of it is stress from a new job and I would understand that if her behavior had materially changed recently, but it's been at the same level for what seems like years now. She'll seem enthusiastic about interacting with me when we already are, but it's like I have to prompt her or pry it out of her. Last time we talked about it, she said she could work harder on it, but that's exactly what she's said every other time this has come up and I don't really trust her. She also seems baffled by just how upset this makes me, which is rather...

TL;DR Long-time friend who I really care about and have amazing times with when we're communicating never initiates and always seems confused that I'm upset about it because I should just accept that it's how she is.

t3_25lh1b,"Advice about contraception, Plan B, abortion...","Hi girls,

I'm freaking out at 6 AM and you're the ones I'm turning to (at least until I can get a doctor on the phone!)

This month, I switched to a new birth control pill because Yasim was giving me mood swings. I started this pill-- Qlairista-- one week after finishing the active pills in my last packet (so like 4 days into my period).

So with the new pills-- took the first 3 weeks, skipped the last week of placebo, bingo bango all set, right?

Turns out, this BC pill is a 26-day cycle (which I had never even heard of). I live abroad and all the instructions are in a foreign language which I didn't bother to parse through as I just assumed it was like every other pill I'd taken (I know, I'm stupid, I didn't think anything of the color change in the pills).

So. Basically I missed the last 5 days in my packet.

I took my last pill on this past Saturday. I had unprotected sex the day before that, and on Tuesday (two days ago-- it's Thursday morning here). I would normally have gotten my period around Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, but nada.

So, my question to you all is....help?! Should I take Plan B? Is it too late for that because I didn't finish the last 5 pills anyway? Or maybe I even started the packet too late? If I do take Plan B, will it make pregnancy tests not work and leave me in limbo for weeks? And, how do I go about getting back on the pill through this sea of hormones and medication?

Oh and-- took a pregnancy test last night and it was negative. I know it's pretty early for that, though.

(xpost r/birthcontrol)","I've (21/F) been on the pill off and on for 5 years and literally can't remember the last time I forgot to take it on time. I almost always take it within an hour or two hour window, and am aiming to be even more precise with the time by now setting an alarm. I've never had any sort of pregnancy scare or pregnancy.

My previous partner had always pulled out to be safe, however my current partner (monogamous, not worried about STDs) was the first that had come inside and I really enjoy not pulling out. We have been having sex 2-3 times a week for the past 6 months and he has always came inside.

However, his dad recently gave the lecture about being extra safe since neither one of us wants me to get pregnant and his dad strongly recommended using a condom, pulling out, AND having me stay on the pill. Neither of us like condoms but he is considering whether or not we should start pulling out as well.

I don't disagree that it would be even more safe but if I use the pill perfectly is it really necessary to pull out as well or should I be pretty much covered? I've read that perfect use for the first year is 99.7% effective, so does that mean 3 out of every 1,000 women who use the pill perfectly get pregnant a year? Also, all the studies I've read only use the first year of use. Since I've been on the pill for so long does that change the effectiveness for the better?

I know this ultimately comes down to a decision me and my boyfriend have to make but we want to be informed. I really enjoy not pulling out and would be bummed to make the switch but not as bummed as I would be if I were to get pregnant.",0,20140515004713,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25mop2,I think my boyfriend has an inferiority complex.,"I'm not sure who to ask about this, because my friends harp on him when I ask for advice. A little background: My boyfriend is successful, handsome and kind. He's got a great job, a great apartment just outside the city and we've been dating for just under half a year. I love everything about him, and he's been my saving grace through a rough year at college.

When I first met Jake he was a really, really boisterous guy. Large gestures, large jokes, large laughs - everything. I loved him for that and I was glad to spend time with him because he was like a big light in this little suburb outside the city. He used to make jokes at his own expense when people would be down on themselves and I *always* caught him cheering other people up or offering to help one of his friends. I once saw him drive six hours at the drop of the hat to help his cousin talk out relationship issues with his wife. Not a lot of people noticed when he did stuff like that but I did, and it's really what made me fall in love with him.

But lately I've noticed that he is so hard on himself. Too much. He considers himself short and he's 5'8"". He thinks that he's a ""smaller guy"" but he's more built than anyone I've dated (and he spends more time at the gym than even his ""gym"" friends). He calls himself stupid for mistakes he's made - stuff that happened over *three years ago* - and I can't help him move on. Sometimes he says he doesn't deserve me and then goes into this odd ""confession mode"" where we start talking about all the terrible things he did when he wasn't the man he is today. Stuff that I've come to terms with. Stuff that really, he never needed to tell me.

I don't know how to help him. He came from a family where his dad wanted him to be independent and I think relying on me for his emotional support is making it even worse. He talks about living up to his father's expectations and how he wishes he could have done better earlier a **lot**. All he does is worry about doing better but I think that he's doing just fine and I'm worried he won't be happy with what he has.

Everything about him is **great** and I don't know how to explain that to him. He's a great person, has a great job, has a great body and he has **me** and there's no way to get through to him that everything about him is great and he doesn't need to ""do better"".

What do I do? He saw a psychiatrist when he was younger for drug abuse and it had a negative effect on him. I don't know where to turn when he breaks down and I feel helpless to see the man that I'm in love with crumble in my arms for what sometimes seems like no reason at all.",82,20140515100304,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25n16i,Exhausted from dealing with my BFF's shitty relationship.,"Wow, looks like it's relationship talk day on TwoX!

I'm lucky enough to be getting married in a month to my favorite person on the planet, but I'm still having relationship issues in my life... they're just someone else's. 

My best friend is engaged to someone who is on academic probation and refuses to work because he doesn't like the only jobs he's able to get with his education level- physical labor or service work. He says his anxiety and depression keep him from holding these jobs, and has been fired or left several in the past few years. 

He pulls horrible shit that's just gotten worse over the years. This last time she called me up in the middle of the night, sobbing, is when she took him to the grocery store at night and he suddenly cannot handle her complaining about work when he doesn't even have a job, so he bolts from the car off in the dark, he won't answer her calls and she can't find him. His friends pick him up and refuse to tell her anything besides that.

I was staying in town at my parents that week to watch my little bro while they went on vacation, and I got her to stay with me for a few days. Every night she’s sobbing and freaking out, trying to get ahold of this fucknut who continues to hang up on her because if she speaks too fast she's interrupting him, and he’s suddenly decided he ""doesn't give her permission to interrupt him.""

I want her to be happy. I've told her so many times she doesn't deserve to be miserable, and this just takes the cake- this is not how someone that loves and respects you treats you. This is horrifying. He ran off into the middle of the street at night, he could have been hit by a car or gotten lost, he needs HELP, and she is not a professional who can give it. And she *knows* all of this, she's the one explaining what's wrong with him to me half of the time. She's brought up moving out on her own dozens of times, but it always comes back to all the obstacles that would make it too hard to leave on her own- not enough money, can't room with someone she doesn't know, ect. We live too far apart for her to move in with me and my fiancé.

After a two days of me staying up half the night with her while she freaks out (for completely valid reasons!) trying to get him to talk to her, my kid brother hasn’t been able to sleep well, and I’ve had to seriously consider that he might show up at the house and I would have to call the police because I cannot take the chance of someone so unstable being around my family. When she goes back home and talks to him, suddenly ""they both have things to work on,” and the absolutely imperative couples therapy she was going to demand as his last chance before leaving ""might happen I guess, it couldn't hurt."" Now everything is peachy keen again and hooray his friends will room with them so they can afford to move out of his parents’ house! I'm tired of being expected to be happy for her making decisions that I know, and she knows, will make life more difficult when things get bad again. I'm tired of being forthright with her about how it's just going to be another cycle and she should look out for herself, and her agreeing, but then not even doing the bare minimum of improving a relationship that continually makes her miserable. 

I want her to not feel judged and have a safe place to come to. I want to be there for her. I'm always trying to pump her up, telling her she deserves to be happy, telling her her feelings matter and that she wouldn't feel them for no reason. Things are “okay” now, but I'm running low on the capacity to handle this when it isn’t. After what happened with my brother, I realize I can't keep giving like this if it's going to hurt other people-- and me. My work suffers and my fiance falls on the wayside when I'm stressing over trying to help her, trying to find the right things to say that will be truthful because I want to show her I care and know this isn't making her happy, but not sound judgmental. And to be honest, I’m getting frustrated with her. I’m sure you can tell I am, and I really, *really* don’t want to be, but I am. What happened was horrifying, especially that I had to consider her fiancé jeopardizing the safety of me and my young brother alone in the house. I hate him, more than anyone. She’s my maid of honor and I don’t want her bringing him to our events, I don’t want to look at him, I don’t want him drinking with us, I don’t want her pretending everything is a-ok and being hurt when I don’t want to play along anymore because it’s all I can do not to just slug him for what he's done. 

I’m venting by this point. I just want to get all these negative feelings out because this is such a delicate situation and I don’t want to hurt her, I want to be there for her. I just need to find the right balance for what that means now.

t3_25n6hm,What do you all do when you get cat-called? Is there anything I *can* do?,"Up until last week, I had never been cat called (that I was aware of, at least). I've heard stories from friends about how awful it feels, and I was very grateful to never have personally experienced it. Then, last week, I was yelled at TWICE (in two different towns) by men in cars as I walked past.

The first was just a pretty standard ""Hey baby"" and some leers. I was very put off, but it didn't really mess up my day or anything. The second really got to me, though. I was walking alone at night in not-the-safest college neighborhood, and a taxi drove past. A man stuck his head out of the window and screamed at me ""Hey sweetheart, nice legs. What time do they open?"" The taxi never slowed down. 

It just took me so off-guard. I didn't really know how to react. I just felt violated, scared, and hurt. I was so angry that another human being would feel entitled to look at me and decide that my feelings of personal safety and autonomy are worthless. To think that his ""fun"" or ""jokes"" or whatever he would consider that comment to be, are more important than my right to not feel objectified, humiliated, and afraid. 

I didn't say anything the first time it happened. I did scream ""Fuck you"" after the taxi, but it had already driven away and I doubt they heard me.  I hear all the time about the shitty way women are treated on the street, and I've always found it deplorable and deeply upsetting, but this was my first personal experience, and I can't stop thinking about how awful it made me feel.

What do you all do in these situations? Is there anything I *can* do? I felt like marching over and screaming at these men, but I know that could put me in a dangerous position, and I know it wouldn't really change their minds or get them to reconsider the mysognistic roots of this behavior. But I don't just want to stand there and take it. It seems like there's no solution.

I've been told in the past to just ignore them. But to me, that doesn't feel like ""being the bigger person."" It just feels like acceptance of their abuse.",23,20140515130135,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25neu3,Sad about not having kids,"Throwaway because I'm kind of ashamed.

I have a disability. It's not life-threatening, and it barely affects my day-to-day life... ever, but it could maybe get worse if I became pregnant. There's no real proof either way--no major studies, even--just anecdotal evidence and enough concern from one doctor that I became really worried about becoming further disabled just as my husband and I were thinking about trying for a baby. 

We decided that we should adopt instead, and we've committed a lottt of money to the idea. But some days, I just don't want to do it. I'm afraid that the baby we might one day end up with won't love me or will always feel lacking because I'm not his or her ""real"" mom. I know I would love the kid, but I worry about society (since it's still ok to make adoption jokes on tv) and I worry about peers and I worry about... I don't know. Raising someone who will drift away from me one day? I know a biological child could do the same, and I know that a lot of adopted kids have amazing relationships with their parents. I just don't know of any positive examples in my own real life--only negative.

On top of this, my ""biological clock"" is screaming. Throughout the month, I have a few days where I'm ok with adopting and a few excruciating days where I'm just filled with regret at the decision because I just want ""MY OWN"" baby. I've never felt such a drive before.

t3_25n56t,"Yelled at in the street, completely baffled me","Story time! I was walking alone, at night, in San Francisco. It was in a pretty good neighborhood, mostly bars frequented by late 20s/early 30s working people. As usual when I walk alone, I was completely lost in my own thoughts, and didn't even notice the car slowing down as it approached me. I was walking in a crosswalk at this point. 

The car had four, maybe five young men in it. As it was ahead of me and slightly to my right, I did not need to turn my head or acknolwedge them in any way in order to watch them. They were making me nervous, of course. Then one of them rolled down the window and, in a voice that carried far too much aggression and vitriol warranted by the situaion, yelled, 

""Get out of the street!!"" I didn't move or speed up or physically react in any way. So he tried again, louder, angrier, ""Get out of the street, *bitch!!*"" I still did not react in any way. I find ignoring loud people is the best way to make them feel small. The car, in response, suddenly sped away in the opposite direction that I was walking.

I have no idea why that happened. The car did not wish to turn, I was not in their way, and even if I was...I was a pedestrian in a crosswalk, I had the right. And why would this person feel the need to try to intimidate me in this fashion? Why was he so angry, so threatened and mean? 

I think...I *think*, that since I was walking confidently and alone, that he felt I needed to be put in my place. Perhaps he knows that women walking alone at night always feel a tad insecure, and are therefore ""easy targets"". I don't know. This was months ago, and I am still baffled by the actions of those young men.

t3_25mxz9,My fellow lovely ladies... how do YOU tell your second thoughts to STFU?,"Hi everyone! I come here seeking your advice on what you do when that annoying inner voice starts fighting against you when in the process of making a big decision.

I'm going to give you a little context on what's happening right now. I recently applied for an illustration workshop located in Bali, and got accepted!! It's going to be a 5-day workshop with artists that I only ever dreamt of meeting. They're just. SO KICKASS. Here's the link in case you're curious. http://baliillustrationworkshop.com/

This is the part where the second-guessing comes in. I live in Costa Rica. Right now I work three jobs, one as a graphic designer and two others as a teacher at two different institutions. All combined my monthly salary doesn't exceed $1500. I'm 24. I don't have children or any other financial liabilities other than helping with the food and rent for my family.

I have never attended art school, and where I live there just aren't these types of art workshops. Everything I have learned, I've learned online. But something feels odd about travelling to the OTHER side of the world for an art class. I almost... feel guilty that I'm chasing a dream all the way over there. Something inside me is telling me this is stupid, and that I should stick around for my family. That I could use that money to pay for a post-degree in computer science or whatever shit.

I have never been able to do what I want. I have been working since I have memory, awful jobs cleaning tables, call centers. I studied computer science because I wanted to make my family proud and wanted to ensure a career that would feed me and them in the future. I have always loved drawing and it is through it that I haven't lost touch with the passions that keep me going day to day. I made some decisions which landed me in graphic design, and I'm happy, but I'd love to be a full time illustrator.

I feel this is the first step I'm taking toward realizing a goal that was nothing but a dream. Maybe it's just one other workshop but it means so much to me. I want to meet all the artists who will be teachers there and I want them to remember me.

But this is totally something new for me so I'm scared. I feel irresponsible and guilty. I want to stop hearing that voice that's trying to stop me. Girls, what do I do?

P.S. This isn't a shameless plug. Just want to share my drawings with you all so you can see what I draw when I'm able to squeeze time from my hectic, ultra-busy routine. http://steftastan.tumblr.com/

I was on the Nuvaring for a year or 2 when I was 22-23, but have only been using condoms since then. 

I never really experienced bad period symptoms until I was around 25 or so. Before that, I would have bearable cramps that could be knocked out with a few ibuprofen, very slight moodiness, and fairly medium flow. Around 25, I started getting weepy the week before, and easily angry. The first night of my period, I'm usually woken up with cramps, take a couple Pamprin, then back to bed. The first day is usually fairly uncomfortable, but I remembered how easy my periods were when I was on Nuvaring. Since its now covered under my insurance, I stated it almost a month ago. 

I took it out Sunday, and I've had some spotting, nothing serious. And I thought ""AWESOME this is a piece of cake!"" Last night, I had some twinges of cramps, but went back to sleep. I got up this morning and was a little uncomfortable, so I took a Pamprin. I went to work, felt really uncomfortable, took a Pamprin, went to the bathroom and SO MUCH BLOOD. Not just that, but stabbing pain and huge clots like I've never seen. I literally would have thought I was having a miscarriage if that were a possibility. 

I talked to my sister, and she said the same thing happened to her on Mirena the first couple of months and then it evened out as her body got used to the hormones. Anyone else have something similar happen? I left work early, I was dizzy, nauseous, and so sore. I'm feeling better now but I really don't want to do this every time I remove the ring.

t3_25n8z5,I think I'm being bullied by my instructor. Need some advice.,"Dear 2X,

I come once again to your doors for advice (via a throwaway)!  If there’s another similar post elsewhere please link me to it – on a quick scan, I can’t find anything.  It’s not an exceptional situation by any means.

I am a woman in my early thirties.  Last year I took up acrobatics – this wasn’t completely new territory to me, as I’ve been doing competitive pole dancing and aerial hoop for several years (competed and won nationally), I used to be a gymnast and contortionist, I’m a weightlifter and involved in numerous competitive sports.  In short – I am very fit, very strong and very capable.  This is important later.
	
In short, I’m pretty sure the acrobatics instructor has taken a massive dislike to me, and I cannot understand why.  I’ve ruled out constructive criticism, motivation, hidden jealousy or whatever the initial thoughts are.  As she runs the acrobatics school and it’s the only one I can travel to, she has the potential to make my life very difficult and there’s nowhere else I can go, and there’s no one more senior I can report her to.  I could understand her dislike of me if I was mouthy or loud in class, but I’m really quiet, I listen carefully, keep myself to myself, do what I’m told and rarely speak unless I’m spoken to.  I’m also in the middle of the batch when it comes to ability – I’m not the best but I’m far from the worst.  Generally unremarkable.  I’m there to learn new skills.    

Some examples of her treatment:
Every week she criticises me in warm up.  Very often it’s ONLY me that gets picked on.  It’s usually very minor stuff…one week she said I wasn’t pointing my toes enough, then when I pointed them, she said they were too pointed.  I looked round and the majority of the class were also not pointing their toes.  In fact, there could be 20 people there, and most of them are making the exact same small “mistakes” as me, and often many are doing things a lot worse.  She’s not helpful when she offers her criticism….she might snap “….I’ve told you before to point your toes, Jesus”, or just plain “…you’re doing this wrong.  Again.  STOP IT.”    

I asked her to show me a move again as I wanted to be sure of the positions etc.  This is a common request, and in the interests of safety, we’re encouraged to ask. She generally does things as many times as people ask.  When I asked, she stood up facing me, near nose to nose and said “Why should I?  Were you not paying attention?”  I opened my mouth to answer and she replied “look, just shup up, ok?  I’ll do it again.” 

After teaching me for several months AND performing in several shows she attended, she randomly decided one week that “I wasn’t strong enough for her class”.  This would be fine, bar the fact that I’m more than strong enough (see piece above about history in sport etc), I had already demonstrated these moves to her plenty of times and to add confusion, there are people in her class who genuinely aren’t strong enough.  This is an all abilities class, there are some absolute beginners there who can’t even tumble and she said because I couldn’t hold a split handstand for 30s that I “just wasn’t capable”.  She actually sent me home in front of everyone.  Another instructor (who I’ve competed with in pole comps) was horrified and demanded I come back the next week.  This nice instructor has now left.  

Most recently, she told me to “stop talking, you always over explain everything” when I mentioned that I was off last week and she had ASKED US if we’d be present in the last few weeks when a stand-in was teaching.  When I mentioned it she announced loudly in front of everyone she wasn’t sure if she should let me do training tonight because I wasn’t there last week and “who knows what critical thing I missed”.  I was genuinely shocked because 1. I very rarely speak, as I mentioned and 2. We were doing things I’ve done LOTS in the past.

So there we go 2x, I’m sorry for the rant.  I am genuinely confused and I want to try and sort this out.  Any advice?  If it’s any help, I’m nervous about confronting her because she is highly irrational and very snappy and emotional.  If she decides it, she could pretty much refuse to teach me and I’d have no -where else to go to learn this stuff.

t3_25nlnm,Will any birth control pill work for me?,"I've been trying to use birth control pills for a while now, but I've had nothing but bad luck. First I tried Trinessa. First time I tried it I stupidly started on finals week thinking that I wouldn't get any side effects. Instead I felt awful. I kept vomiting, had bad diarrhea, and constantly felt dizzy. I stopped because I had to finish my finals and the effects went away almost immediately.

I tried again a month or so later and instead had an allergic reaction to it. I had no other side effects that that time though. I was just covered in rashes though. I stopped that after about three days.

I then tried Minastrin 24 Fe. That was just terrible. I had diarrhea and nausea. I somehow ended up with a fever and couldn't do anything other than lay in bed feeling terrible for two days after I stopped taking them. I think at that point I had only had two of the pills.

I still want to try taking a birth control. My boyfriend suggests I stop because it just may not be the way for us. He doesn't want me going through all of this when condoms are so much easier for me. I still want to try one more to put my mind to rest I guess. Third time is the charm?

t3_25oqe8,A PSA: rape happens...a lot.,"I've been thinking about making this post for a couple of days. Now that we're a default subreddit, we've opened up to a broader group of people. While I don't think this should become a educate-men subreddit, I do think it is good to occasionally talk about things that our core users understand but our new users might not.

So what I want to talk about is rape. I want to talk about it because for the last week I have seen so many reddit threads circle-jerking about rape culture and the fact that women have been brainwashed to be afraid of *all* men. I've seen so many comments talking about how hurt men sometimes are when women don't want to talk to them on the bus, or cross the street when they see them, or just are overly-cautious around them. I think this is something that needs to be addressed and discussed.

Some men seem to believe that women have been taught/socialized by the media to fear men, or to think of all men as potential rapists. The truth is, we have been socialized to think that, not by the media but by life. Rape happens. It happens *all the time*. There isn't a woman alive who doesn't know someone who's been raped, or been raped herself. It's prevalent. It's real.

Here's a story. I am in a social group that includes many girls. Last fall, we had a special meeting where we got together and were given the chance to speak about our personal histories, if we wanted. In this group there were sixteen of us in total. Of those sixteen, FOUR admitted to being raped (two by their boyfriends, one by her ex-boyfriend, and one by an acquaintance). More than that, I know one of the other sisters well, and know that she has been raped (she didn't share that during the ceremony). I have never been raped, but I have been sexually assaulted twice (once by an acquaintance, once by a stranger). 

So in total, 6 out of 16 women in a room had been either raped or assaulted. Keep in mind that this is a group of college girls. We are all different. We come from different places, different backgrounds, different religions, different everything. And it was still 6 out of 16.

So yes, I'm wary of men. I'm wary of strangers. I'm wary that the nice guy I'm talking to is only telling me what I want to hear, and will get angry and aggressive if I turn him down. I'm wary that the guy on the bus who sits too close to me isn't just someone with a poor understanding of personal space. It's always on my mind. It has to be. Because these things happen.

That being said, I don't fear men. I know that there are a vast amount of great wonderful men out there. I have many of those men in my life. I believe most men are good. But I'm still cautious, and that's okay. We all have to work together to make this world a safer place.

To any men or women out there who haven't dealt with this topic in your life, please know there's a nearly 100% chance that a woman in your life, probably even within your own family, has been assaulted or raped. It's that prevalent. The best thing you can do is to be supportive and understanding. Parents, teach your daughters to stand up for themselves, to know that they can always say ""no."" Friends, look out for the women in your life. Be there and be supportive if she needs help.

[As a side note, I know that many men out there are raped too. I don't mean to diminish their situations by focusing on women in this post. I thought since this is a female-oriented sub it would be good to stick to a female perspective. However, men deserve our support and understanding just as much as women.]

EDIT 1: To those saying that so many of my friends were raped because we are in college, I would like you to read what I posted in reply to a comment:

>The answer is yes. Of the five girls I know were raped, one was raped in high school, one was an alum who was raped two years after leaving college, one was raped while visiting her boyfriend's family in the suburbs, one was raped in her dorm room, and one was raped at a party. I was assaulted once in high school and once at a college party.

t3_25nvmy,What to do when the police tell you that your rape wasn't actually rape?,"I've heard of this happening, but it's one of those things that you never believe is true because you just don't want it to be. I'm at a loss, and I'm sorry if there's a better way to find this information within this very community. But I'm sure there have to be resources somewhere? I just can't find anything, and I'll take any help that I can get.

A friend of mine was raped by a stranger (parking lot attendant) a few weeks ago, and I've been helping her get through it the best I could. She's done everything ""right"" since then (calling a rape hotline for support, going to PP for plan B, STD testing, even going to the ER for a rape kit), but it took her exactly seven days from the event to report it. By that time, she got tons of criticism from the male officer who filed her report. He asked her questions that, in my opinion, should have had nothing to do with his decision to rule that ""no foul play was identified"" in the final report. He asked if she was sexually active otherwise, when the last time she had engaged in intercourse was before the rape (more than 6 days prior), insinuated that the semen might be from the sex with her partner and not from the ""alleged rape"" that she might be making up since she was drunk at the time, asked how she knows she hadn't consented if she had been drunk, asked why she didn't scream or push him off of her (she did try to push him off, but she dreams every night about it and wakes up crying at the point where she doesn't scream). The officer also criticized her for waiting so long to file the report...etc.

So basically, this officer, who signed up to protect people by being a police officer, just made my friend feel ""like a slut"" (her words, not his.) and feel more guilty about what happened to her. Shouldn't a police officer understand that dealing with trauma victims is part of their job? Shouldn't that knowledge alone make you at least slightly understanding of the fact that some things take time? That you should be a little bit more gentle with victims and not treat them as suspects? Am I just crazy?

I just feel so defeated, and I know it is only a fraction of how defeated she feels. The injustice of it infuriates me so much that I don't even know what I'm asking for. I just want to help her. I want her to know that the world doesn't think she asked to get raped, even though that officer made her feel like she did. And, if possible, I want to know if there is any legal action that we can take in order to file a new police report, although I'm sure that's not actually possible once the original is filed, or maybe take action against that officer? 

Thank you so much in advance just for reading this. It felt good to at least get this all off of my own chest, at the very least.",90,20140515170758,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25nwwn,When is 'You Lost Weight' not a compliment?,"I want to take this moment for my first post, I have something that's been bothering me.

Let me start of with the fact that while I am not the skinniest I am a healthy and what some may even consider to be 'small' size. I work in Beverly Hills at a prestigious company. I am a receptionist and I make good money for an entry level position I came into with hardly any experience at an age where my peers have chosen college. I completely support myself which with the addition of a couple bills, lately means that I cant afford to eat 3 times a day or even twice all the time. As a result I'm sure I've lost weight but I wouldn't definitely know since I never weigh myself and I've never noticed any drastic change in the way my body looks.
Last week a male that I work with was talking to me and at some point he added 'You look good, you've lost weight!', and I was kind of taken back by that. I'm not completely sure why but it offended me. How could he tell I lost weight? Why was that a good thing? Was I not a good enough size before? Did I need to lose weight? I know he meant it as a compliment, but why would he compliment a healthy girl on weight loss?
Just yesterday at work I was speaking with another male I work with while I was eating and he invited me to walk with him and I said I should rather do that than eat seconds of this pot luck lunch we were having since I was completely stuffed at this point. He then said something like about how I've been improving ' You're going blonde, you've lost weight...', and once again I was offended and still not completely sure why. Why is changing my hair color an 'improvement'? I obviously needed to lose the weight right?
I can't seem to get it out of my mind, and I'm not sure if I'm over reacting. It was meant as a compliment but I feel insulted...

EDIT: Insulted is not where I was trying to go with this. It was more along the lines of 'Why should telling someone who is already healthy that they lost weight be a positive thing?'.",24,20140515172119,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25npuf,My armpit hair is strangling my self-confidence...,"Help!

For my entire life, all of the hair on my body has grown in incredibly thick. My leg, pubic, and armpit hair in particular is really thick and wiry. I can deal with my legs (though my pores are ridiculous) and my pubic hair, but my armpit hair frustrates me. My armpit hair is just as thick as the hair that grows in my nether regions. I lack the confidence to wear tank tops without worrying that I'll accidentally show my underarms and I always keep my arms down when I'm wearing a bikini. 

I have tried waxing (the hair was too short and thick to wax and I ended up just hurting my underarm skin), tweezing hurts like crazy, and shaving just leaves a dark shadow on my arms where the roots can be seen under the skin. 

My armpits look very similar to [this before picture](http://www.westderm.com.au/sites/default/files/images/underarm%20hair%20removals.jpg) all the time, except darker. I cannot afford laser surgery and I need to find another way to lessen the amount and thickness of hair under my arms. I'm tired of hugging myself when I have sleeveless shirts on....

We were best friends for a year and then started dating around 6 months ago. Both of us are rationally confident that we'd be more than comfortable spending the rest of our lives together and have discussed engagement in the near future. 

What's the rush, you ask? We're both surprisingly sure about each other. We've decided to wait until marriage for sex, and moving in together before then wouldn't encourage that decision, nor would it make our families very happy. We're just excited to start life together. 

He's already discussed it with his family and they're supportive. I'm terrified of confiding in my mom because she's wise to a fault sometimes. She would highly encourage waiting for both emotional and financial reasons, and while I clearly understand that, I also just want to be with my best friend. 

Are we crazy? I have no idea how to even ask my mom for advice without her thinking I'm irrational on the subject. I know that other couples get engaged after a few months and go on to thrive in wonderfully long marriages.

t3_25og15,I told my boyfriend about my eating disorder and now I just hate myself even more,"I'm sorry if this is a lot of text.. but I don't have anyone else to talk to. I lurk here all the time, and I know you all are very supportive. I hope one of you is kind enough to offer me some words of wisdom right now.

Last night I told my boyfriend (first time I've told anyone ever) about my bulimic behavior. When I eat a big meal, I throw it up. I explained to him why I do it - I'm very depressed and suicidal, and throughout my whole life I've been using food to help me cope. I used to be very overweight until I was about 17-18 (20 now), so I've always truly hated my body. Now, I'm a lot thinner (I lost a lot of weight in very unhealthy ways), get lots of attention, am considered ""skinny"".. but I don't look as good without clothes on. So I want to lose some weight until I'm happy. I feel obese, still. I feel like a whale. I want to die, but I  want to eat everything before I do. To be honest, I'm never full. I hate being around food because I just want to eat it. And if I do, I'll puke it all out. But if it was up to me, I'd eat forever, you know?

After explaining to him that food makes me temporarily happy and takes me away from my depression for a bit, he was worried and showed concern, etc. I specifically asked him for help because I know this is bad and I don't want to damage my teeth any more. Of course, he agreed to help. After the conversation, we went upstairs to his apartment and decided to eat. He made me promise I wouldn't throw it up (I wasn't going to, I had already done that before so I was actually hungry and knew I needed some food to function). As soon as I sit and am about to eat, he says, ""don't eat too much"".

At that point, I put my plate down, and decided not to eat. He didn't have a problem with it, and just continued to eat his food. He saw I was upset but I didn't want to talk. I felt like the fattest person in the world, and well, I felt broken inside, and decided I needed to eat a lot less because he probably agrees with me and also thinks I'm fat... I mean why else would he tell me that? I got the hint.. but I can't deny he made me feel horrible.. 

Fast forward to today, around dinner time, I tell him I don't want to eat. 5 minutes later I change my mind (I was going to puke it out anyway), so as I'm about to get some food, he says, ""I thought you said you weren't hungry."" I said ""I lied,"" to which he replies, ""you need to make up your mind."" He sounded annoyed that I decided to eat.. So, again, I felt like a cow, and decided not to eat. He then proceeded to eat next to me.

Now, a few hours later, we get to his place and he immediately heats up some pizza hut, and just eats it right in front of me.. doesn't offer food, doesn't care if I'm hungry or not (he obviously knew I skipped dinner earlier)... I mean, he doesn't have to offer food, I can eat when I want, but god, I told him how hard it is for me to be around food!!! why is he doing this?

I started to cry, so I told him everything I've typed, and he just said that he's sorry and that he didn't mean it, and that just eating in front of me was wrong. But then, why would he do it in the first place? I'm confused, I don't know why he's making this harder for me? I mean why would you tell someone with an ED that they shouldn't eat too much? Or why would you just eat in font of them when you know they are hungry all the time? :( Am I overreacting? I want to think that I am but I just feel so fat, I feel like I'm not skinny enough for him and that he's kind of doing me a favor by encouraging me not to eat. But a part of me still feels sad.

Look, I know that we shouldn't *have* to do this. I know that the onus should be on people not to rape/assault/etc., rather than to avoid being assaulted. 

However, and this is a key thing you all need to realize... Just because the onus is on them doesn't mean that the consequences won't fall on your head. To not be prepared to defend your person as best you can is to showcase extreme ignorance about how the world *actually* works. 

Right now, the top post is from a lady who is being stalked. To her, to all of you, I say this: 

**TAKE BACK YOUR POWER!**

Learn to defend yourselves. In an ideal world, and if you're lucky, you will **never** have to use the knowledge. But if you *do*, you will want it to be physically innate. You will want it to fall back on. 

Doing this may not prevent all bad things from happening, but if it prevents it once, it's worth it. If it makes you feel less afraid, it's worth it. And if it doesn't do any of those things... At least it's a good workout.

t3_25o1xt,I can't take NYC creepy men anymore. Here's what happened today.,"Creepy men everywhere are really bad but for some reason either there are more of them in NYC or they're just so much worse.

Today, I went into a restaurant in Manhattan in NYC.  The servers put me at a table next to a window with the seat facing the restaurant. The seats were facing the restaurant and the window, not sideways next to the window.  A few minutes after I sat down, I noticed a relatively large, domineering looking man wearing a white shirt that looked like a chef's jacket sitting in the corner diagnoally opposite from the corner I was in. While his seat was facing the opposite way from my seat, the seat was not directly turned toward me.

But *he* was turned directly towards me and looking at me. I looked at him and he kept looking at me. This went on for about *20 minutes.*  I wasn't looking at him the whole time and after a few minutes I was thinking, you've gotta be kidding me. Someone can't actully do that.  

But, you know, this is planet Earth, and someone, yes, can do that.

Finally after about 20 minutes, I turned to two women sitting at the table next to me and discreetly, without looking at the man, asked them if the man was looking in my direction. They looked at him and said yes.

About two minutes later, he was gone.

Later I asked the server who it was and the server told me that was the owner.

I mean, c'mon. It's not like I've never gotten stared at. But 20 minutes?

Ok. Yes, one of the women said he was just looking in that general direction and looking around.  The server said he likes to watch the restaurant to see how the waiters are and if the customers are happy.

But ok, if you're going to watch the restaurant, make it discreet.

You shouldn't make it a perfect excuse to stare at a woman who is eating by herself, who also happens to be the only Asian woman there.

You're all welcome to go ahead and think he wasn't actually staring at me for 20 minutes. Maybe he wasn't.

At the very least, if you watch your restaurant, be discreet about it!  No female customers like to get stared at for 20 minutes by a creepy looking man no matter what your real intentions are.

When I asked the server about it, he was really apologetic and understanding. I wasn't obnoxious about it, but merely pointed out what had happened.

The two women I asked were sympathetic and suggested I move seats, ""but then he'll know you're on to him.""

Anyone want to doubt that this type of stuff can happen?  Go to NYC!

EDIT: This is not the worst thing that happened to me from creepy men in NYC. Nor is it close to the worst that's happened to any women.

I would just expect that with something as routine as eating your daily lunch at a decent restaurant where most of the patrons are hipsters and yuppies, you should be safe. At least safe from staff. But so many of these managers and owners of restaurants seem to do it because they want control of a place, not to make customers happy. Has anyone else noticed that?

I'm not anti-relationship questions, but they seem to have become a large percentage of the total content. I can understand why people would want to pose a relationship question to THIS sub specifically because I identify with the community, and see a lot of supportive, non blame gamey advice. 

I think work interactions, and social interaction questions are more along the lines of this sub's daily mission because the advice is normally pretty universal while relationship questions tend to be very specific to the person posing them.

I think we should do something like Tuesday and Thursday relationship advice day... and (of course) the occasional post seeking advice about leaving an abuser should not be deleted because the poster's crisis didn't happen to fall on a certain day of the week.

Throwaway because my fiance is a redditor and I would prefer he not read my explicit detailing in this even if we have talked about way worse. This is my problem, and would like to see some opinions on it.

When I was in first grade or so, I remember asking my mom what the white residue left in my underwear was. She never really explained it to me, but it continued. It always seemed to leave a nice white seam line of my labia, concentrated at my clit.

It was normal for me to come home and change into gym shorts until my shower, then new underwear in the morning. I did this all through middle school and most of high school. It wasn't that bad. It didn't smell. It didn't make me feel uncomfortably wet during the day.

I took two shots of the Depo Provera starting at the end of Junior year, and over the summer.

The discharge was gone! Nothing. Zip. Nada. No problemo. I was a lot dryer and had to use some sort of lube for banging, but I was fine most of the time.

I went off of the depo shot in February when I moved in with my fiance. It was very gradual for my periods to get semi regular, and now I have had two real periods. For the first time in my life, I am bleeding on my own.

 See, I never started my period without birth control. First time was during the off week on the pills when I was sixteen. Depo was supposed to regulate me. Instead I got the flood of the red tide for a few months.

So now ladies, the root of the problem: I have an overabundance of cervical mucus at night and too much discharge during the day. I can't go back on birth control because I don't know how bad depo might have messed me up.

It was, by all standards, a really good time. Eventually my friend passes out in her bedroom around 1. I check on her every little bit to make sure she's okay.

One of these check ins, I come onto a male close friend of mine, helping two posing girls take selfies with her passed out on the bed. I got pretty upset. I berated all of them. I asked if that was how they'd want to be treated if they were passed out, and if that's the kind of respect they show for a friend. The girls got snarky and left, and the next morning I apologized to my friend if I was being rude to her pals. She said it's okay and acted nonchalant, but I haven't heard from her since.

I'm worried I've damaged the relationship, but at the same time, I stand by what I did.

t3_25owc3,My sex drive has evaporated/ personal anecdote about a skin disease that doctors aren't too familiar with,"Hi guys, longtime lurker but I would love your input. 

Basically, I had a series of infections ( strep/uti -> kidney infection/ weird allergic response to antibiotics ) and believed that I was essentially one of the unlucky people who are more susceptible to yeast infections. After a year of std tests and other random medications, it  turns out that I have lichen sclerosus- but luckily not visibly matching that on the image search. Essentially, I get intense bursts of extreme itchiness. Yeast infection itchy, and any friction (especially the kind due to penetrative intercourse) makes my bits swell up to blue waffle proportions. And semen *burns* ( I'm not allergic, it's probably due to the microtearing of my skin).

For anyone who has it, I suggest silicone lube, it helps a lot. It has made sex a lot less painful for me.  I used an high concentration corticosteroid which does stop the itching when applied, however, the irritated patches of skin have never completely healed.  I'm able to have a relatively normalish sex life again with minimal pain/swelling, but I'm definitely dryer than I have been in the past. Also, the longer the session, the more likely I'll really swell up. 

I'm just wondering now if I'm associating the pain caused by lichen with sex, or if it's a sign it's just something about my current relationship that isn't doing it for me anymore. I wasn't always like this. I used to love it, and now I don't really care. My partner is so understanding, and he hates to cause me pain.

t3_25pie9,Need some advice on how to help my girlfriend come to terms with what I suspect is years of abuse from her father.,"Hi,

I have been with my girlfriend now for a few months.  I really care about her and we have a great relationship.  But she has quite clearly suffered phycolgically and it has taken her some time to open up to me about a few things.  She does not want to go into too much detail but I am hoping that she will continue to view me as trustworthy enough to bear the burden with her.

I suspect her father has both physically and mentally abused her.  She is early 20s.  I don't know how long it has been going on and I don't know how far it goes and it worries me.   She has mentioned that her father has hit her in the past and still grabs her and stops her from being able to get away from him when she wants to leave the room.  I don't think it's like one of those crazed moments of fury kind of attacks, but more of the grabbing her arm and forcing her back into the room so he can continue to lecture her.  Apparently it has escalated to the point where she has told him to get away from her and he continued to force her to do whatever it was he was trying to get her to do.  She has said that he did hit her often when she was growing up.  Her father is a devoted catholic, and has a very successful career.  Seems to treat his family like property because he earns good money.....

I see classic signs of abuse.  I love my girlfriend, and she loves me.  We live in different states so it is long distance thing, but when she comes to see me she says she is so happy and relaxed.  But she is being pressured by her parents (remember she is in her 20's and able to make her own mind up) to break up with me, because ""only they have her true happiness and wellbeing in mind"".  They tell her that I couldn't possibly love her as much as her parents which is why they must do 'x'.  It real control issue.  

She does not live with her father, but she lives in his house (well-off family).  She is studying and does not have a lot of income.  Her parents have always said that they will let her live rent free while she is studying.  She lives with her sister who is just as bad as her parents in a lot of aspects.  She does not get along with her.  When she told them she wanted to move out of the house, they coincidentally started charging rent.  This rent coupled with the low-income-student situation means that she now cannot possibly save the money required for rent/bond to move - how convenient!

Basically, I wanted to come here to have a bit of a rant, but I also want to know what you all think?  She has started seeing a phycologist in the last month which I hope will allow her to work through some of this.   

What should I do about this?  I need to get her out of this toxic situation?  Any suggestions?

Sorry for the formatting (on phone), spelling, and general lack of direction.

t3_25pwjl,"Introducing /r/femmethoughts, a new womens sub and safe space","Hey 2xers! We know that some of you have not been happy about the recent change to make 2x a sub. I was one of the people outspoken in my criticism of 2x going default, and I've actually mostly come around. I still disagree with how the lovely mods here do some things. But they're grown a pretty freakin' awesome sub to the point that it was big enough to default. And one of the things I want is for women to have a greater voice on reddit, and having a woman's sub among the defaults is a great first step. 

But for those of your complaining that 2x isn't a safe space, well, you're right. But why fight over how to run 2x when you have alternatives? We deserve more than one great woman oriented sub! So, I'm here to introduce /r/FemmeThoughts to you. The only thing default about us is that we default to awesome!  

The goal of /r/FemmeThoughts is fairly similar to 2x. We're a casual, comfortable space for women and friends to share perspectives and experiences in relative peace. Our rules are relatively simple: don't be a bigot, don't wish violence onto others, don't doxx and listen to the mods. And above all, have fun! All genders are welcome, but this is primary a space for women. Mods will give warnings for lesser offences (like mansplaining), but bigotry and trolling get banned quickly.

After I got my eye brows waxed for my sister's wedding I started breaking out super bad around my brow and so did she, the goddamn bride who worked so hard to keep her face clear was breaking out like teenage girl. After calling the salon and asking what worked best we went out and got some Witch-Hazel. Within a few hours both of our faces were no longer red and the bumps were going down. After multiple applications throughout the day the ugly bumps and redness were nearly gone the second day, by the third day they were completely gone, nothing but smooth skin left behind!

I have always had ugly bumps due to shaving irritation for my area ""down there."" After I discovered this magical stuff worked on my brow line I tried it down there. OMG instant relief from the itching and the bumps are clearing up! Even the blemishes on my chest are clearing up!

SO- in conclusion- you need to have this as a staple in your beauty supply. This shit is amazing.

t3_25plre,Thoughts on the state of comments after the defaulting and how to make it better,"Reading the PSA: Rape Happens thread clarified my thoughts on why I am finding the defaulting so annoying.

This is a flawed metaphor, but bear with me.  Imagine that we are a calculus club.  We sit around all day talking about calculus, when suddenly a group of people barge in and demand an explanation as to why ""2+2=4.""  We say ""Because addition, but that really isn't what we are talking about today.  Feel free to sit in, but we are talking about calculus.""  They say ""Tell us what it means you fucking Calcunazi bitch.""

I found myself very frustrated in the PSA thread because there were some comments that were so erroneously wrong or questions that were very basic, that I couldn't not answer.  I just couldn't let a person ask ""Wait, consensual sex can turn to rape without someone fighting? Have I been raping my girlfriend?"" without answering.  I *COULDN'T*.  Continuing without answering would have been like playing a guitar without tuning it.  

BUT that wasn't the point of the thread!  And it was so incredibly frustrating to see comment after comment with people either wondering what 2+2= or insisting that 4 isn't the correct answer.  There is obviously need for dialogue, but TwoX wasn't supposed to be that place. It was supposed to be a place where we already all agreed that 2+2=4 and that a yes can change to a no mid sex.

The only solution I can see, now that we are defaulted, is to simply not engage.  Either downvote without replying (since very basic questions like that do not add to the discussion) and completely ignore the outraged ""EDIT: I'm being downvoted for asking a fucking question! Seriously!"" OR decide as a subreddit to post a standard answer like ""This isn't what we are discussing here; feel free to post to /r/askwomen"".  ",53,20140516084117,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25qf81,"I had something taken from me. I will never be the same again. I lost my virginity to my rapist, simple as that.","I would like to share my story of two separate occurrences that have drastically changed me as a person:

1. I was a young child and my sadistic abusive brother would make my life hell in ever way possible. One particular story that stands out was my brother and I alone for the evening in the home and out of fear (this was nothing new) I would hide in the bathroom, lock the door and push everything against it I could, like a laundry hamper and my legs.  My brother became so irate at this self preservation that he went into a classic rage.  After having to check out mentally for about 4 hours my parents return to find the scene, he had stabbed the door about 50 times with a large kitchen knife, kicked down the door and was on top of me cutting my throat with the same knife.  To this day he has never apologized, has never spoken of any of the hundreds of incidences like this, I truly believe he is a terrible person, just that simple.  Given I grew up in a very wealthy household all of this was hidden form everyone, no therapy for me, no special family talks about situations, no anything, not even my father protecting his youngest child who was almost murdered many times.  I hurt deeply inside and due to all the abuse I received as a child I have no memories of being young, don't know what elementary school was like, what field trips I went on, who I was friends with or what games I played.  I had no childhood and it pains me deeply.

2.  In college I am living with my SO and two more roommates.  SO and I end a 4 year relationship and go our separate ways.  Another roommate tries really hard for something physical, but I continually reject the offers and am very clear with my boundaries (something I learned from my childhood).  After a night of heavy drinking (liquid relationship therapy), I end up in bed with this roommate due to a lack of control on my part, again I was clear though, no touching, no anything, and I just passed out.  The next morning I am awoken by them having sex with me and the confusion and overall overwhelming emotion of hatred for this person instantly.  I had been waiting to have sex when I was first married, something without religious purpose, but something I cared about deeply at the time.  This was taken from me by a greedy and shitty person.  I went into the college offices to speak to people because I was in a rental contract with this very person and needed all the support I could get.  I was literally laughed at and turned away due to 'no evidence' and my word against theirs.  I still cry about it to this day, over ten years later.

Why do I say all of this?
1.  I need to get it off my chest, it pains me to think I am not alone in these situations, and that others experience this very same hell on earth.

2.  Sharing information can enlighten others to realities that exist, I appreciate support, but really I want a conversation on this, so others can learn from my experiences.  I am open for questions, responses, support and hatred. I would like a conversation as a result, feel free to join in.  If anything rubbed you wrong in what I said, call me out on it, so I may learn (and apologize).  

3. I am a male, my brother a male abuser and my female roommate a female abuser.  Both are people I will remember until the day I die, for the way they walked on me and took my purity in more ways than one.  Rape is rape, abuse is abuse.  The type of language used in this subreddit hurt me, literally villify men as a form of support to each other.  I would like to point out, I have suffered at the hands of a man, and it wasn't a gender issue, it was literally a physical representation of that persons hatred for themselves, much like a drug addict may push the limits so much out of self harm.  I was the victim yes, but it wasn't because of who I was as a person, quite the opposite.  I represented what they didn't have, morals and values.  And try as they may, I will never move on those.  Also, I do not look like one would imagine: I am 6'2"" tall, with a shaved head and broad shoulders and a strong voice.  More often than not women cross the street when they see me walking alone at night, I am assumed to be the attacker due to my looks.  Yet my experiences say otherwise. 

4. I am genderqueer (see my two stories above for some background on why).  I believe we proliferate a serious amount of issues due to gender definitions in our society, things like telling girls looking pretty is part of their job, or telling boys they must be ferocious and fight for what they want.  I will not bash anyone, for any reason, period.  

5. I will never know what it is like to be a female, period.  Just like I will never know what it is like to be my brother and have a mindset that can justify such horrible actions.  I am extremely empathetic and believe that having an open mind that sees the other side of the story changes things. 

6.  I wanted my stories to be void of genders, not to hide that I am a male, but because I am genderqueer and see such strong male bashing here that it hurts.  I have never disrespected a womans boundaries (nor a mans), I have never physically attacked anybody, I have supported/stood up for men and women who very clearly were being abused in their relationships or by a stranger.  I live like I think all people should, yet my gender can make me feel like the bad guy in this subreddit at times.  This needs to change.  Emotional support can happen without bashing, empathy can happen without hatred, love ought to be shared by all.

I love you all, you are my family.  We walk this land together, share many things and are unique in others.  Please take my hand as we continue to walk this earth and make our home the most beautiful place possible, one where a smile is the norm, where support is everywhere, where everyone is respected and we can all grow into the amazing creatures we are meant to be.

She's lived with it a long time, and retires in less than a decade. She goes above and beyond what's really required of her position to try and branch out networking and communication, but she has gone unappreciated (which hasn't really bothered her) and a newly arisen issue of someone trying to seriously put her down has made her question that maybe she should stand her ground a little more firmly.

t3_25qicu,A Question for the Women of 2x,"Hello Women of Reddit! (And the men and trolls listening too.) I wanted to ask what your thoughts are on the men who come here due to hearing about the influx of trolls once this became a default. Do you dislike them for trying to help out? Angry at them for being here? I want to start a serious discussion, that includes the women AND men. Let's talk about this calmly and rationally! Do you want the men who came here to fight the trolls or support the women to stay or leave? I've gotten a few pieces of advice i like, such as not apologizing for the jerk-ish men, not calling yourself a nice guy, etc. Any advice for the men who risked the wrath to come here and see what was up? 
Edit: After so many negative comments, after a simple request for a discussion, i'm out of this sub. Too many trigger happy people shooting anything that moves. Good luck 2x.

t3_25q375,My Paraguard Story!,"When I was researching different forms of birth control, a lot of negative or scary stories came up for IUDs, which sucked... because that was the form of birth control I most liked. I ended up having a Mirena, which is a hormonal IUD, inserted when I was about 19. 

Let me start by saying I suffer from panic attacks, anxiety, and depression. I am being medicated for it successfully, so it hadn't been a major, life-stopping problem for about a year at the time of insertion. I'm not saying necessarily that the Mirena caused it, but I started getting anxious and panicky afterwards with no cause that I or my family or friends could determine. I was happy with my job, my SO, my living situation, etc... So, I decided to have it removed in hopes that, even if I was making myself panicky over the hormones, my anxiety would dissipate. The anxiety went away and so did the annoying break outs I seemed to be having. So I just used condoms for a while until I finally made an appointment to have a Paraguard (non-hormonal) in. 

I went in on the last day of my period (a feat in itself as I have irregular periods, don't worry I've had everything checked out, my body is just weird.) The cramping was no worse than a bad period cramp and it was only at it's worst while my cervix was being held open by the clamp. It was moderately sore for the next two days afterwards, which went away with some ibuprofen and a HarryPotter-a-thon. 

It's been in for two and a half months. A lot of women say they bleed more heavily afterwards or that their cramps are worse... Here's the weird part, I've had mildly heavier bleeding, but my period cramps have all but disappeared. Also, and this could be completely unrelated, my period has been on-the-dot on time for the two months after. We shall see if that continues at the end of this month when I'm due for my next cycle. 

While I was researching IUDs there were a lot of horror stories. Women who had incredibly painful insertions with long after-effects. My experience was incredibly positive, especially given that I have had no real side effects. AND, the best part, I don't have to think about it for the next 10 YEARS--possibly even longer! At a 99% effectiveness rate as long as it stays in the correct position which is pretty easy to check and very easy for your OBGYN to confirm. I had mine checked yesterday.

So, if you're having issues with hormonal birth control or problems remembering to take your birth control every day, I sincerely hope you give the Paraguard a try and that your experience is as positive as mine was!

If anyone has any questions about my experience, feel free to ask or send me a private message if you're embarrassed!

(EDIT: TL;DR: I had a Mirena, not so happy. Got a Paraguard inserted instead. Magic and unicorns and no side effects for me! Yay!)",0,20140516115453,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25qcx2,To the mods of TwoX: Going default was a good decision,"We've heard a lot about why everybody thinks the defaulting of this sub was a bad decision.   

* On the one hand, we've got the faithful TwoX subscribers who are battling the influx of shitposting and rage-inducing commenters and fear that our little 'safe' space is going to the dogs. 
* On the other hand we've got the MENZ. The ones who are pissed off that their internets are contaminated with with girl germs and instead of unsubscribing, they'd rather tell us how wrong we are to think we deserve a portion of their all important brain space (it is usually quite limited in these specimens, so I can see why they'd want to prioritise it...)
 
While I have zero sympathy for the latter, and a lot of empathy for the former... I still disagree with both. I think making TwoX a default was NEEDED, and I'm glad the mods decided to give it a go. I hope they stay with it for a little bit longer. 
 
My reasoning: reddit needs more diversity on its front page and in its default subreddits if it's ever going to become a less shitty echo-chamber of awfulness. As a woman and a redditor for 7 years or more (on my regular account) I've seen reddit go through a lot of changes. Over the years, I've retreated into fewer and fewer subreddits because of the shitty behaviour and opinions of the masses. There are now maybe five subreddits I visit on a regular basis, twox being one of them. I'm not a particularly fragile flower, so the fact that I feel reddit is basically a hostile, unlikeable space for the most part is probably a good indicator that plenty of others do too - and anecdotally I think we can all agree a lot of women feel that way.  
 
**This general awfulness will never change unless there is more diversity in the defaults.**

Does this mean things are going to be easy? No. It probably means TwoX will go to shit... for a while at least. It probably means the mods are going to have a hell of a job moderating shitposts and shitty comments. It means we, the community, are going to have to put up with some uncomfortable situations - and I by no means think the community has to put up with something that makes them uncomfortable. Sexual harassment or rape threats or anything of that nature is **not acceptable**. For users who have to deal with that (and the fear of it is what's causing me to use this alt today, tbh), I'm not sure what the answer is. I'm not sure what's best. For those who choose to stay and engage in TwoX anyway, we'll have to be strong and vigilant and report bad behaviour to mods and admins.  
 
Default status may even mean - worst case scenario - that TwoX is unsalvageable. But I know that you're not going to make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. Hopefully the eventual omelette of a nicer, more equal and tolerant reddit is a delicious omelette worth fighting for (ok, my metaphor ability sucks...)  
 
In the mean time, I'd like to mention that /r/SRSWomen exists - it's a lot like TwoX but men are explicitly forbidden from posting/commenting and some women here might find it a safer space than TwoX until shit dies down here.  
 
**edit:** if there are other women-focused subs that explicitly foster a safe space for women, let me know and I'll list them here too. I realise /r/srswomen might be offputting for some, but I honestly don't know of another sub that strictly enforces a safe space for women...  
 
**edit 2:** Another sub recommendation: /r/FemmeThoughts - for those who don't want to go to SRS",0,20140516133452,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25qtev,My ex ditched a broken condom and came in me two days before ovulation day. Just found out. Im FREAKING out. (xpost),"Ex and I broke up because in short, he is a crazy cheating manipulative person. Well I ran in to him at the bar Friday and he was charming as ever, I feel hook line and sinker for the ""I miss you, I need you, I love you, just spend one more night with me""


I'm rather drunk and his house is across the street so I go home with him because my daughter was at her dads for the weekend anyway. Cuddling and crying turns in to crazy sex. Tried to talk a couple times after but it all went back to me being upset about the past and this morning I told him this will never work and I was sorry I went to his house. To which he responds ""Well I wasn't going to tell you but the condom broke and I ditched it"" I freak out and ask if he came in me to which he says ""Im pretty sure""


FUCK. FUCK. I check my period calender, the day he did this was two days before an egg drop. So, for those who don't know, one to two days before your actual ovulation date is absolute prime time to get pregnant.
I am a very fertile person. I have a daughter and had a miscarriage 2 years ago (same dad to both).


It's too late for a plan B. My boobs are super sore and feel much worse than PMS. I have the discharge I had the first two times. and I am FREAKING the fuck out. I have a terrible feeling. A lot of girl who have ever tried to concieve will know this feeling and these symptoms, it's just a funny one. I chalked it up to PMS but this makes so much more sense. You usually don't notice these things unless your trying to get pregnant, which is why it made so much sense today.


I took my daughter to walmart after he told me this through a text and it was so different than the first two times I was pregnant. My ears were ringing and I got dizzy in when I walked by the baby stuff, just thinking oh my god, please, no. Im in a daze right now and I don't even know how to think straight and I don't even know if this is real.


I haven't responded to him. I feel like he meant to do this because he hates the idea of me not being in his life. I fell right in to this trap and Im terrified. I don't know if I can have an abortion, I'm still fucked up from losing my second child.
Fuck. Idk what to do.


As of right now, if I am pregnant, I'd like to think about it for a few days. But if need be I will have to cancel my vacation I have been planning since January for next weekend, and use the money I have saved for an abortion...Im just not sure I can bring myself to do it...Fuck....and there is no way I could tell him ever. He wouldn't support it. I know he wants a baby, he was mad one of his ex's had an abortion. So telling him if I abort it is not an option which means 0 support.....or I keep it.....which seems just as crazy.


tl;dr: Ex is pretty sure he came in me after ditching a broke condom and didnt tell me until it was too late to take a plan b. Im a really fertile person. I cant test until next week at the earliest, but im freaking the fuck out.",19,20140516162550,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Some girls have told me that they keep their keys in their hand when walking or that they keep pepper spray with them. Others have taken self-defense classes. One girl has even said she messes up her hair whenever she is on a late-night subway ride in order to look insane and turn away any potential predators.

t3_25rflf,"Boyfriend (25M) sees things in the media and constantly tells me (20F) that I would look ""so hot"" if I dressed like that too... how do I take this?","I know that he's probably just trying to be helpful, but I'm sick and tired of hearing this stuff. I told him once or twice before that I dress according to my own style (which isn't unattractive either) and that I appreciate his fashion advice and I might give it a shot sometime. 

Like for example, he's been telling me to wear thigh high socks, colored pants (like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l8CcsKERqNI/T4H6h8qiyGI/AAAAAAAAC-k/aaGJWOgWA10/s1600/mint+jean+options.jpg) or [this](http://forelyse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mint-Sk1.jpg)), super tight sweater dresses in the fall (like [this](http://image.venusswimwear.com/is/image/Venus/Z9893BKWH.22?$ProductPage380x532$)), leggings instead of jeans or jeggings, etc. 

I feel like he's trying to tell me how to dress and it makes me SO fucking mad sometimes because I know that he's just getting ideas from other women he sees in the media/around town. He makes me feel like I'm Plain Jane even though I think I'm not. 

I always refrain from ever being anything but polite when talking with him about the manner. I'm sure he is just trying to give me some genuine advice. But in the back of my head, I'm asking myself ""Why is he telling me how to dress ""hotter""? Why does he think that I need his help? Am I that bad? Am I not good-looking enough?""

It's even MORE infuriating because, truth be told, he's pretty average-looking himself. He's nothing like the men I see in the media/around town but I never fucking ever tell him how to dress so that he looks ""hotter."" 

Whenever he tries on something, I'm always so supportive of him. It's not that I always like his style, either; I'm honest with him so if needed, I kindly let him know if something is not flattering on him, and he always takes my opinion seriously, which is nice. 

Whenever I *DO* try to step out of my comfort zone a bit and try something new, 7 out of 10 times I pick out something, he always just makes me feel like my selection is ""ok."" He's only impressed when I pick out something that he has specifically mentioned would look ""hot"" on me or something of the same caliber. 

SO WHAT IF I LIKE TO DRESS SIMPLY? SO WHAT IF I DON'T LOOK LIKE GIRLS IN THE MEDIA? SO WHAT IF I'M NOT FASHIONABLE? I wish he'd just SHUT THE FUCK UP and be happy with and supportive of how I dress/look! 

I LOVE HIM BUT WHENEVER HE DOES SHIT LIKE THIS, I JUST RAGE SO HARD INTERNALLY. I'M SO TIRED OF IT. And I don't have the guts to tell him all that I've written here because deep down, I know that he's just trying to be nice/helpful BUT HE'S ACTUALLY DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE.",6,20140516205257,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

The wedding is in our mutual home town.  I currently live with my boyfriend (she is aware that we cohabitate, though they have never met).  Upon receiving the invitation, I noticed it was addressed only to me.  The RSVP card has a single, long line (long enough for multiple names) and boxes beneath to check whether or not you will be attending.

So my question is whether or not I should ask if my boyfriend is also welcome to attend, or is that rude?  We live together and are contemplating marriage, so it isn't as if he is just a fling I want to bring on a whim.

t3_25rftj,Feminism and Men's Rights: Discussion,"I have a question, 2X, which has been bothering me for a while.  I identify as a feminist, but as a feminist I also campaign for men's rights.  Gender inequality does not, I believe, affect just the glass ceiling but also the cutthroat, man-up attitude of career driven persons.  I think it has to do with women being perceived as sluts and men being perceived as predators; of women being seen as weaker in all aspects and men being seen as stronger in all aspects, least you be not womanly enough or not manly enough.  However, I've recently come against some contrary opinions, and I'm thinking perhaps feminism is not necessarily the platform that is supportive of both sexes.

My question, 2X users, is: do you feel that feminism and men's rights are compatible?  By empowering men to break from their own gendered stereotypes are we opening the door to more opportunities for ourselves as women and future generations of women, or does this simply take the focus away from women's goals and rights?

However, every time I *do* eat, I get nauseous because I'm literally forcing myself to eat, or I just don't feel hungry anymore. When I eat, I make sure I'm eating smaller portions, because I don't want to waste food that I know I won't end up eating.

t3_25rb3i,My abortion story.,"A little over a month ago, I had a medical abortion.  In the days before, I searched reddit relentlessly reading people's experiences with abortions.  I can only assume a lot of people would do the same if they were in a similar situation, so I'd like to add my experience (and will attempt to limit the emotional stuff surrounding this).

April 10th I went to my appointment at Planned Parenthood for a medical abortion, which is the one where you take some pills and basically induce a miscarriage.  My mother told me I should just go to my regular gynecologist but for some reason when I realized I needed an abortion, planned parenthood was the first thing to pop into my head.  I also kind of preferred going to a place where I didn't know any of the doctors or nurses.  I was already ashamed even before I went through with it.

My visit consisted of a lot of questions about health history, emotional state, and whether anybody was abusing or pressuring me to do this.  Then there was a vaginal ultrasound which, before I was there I told myself I wanted to see it, if I was going to terminate it I could at least face it and see it before doing so.  When the time came, I told the nurse I didn't want to see or know anything.  

They gave me the first pill at the office, and while I'd held it together just find beforehand, as soon as I swallowed the pill I could not stop crying.  Everything in my life logically said there was no way I could have this baby and the best thing was to abort.  Emotionally, all I could think was I was this tiny creatures mother and I was killing it.  It's the most emotionally draining and devastating thing I've ever gone through.  There were two more pills I had to take at home the next night, and I was terrified of the pain.  Almost every story I read was about how utterly crippling the cramps were with a medical abortion.  Girls rushing to the ER, girls laying on their bathroom floor in agony for hours, etc, and I was terrified.  They told me to take ibuprofen and didn't give me anything else for pain.  

The next night I took my own regimen of Tylenol and then ibuprofen starting 45 minutes before I took the pills.  About an hour after taking the pills the cramps started, and honestly I've had worse cramps during my normal periods back when I was in high school.  For me personally, it truly was not bad.  It was mildly uncomfortable, but completely bearable.  Every 30 or so minutes I had to go to the bathroom and could feel a rush of blood and clots coming out.  The clots weren't painful in the slightest, but they were very unsettling to feel coming out.  

After a few hours the bleeding slowed and everything seemed fine.  I went to my 2 week follow up appointment and they said it looked like everything had come out and that was it.  So I went about my life.  

2 weeks after the follow up, I had a couple of days of very light spotting.  No biggie, I wore a pad for those few days because it was really barely anything.  Then one day I was getting up from my last class of the day and I felt this unmistakeable rush of blood.  I got to a bathroom ASAP and saw that the pad was completely saturated with blood and had gotten through to my pants.  I could still feel it gushing out on the toilet and it had even gotten on the floor.  Once again, I was terrified.  I cleaned up (thank god I still had a huge pad from the abortion floating around in my backpack) and went to my car and called planned parenthood.  I told the girl on the phone I was gushing blood and was there a nurse or anybody I could talk to who can tell me if I need to go to the ER or not??  She told me nobody was available, but I could leave my name and number.  I begged her to please just give me somebody who can tell me if this is normal or not, and I kid you not she started going into a whole ""well, as we get older our bodies change, so your body might just be changing..."" speech.  Basically they told me someone would call me back the next day, so I went right ahead and called my normal OB/gyn and they wanted to see me right away.  

It turns out, the abortion hadn't expelled the whole thing.  I still had ""retained products of conception"" and was still showing up positive on the pregnancy test.  I had to have a D&C, which is basically where they go in their and scrape out the whole lining of the uterus manually.  Aside from a C-section 4 years ago I've never had any type of surgery at all, and I've never been under full anesthesia before.

The surgery was yesterday, and I guess it went fine.  I had a really difficult time this week and can't even estimate how many times I broke into tears.  Every single doctor, tech, anybody kept asking the same question: when was your last period?  And I had to tell people over and over what I did.  The only reason I started to get over this is because as time passes I think about it less, not because it gets any easier to think about.  This past week I've had no choice but to face it and think of it constantly.  But anyway, the surgery was fine, it was over before I knew it, I didn't feel a thing, and I've been in no pain whatsoever since.  I regret not going to my doctor originally, but then there's a lot of things I regret.  

I knew that no matter what choice I made, whether to abort or not, I'd likely regret it.  But all I know is the choice I ended up going with.  And I can't stop thinking about if I'd chosen differently.  ",0,20140516195400,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

Oh, and it sucks even worse because we're roommates. Separate rooms, thank God, but still roommates.

t3_25roys,I just needed a place to vent/rant/figure shit out- relationship issues,"Long story short, I've been in a pseudo relationship with a guy since the beginning of the year. Neither of us wanted anything serious, it was my first ""relationship"" and he was teaching me about sex and whatnot. It was fun, and nothing serious. We never really talked about what we were, and I know I shyed away from talking about it with him, because some part of me knew what he was gonna say. Anyway, we hang out this past week. He mentions he has a date with a girl next week. I played it off because hey, we never talked about any of that shit. Part of me really doesn't mind. I don't feel passionately about him, and it's not like I love him or anything. I see him as somewhere between a friend and a boyfriend, maybe more towards the boyfriend end but without the attachment.

But the other part of me was really hurt. I'm fat. I know I am (but I'm working on it!). He mentioned something about my weight on our second date, more saying hey if you wanna lose weight you'd be able to do more sex-wise (I'm easy, what can I say). It hurt me, and I let him know that. Since it seemed like he wasn't attracted to me so why waste his time with me? But he kinda assured me his comment was meant more as logical, and not as an attack. That made sense to me, since I have a habit of saying things like that that can be taken as offensice when I don't mean it to. Now knowing he's activiley looking for other partners, I find uncomfortable. I feel--- I don't know, used? Like he was doing me a service by sleeping with me and showing me the ropes, but now that someone he actually finds attractive comes along, what happens to me?

Again, it's not like I want to marry this guy or anything. But I liked what we had-- what we have. We saw each other every so often (he lived in a different state, I'm still in college), spent a couple days together, and then when we weren't together, we skyped and texted a lot. Again, it wasn't passionate or serious, it was fun. But I liked it. I'm still in school and am not looking for nor do I have time for a super serious relationship. I just feel like this is like his way of saying ""I'm done"" or ""I've found someone better"" without actually saying as much.

I don't know. I don't know how I feel. I've been used a lot in the past by friends, and I don't want to be used by partners, and I think this might be the path I'm heading down now with this guy but I also don't know if I'm overreacting because I tend to do that a bit as well.... I'm a rather indifferent person- if nothing is very wrong, I'm perfectly content. So maybe that's the problem? I was content with what we had, made no obvious advances so he figured we were jsut friends? Maybe?  I don't know what I'm expecting out of posting this here. I guess maybe just some other women's perspectives would be helpful. I have a lot of self confidence issues (which I'm working on) so I don't want to be sued but I'm afraid of upsetting people or having people be mad at me, so I don't like questioning things or standing up for myself.

t3_25r2l1,"On working with women who think you're ""scary""","This is a potentially controversial post, but I want to get perspective from other women and their experience.

For the longest time, I couldn't relate to feminist blogs that talked about difficulties in working with men in the workplace. I'm feminist as all hell, but I've had the most trouble dealing with other women, specifically white women. (Before anyone gets upset, I'm also white.) My attitude is more direct than passive-aggressive, more ambitious than uncertain, and while I'm not being Ms Barch in the office, I'm not exactly being Brittany, (I'm probably more of a Jane) and I think it keeps screwing me. The hiring managers everywhere I've worked or interviewed have been white women and I've noticed a trend in how many are passive, calm, speak quietly, smile often, avoid conflict, and will never tell you if there's a problem because it's easier to complain to others than talk to you. I am more the type to ask someone if there's a problem so we can resolve it, I usually get a big smile about how there is no problem, and then word travels back to me within the office about how so-and-so thinks I'm ""scary"". (""My name is Juu Dee. Everything is fine in Ba Sing Sae."" You know the drill.)

After years of being told to show off my passion for the company I was applying for and to list all of my accomplishments and how I can apply them, I realized it wasn't getting me anywhere. A few weeks ago I tested my theory in an interview, submitted a resume with several accomplishments omitted, lower test scores, and spoke in a flat, spacey tone of voice about ""finding myself"" instead of where I saw myself in five years at the company. She thought I was perfect. I got the job. (I accepted another elsewhere.) I couldn't make this up if I tried.

I spoke to a few of my girlfriends about it and while some have felt empowered by the idea of sisterhood, I spoke to enough who said they always had problems with their female managers because they wouldn't play the game. I don't swear or lose my temper ever (at the office), I'm always friendly and respectful, I never use the tone in this post at work (unless I'm chatting with friends), I've had people describe me as ""intense"" but they say it reflects well in my work, but I'm concerned about how many times my friends and I have been described as ""scary"" by female colleagues and superiors. A few have been denied promotions or been the first in layoffs because of this even though their work ethic is superb. I've always felt worried talking about it publicly because of repercussions from other women insisting this was a stereotype and wasn't true, and from men who would use it as an example of how women are evil manipulative bitches.

TwoX ladies, is this anything you can relate to? Am I full of it? Am I right on point? Have you ever had to play passive to get along with other women at work? Has resting bitchy face gotten you a talking-to about your pieces of flair?

As I said, we were friends before it happened in the fall and a lot of our mutual friends for the time live in this neighborhood (which is why I moved here). I still see his car parked down the street often, and I still get the urge to take a baseball bat to it everytime. I've restrained myself thus far. 

But the idea of him being literally right outside my window makes me feel ill. I've cut off all contact with him but I know seeing him will become inevitable. Suddenly the parties won't be a block away, but outside my door. 

I just don't really know what to do about it. I resigned my lease a month ago because I'm extremely poor and it's an amazing location for a good price. I can't break my lease without being responsible for all of the remaining payments. I'm going to try subletting but I know it will be near impossible because it's a one bedroom in a college town, and expensive at that (I live with my boyfriend so it's split, hence why it's cheap individually).

I'm obviously going to try to move out, but it really sucks because I love my apartment and I've put so much work into it to make it my safe haven and I just feel like yet another thing is being stripped away from me because of this event. 

I just wanted to complain really and come to you guys for some moral support, especially in the event that I'm not able to sublet and am stuck here for a year having to see him everyday. ",67,20140517033404,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I don't really have anyone I could really talk to this about, and you guys seem to be a pretty awesome and supportive community.

About a year ago I started taking Wellbutrin for depression after a (second) bad run with Lexapro. I've had some pretty fantastic results with it when it comes to my depression (still some bad days but they're far and few between) but shortly after I started taking it I started dropping weight. I started out somewhere between 118 to 123lbs (5'1"") and dropped to around 98 which is somewhere around the lower end of a healthy bmi for my height/age, but it's still dropping.

Shit gets serious when your boobies start to deflate, ladies. I returned to a healthier weight after going off meds for a couple of months, but my depression got considerably worse. One hundred and fifteen pounds is a normal, healthy weight, and the reasonable part of my brain knows that, but fitting snugly into what had been my baggy, stay at home jeans for the past six months made me want to cry. 

I know it's probably pretty fucked up and unhealthy, but I still have that voice in the back of my head when I look in the mirror or see myself on cam (camgirl) saying how my legs could be a little slimmer or my stomach could be flatter. It's some body dysmorphic shit and I know it, but I can't silence it either. 

My boyfriend mentioned an eating disorder last night when we were talking. After thinking on it I'm kind of afraid that he could be right and I'm heading in that direction. I stress about my weight a lot, and with work I'm certainly in a position where there are plenty of opportunities to over analyze. 

However, the thought of changing meds after finally finding something that works is a nightmare, and doesn't really solve the underlying problem.

Any thoughts or suggestions on coming to terms with the squishy bits?

Feminism has been described to me as an ideology that pursues equal treatment for all so generalizations should not be a part of a logical speculation. I may seem ignorant posting about feminism here because not everyone who's genitals are inside their bodies consider themselves feminists. I do believe that most of those that do confess feminists ideals are only moderate in their beliefs and Americans as a whole fail to promote gender equality, no matter where your genitals reside. Take this video for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN4sMISyYgk. The ""not all men"" argument is being made all over the place but I believe this argument is obsolete in this scenario. Why do people expect the abused in this situation to be so helpless? Because the person can be labeled as a she? Why do people expect women to be so docile and rarely talk about victim hardening (making it less possible for a crime to be committed against a victim)? What I truly do not understand is why are victims labeled as women seen as more vulnerable to males that are victimized? Rape is a violent crime that happens to all (prison rapes exceed the amount made in the public and the majority of these victims are males) yet many who post in this subreddit see it as a crime that targets women. It has been said in this subreddit that women are socialized to fear men because of the real dangers they face. But isn't this fear irrational and a product of socializing women to be a part of a gender that sees themselves as inferior in terms of strength and capability? Especially since someone labeled as a male will experience more violence in their lifetime than someone labeled as a female. I have nothing against this subreddit but it seems to provide evidence that the marginalization of the sexes through gender is here to stay.

t3_25si6v,SOME Men Arguments & Safe Spaces,"Reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25q5vs/iff_behold_its_not_all_man/) thread, I thought it might be useful to address how insisting ""not all men"" derails discussion and how this, specifically, relates to safe space.  
  
First, we've gotten caught up in a discussion of women making generalizations about men. From participating in r/TwoX for a long time, I can't think of an instance where someone has said *all* men are blahblahblah. On the contrary, the generalizations I see are about women's OWN experiences. As in, I often don't feel comfortable in suchandsuch situation. Or generalizations about their lives in certain institutions or fields.  
  
So it seems to me that posters are defending the propriety of ""not all men"" statements based on a largely hypothetical situation. I'm not saying it never happens, just that it isn't some huge issue here. This is a red herring issue, but it betrays a common misconception/anxiety that feminism is concerned with misandry rather than gender equality.  
  
What does this have to do with ""safe space"" or a forum for women's issue? It is a common understanding that different spaces on the internet have their own culture, which newcomers need to learn in order to participate effectively. This is common sense, right?  
  
But when it comes to women's issues, it seems that we cannot assume that newcomers will make this effort. I'm seeing a lot of complaining that this sub is unwelcoming. I'm seeing a lack of understanding about derailing. I'm seeing a lot of posts that start out ""as a man."" Now who feels I am generalizing about *them* specifically?  
  
No, this is not a ""safe space"" like a ""safe room."" People can come and go, and people can flame here. What made this place feel safe was that women (and their allies) could discuss issues without being constantly interrupted. If you want to post here without really understanding this culture, perhaps it is time to ask yourself: why? If you think this is the appropriate place to insist on men's representation, perhaps it is time to ask yourself: why?

I need help. Badly. 

I'm so exhausted of being treated badly for my body. I can't even wear a skirt or dress because of fear another guy will grope me. 

Let me explain, 
I'm 21 and mixed Native American/German. My body is fit but curvy. I have been called a slimmed down Kim Kardashian? Which confuses me because she does not even have extra weight. My face is different but not exotic.

Anyway, I have been offered for modeling and to work at hooters. I turned it all down because I don't want to be considered ""slutty"" by peers or ruin a possible work relationship I will have in the future. I have been hired based on my looks, really. 

I worked at a sub place, and when we got a new manager I was told by the manager, that the old one had already checked ""Accepted"" on the interview forum as soon as I walked in. Just so they could have something easy to look at. WTF. I'm a hard work! I worked 10-10 shifts 6 days a week to make rent and go to school. I quit after managers were hitting on me, spreading rumors, and some coworkers were urging me to report it.

I had a guy on my 17th birthday put his phone under my skirt when I was standing, waiting to be seated at a restaurant. No one said anything to him, but everyone saw! I was so embarrassed. My mom said it was because I was wearing heels and a tight skirt. But it went maybe 3 inches above my knee.

I have been groped on the street wearing jeans and a t-shirt. I told my dad and he said ""some men can't help themselves, it's the way your body is shaped and looks combined."" He then proceeded to tell me that I should wear baggy clothes and sweat pants. 

During my 21st, I thought I was with some good friends. My boyfriend broke up with me because he said I was having fun and he wasn't. He thought I was having fun to spite him since he was in a bad mood and sulked. I was drunk for the first time, and I cried. So my ""friends"" took me to their place, I crash on the couch and their roommate (both high and drunk) kept waking me up and trying to touch me up my dress. I kept telling him no, and tried to move his hand SEVERAL times. I had the courage to wear a dress for the first time in 3 years because my ex swore he would protect me. 

I hate going to gyms, so I exercise at home but it's not a good enough work out. I use to go to a gym but I had guys follow me out into the parking lot a few times, or pull their cars in front of me to get me to talk to them. I was wearing spandex capris and shorts over them with a tight fitting t shirt. I want to see my muscles move with what ever work out I do. Eventually I stopped going.

I don't like being touched at parties. I hate everything about me now. I hate my breast, my ""onion"" butt. My blue eyes. My dark hair. My slim waist. I had looked at one point to plastic surgery for reductions so I can have no curves and wear a skirt again. If something happens to me again my dad can't blame it on my body, people can't say it was because I was showing off. 

I also plan on selling all my pretty dresses/skirts. I use to love makeup, but I'm so afraid of wearing it because I don't want to give anyone the wrong idea. I'm planning to sell my skinny jeans to get sweatpants. I want my body to be my own. I'm ashamed of me.",66,20140517122524,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I reported him to our University in January (our court date is the 29th of this month).  But after I reported him, I find out he assaulted another girl and I freaked out. I felt so guilty for not saying anything sooner and getting him kicked out of our dorm. I had a mental breakdown and was in the ER a few days later for having panic attacks and suicidal intent.  When I found out though, I went down to his quad and yelled at him mainly saying 'Unless a girl says something, SHE DOES NOT WANT IT.""

I found out yesterday from the prehearing that he intends to press charges against me for harassment.  I'm at a complete loss. I have no idea what's going to happen. I don't want him to get away with this with not even a slap on the wrist.  I don't want to get in trouble because HE decided to sexually assault 2 girls.

t3_25t4ax,sharing my planned parenthood experience.,"i spent hours last night reading 50+ threads about abortion experiences, so i am posting my own as a small way to give back and hopefully help someone else the way i was helped.

i'd been feeling kinda weird and gaining weight for the last month, and finally got the courage to take a test yesterday afternoon.  double positive results.  i didn't even freak out; it's like i KNEW that it was going to say that and the test was only confirmation.  of course, i wasn't happy about it and had to take care of it.  i don't want kids (probably ever, but especially not now), and i've been taking the pill for months.  clearly i fucked up at some point, but moving on.

immediately called my local pp to schedule an appt asap - not sure how far along i was, and was paranoid that i was already too far gone to get it done.  the woman who answered the phone was amazingly helpful and nice and gave me tons of info (though my decision was made).  her office only did abortions on friday, so i'd have to wait a week and schedule around work, which was tough.  she then informed me that another nearby clinic had saturday morning (the next day! less than 24 hours!) appointments still available.  JACKPOT.

so i schedule my appointment and start reading reddit/the internet for hours, about other people's choices and experiences.  the medical horror stories scared me off and i was committed to a surgical.  i was hoping i could get at least a moderate sedative, but i didn't have anybody who could drive me.  still not really freaking out or sad, just kind of anxious about the actual pain of the procedure.

got to pp bright and early (7:20am) on saturday morning.  lots of time with administrative and waiting to go back (maybe 45min?).  when they called me to go back, they did the ultrasound and informed me i was about 5 weeks.  this actually made me happy because earlier abortions are easier abortions, and i was super afraid that i was further than i thought.  then back to another room for more waiting.

next step was the counseling bit, where they asked about my comfort with the decision, any pressure or support i had from others, bc methods, etc.  this went pretty quick cause i knew exactly what i wanted.  then they took a blood sample, bp, weight, etc.  then off to another waiting alcove, where they were playing beauty and the beast.  this was the longest waiting - first a wait to get my ibuprofen, then about 45min for it to take effect and get called into the doctor's.

finally get called in.  kind of freaked out about pain, but a bunch of other women had come in and out of the waiting area with no apparent trauma.  got undressed and sat down awkwardly for ~10min waiting for doc and assistant.  doc came in and asked if i have any final questions.  i asked how soon i would know the abortion worked (a little afraid about having to do it all again!), and she told me that as soon as she does her thing, she checks to make sure ""the pregnancy"" was fully removed.  so, all right.  she also told me it would take 3-4min!  so incredibly fast after the 3 hours i'd spent there already.

then she started the actual procedure, which you can go read the scientific details of somewhere else.  it was surprisingly NOT painful.  i was really worried that with only the ibuprofen i would be suffering.  it was some discomfort when she first opened me up (graphic, lol), then a pretty sharp pinch when she started, i guess.  the assistant was holding my hand and rubbing my shoulder the whole time, which felt super relaxing.  i could feel that my legs were super tense, which probably wasn't helping, and tried to relax them.  i was breathing in and out and really focusing on that.  yoga comes in handy when you least expect it!  then they told me it was almost over and i was very happy.  the worst pain was at the end when the cramps started.  i don't really get cramps in general, so it sucked, but they weren't ever more than a 6/10 on the pain scale.  then the doctor left to check for completion and it was over.  

the assistant stayed in while i cleaned up and got dressed again, then they sent me to recovery where i got a heating pad and a lounge chair.  i was feeling some cramps still, but it was more like discomfort than pain.  i had to listen to a 5-minute post-care spiel, and then talked to another nurse who confirmed the spiel yet again.  went to the bathroom to make sure i wasn't bleeding too hard, and then i was free to go.

all i feel right now is incredibly relieved.  from knowing i was pregnant to having it taken care of in less than 24 hours... i think if i'd had more time to worry about it, i'd be more of a basketcase.  but i just feel good and happy right now.  we'll see what the next week of hormones brings.  the one negative thing is that i'm out $500, but that's way better than a baby.",41,20140517135546,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25tdvm,"unplanned pregnancy, confused","I'm 23 years old. I just graduated college. And I'm currently trying to transition out of my job as a nanny into a full time, corporate america job. I just found out I'm pregnant this afternoon after being paranoid for a few days. I called the guy, who I was in a very serious relationship with at one point, but for the past 9 months or so it's been very rocky and I wouldn't even say we're emotionally committed to each other. 


I told him about it, and he was a HUGE DICKSKIN! I've had to get an abortion before, and went through a lot of depression following and told myself I would never do that again… I also told him. He also knew I wasn't on the pill. No tricking him. So I tell him, he's like well what do you wanna do, I feel as though the realistic option is to abort. He's cool with it. I text him a little while later telling him I don't know if I can go through with it. He immediately calls me and starts talking about lawyers and how hellish this is going to be. It feels like he's trying to emotionally manipulate or intimidate me by being like well if you have it I'm going to make your life a living hell, he talked about trying to get it taken away because in the past I dabbled with prescription pills. I know having the baby isn't practical, but emotionally I don't know if I can handle an abortion. And I feel like I have no support system right now because I haven't told anyone besides him. I feel like it's selfish to keep the baby and bring it into a world where I'm not in love or in a loving healthy relationship with the father. I feel like I could consider adoption but don't know if I could go through with that. I'd also feel like an asshole if I got a job under the pretense of not being pregnant and then having to tell them I am pregnant.

There's a lot of factors at play. And my thoughts are very unorganized, so I'm sorry if this was hard to read. Just needed to get it out since I'm not going to talk to any friends/family just yet before I know what I'm going to do or want to do.",15,20140517155057,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25sk65,Finding self worth,"This post is mostly directed at those ladies who are in serious long-term or live-in romantic situations. 
I have been part of a serious relationship (not without it's ups and downs) for going on two years now. Throughout these two years both me and my partner have changed and grown by each other's side to become very people different than we were when we met. 
Before this relationship I had been single for a long time, enjoyed my alone time and felt confident in being alone. People often say you don't know what true anger or sadness is until it's manifested by lovers and I now believe that to be true. 
It started with confusion and blame. ""How can we be meant for each other if he can make me more angry than anyone I've ever met"" and the like.
Eventually I learned to reason with my emotions and take what came as an ""in the passions of love"" type of thing. I dabble here and there in anxiety as it has it's ups and downs depending on the state of the rest of my life, and I've found it recently to be crippling - devouring my mental state day in and day out until sometimes I literally feel like a shell. This tosses the passions of love into a storm and enhances any lovers quarreling that may already be taking place. Sometimes I feel as though I've lost my self-worth from clinging so hard to my significant other for support.
I am searching for similar situations and any helpful exercises or practices that help with self-confidence with OR without a constant partner.

I've been dealing with this for a month now. From the hospital to the questioning, I have grand jury on Monday. I have felt weak and lost the entire time.


He has been in jail since. His bail was set at $25,000 and he requested to have it lowered. I waited for that call all day and I finally got it, he was denied. It felt like a small win and gave me hope. Maybe he'd plead guilty and I can start working on feeling like myself again. Feeling okay again.

But I got a call today. He's out. His family posted bail. That means his family believes in him so much that they are willing to put in a quarter of a million dollars on it.

We are apart of the same family. If he can convince them what's to say he won't convince the court. I'm scared and I'm anxious and I don't know what to do anymore. Now I feel this will never end.

t3_25t6ed,In the middle of father cheating scandal (serious),"Long time lurker, first time poster! (And last, throwaway)

The fact that my parent's marriage was never a fairy tale was obvious to myself and siblings from the start, confirmed when we realized their wedding anniversary was less than nine months before my brother's birthday... But they made it work, for the family.

My father met my mother in college, but had been dating a woman before. We'll call her OTGA - see if you can crack the code :P

OTGA has been a constant figure in my life, a photo here, a passing reference there, but my parents have been married for 25+ years (dating for four before my mother got pregnant and he became overwhelmed with Catholic responsibility) and have overcome a lot. My father has no clue I know she is more than a fleeting memory (as he is less than subtle when ""sneaking"" away from family dinners to write up inappropriate emails).

Fast forward to a month ago. My dad invited us on a family trip, hooray! First coincidence, it is scheduled when my mother can't get away from work... Second coincidence, it happens to be to the city where this woman lives... 

The trip is under the guise of being a gift for my sister. I ask my dad, ""why would you choose city x? Sister is intimidated by that city,"" (all she ever wanted was a beach and cervesa, this city is capital M Metropolitan) my dad drops casually that ""he is visiting a special friend there, so he will have to leave us for a day or two... or three..."" Inside I am consumed with rage, but we are at an event and that kind of drama is not my style. I play it cool, pretend not to notice anything.

I spend the next weeks wracked with guilt, realizing immediately he is using my siblings and myself only as cover for his visit to his mistress. I have a good relationship with my mom, so the lying is killing me, but the thought of hurting her by telling her is too much to bear. 

I hate being dragged into the middle, and the price of betraying my mother would cost far more than any trip, but if I dropped out my sister would know something was wrong and I don't want to be responsible for ruining her experience. Rock, meet hard place.

Fast forward to weekend after Mother's Day, I promised her a special girl's night out. She confesses that she knows the vacation is a sham, and has known since September when he first told her about his mysterious desire to visit city x and she tore him a new asshole, until he mysteriously suggests that exact city for a special family vacation. I am relieved of my guilt, and we talk at length and end in a good place together (she talks about taking him for all he is worth in a divorce, we toast :P), but I am still stuck spending two weeks on a vacation acting as an accessory to my father's infidelity doing everything I can to not let on for the sake of my sister, who would be crushed. 

Four people, one tiny apartment, and an elephant in a room for two weeks. 

Not sure if I'm looking for advice, or more of a digital shoulder to cry on. Sorry for the long post, and thanks for listening! If anyone has been in a similar experience, I would love to hear your stories.

t3_25teex,Help me be okay with my disease.,"I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome over a year ago.

I went to the doctor because I was having horrific abdominal pain on my right side. The doctor wanted to be absolutely sure it wasn't appendicitis, so to the ER I went. Multiple external and transvaginal ultrasounds later, I learned that I had dozens of cysts on my right ovary, and one of them was over 6 cm in diameter.

After reviewing the ultrasounds, my gynecologist told me that I had PCOS. It hadn't truly manifested itself until just after I quit taking birth control pills. I had heard about PCOS before, but it shook me to hear that I would most likely be having cysts on my ovary for a very long time—unless I tried taking another set of hormones, which I purposely stopped because the cocktail didn't react well with my brain chemistry. Long story short, they made me suicidal, among other problems. Mostly emotional numbness. I have some form of undiagnosed depression or anxiety, or maybe both. I'm not sure. And birth control pills seem to exacerbate it.

I've only recently begun to read into what else this disease causes, and the more I read into it, the more hopeless I feel. The thicker hair growth I have along my arms, eyebrows, belly, and legs; my molasses metabolism and inability to lose weight; the lack of breast tissue, resulting in conical/tuberous breasts. 

Just... all this time, growing up, I thought I had done something wrong, that maybe I hadn't worn the proper bra, and that's why my breasts didn't look like all of the other girls'. I thought it was because I hadn't taken care of myself in some way, that my mother didn't tell me something that every mom is supposed to tell her daughter as she grows up, but it wasn't any of it. It was because of this disease, a hormonal imbalance, and I never developed the way I should have.

I feel so incredibly upset and *cheated* that I was handed this in my slew of genetics. I'm 5'1"", 155 lbs. with bad knees and an arthritic spine. I can't run to lose weight, I can't stand up for extended periods of time without my lower back feeling like someone's drilling into it, and I can barely reach things on my tip-toes. I have to take medication to keep my body's hormones under control so it doesn't cause me extreme pain, and I should probably be taking medication to keep my head in check, too, but I just don't have the time or the money to find a psychologist right now.

Others with PCOS or with PCOS and depression—how did you come to terms with what you have? How did you find a pill that worked to control your body without controlling your head? How did birth control pills and depression medication interact?

I'm at a loss. I've tried so many BC bills for this, and I've reacted poorly to all of them. I'm starting to run out of options and out of hope.",2,20140517155742,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25sy4h,Today's Feminine Mystique,"The recent post of a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFdWcNJ17YY&feature=youtu.be) from Louie got me thinking. I've also been reading the [Feminine Mystique](http://www.amazon.com/Feminine-Mystique-50th-Anniversary/dp/0393346781/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400348331&sr=1-1&keywords=feminine+mystique) recently. (You should all read it. If nothing else it might give you some insight into how your grandparents grew up and lived) And I've been thinking.



If you're not familiar with the ""Feminine Mystique"" (summary [here](http://www.enotes.com/topics/feminine-mystique)) it's the concept, laid out in the book of the same title, that women are defined only by their roles as wife and mother, and never have an individual identity as a person. Among other things, the book runs through the history of how the women's rights moment somehow lead to the housewifery and (often voluntary) sexism of the 50's and 60's. Within chapter 5 and 6(ish), Freidan talks about how popular media of the time including psychologists, sociologist, marriage counselors, and magazines laid out that a woman's highest achievement was child-rearing and her highest quality was her passive and genteel femininity.



It got me thinking about beauty, and how we view female beauty today. And I'm not talking about the trashy magazines that say ""Bikini-ready in 10 days"" and ""Stars' beach bodies, page 6"", though those are by all rights a horrible message to be spread so pervasively. But what about things like Dove's campaign for real bodies and blogs on the internet that espouse ""fat can be beautiful too."" I see these sorts of attitudes and campaigns emerging and it's lovely that there's a movement to expanding our societal concept of women's beauty.



But perhaps we're missing the point, at least a point. The feminine mystique and all the views of its era says: ""All a woman can ever do or want to do is be charming and beautiful"". Today that's not the case. We encourage women to be astronauts and engineers. But it seems we also encourage them to be beautiful. Campaigns and commercials like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpaOjMXyJGk) seem to tell women that you must see yourself as beautiful. Like beauty has transformed not from the only thing a woman can have, but it still lies in the must category. Why does women's beauty seem to be equated with value? Even in their own minds. A commercial like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDMXvdwN5c) wouldn
t be effective or moving if beauty was just something like ""good at math.""



Maybe we still have some problems to fix. Yes, there's more to beauty than the photoshopped girls on cheap magazines, but why do we as woman need to maintain this complex that we must be beautiful? Why does it hold so much power over us? Why do we need to go on campaigns telling ourselves that even the fat, the flawed, the disabled are beautiful and see scenes of women breaking down and crying at their changed conception of themselves? Why should physical appearance still have a strangehold on our sense of self-worth and societal value? It just seems to me that maybe we're campaigning a little too parallel to the feminine mystique of the past. What do you guys think?

Edit: Awesome comment from /u/animousity692 to remember:

I (F/mid 20s) have this unexplained vaginal discharge. It's white, doesn't really smell bad, and is pretty constant. I haven't had this much discharge since puberty - needless to say, this is not normal for me. Also, my inner labia are noticeably swollen. This has been going on for at least three weeks. 

I saw a doctor, and was tested for BV, yeast, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea, and everything came up negative. I had some minor abdominal pain (unrelated to my menstrual cycle) so I asked to be tested for a UTI, which also came up negative. I'm also not pregnant. 

The doctor told me that the increased discharge could be because I have a new intimate partner. I doubt this, because I haven seen him in weeks. She also said it might be an allergic reaction and advised I wear cotton underwear (FYI, I literally don't own underwear that isn't cotton and never have). The doctor then sent me on my way. 

I'm really frustrated. This discharge is starting to piss me off. I haven't changed major anything about my diet or started any new medications. My detergent is the same, and my shampoo is one that I've used before with no side effects. The only body-related thing I've done in the past few months was get the first round of the HPV vaccine. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? What did you do? Right now I'm planning to ask the doctor to check me for cervical cancer and refer me for allergy testing. ",0,20140517094812,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I'm almost 30. I haven't peed or pooped myself since elementary school. 

But today I was in Walmart just picking up a few things. I didn't even have a cart. As I was standing there debating if the $1 a piece slotted spoons were actually any better than the $1 pack of three when I felt a little rumble and pressure. I noted that I need a bathroom soon but thought to myself, ""I'm just gonna be a few minutes, I can make it home."" I decided on the three pack for a dollar. I grabbed them off the hook and took a step to turn around and head an aisle over to grab a new shower mat. But I didn't make it. I was immediately thrown into panic mode. 

I don't even know how it happened so fast but before my left foot had hit the floor my butthole was puckering so hard it clearly felt bad for what it had done. Chunky, slimy, wetness filled up my crack and traveled all the way around to the front. My panties were soaked immediately and I could feel it starting to drip down to my upper thighs. I dropped my dollar utensils and started walking as normally as one can when trying to hide that last nights chicken curry is in their crotch. I realized I was super lucky to be wearing a black dress and not jeans as the slime headed quickly down my legs. I made it to my car, deciding that a public bathroom was not properly equipped to handle this, and grabbed a stack of papers that hadn't made it into the shredder at work for the past two months. A lady in the car adjacent stared at me as I arranged them on my front seat so as not to ruin the breathable leather. 

I drove twenty minutes home, waddled up the drive way, and trashed the now neon yellow papers on the way to a scalding hot shower.

I don't really know why I'm posting this but I've been crying all day about my skin. I haven't struggled with acne for the past 5 years. When I did struggle, it was BAD. 

I went on the pill to help with migraines and it seemed to, so I stayed on it. It had the added benefit of clearing my skin which was great. 

After a few years, and many different brands of the pill, I decided to go off it to normalize my moods, deal with my depression and just be prescription free to see how my mind and body function in their normal state. 

Everything was great. I was less moody, happier, less irritable, I lost weight and for the first 4 months my skin didn't change much.

Until two weeks ago, when it exploded (not literally). Pimples everywhere. Big ones, little ones. Overall texture was just bumpy and awful. 

Before anyone plugs skincareaddiction, I used to work for a major cosmetic retailer as. a full time skin consultant so I know my skin care. This is not the kind of acne that a great skincare routine can fix (I've tried). I have a GREAT skincare routine, but it won't touch hormonal acne very much. 

I'm frustrated. Very much so. My moods are better but depression is taking a hold because I hate my face again. I barely want to leave my house anymore because I feel disgusting. 

I refilled my old prescription for the pill today and im just staring at the box wondering if I should do it again. It's the lesser of two evils at this point but if I wait it out will my hormones balance and my skin go back to how it was even last month? I just don't know..

Has anyone had this kind of experience?

Edit: this got gilded? Really?! Thanks!! But I'm not sure why hahaha.

t3_25tl9g,Really need advice on deciding whether or not to invite boyfriend's mother to babyshower.,"My SO and I are having a baby in September. We're not sure if we want his mom to be inviting to the baby shower that my mom is hosting. 

Reasons to not invite her: 

1. She's been psychologically abusive to her spouse and my boyfriend for his whole life. Example: Giving away stuff my boyfriend had bought himself and his clothes. Telling him how shitty he is daily. Demanding he pay rent when he was 16. She tells everyone that her husband is her meal ticket, but he doesn't care. She's also been arrested twice for domestic abuse against her husband. Punched him and went at him with a knife. One time she thought my SO turned the air conditioner down, so she punched him in the chest and screamed at him. 

2. She's had multiple outbursts directed towards me. Example: When we announced that we were getting an apartment together, she cried and screamed at me that I was a bitch who was stealing her son. Wouldn't let him get his clothes or anything out of his room. 

3. She usually has outbursts at family gatherings. Actually, I cant think of a family gathering where she hasnt had an outburst. Example: For easter we went to eat at grandma's house. My SO's brother, billy, called and asked if we were eating yet. Grandma mentioned that his mom was there (billy doesnt have contact with his mom.) Billy said he cant come then because in his custody papers it says his kid isnt allowed near Billy's mom. Something Billy's ex did when Billy's mom got arrested. SO's mom freaks out, starts cussing at grandma and her husband, and starts walking home. 

4. In social situations she makes everyone uncomfortable and says/does inappropriate things. She makes sex jokes all the time. Today she met my dad for the first time and said ""she's having OUR grandbaby. Thats what I tell everyone. We're the grandparents."" At her dad's funeral, she was extremely loud the whole time. In the middle of the service she'd say something like ""oooh look how pretty the wreath is!"" When she met my younger sister (who was 13 at the time) she was trying to convince her she doesnt do drugs the whole time she was talking to her, and kept rubbing her head and shoulders even though my sister was noticeablly uncomfortable. This is not really that big of a deal to me, but it does contribute to the fact that I don't want her at my baby shower. If this were the only reason I didn't want her there I would invite her anyway. 

5. She has issues with nearly everyone in her family, and I want to invite our grandma and Billy and his girlfriend without there being an episode of family drama at my babyshower. I could call the police and have her escorted out of the babyshower, but to me that would ruin the day and also make other guests uncomfortable. 

The only reason my SO still talks to her is to see his dad. He said if his dad didnt live there he'd never go see his mom again. She definitely has mental issues (which she's getting help for. She's had to go to therapy since she got arrested and committed into the psych ward), and I feel bad for her. I can deal with the fact that she's blown up at me multiple times, and though she acts like my best friend sometimes I'm not sure how she really feels about me. But at the same time I don't want any issues at my babyshower.

t3_25u1km,Question about Microgynon/BC/Acne.,"Hello all! I have been doing some research but I have not found any answers to my question. I will ask it here and I am sorry in advance if someone already asked and I just couldn't find it. 

I just started taking Microgynon, it is a 0.15 mg Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg Etinilestradiol split. I have never been on this particular BC before, but I have been on others. I have never had acne in my life, just pimples/zits from time to time. Since I went on this pill I have broken out all over my face, even on places I never had zits before, like on my nose and around my eyes. My skin is also crazy uneven, my foundation doesn't cover well, as if my skin is a different color. I am concerned. 

I read online that Seasonale (the same chemical split) causes your acne to get worse for the first month sometimes and when people have waited until the next month it cleared up and their skin even got better. 

So, this is my question, has anyone ever been on this medication? If they have, has anyone had the same experience as I have? Even if you haven't, does anyone have an idea if I should tough it out and wait another month before switching, or switch right away?

Please, please help! Maybe I am also a little more emotional than usual because this is making me cry right now ;)

A typical post by many of the proclaimed females of the sub usually contains a lot of comments that we are unwelcome or that our advice/opinions/experience are invalid.

My boyfriend and I always use condoms and I'm not on BC but I've never had a problem. Except last month, we had sex where the condom broke during my period. Even though my ovulation is about 2 weeks after, we went and got a plan b which I took about an hour or so after the condom breaking. 

In this past month I've had many lifestyle changes that could also affect my period: Finals which means lots of stress, moving home which changed my diet, got prescribed adderall which helped me lose around 8 lbs in the last month, and my sleeping schedule has changed quite a lot. 

However, with all of these changes, my period is really late, even more so than usual (6 days so far). I'm going to get a test tomorrow which would make it a week late and hopefully be accurate? Are these symptoms (medication, weightloss, stress, diet change, sleep change) enough to delay my period by 6 days?

4 1/2 years ago my beautiful mother (41) went out to the bar which she NEVER does to celebrate her birthday with her friends. That night she met a younger man (29) and spent the night dancing with him. That night he drove her home and they sat in the driveway for **four hours** just talking and laughing - I don't sleep much so I spied a lot of the time to make sure no naughtyness was going on. - At this time the sun was coming up so she gave him her e-mail (she got drunk and lost her cell, good job Ma! I remember my first beer.) and told him if he got bored to e-mail her. I was up and she was twirling around and was ontop of the world telling me about this mystery man. 10 minutes later she checks her e-mail and in her inbox was a love note. Something along the lines of ""I had one of the best nights of my life with you, I'm not sure if this is too quick but I need to see you again."" and from then on they were in love. 

We'll call him Bryan. Bryan NEVER wanted kids and it took him 5 months to meet my brother (at that time 20) and I (at that time 17) and he instantly loved my brother and I and we loved him. We did everything together and if we weren't together we were sending eachother goofy text messages. My brother moved out and my mom, Bryan, and I built a house together. I became his daughter and he became the best father i've ever had. It didn't matter that we were kind of close in age, if he met someone he introduced me as his daughter. Not his girlfriends daughter, but his even though him and my mom never actually got married. We've even had talks about him walking me down the isle one day, my kids calling him papa, everything. 

Well on Friday May 2nd he was watching TV with my mom when he got up, looked at her, and said:
Him: **""I can't do this anymore.""**
Mom: ""What are you talking about?""
Him: ""I can't do this."" 
- he starts to leave - 
Mom: ""Please, Bryan, tell me what's going on."" 
Him: ""I want kids, okay? I want my own family. I need you and Kelsey to leave."" 
Mom: ""Where did this come from, Bryan? What's going on?"" 

So he packs a bag and leaves. He tells my mom he's staying at his best friend Shawn's house and we don't hear from him. As the time goes on he starts missing us. Asks to come eat with us, asks to sleep at the house, etc. It's gotten to the point where he keeps just begging for my moms attention. He even sneaks into the house and crawls into bed with her. On the 16th he cried to my mom and told her how much he loved her and wanted things to work but there just wasn't something there. Welp, come May 17th he falls asleep in bed with her again and she hears his phone go off. It's another woman texting him. She reads through his messages with her and they date back to the begining of this year and I guess he's been dating her AND bonding with her very young son. 

**My mom is crushed** 

She runs into my room and gives me his phone and my heart sinks into my belly. They're saying they love eachother, he can't wait to see her and her son, they're talking about dinner, they're talking about things a family talks about. This is even before he ever ended things with my mom. I can't breathe, i'm shaking, my mom is sobbing.

**so I call her.** 

She answers and is very confused since it was now 130AM and technically the 18th. I tell her how Bryan is in bed with my mom and just cried over her and still says he loves her. She's confused and sounds annoyed but won't really talk. Won't admit to how long they have been dating despite me saying I saw their text messages, won't tell me anything. It was a 10 minute conversation but it felt like forever. We hangup and I have my mom clean up and get into bed and told her to follow my lead. She gets into bed and I barge into their bedroom and it goes like this:

- flips on light - 
Mom: ""Kelsey, what is it?""
Me: ""WAKE UP BRYAN.""
Bryan: ""Huh? What? What's going on?""
Me: ""I just got off of the phone with your GIRLFRIEND.""
Mom: ""What? What is she talking about Bryan?""
Me: ""Yeah Bryan, why don't you tell my mom about VERONICA."" 
- At this time he puts his hands behind his head and he has a sarcastic smirk on his face and he's shaking his head and staring at the ceiling. - 

He won't talk to us despite me sobbing and screaming at him. How he was MY dad and how much I loved him and how much he royally fucked up. 

He won't talk.
He won't even answer a simple question.
He put on a hat, shoes, and left my mom and I in the middle of the road and didn't look back. 

My mom is broken... we're homeless now. When they first started dating our house got foreclosed on and her credit was screwed from there. I'm only 20 and have no credit. No apartment will take us and we can't afford a house. I'm making more money out of the 2 of us. We have family but they aren't in a good situation either. We're still staying at Bryan's house but now that this happened I don't know what we're going to do....

t3_25uqjn,How do you deal with customers who try to flirt with you or ask you things that are too personal while you are at work?,"I've recently started a new job, and it's my first in the past few years that I consistently deal with customers directly, or deal with male customers at all (my last job was in a store that catered specifically to women). I work in a large new store with tons of customers behind a counter with several other people, so I am never alone with anyone. 

We don't have a dress code, but I dress very conservatively at work. No cleavage, knee length skirts or longer, and flats, plus I usually wear black tights (when I remember to wash my dang tights). 

Today, one man asked for my number when I asked if I could help with anything and called me beautiful several times, then asked if I was told that I was beautiful often. I turned pretty red and tried to laugh and said something like ""haha, nope! not while I'm at work!"". He was with someone else (I think his mom?) and didn't actually need anything from my counter, but it went on for several minutes while I couldn't leave my computer. He was mostly laughing and being silly, but it put me in a really tough situation.

A second was very polite and not as persistent. He told me I was beautiful while I was helping him and I awkward-laughed and said thank you and that was that. 

It's embarrassing because it happens in our small work space where everyone can hear, and there is no graceful way to let them know that I'm uncomfortable / it's inappropriate / I need to get back to work. I REALLY don't want to embarrass them or make them feel bad, but I also worry about giving someone the wrong idea by being too polite and then running into them in the parking lot when I'm leaving. 

Basically, thus far I've just laughed it off and said thanks and hoped that was the end of it. I've definitely not been harassed, and no one has made me feel unsafe or uneasy, it is just an uncomfortable situation that seems to have no good / safe response.  

I know there's no use worrying about something that hasn't happened yet, but in the past, I've had men ask me if I have a boyfriend, why I don't have a boyfriend, why I don't leave my boyfriend for them (if I make one up) if I want to be their girlfriend, ask if I'd give them MY number, what time I get off, etc. I've also had people track me down via facebook and send me long messages (which are easy to ignore because I'm no longer at work and obligated to respond). This hasn't happened at this job yet. 

I'd love to hear any experiences with this, or advice on how to respond better / something to say in those situations so they stop but aren't upset or embarrassed. ",36,20140518045357,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

But under all the joy, the stresses of real life continue, and are grinding me down.

I pride myself in not being the stereotypical male that so many people out there embrace. I'll stay up with her or one or the babies until early in the morning and then go to work early to make enough money to let her live her dream: being a stay at home mom. 

I want to be there for her, I want to support and proved for her, but when she says that my ""I love you"" sounds hollow, and that I'm acting like an entitled Man.

OK, so my problem is that my friend's younger brother likes me. He flirts with me all the time; I flirt back. I'm a nearly 25 year old female and he's nearly 20. I think I am very susceptible to giving in because it's been over a year since I've even kissed a guy. I am really craving that kind of attention, but I haven't met anyone that makes me feel this sexual since my breakup. In other words, I think about jumping his bones. All. The. Time. I would act on it if I let myself, but I would only want a friends with benefits sort of arrangement and not anything serious for reasons stemming from our obvious age gap. And I just really don't want to be in a relationship right now. A part of me feels like this is a pretty messed up thing to want from someone who is my friend's younger brother. I would want to minimize the risk of drama or ruining our friendship.

tl;dr: My friend's attractive younger brother really likes me (I'm female) and I only want him in a physical way. If he wants me in that way too, and I'm pretty sure he does, how should I handle this situation ethically? As of now, I haven't discussed anything with his sister (who is a strict Catholic and doesn't want to lose her virginity before marriage) and if I do, I would want to minimize the risk of drama or ruining our friendship.

t3_25ufm7,A Different Approach to Misogyny on Reddit,"I recently did a little bit of digging into some of the more misogynistic subs on reddit, and came to some interesting conclusions.

I think its reasonable to assume that the majority of contributors to these subs are heterosexual men, and I can't help but feel sorry for them. I think everyone know how horrible it feels to be lonely and how toxic hate and anger can be, and these men are consumed with it. 

Can you imagine loathing roughly 50% of the population, but simultaneously being attracted to them? Hating an entire group of people so much that it leads you to say horrible hateful things, but at the same time crave their attentions, affections, sexual intimacy and more?

I find it stranger still that I am somehow able to empathise and sympathise with these men - although generally not for the reasons they seem to want it. These men hate women for a reason. Maybe not a realistic, logical or even comprehensible reason, but I'm sure that they have reasons nonetheless. 

Again I'll generalise about contributors to these subs. I suspect that many of them either feel that they have somehow been wronged by women, or they have been raised in (or exposed to) an environment in which hate for women is normal. This just makes me feel more sorrow for them. Its entirely possible that some of these men have been genuinely wronged by women, and lets face it, there are unpleasant women out there, and most of us have had to deal with one at some point. Not everyone has the benefit of having largely positive experiences with women, so its somewhat unsurprising, almost understandable that these men are angry.

I in no way condone any of the horrible things these subs say, but I'm beginning to think that they actually play a really important role in online communities such as reddit. These subs give men who are angry, a place to vent, a place to communicate and a place to feel safe. 

I want to believe that most men who participate in these subs only participate for a fairly short period of time, most likely when they are trying to work through issues that they have with a significant woman in their life. These men will eventually realise that being consumed with hate and anger is unhealthy, and will eventually walk away from such a toxic environment. The remaining few who are long term participants have probably been so damaged by negative experiences (real or perceived) relating to women that they are unable to let go of the anger and hate, and they need help, tolerance and compassion.
 
I consider myself somewhat feministic. I believe that society would be better if there was greater equality between the sexes and that people should be respected, admired and rewarded for the quality of their character, their deeds, skills, talents and abilities, and not based on gender. I'm in no way a supporter or proponent of intolerance, so please bare this in mind when you read the below.

I think its time to try a different approach to misogyny on reddit, and I think that 2X is the perfect place to start. I think that instead of fighting  misogynistic vitriol with aggression, righteousness and outrage, maybe we should try responding with compassion. So with that in mind, this is my message to any misogynist who feels the need to read this:

'I'm sorry you feel victimised. I'm sorry that you feel that you have suffered at the hands of women. I cannot imagine how difficult your experiences have been, and I am sure that you are in a great deal of pain. It is my hope that you read this message and know that not all women are horrible, in fact, I hope that eventually you come to see that the majority of women (like the majority of men) are good people, who are simply living their lives as best they can. With that in mind, I hope that you find the help that you need to overcome your hate and you pain. Until then, I hope that at the very least you will attempt to contain your hate to subs created for such discussion, instead of directing it at women who have not wronged you.'

Only I've also been experiencing some that I've never had in the past. The whole week before my period (which I've had about 24 hours now) I've had sensitivity to smells and an overly heightened gag reflex. I work with babies and have been changing diapers for 8 years and now I suddenly find myself almost throwing up. In one case I actually DID throw up. I can't seem to wipe noses without feeling sick either, and strong smells such as cooking food completely ruin my appetite. My stomach just can no longer handle anything. 

Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? Do I have to get used to changing diapers again after 8 years of no problems, or will this go away?

t3_25vbvs,My best friend told me she absolutely hates my wedding dress. I feel crushed.,"My wedding is in about 4 months. Yesterday, I went dress shopping with my mom for the first time. Instead of shopping around multiple bridal stores or sleeping on it first, I gave in to pressure and bought the dress I liked the most, in fear of never finding the right one in time. It cost me quite a fortune, which I had been saving. Nonrefundable, nonexchangeable. 

Upon showing the dress to my best friend, whose opinion I trust, told me she absolutely hated it, and it looks like it's made out of doily. And that I look like a ""melted ice cream cone"". I feel so depressed. I don't know what to do at this point. I did like the dress, but it didn't quite feel like the perfect ""one"". I certainly can't exchange it or ask for a refund, and I hardly believe it's possible to sell it before buying another dress. 

Here is a picture of me in the dress, for reference: http://imgur.com/8aomyLY

t3_25vs4z,"Ladies of Reddit, I am 22 years old and I wonder if there are others out there going through the same thing I am..."," 


  This is a little hard for me to explain, but I'll try to be as simple and clear as possible. 
 I feel like I'm going from maidenhood to womanhood. Let me give you guys some background here:

  I have always been TERRIFIED of childbirth and pregnancy, and just womanhood in general...I never understood it. I never could accept the fact that my body is made for the sole reason of bringing another human being into the world, it disgusted me. 
  My fears come from a number of different things in my past: I was raped a few years ago, I was in an abusive relationship with my ex-boyfriend, I was bullied by all the girls in elementary school, and I was abused by my mother as a child. I was always told (and shown by Hollywood) that childbirth is horrifying, painful, degrading, and traumatizing. I've also been shown that women are often raped, assaulted, and treated like objects quite often.
  As a result of all of this, I've always resented my body and femininity. I've been ashamed of being a girl because of what consequences come with it. I never saw it as a gift or something wonderful, I've seen it as a hideous burden.

  Anyone reading this may be wondering what being raped has to do with this, and it has been the catalyst to what I've been going through recently. I had repressed the traumatic memory of the time I was raped in my mind for years, with the help of booze and drugs. Once I got clean nearly 5 months ago...my mind began to clear. Memories came back...my mother beating me and psychologically torturing me. The teasing I endured as a little girl by my peers and even teachers. My ex-boyfriend taking advantage of me, emotionally and sexually. It all came back to me in vivid detail. Along with the memory, my repressed fears of womanhood/childbirth resurfaced also. I was devastated all over again. I have spent these last few weeks sobbing, screaming, shaking my fist at the sky cursing God. I have been consumed by fear. I have been afraid to have sex with my fiancee because of what happened. Every woman I've seen I can't look in the eye, because suddenly any female just seems so alien and foreign to me...especially pregnant ones. I am afraid to take a shower because I will be naked...and the feeling of the cold breeze on my naked skin brings me back to that horrible place. 

Anyway, with both the PTSD and the phobia of childbirth and pregnancy mixed together, I found myself in the middle of a strange sort of identity crisis. I didn't know how in the world I was going to heal...how I could possibly get over my fears. With the help from my therapist and my wonderful fiancee, I found that healing started with an attitude change. I decided I had to change my perspective on becoming a woman, one fear at a time. Recently, I've started with pregnancy, and the natural duty and obligation of a woman's body being a vessel for life. 

  That phrase I read out of one of my psychology books...""a woman's body is a vessel for new life,"" I felt the cogs and gears turning another direction in my mind...suddenly, an unborn baby in my body went from an alien-like parasite, to something the man I love the most and I created by our love for each other. My body suddenly feels like a warm home, getting itself ready for that one day that the time comes to keep our little one safe and cozy, instead of a host or an empty shell. The idea of childbirth no longer seems so violent and dramatic like they show us on television, but just another strange, weird process that our bodies happen to perform. 

  I think about that baby I'll have one day, I can see his/her eyes looking up at me and my future husband for the first time...seeing our child created by our love and struggles. I want to give that little one the life and kindness I never had.

  Yesterday, I was stark naked in front of a mirror, and I looked at every single inch of myself. I'm a woman now, a beautiful creature. 
  It was cold in there, but it didn't bother me in the least bit. 

 Sure, I'm still scarred by my past...by all those horrible memories. I still cry. I still feel detached and numb sometimes. But I finally feel like I've accepted what I am: a woman. ",13,20140518143158,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I would constantly lie to myself and make excuses for his behaviour, convincing myself that his unjustifiable actions were in fact completely justifiable.

I know that the point is that he is not making time for me. However, I do care about him.
>

He literally bailed on me 2 weeks ago on his only off day, and because we couldn't catch each other, he suggested a break because if not, we were (probably) going to break up. **Now I regret not breaking up** - particularly because I feel like he's flirting with other people in the mean time (from afar, of course). 
>

Now to preface this - he totally pursued me and thinks that I am amazing (or he bullshits that I am amazing). I really did feel a connection and although at times, he's distant at work, we click in person and even on the phone/skype. **I love putting myself out there for him and finding that he feels the same about me. But when I don't find him there for me, it gets much harder.**
>

Last but not least, I just saw a super flirtatious comment from a girl on one of his social media accounts. I know I'll sound like a crazy paranoid ex when I say this, but when he bailed on me, he was stuck in the city she is located at. They like each other's face shots on social media frequently in the last couple of weeks. And I don't even know if I *want to* know if something happened.
>

I don't know what to say to him when we talk.. I need advice, or even better if you can tell me if you were in a similar situation and tell me how it ended up. Sometimes the biggest risks are worth taking, but only when you trust the other person, right?
>

**TL;DR - Guy I recently started dating asked for a break after (in my calculated predictions) he bailed on me to perhaps see another girl who flirts with him on social media.** **Don't know what to feel about it or what to do about it.**

However, the student stops writing, going only as far as her ""expertise"" allowed, steering clear from the sensitive topic of women and beauty which leaves the reader to ponder what suggestions Disney may be subtly  making to society.

Basically I went to shower and when I took off my underwear I saw a lot of brown, mucusy discharge.

I DID forget to take my pill on Friday though, so I took it on Saturday night with my Saturday pill.

So, it's not post-period dried blood. It doesn't look like blood and it doesn't smell like blood, it doesn't really have a smell at all. The consistency is normal, but the color is not. 

I also could not be pregnant unless I'm like five weeks pregnant, as that was the last time I had sex and I've had my period between having sex and now. Also, I always use condoms. I was tested in August and have been with one partner who was also tested and clean (and monogamous). He is my only sexual relationship.


What could this be?? I've never had brown discharge before my period. And if I'm on BC, why would I be so early?

I need to make some big life decisions. I am about to finish my honours year, and I need to decide whether to do a masters and if so, where. I can't do it where I currently am so I will likely have to go overseas. Trouble is, my SO of 4 1/2 years is making this decision much harder. 

The truth is, we have has lots of issues in our relationship, and while we love each other, I don't know if we will last the distance. As we have gotten older, I have realised just how different we are. And I don't know if this will be a good or bad thing in the long run. When I think about being without him, I hate it. But when I think about us being together forever, I'm not so excited either (although I used to be). 

It's just really cutting me up. I know I need to go and do my masters, but it will involve us breaking up. Which kills me inside. I am just so confused. My logical brain and my emotional brain are constantly conflicted. 


The hardest thing is he is going through lots of difficult stuff right now. He doesn't have a direction in life, due to some medical issues he has had/ is having. So part of me wants to cut and run because we are at totally different phases, and the other part of me wants to stay and help him because I feel I owe it to him. 

I don't know what to do. 

Tl;DR: have to decide whether to go overseas for post-grad - if I do, I don't know what to do about my long-term bf who I love but who may not be right for me. ",3,20140518231408,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25x165,"I don't feel comfortable around other women, I prefer male friends...but then they always end up wanting to date me, or have sex with me, and it kills the relationship.","I don't know if it is because I grew up with two older brothers and no sisters, or if it is because my two best friends growing up were one geeky guy and one gay guy, or if it is because every chick I was ""friends"" with in highschool/college ended up completely ""Mean Girl""ing me, and always seemed to be trying to subtly (out not so subtly), undermine my self esteem. Girl on girl friendships always felt competitive and bitchy, and I always dreamed to end up getting hurt and betrayed in some hideous and vicious kind of emotional bullying. So...now I don't trust other women, and I always feel stressed out and am unable to relax in their presence. I don't know if it is residual hurt and bitterness from these earlier betrayals, or if all the women I meet now still are vindictive, evil, bitches ready to stab you in the back at the first opportunity. I only feel comfortable around guys. I feel relaxed, and I actually have fun, instead of feeling uncomfortable and full of dread and trepidation. Thr problem is that eventually, even if I very clearly state that I am NOT interested in them in any sexual or romantic way, the guys always end up eventually misinterpreting my ease around them,my friendliness, and my sincere interest in them as a fellow human being. They ALWAYS seem to try and date me, or at the least they hit on me-and not just in a casual and inconsequential ""friends-with-benefits"" kind of way. ...Always in a friendship killing, awkward, kind of way. The only people I seem able to really be friends with then, and feel like I can trust, are gay men. It seems like guys can't be friends with girls without it becoming romantic/sexual, unless at least one of you is gay. Idk what to do about this. It ends up making me very likely, as I have no ""girlfriends"", and my friendships with his always seem to implode once they realize that I really am serious when I say that I am not looking for any kind of romantic relationship. And the solution can't be to ONLY befriend gay men...that seems a bit odd and dysfunctional, on my part. Do any other women feel this way? (Actually, I am already COMPLETELY certain that many, many other women don't enjoy hanging out with other women). I guess I am more asking if other women feel this way for the same reasons (or for other reasons), or if any women have managed to get over this distrust and dislike of their own gender, and actually started to like other chicks. Or if any girls know how to avoid these romantic expectations that seem to ruin any real friendship between men and women. The guys always seem to think that either I am lying, or that I am going to change my mind, when I tell them I am not looking for a sexual/romantic relationship. Then when I turn them down and they realize I am actually serious, and that I really DON'T secretly want to be their girlfriend, the relationship is ruined. If I can't be friend with women, and I can't be friends with men, WTF am I supposed to do if I want to have ANY friends outside of my S.O.?

t3_25xe61,My boyfriend has OCD. I need some help.,"I wasn’t really sure where to post this. I’m open to suggestions if there is somewhere better! This might feel like venting, because that’s what it is. 
My (20F) boyfriend (27M) has OCD. His compulsions have caused some problems, but we've (for the most part) been able to work through them. 

Near the start of the relationship, I had to make my feelings known about some of his behaviors. 
He shaves off all of his body hair. I have a head of curly, thick hair and often shed. He is constantly picking hairs off of me and him. He is always making comments about my ""mane"" “hairy monster” or ""woman fur"", but it's usually said with a smile, so it never bothered me. The first time we were intimate, he was appalled by my body hair and asked me to remove it. (it was a spur of the moment thing and I was kickin it oldschool...) Again, not a big deal. That's probably very common in relationships. If he sees a stray eyebrow hair on me, he will pluck it. Same with arm hairs or skin on my face. I feel like he's always picking at something on me. He tries to squeeze blackheads if he sees them. I have very dry skin and it's something I've always been sensitive about. Him pointing it out always makes me self conscious. 

He begs me to let him vacuum my apartment (I live with 5 other girls and things get hairy fast) but the one time I let him, he spent the entire time complaining about the hair, and sent me pictures of the hair in his vacuum. It made my roommates uncomfortable and they asked that I not let him do that again. 

He asked if he could brush my hair every day to get the stray hairs out of his room. I said no. 

He doesn’t allow sex in his bed. We have to do it on the floor. Which I’m sure is also very clean. Sometimes he puts a paper towel down.  We were planning a weekend where I’d spend the night (he has roommates too, but they’re very chill) but ultimately he decided it wouldn’t work because I couldn’t shower in his apt, and I couldn’t spend the night and not shower. 

Despite being a generally unhealthy eater, he is very self conscious about his weight and appearance. He is 6'2 and weighs about 135 lbs. I am 5'8 and weigh the same. He constantly makes comments about the weights of my roommates or girls we see. Girls who are my size, sometimes smaller. I asked him if he wanted me to lose weight and he said it didn't matter to him, he would be attracted either way. He constantly touches and plays with my butt. He says he loves it because it's ""big and squishy."" No girl EVER wants to hear that about her butt.  I hate it. I feel like a fetish sometimes. 

This makes me sound fat, sloppy, messy and hideous. I am not any of those things. I just feel that way when I’m with him. 

His words are good, but his treatment of women in general is horrifying. He slut shames all of his exs, his roommate's girlfriends, and women he knows nothing about. We had a fight and i asked that he not use words like ""slut"" or ""skank"" to describe anyone. He apologized and agreed, but he still slips up quite often. His homophobia is a whole other issue that probably will not be resolved. Very early into the relationship I told him how much it hurt me. He apologized and went right back to throwing around “fag” and “dyke”. When I protest, he calls me a “PC hipster” and things like that. 

Last night we got in a fight because i told him that i didn't feel wanted sexually, and that's very important to me. I told him i felt like I was always initiated, and that I wanted him to see me as more than just my butt. He said very little about this except ""It's hard when the woman you love feels like you see her as a piece of ass."" 

Today he refused to see me because he hadn’t showered yet. I told him I didn’t care and he said that It was important to him and I needed to respect that. I can do that, it just hurts.

There are so many wonderful qualities. He’s so giving, so helpful. So snuggly. He’s casually mentioned marriage a few times and I think he’s serious. 

I’m not 100% on what I’m really asking here. I thought about posting on r/OCD so I could get some input on how he thinks, but his OCD is a part of him and he says he likes the way he is, so I just don’t know. 

Tl;DR My boyfriend has OCD and it makes me feel like trash. How do I fix this?

It wasn't planned, and we'd kind of talked before and I'd made it quite clear that we wouldn't have sex. I wanted to sort of save myself until college at least, I guess. While I am technically almost in college, I almost feel..cheated. 
I mean, I'd told him to slow down if things get too wild because I tend to just go with the flow and can't help it. And he said he would. 
Even then, somehow one day, we ended up doing it and I didn't really stop him so I don't know if I have the right to feel this way. And he honestly cared for me throughout and made sure it was a good experience for me, and he asked me several times after if i was okay or if I felt forced. I said I didn't but I kind of freaked out later, not that it would make any difference. And I suppose it is better that I lost it to someone I love and trust than to someone random after a drunk party in college. 
Idk, I'm just ranting now. But am I wrong to feel this way? :|",0,20140519042350,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_25x9e8,"People were complaining about ""consent workshops"" at my uni, so I wrote an article about it.","I'd love to hear what /r/TwoXchromosomes think. Basically the situation is the Women's Campaign have pressured the student union into hosting consent workshops. Feminist stories have been met with criticism in the comments section of the student newspaper, The Tab. So I decided to write this.

**The FemiNazis are getting us to do consent workshops now.**


**Hostility to feminism is unfortunately popular in Cambridge.** But the cries of “Feminazi” are sadly ironic, because this is not a women’s issue. Stanley Milgram used his famous social experiment to suggest that Nazi officers were not warped people: they were normal people who committed evil because of the urge in every human being to follow social convention. With this in mind, a perspective needs to be shared. Lad culture threatens to blur the line between social convention and assault. It is men, not feminists, who must confront this head on.


**But why are these workshops needed in the first place?** Do people really believe all men are lecherous perverts who need a good talking to in order to keep their man parts tucked in? Well, no. And hopefully the Women’s Campaign doesn’t either. The aims of this are to tackle lad culture, and stop victim blaming. Legitimate goals with legitimate reasons for pursuing. Firstly, victim blaming is rife. Remarks such as, “People drink themselves into these situations,” and “It sounds like she was definitely kissing back,” are not uncommon, especially on the Tab. Even if these viewpoints are valid in some situations, they’re not going to help us deal with sexual violence. That much should be obvious. Remarks such as “Why did he do that?” “Why do so many men think this is acceptable behaviour?” “Why do men keep abusing women?” These are the questions that will get us somewhere. And it needs to be men asking other men. We need unabusive men to challenge their friends when they say something misogynistic. Instead of laughing along, shouldn’t we oppose it? Shouldn’t we say, “Hey that could be my sister you’re talking about. I don’t appreciate it?” Only when men lose social status amongst their friends for being misogynistic will we start to see meaningful progress. Only then will the harm of lad culture have ended.


**And let’s be clear: lad culture is pernicious because it has arisen out of a desire for social status.** It plays on men’s insecurities and doubts about relationships and popularity. It is not the twisted reality of a parallel universe where Robin Thicke is Equality minister and Katie Hopkins is Women of the Year. It is the logical conclusion of an ever pervasive (and quite wrong) belief that girls are not interested in meek, accommodating, “nice” men. That lacking sexual experience is tantamount to being a social outcast. That in order to be sexually successful you have to be a “dick.” The past articles on the Tab on lad culture and assault have illustrated these situations are rarely clear-cut. Questions such as “If she’s coming home with me, does she want me to make a move?” and “How drunk is too drunk?” have no one-word answer for all women. To some people (for reasons beyond my comprehension), drunk one-night stands are something to choose, want, and enjoy. They might be a small minority, but they exist. But for others who do not give their consent, it can be unacceptable and traumatic to even try. This highlights that a judgement call is needed. In that grey area, lad culture encourages men to make their decisions based on the likelihood of sexual and social gain instead of the wishes of the people involved. When men get these decisions wrong, that’s when assault happens. To address this, men must learn to be conscious of consent as much as their social status.


**But you might still be wondering why these workshops are to be compulsory.** I believe the answer is simple. This is not an issue about being sensitive to the “plight of women,” stuck between the oppression of a male dominated society and the patronising goodwill of some sympathetic male protectors. This is a leadership issue. When a public figure is found guilty of sexual assault, they don’t need to be more sympathetic to women. They need leadership training. They have failed in their leadership. Although by this point it’s already too late; they also probably need to go to jail.


In Cambridge of all places, the leaders of tomorrow should understand that consent is the foundation of our non-Nazi society, and that challenging social convention is vital to this. I do not know whether these consent classes will be any good, but I do think I understand something about why they’re needed. It’s our responsibility as men to support them.

t3_25x6ep,I'm too damn nice.,"Hey TwoX,

I'm (21f) looking for a little advice to keep me out of uncomfortable situations that I've got myself into for being... too nice? I think my personality comes off flirty because I'm smiley and chatty with everyone, so it probably comes off as flirty with guys.

I was always under the impression that boys and girls can be friends but it's got to the point where I realized that every friendship I've had with a guy has either turned into a relationship, or the guy has wanted it to turn into a relationship and then it gets awkward. Even when I preface it with ""I ONLY WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND AND WANT NOTHING MORE FROM YOU"", it still happens.

Do I just avoid friendships with guys? Do I risk coming off as a bitch and be straight up with them from the start? It's a pretty integral part of the way I interact with people in general so I don't want to shut it off, but maybe there are tips or boundaries I can set up? (The problem with setting up boundaries at the beginning of a friendship or whatever is that I feel like I'm being presumptuous and think they'll be into me, so I don't because I give everyone the benefit of the doubt...)

And I appreciate that my post wasn't downvoted into oblivion like it was headed towards at first. I'm very happy so many people decided to respond and share their stories instead. THANK YOU!

--------------------------------------------------

This is something I think about now and then. I began considering this as a teenager and now that I am nearly 34, this is popping into mind more and more. 

I love my mom. She was a good mother when I was growing up. She wasn't perfect but she is only human and I acknowledged that. She wasn't an addict, nor was she abusive, nor neglectful. She can be very funny and she laughs easily. She loves animals (as do I) and is great with them. 

But I've always felt a disconnect between us. As I grew older, I noticed how some of my gal pals would hang out with their mothers, or go shopping. These days, many of my female friends my age hang out with their mothers when they can, which I notice thanks to social media. I'm very happy for them but seeing this also makes me wistful.

Outside of animal-related activities (like horseback riding lessons together), my mom and I didn't hang out when I was growing up. We went shopping a couple times and while it was fun, it also felt forced to me. These days, my husband and I visit my now-retired parents a handful of times a year (they live about an hour away from us). I enjoy the visits but they are also stressful because I feel like I need to adapt to my parents' expectations of me each time. Yes, even at nearly-34.

As my parents grow older,  however, I find myself wishing that the disconnect between my mom and I wasn't there (there is no disconnect between my dad and I). I've tried to chat with her like I would my friends (but on a more PG-13 scale) and she will usually end up disagreeing with me on one topic or the other, then taking it personally when I state why I feel differently about this topic. It doesn't matter how gentle I am in my approach--she claims I've ""hurt"" her so I just back away and give up. 

As a result my encounters with her feel kind of hollow and  many times I don't know what to say to her. We can only discuss our cats so often! A major thing I wish she would tell me more about are her parents and any family history she knows, so occasionally I will ask her about these topics over email which gives her time to respond at her leisure. But that's the closest we get.

Is it truly the norm to be such good friends with your mother, as it seems from what I've seen with my friends?

Edit #1: Not sure why I'm getting so many downvotes. Really? I thought twox was open-minded :/ If this isn't the suitable sub for such a question then please redirect me to an appropriate one.

t3_25ytrq,Just looking to vent to a receptive audience.,"Yesterday I failed miserably in a promise I made to myself a few months ago that I would stop arguing with stupid people on the internet.

I commented on an article about a feminist student group that advocates placing trigger warnings on assigned readings in schools. The general attitude of the kind and tolerant subscribers to r/news was that this was a ridiculous attempt at censorship.

So I was a fool and shared my own experience. My younger sister was raped by her ex and his friends while I was in college. A few months later during a class presentation on the Nanking Massacre, I had to excuse myself after being confronted by a really graphic image of a dead rape victim. If someone had simply said ""The next picture depicts a dead rape victim"", maybe I could have kept it together. Or maybe I would have still left. Regardless, I would have been a little better prepared.

Some lovely and considerate man decided to let me know that I was invalidly reacting based on an experience that, essentially, is not my own. Further more, that I was a child and that the world would ""obliterate me"". 

First of all, I'm 25 and a completely independent adult, and as far as I know, I have not been ""obliterated"". Second of all, I of course realize that I was not raped. My sister was. Whenever I think about it, I am enraged at how improbable it is that I will be able to strangle the life out of her rapists. I am ashamed of myself for failing to keep her safe. I feel hollow, disgusted, ect. ect. 

It's still not easy to think about, but you know, 2 months after it happened I was having a really hard time dealing with it. Is it really that outrageous that the immediate family member of a rape victim would not want to look at pictures of sexual violence while they were still in the process of coping? Apparently!

Fuck that guy.

Edit:
I just want to articulate that I by no means believe I have PTSD as a result of my sister's rape. It may be difficult to imagine how rape effects family members, but there are tons of support groups out there for that specific reason, so I am very confident that the grief I experienced was entirely normal. 

My initial point was not ""Look at me, my sister was raped and it made me sad, so now everyone should be sensitive to my feelings!"". I was trying to contribute to what I thought was a conversation about how the emotional and social impacts of sexual violence should be dealt with in an academic setting. Are trigger warnings the best way to deal with that? I don't know, but based on my own experience it could be helpful.

FINALLY, it's not even the fact that someone would disagree with this opinion that resulted in my angsty post. I think it's pretty fucked up that I can't have this conversation without being told that the emotions I had at the time couldn't possibly have been bad enough to warrant any sort of mitigation beyond me growing a pair, or that I am just looking for attention or something. I seriously could care less if someone feels that way about my little story. I care more that this seems to be a very widespread reaction to assertions that rape is a hugely negative thing, in general. The sad thing is that the chances that anyone who feels this way will eventually be proven wrong when someone they love is raped are not in their favor.",46,20140519144417,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_25yec0,Adults can be the worse (about casual sexism),"So I just graduated college this weekend, and yesterday I had a graduation party to celebrate. My mom invited a ton of her friends and our neighbors, so I had to spend a good amount of time doing my polite rounds, having pleasant conversations and telling them about my future plans, you know all that bs.

At one point I mentioned last week, in order to get my degree in English, I had to write a 20 page research paper. ""What on?"" I was asked by one woman. Ahh...I feared the worse. My topic touched on feminist topics, and this is not a polite, delightful conversation topic. ""Oh, it was on the representation of female friendships in Women's Films and how their problematic"" I replied, purposefully not mentioning my thesis being ""and how these friendships are defined by and at the whim of patriarchy.""

And that's when the casual sexism begins.

The woman laughed. ""Well, my husband has a theory that women can't really be friends with each other until their in the 30s,"" she explained. ""Before then they're just competing with each other, over jobs, over boys, you know, that kind of thing.""

""Yes, but do women compete with each other because that's how we are as women, or because we culturally teach women to treat each other that way?"" I replied. She tried to deflect answering the question directly.

A man heard us too. ""I can't speak from personal experience, since, you know,"" he says, hiding his distain for the topic behind his sunglasses but not being able to resist giving his opinion. ""But my daughter only hangs out with boys now because she says girls are too much drama.""

""That's funny,"" I said, deciding to give my anecdotal evidence as well. ""Because I have a close group of girl-friends and we've pretty much stopped hanging out with the guys that used to be in our group because THEY are too much drama."" He avoided replying as well.

I guess the reason why this whole event bothered me so much is because, well, this is why I wrote that paper in the first place. I wrote about how these movies gave barely any credit to inter-female relationships and how they can be important to a woman's life, and instead these movies focus on the obsession over woman-to-man romantic relationships that are all too often unequal in their power structure. And the reason why I thought that was important is because I didn't think it just appeared in movies, but in real life as well. And I was given proof of that right before me. I am extremely close to my girl-friends and we've helped each other so much, but here I have one woman telling me that she assumes that these friendships can't be real because we're still in our 20s and 'haven't gotten over our competitiveness,' and I have a man assuming that these girl-friends only add drama to my life, and only friendships with men would avoid that. 

I guess it also bothers me because this was at the celebration of my college graduation, meaning that in some ways I'm now in the 'adult world.' And these are the kinds of conversations I have to look forward to, apparently.

Sorry for my rant, guys, hopefully you'll relate~

(also I want to make clear that I don't think that male-to-female relationships are impossible or aren't important, or that I avoid them in my life. Personally, as of late, I don't have many close guy-friends, but this is not an active choice. I just feel like culturally we undermine female-to-female relationships, which bothers the hell out of me, but I have nothing against male-to-female relationships in comparison)",2,20140519121340,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I'm currently engaged in several activities outside work such as gym, keyboard and singing lessons, a study group about religion and I'm also currently seeing a shrink.

I just moved to a new city for work and while I seem to have great interactions in the office, I can't seem to make any real friendships.

I can't see anything blatantly awkward that I do or say. I recognize social cues (I think?), I'm kind and thoughtful. I get very good reviews from clients and higher-ups at work. But when I interact with women coworkers outside of work I feel like an outcast. The other women just have some kind of connection that I don't seem to have. They text each other funny gossipy things and they don't include me. Even when I get invited to go out with them it constantly seems like there is some kind of joke I'm not in on.

t3_25y3w0,Can we talk about the 'Not All Men' meme?,"Fundamentally it's meant to be about having faith in a person making an argument, that he or she aren't making any sweeping generalizations. And it's about posts that derail that argument by talking about anecdotes or a unique account of an event. But I don't feel like it's used that way in practice.

Oftentimes, when people say ""not all men"" they're responding to a post that comes off as though it stereotypes men. It's not a statement about one or two men who don't fit the description - it's a statement about men in general, and it's backlash against a post that seems to marginalize significant groups of men by talking in apparent universals.

I think the latter case is justified. If someone makes a post that talks about ""men"", unqualified, it's their responsibility to make sure it's understood if and when they're referring only to a -particular- group of men. And if they weren't sensitive enough with their language (and this is something one needs to be extra-sensitive about), they shouldn't get to balk at someone who criticizes either the tone of their post or the message about men that it seems to imply. 

In practice, with the rising popularity of this meme, I think people are getting too eager to call someone out on a ""not all men"" argument, and they don't bother making the distinction between the latter and the former. So a post that comes off as legitimately insensitive gets defended by it just as well. And I just don't think this is the way to go, especially not if someone hopes to buy both genders' mutual understanding.

t3_25ys7k,on the fence — medication vs. surgical?,"I found out I was pregnant this morning via a urine test. I took two individual tests and both came out positive. I am 5 weeks along (first day of last period was 5 weeks ago). I am very sure I want to terminate this pregnancy but my main concern is just taking care of this issue ASAP for peace of mind. 

The doctor at planned parenthood told me I have two options, taking an abortion pill or an in-clinic suction abortion (surgical option). I really need some advice on what route to go on. I understand it's ultimately my decision but I wanted some advice.

The pill option: I can take it this Wednesday. The cons are that I've read it might not work and I might need to follow up with surgery. Also it seems like it's really painful and can last a long while. 

The surgical option: I would have to wait until the 31st (this would make me in my 7th week). The pros are that it seems like I know then and there it was effective in terminating the pregnancy (is this true?). Also, it would be less painful/disruptive and quick. It's just that it kinda makes me nervous to sit here and do nothing but wait for 2 weeks to take care of this issue.

Ultimately, I'm torn between the two because I want to get this over with as soon as possible but I also want to know it's done for good when I go through with it.

t3_25yvht,I just need to be told it's going to be okay.,"Two years ago, I met a very special boy. I was 18 when I went on a two week Holocaust based trip to Poland and Israel and I met a guy named R* and over the course of the latter 9 days of the trip, we started to fall for each other. I know, commence eye rolling. But on that plane ride home, we basically decided to start a long distance relationship (him on the east coast and me on the west). Seeing as it was three months away from the start of college for both of us, we obviously had lots of people telling us it was a bad idea. But you know what? It was one of the best years of my life. We flew back and forth a total of four times and it was unreal how fast we fell in love with each other and started talking about our future together. 

We broke up a year into the relationship because of me; I'm a very affectionate and physically oriented person and it was getting too difficult for me to be in a relationship and not be able to touch him and still have it feel tangible. Once the break up happened, he backed away for a bit. I still wanted to be close because I still believed in a future together. He still wanted that future but he was too afraid it wouldn't end up happening. Slowly, he started coming back and we resumed a relatively close friendship. We've had this going on for the last year. 

Two weeks ago, my moms friend's friend randomly lets it be known that she is looking for a nanny for their kids to fly with them to THE VERY CITY R LIVES IN for 2 weeks while they go on daytime business trips. I'm a very big believer of things happening for a reason, so I let R know and he was incredibly excited to hear this. We started talking even more and decided that we would engage romantically with everything except for the relationship label. At one point I got scared and asked him about what would happen after I left. He told me that he likes to deal with that when it comes so that we can enjoy it while it lasts.

My first day in his city was last Wednesday. I saw him during the evening and we had a great reunion at first but for some reason we were arguing about little things a LOT. Later on, after we'd been intimate, I started getting very emotional about the uncertainty of our futures. About how I desperately wanted him in mine and/but would feel guilty to fall for someone else and want a future with them etc. He was nothing but reassuring. The next day, I saw him again, and the weird arguing was back and by questioning why it was there, I opened what was to be the enormous can of worms. 

I could tell her was more irritable and impatient than he normally is and I asked him why. That launched us into a conversation about how ""people change"" and ""maybe we're too different now"" and yadda yadda but I eventually got him to open up to the real reason instead of giving me bullshit ones cause he was too afraid to tell the truth. 

After the emotional conversation we'd had the previous night, he kind of got freaked out. He became afraid of not being able to live his life because he'd always be in love with me and comparing other people to me. This has absolutely been my life for this past year; I was in a wonderful relationship but I was literally afraid to let myself love that person. And so he said he needs to let me go for now romantically and that we can't see each other anymore in a romantic context for the duration of my trip. He said that he thinks there's still a ""substantial chance"" that we will be together at the end but he can't close himself off anymore for the sake of his happiness.

The reason this shatters me so much is because for so long I've felt and seen a beautiful future with a wonderful man who was my best friend while we were together. We were incredibly compatible and wanted the same things out of life and talked in such detail about the future we would have. He even told me when he'd propose to me. And now, that's gone. Please don't get me wrong- at the end of the conversation I told him through tears that I thought he was doing the right thing, because I want nothing more than happiness for him. This isn't me trying to wrap my claws around him or bemoaning his selfish ways; I support his decision. But it completely blindsided me and now I find myself scrambling to erase him from my future in order to protect myself from the very real chance that he won't be in it. It HURTS so much to have to force myself to erase a future that was so certain and wonderful. I feel like no matter what, nothing will ever measure up or even if it will, I'll always find myself wondering ""what if"". The fact that I only get one life in this universe and he may very well not be in it is scaring me so much because I never want to have regrets in my life and even though I don't know what I could have done differently, I'm so afraid that the loss of a future with this person from my life will be one I can never get over. 

I don't know what to do or what to think but now I've got a week and a half left in this place and all I do is nanny two babies and desperately try not to cry in front of them. The reason this is so devastating to me is because this isn't just a breakup with someone really cool, it's the loss of a future I was so sure of and happy with. One of the worst parts is how he is capable of seeing alternate paths in his mind- with one of them including me. But now I don't think I can allow myself to see that anymore in order to protect myself. I find myself needing to completely erase the idea of us being together at all in order to heal. But I don't know if that's the right thing to do. I just don't know. I needed to rant and cry and if any of you have inspirational or wise words, they would be so so welcome.

t3_25y0v1,Barely having a period and I (18F) don't know why (semi-freaking out).,"Not sure if this is where I should post this, but I created a throwaway for it, so here goes:

My last two period have been TINY. Normally, I'd have one for about 4-6 days, with the first two being a competition to see how many pads I can go through in one day, and the next couple of days everything calming down. The color changes are like a regular period: bright to dark. 

However, my last period was more of spotting over a span of 3 days. The first day was still the brightest and the 3rd was the darkest, but there wasn't really anything there. I barely needed a pad. 
I thought: ""Alright, no problem, we'll see how it is in a month.""

Same story. Maybe an ounce more of everything, but I'm basically having the same thing:

Bright, but small, first day, and now (the second day), it's a bit darker, but still. More of spotting than a period.
I don't know whether it's a hormonal thing, a pregnancy thing, a nutritional thing, or what. I want to rule out pregnancy, because I've only just lost my virginity a month-and-a-half ago, and since then, had sex maybe 3 or 4 times, where he came. But there was always a condom and it always got tied up and thrown away at the end.

Is it normal to sometimes not have much of a period? 

Edit: NOT PREGNANT, JUST TOOK THE TEST, it felt extremely surreal and I now know a bit about the abortion laws here where I live (call it late-night cramming). Anyway, I'm even more relieved to not have to tell the guy about any of this.

Last night and all day today I  have been feeling weirdly nauseated and achy, with lower back pain. It's not my time of the month, and I missed my last period because my cycle is just weird like that; so I have no idea when my next one is supposed to come anyway.

Then my boyfriend's dad said something about how everyone already knows, and she started yelling that he watched porn with my boyfriend.. so I guess that's sexual abuse? That was all the detail I got. Im not sure if he actually touched my boyfriend or how old he was at the time.

After his parents were done arguing, his dad said he needed to talk to him in private. They talked for maybe ten minutes and then my boyfriend came back and sat by me. I asked him if he was okay, and he was like ""yeah I'm fine!"" like whatever they talked about or whatever happened was no big deal. 

I dont think his mom is lying, because his dad was going along with it and saying how much he regretted it but couldn't change anything, etc.

I have no idea what all happened, if it's as bad as it sounds, how old my boyfriend was or what. I don't know what to do about this. We've been together for almost five years and he has never said anything to me about it. Should I talk to him or leave it alone? We see his dad and mom really frequently, I would say at least twice a week, but I really do not feel comfortable around my boyfriend's dad if he molested my boyfriend. If I should talk to him what should I even say? 

We have been having issues in bed, and he has self esteem problems, but I dont want to assume that it has something to do with being molested... but there's also a chance that whatever happened greatly affected him. I don't know what to do.

After much thought and research. I finally took the plunge and had Mirena inserted Saturday. Just as I've seen on other posts here the insertion was uncomfortable and as painful as the worst period cramps. I spent most of Saturday experiencing severe cramps and therefore laid around most of the day.

My OBGYN said that I would experience cramping for a day or day and a half after insertion but not longer than that. I'm three days out now and I'm still cramping a lot.

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced cramping that have lasted longer than what their doc said? 

What does it feel like when the IUD has migrated? 

And what does perforation feel like? Or how do you know if something's not right?

I know this all might sound paranoid, but I'm a bit of a worry wart and I don't have many people in my life who would support me, my mom is really old school in regards to sexual health and my sister belittles any concerns I may have. I do have a loving boyfriend of 3 yrs. but what I really need right now is some support from other women who know about this.

t3_260plx,"Best friend is having a whirlwind wedding, and I have essentially been ruled out as a bridesmaid","This is my first post to TwoX, I'm really glad I found this subreddit.

This may sound really petty, and I'm getting a little annoyed with myself for being peeved about it. I've known my best friend for 13 years. I don't get to see her much any more (I moved out of our home town 4/5 years ago) but we text almost every day. She's like a sister to me. 

She's getting married this weekend. It was a pretty whirlwind decision and at first it was only going to be her, her boyfriend, and two witnesses, then having a bigger celebration next year, but it soon developed into a wedding with just close friends and family. My boyfriend and I are going and we were (..are) really looking forward to it.

She always maintained that this would be a pretty simple affair, no big deal, just a 'casual' marriage. She didn't even plan on having a dress. It's now gone to the complete opposite end of the scale, and she's got the dress, a car, the full works. She didn't tell me that she planned to have bridesmaids, there was no mention of anything at all. She'd always said that I'd be one of her bridesmaids when she gets married, and she'd be my only one (as I have zero girl friends where I live now). I saw on facebook (cue sounding like I'm on Jeremy Kyle) that a girl I know posted on her timeline saying 'I am in love with my bridesmaid dress'...hello legitbabyseal14's shocked face. I had to try so hard not to cry! How pathetic.

I asked her if she was having bridesmaids and she said she's decided to buy two of her friends bridesmaid dresses, saying to me 'you wouldn't have been able to try it on, I'll get you one for the next time' - completely ruling out any possibility of me coming down for a weekend to try it - which you know what, I would've done. 100 miles of distance wouldn't stop me going to try something on if she wanted me to be a part of her day. It's just like she's not even taken into consideration even asking me, just ruling me out straight away.

I got a bit upset, I valued our friendship...I still do, but I'm feeling a bit put off by her now. I don't want to be a bridesmaidzilla, I'm just glad I get to see her get married, albeit with gritted teeth when I see her two friends in their undoubtedly gorgeous dresses. Am I being out of order? My boyfriend has been supportive and he seems to think that she's been a bit wrong in this situation. It's absolutely her day, absolutely up to her what it is she wants to do, I respect that, but I just feel like I've been a bit disregarded in the whole thing.

t3_260tuh,"I've (21, F) never had a crush on anyone.","I'm 21 and I to date have never developed a 'proper' crush on someone. There's various celebrities and a few fictional characters I'd say I have a bit of one on, and I do see various people that it's like 'Oh hello, you're rather nice looking'. But it's never been a full blown crush, and on an few that are more 'intense' it's generally because they seem to be a genuinely nice person, so it's more like 'Awww they seem nice, wouldn't it be nice to meet them?' 

I never went through a 'boy crazy/girl crazy' phrase and I'd say the whole thing was kind of low on my radar like when I was in primary school and about 7/8 I think and people were moving onto 'crushes' and 'boyfriend/girlfriend' stuff I wasn't interested (whilst academically 'bright' and apparently slightly advanced I think socially I lagged behind a bit), like I think some vague 'Oh a realtionship would be nice' stuff came through when I was about 16. 

I'm not really sure on my orientation, because of the 'never had a proper crush' thing means there's not a clear 'Oh I like xyz' to go with. And by extension I've never dated, (I tried online dating for a short period but it didn't really work out due to personal circumstances at the time),never flirted with anyone (I've been hit on but both cases have been rather creepy) you get the picture. I don't think I'm on the Ace spectrum but who knows. 

I don't think there's anything 'wrong' . I know I'm likely very much not the only one. 

I feel a lot of it is more personal circumstances have not given me the opportunity to be in a position to get a crush/have a chance to go out with someone . Like I got bullied in school, I'm quite introverted and have sort of solitary hobbies and by my own admission I don't get out much (and there's not a lot of places to go where I live), and I honestly don't have a wide social circle. 

I seem to get on with people okay, at least I'm a lot better than I was, I'm dyspraxic and one of the things it can effect is social skills, so I honestly do find it hard to interact with people at times, like just not really knowing 'how' to be sociable.

t3_260jt4,Problem? Must be a Woman,"Throwaway because my boyfriend knows my username.

It's not a huge issue but I think it might be over the long term. We've been together for 2 years now but lately I've noticed that my boyfriend's mother has a really low opinion of women, particularly women my age.

I should preface this by saying that we get on brilliantly, she's almost a surrogate mother to me at times. But in her job she deals with a lot of young women who make poor decisions (trying to vague this up as much as possible) and so seems to think that the same is true of me- or at least that's the impression she gives off at times.

Last night she was giving us advice on our housing situation and she basically said that if there's a problem, look for the woman. 

Because women are really the only ones who cause issues... /s

The actual situation has nothing to do with the woman involved, but it really got to me that she instantly went to that. It also feels like she thinks my boyfriend is weakwilled and is liable to be 'taken in' by a controlling woman- it's never mentioned overtly by her at least (though it has by him) but that is the feeling I'm getting. He is probably the least weakwilled person I've ever known so I don't know why she assumes that's likely.
  
I just feel like she doesn't respect women which is odd as she's in a senior position in a male dominated field, so I thought if anyone would get it she would.

t3_260id7,"Sports bras, big boobs and nipple piercings","After almost ten years of doing squat, I (25) have recently taken up running/jogging for about an hour three times a week. I'm loving it so far, and this is largely due to *finally* finding a sports bra that can tame my 40E jugs. The only problem is that about 40 minutes into my workout, my nipples start hurting like I dipped them into ice water for too long. I'm suspecting that this is due to the fact that I got my nipples pierced in my ten sports-bra-less years, and that the segment rings, combined with the ultra-tight sports bra (a wireless bustier-type thing, if it makes any difference), are somehow cutting off circulation. 

So I'm wondering, fellow busty Sporty Spices of 2XC -- are tender/hurting nipples normal for large boobs? Could there be other factors at work? Or am I going to have to choose between my piercings and my running?",3,20140520024823,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_260axr,Rant: India,"Let me just preface this by saying that I am an Indian woman (by descent, I was born and raised in the states).  

There's been a big hullabaloo in the media fairly recently about India and rape.  Inevitably, these stories get posted on reddit, and certain recurring tropes get entrenched in the collective consciousness.  I'm just gonna list the stuff I take issue with.  

**1)** First off, there's the claim that India is somehow ""rape central"".  Statistically, this is false (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#Rape_statistics_by_country).  

A common counter-argument to this is the idea that there might be a lot of women not reporting rape incidents, or that a lot of rapes might occur in underpoliced areas.  This may well be true, and definitely deserves more investigation, but the argument used is very specious.  You're essentially saying ""India has a lot of rape"" because ""it might have a lot of rape"".  In addition, it discounts the complex issues of underreporting in other countries, and only focuses on India, as if this problem is unique to the country.  

""Then why do we hear about so much rape from India?""  Well, maybe it's because the country has fucking 1.2 billion people in it?  I mean, that's more than the entire population of the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan combined.  

**2)** Then there are the accounts of staring.  Staring is rude, yes.  Men like to look at women, and in the west, we expect them to do this discreetly.  Personally, I have never noticed a problem with staring when I've been to India.  My guess is that some portion of these reports might be due to the novelty of seeing a non-Indian?  

There's also the possibility that maybe, and I really hope this isn't true, but maybe, some women feel, on a subconscious level, more threatened by men of color, and are therefore a lot more likely to interpret things like normal looks as ""stares"" or ""leers""?  I don't mean to discount the concerns of women, but the concerns of people of color are just as valid.  

**3)** Double standards - basically going off of the last idea; nobody really makes a huge deal out of groping in Japanese trains (but they should).  A German accent is seen as sexy, an Indian one is seen as creepy, etc.  Things like this further lend themselves to a more ""subjective"" interpretation of things, which scrutinizes certain ethnic groups under a more discriminating lens.  

**4)** Shaming Indian men.  I've personally encountered this once:  I was having dinner at an Indian restaurant with a (white) girlfriend of mine, chit-chatting about classes and such, when she declared what a shame it was that she couldn't eat Indian food more often.  When I told her she could easily find ingredients at local Indian-oriented groceries, she replied, under her breath, ""Yeah...but it just feels so creepy there.  No offense.""  

When I questioned further, she was unable to explain why (""The guys are just creepy!"").  I'm sorry, but this just seemed like blatant racism to me.  

**5)** It takes a local phenomenon and turns it into a nation-wide one.  Nearly every rape case I've heard about has come out of Delhi, maybe a couple from Mumbai.  These are two cities in India.  America isn't full of crime simply due to Detroit and St. Louis, and India isn't full of rape for the same reasons.  

Of course, nobody sees it fit to generalize all of America as being reflective of its two worst-offending cities.  But, somehow, we end up generalizing India that way.  Kind of akin to how ""Africa"" is perceived as a country.  

**6)** It ""excuses"" western societies.  One of the most oft-repeated tropes in the ""India rape"" threads is how great the U.S. is in comparison, at upholding womens' safety.  Often, these comments will ""exempt"" the U.S. from criticism.  ""Feminists should focus on the *real* misogyny"", ""Say what you want about us, but at least we're not *India*"", etc.  Yes, white western men are perfect and don't ever rape, or sexually harass people.  Feminists should quit feminism and rally against INDIA, because after all, that's where all the rape is, except not.  Ugh.  

I'm anticipating a lot of hate for this, but let me just reiterate that I am NOT excusing rape, and I am NOT excusing the objectification of women.  I recognize that India is still corrupt, and has to make a lot of progress, but the situation is not even close to what most redditors make it out to be.  I'm merely pointing out the unfairness, and possibly very racist double standards that are sometimes used in discussing them.

t3_261i1l,I am not ashamed of my abortion. [venting],"Recently I tried to give advice and comfort to one of my friend's now-pregnant teen child. I wanted to give her insight into my experience and let her know that no matter how alone she felt, there were always people around that can empathize and show love. The reaction of the people around me blew my mind.

It is appalling to me that when I talk about my own experiences, others around me feel like it should be something I keep to myself.  ""Why would you tell people?"" they say. Why?? Because keeping it a secret and acting like it is something that we should not be talking about only affirms the misconceptions that it is wrong and you should be ashamed of your decision. Well you know what? I am not ashamed.   ""Well you just didn't have enough information or know what you were doing at the time."" Are you freaking kidding me?? You have no idea what i did or did not do and I don't appreciate the judgement.

I got pregnant at 16. The fetus was conceived from a date-rape with someone I thought I trusted.  I was intoxicated, and could not tell him to stop. I never told anyone, and at the time I blamed myself. I kept it from my family, but the rumors started to fly at school and it made it back to them.  My family is ultra conservative and was pro-life to this point. My father made it all about him.  ""How could you do this to me?"" At the time, I felt so guilty for 'putting my dad through this,' but I have since changed my outlook and allowed my true feelings to emerge.  Screw him.  I was a young girl, and in a position I was barely capable of understanding.  I was frightened, nervous, sad, angry, and all he could say was ""how could you do this to **me**?"" My mother was a little more understanding, but couldn't dare show it due to the nature of my family.  Either way, they asked what I wanted to do. 

I wanted to get a surgical abortion (medical abortions were not available at the time).  By the time my family found out, I had already done every bit of research I could.  I had looked into adoption, read about pregnancy, understood the process of abortion, and I had already made up my mind.  There was no way I would be able to take care of a child, and I knew it. I was well informed and took many nights to decide if this was really the right thing for me.  It was not a rash decision or one that I took lightly…even as a child.

""You're killing my grandchild,"" my father said when I told them my decision.  **YOUR** grandchild?!?! What about it being **MY** child? 
No matter who is pregnant, or who you are talking to, it is all about them.  It has everything to do with what *they* would do in the situation, or how *they* feel about it. And this goes for the people to which I share my story.  But you know what? I am not ashamed, and I will never quit talking about it. We all need to know that while making the decision to have an abortion is hard…there is no right or wrong answer. I made the right decision for me, and I have never regretted it.  Is it sad? Yes.  Do I think about it every day? Yes.  Do I wish I would have done something different? Not at all. 

**EDIT:  Thank you for all the supportive comments. Nothing anyone ever says will cause me to feel bad or shame for the decisions I have made, and I am glad to know there are others that feel the same.**",1637,20140520113021,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_2627h9,[Need Help] Talking to my 13 year old niece about unwarranted male attention she is getting nowadays which makes her uncomfortable and scared [I'm her Godfather],"I found this subreddit on the front page and made a post to just get your opinion on this problem. It is an unique situation and talking to girls I know did not help that much.

Also, I don't even know if I should be the one talking to her about this. But, I can see that she is always flustered and uncomfortable whenever we are outside and wanted to help her out. So hear me out please. 

Forgive any grammatical errors as English is not my native language.

I lost my elder sister and brother-in-law in a car accident four years ago. My mother became my niece's legal guardian after that. Now, my mother is getting old (70+) and her health is not always peachy so she asked for my help, around six months ago. I always visited them over the weekends and mom asked me if I can move in with them permanently.

I adore my niece and she is my favorite kid in the whole world, So naturally I said yes and moved in with my mother.

I drive her to school everyday, we go shopping/movies together. If she wants to talk to a woman she always has her grandma around.

So here's the problem. When we are outside men stare at her and make her very uncomfortable. I have to admit I did not even recognize that she was uncomfortable until that day when she just clung to my arm and wanted to get out of the park. I didn't even know why. She did not want to talk to me about what made her so uncomfortable. I was able to identify the problem when we went to movies one day and caught some high school kids staring at her and she became uncomfortable and wanted to go back home. I honestly wanted to punch those kids but by the time I looked for them they were gone. 

I checked with my mom and my niece hasn't talked to her about anything at all.

What is the best way to talk to her about this? Is there a solution? I just want her to enjoy and have fun when she is outside and not worry about the pervs and creeps out there. Wish my sister was still here to help her daughter out or at least talk to her.

t3_2611yx,I can't figure out whether my coworkers hate or like me. Please help?,"Hey TwoX, I'm a 20 year old young woman and I work for a fairly small office. The women I work directly with are both older than me (20+ and maybe 35+ years).

This is my first time working in an office environment (been here for 2 months), so I'm trying very hard not to screw it up by learning as much as I can, doing as told, etc. 

What bothers me is that these two women (the ones I have to directly deal with every day) are confusing the hell out of me. They both act very friendly towards me at some point during the day, but it just doesn't feel genuine and it makes me uncomfortable. I've always been well-liked at all of my previous jobs, and I've never felt this ""fake"" friendliness coming from any past coworkers/bosses. It feels ""fake"" because as soon as I open up to them, these women find a way to indirectly tell me how much better than me they are or how wrong I am. Despite this, I always smile and take in their advice and find myself actually trying to figure out what's wrong with what I'm saying or how I'm acting, but I find this strange because I've never had to question myself so much before.

I find this ridiculous as they are much older and this just seems like childish behavior, it feels as if they're trying to compete with me by showing me that they're right and I'm wrong. They also seem to get very annoyed and upset when I ask for clarification on how to do certain things that they've NEVER explained to me before (these things need to be explained because these ladies have very specific ways of doing things around here, so they can't possibly expect me to know this stuff). I also get very mean death stares, as if I did something to purposely hurt them. They also don't make me feel very welcome or as a part of the team. For example, they all talk and joke with each other, but always seem to exclude me. That doesn't bother me as much, but it's just something I've noticed. I also can't help but notice how much my boss (the woman I interact with most) excludes me from their group. For instance, she is always going out of her way to ask all the women on our side of the building if they'd like to order any food (they all order together for lunch, or if she's going to the store) and never asks me if I want anything. I don't know how to feel about this (not that I should expect her to consider me in any way), but why not ask me as well? I, too, am an employee and I do all of my work, I'm always nice to her, I do literally everything she asks of me, so why exclude me so much? 

There's another girl of my age that also works here and they all love her like family, and I'm not asking for the same, but I feel as though this shows me that my age is probably not the problem here. Therefore, I don't understand what I'm doing for them to dislike me. Also, all of the men around here are very friendly and they all try to help me even if I don't need it. Some of the ladies from the other side are also nice and don't seem fake, however I don't see them very much.

I really, truly like this job, but this is getting to me. Is this normal in all office environments, or am I completely out of line here? Am I expecting too much? If any of you have similar experiences, please share! Thanks",30,20140520084041,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_260zsw,if only I believed in God - love advice wanted,"2X, help me work through this, iron out my thoughts, figure out how to proceed... (I feel this may be (more) appropriate for another subreddit or two as well, but I know you all and I trust you all, and wanted to try here.)

My boyfriend (29) is the best man I've ever met. He is loving, doting, faithful, smart, interesting, funny, sweet, a great communicator, fun to be around, active, has wonderful friends and a close and amazing family, and he's as handsome as they come. 

I (28) happen to also think I'm pretty great, and share many many of the same qualities he does. We've been together almost 2 years and living together for 8 months. Boyfriend and I laugh together, we (make) love together, we cry together, we stress together, and we talk. We don't argue or fight really. Friends all agree we're great together.

What's the problem? 

**He's Christian and I'm not.**

(I'm nothing and prefer not to even say Atheist or Agnostic.)

*It doesn't come up in day-to-day life*: we both try to keep a lid on it - he doesn't regularly go to church so it doesn't come up every Sunday either. He is 100% a believer in Jesus Christ being his Lord and Savior, though, and he prays (like really, really prays a lot about everything) and thanks God and feels blessed every day. He had a very very rough childhood and I don't begrudge him his beliefs at all. They bring him peace and love and he doesn't use them as a weapon against anyone or anything, so I very much respect his personal brand of loving God and Jesus, although I don't share it. In other words, he is very much a firm/strong believer, and not at all ambivalent or light-handed about it.

*It comes up when we talk about our future.* Whether we could marry. How we'd raise our kids. What would happen as we aged, grew old, and died. We've pondered not having kids. We've pondered not getting married, and just going on with our day-to-day. I've told him I can accompany him to church (we've gone a couple times). I can hold his hands as he prays. I can continue to respect and encourage his emotional and religious growth. But I just don't share it. 

We've been having rough talks lately and it came to a head last night when something in him finally clicked and he got the notion that our relationship is a trial, and Satan knows him so well and has tempted him with me and my dis-belief (he loves me so incredibly much that he considered for a teeny tiny second, abandoning his faith/turning his back on God), and all the sudden it is so very clear to him that he cannot marry and have a life with me if I do not believe. 

*He wants me to believe.* Part of me wishes I did - things would be wonderful for us, and maybe I'd get some of the peace and assurance that his beliefs bring him (and I could certainly use another source of strength/calm/love in my life). But the other part of me really truly does not believe and cannot wrap my head around faith and the concept of God and Jesus and there being one right religion, etc. I've never felt lost or empty or alone, and have never had a desire to be saved, found, or any of that. I cannot fake it, either. 

Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone been through anything similar? Should I try to become a believer by surrounding myself with it, and just see what happens? Help.

**TL;DR: I could have the man of my dreams and continue living our wonderful life, if only I believed in and loved God.**

FWIW, I'm in therapy, he's tried therapy (still looking for the ""right one""), and we have our first couples therapy appointment tomorrow. Shit just hit the fan last night and I'm struggling to make it through the day, let alone all the way til tomorrow evening. We slept apart last night.

t3_261tlg,Does this qualify as adult bullying? How do I respond?,"So, to preface: I consider myself an average shaped 24 year old - I have DD breasts and I am fairly slim. Not supermodel shape, but I eat fairly healthy and actively TRY to stay this way.

This week, I was invited to a coworker's daughter's birthday BBQ. She invited the entire department, as a lot of us have kids her daughter's age, and we are a pretty tight department as it is. I have hung out with her family multiple times, so it wasn't a crazy invitation. However, the woman asking, plus **three other women in my department that are attending** have told me (NOT ASKED) that I could not wear a bikini to this pool party. I would understand if it were because there will be small children there, but their reasoning is worse: they are afraid their husbands will stare at me, and they are insecure about their own bodies.

I was told that if I go in the pool, I would have to wear a large, baggy tshirt, and that I wouldn't be able to tan myself in my bikini. They said that because their husbands would be there, they didn't want me wearing anything except ""a trash bag."" I've laughed off most of their comments but finally asked if they really thought so little of their husbands, to which they responded, ""no one wants to see Baywatch running around when we are all covered in stretch marks and McDonalds marks."" I'm not a mother, so I of course cannot relate to the self consciousness that comes with stretch marks. I am, however, 6'0"", and covered in stretch marks - albeit a different kind, from growing too quickly. I can't change these and I've come to terms with them. They're a part of me.

My question is: what do I say to them? I tried telling them they were making me uncomfortable, in a very polite way, and they insisted it was all in good fun, but then added the caveat, ""but come on. Really. Wear a one piece.""

I don't own a one piece. I'm not going to spend money on a bathing suit that I will wear to a coworker's daughter's birthday. I'm tempted to just not go, but they keep adding guilt on and saying that they already told the kid I would be there and that I have to come. Mostly, I am sad. I'm sad that they don't feel comfortable in their bodies and I'm sad that they think it is okay to make me feel uncomfortable about mine. There is nothing wrong with *any* of our bodies, and I wish they saw that. So how do I get them to understand how awkward this is making me feel?",24,20140520132442,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_261jns,I'm a stepmother hoping to bring our family closer together! Anyone has any tips?,"Hi everyone! I've been a stepmom for almost 3 years and have 3 children (boy who's 7, girl who's 10, boy who's 11) that I really see as my own. 

I love them to death, but sometimes I don't get the feeling that it's reciprocated, and obviously that hurts. In the beginning I thought it was normal, it was obvious everyone needed some time to adjust, and it did improve over time, but there is still some friction at certain points.

Actually, the two boys are adjusting just fine, but the girl is only partially. 
In the beginning she gave me a really hard time, and the fact that she had an oedipus complex, only made it worse. For the people who don't know this, I put the link below, but it boils down to the fact that she saw me as 'her adversary' in a battle that was going on in her mind for the love of her father. And before people start to question this, this isn't just my opinion, it is the collectif opinion of me, the father, her biological mother, rest of the family etc. and has been professionally diagnosed.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex

Anyway, quite some time has passed, and it has seeped through to her that it IS possible for her father to love both me and her, but she still really likes to be difficult about the stupidest of things, just for the sake of being difficult to me.

I hope this kind of gives you an image! My questions are
a) How do I react best to this behaviour? and
b) What suggestions do you have to bring our family as a whole tighter together? I've already started doing family nights once a week. That is an evening where we don't turn on the tv and just play boardgames and talk together! :)

I just want the best for my family and really want all three of my stepchildren to feel at their best!

t3_2622uf,"He still thinks abortion is murder, so we came up with a compromise for our ""what if...""","I don't know if this will be an unpopular opinion or not but I just wanted to share my side of the tough abortion talks.

We are both 22 and live together.

I'm on birth control. Lately, my boyfriend has been wanting to use condoms out of this extreme fear that my pills aren't effective. I personally don't like condoms, but I understand his fears as there is that 1% chance.

This led to our talk of what we would do if there was an accidental pregnancy. I know we are both too young for kids (in our opinion), and I have worked with children in the foster care system. It is not something that I, in good conscience, could subject another child too. Therefore, since I started having sex, my logical opinion has always been abortion.

I didn't know this, but it freaked him out even more and made him adamant about using condoms. He didn't want to have to put us through making that decision.

A couple days later, we finally have another talk where it comes out how uncomfortable my ""plan"" made him. While he understands my logical stance on it, he does not believe he could emotionally detach himself from it feeling like murder. He said it would eat at him forever.

This hurt me, as I never believed my opinion to be bad, but I thought about it for a day or so and came up with our compromise.

I would be willing to put a child up for adoption under two conditions. One, we picked and got to know the chosen family during the pregnancy. And two, it was an open adoption so that I could be a small part simply to ease my mind that this child was being treated appropriately and in a loving home.

He was much more comfortable with this idea and last night was one of the most loving experiences I have ever had.

I guess I wanted to share this to say that, even though we have varying opinions on the matter, we can still compromise and love each other. Giving up my plan A was a little difficult as I don't want to entertain the idea of going through a pregnancy, but in the end it's about making a decision that both of us can live with.

I think women who have had abortions are strong and I'm glad they felt able to make the decision right for them. In this case, I want to make a decision right for both of us. I'm glad that I have a relationship where I can include him in the conversation and choose something right for both of us.",9,20140520145224,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_261fml,At least he's not licking pee off the floor...,"Sometimes I get a little agitated with my husband, like when he leaves tools lying all over the kitchen floor.  As I pick up all the tools and take them to the garage, or clean up this or that mess, I recently started thinking... at least he's not licking pee off the floor.  

You can use this too, when a little something about your SO gets you irritated.

I was with my ex-boyfriend for 7 1/2 years.  We started dating in sophomore year of high school.  Broke up and got back together, cheated on each other quite a bit to ""get back at each other"", I went to a local community college instead of going off to a big state school where I had been accepted in order to stay closer to him, etc., etc.  The usual dumb stuff you do when you are in a first love, high school relationship.  Only problem is, I stayed with him for 5 years after high school, on and off, on and off. I know... Nooo!!

One of the things that really gets me thinking, ""Oh my God, why didn't I ditch him for good after that?"" (and there's quite a few), is the following scenario: 

Some background: I think this was about 7 years in.  He got really mean when he drank hard liquor. 
 
He barbequed and had been stumbling all over the house knocking things over and being a bohemith all night.  He stumbled into the bathroom to pee and I followed him as I had nice, breakable decor in there.  He fell asleep while he was standing there peeing and the stream went all over the floor and around the toilet.  I yelled at him that he needed to wake up because he was peeing all over the floor.  He did wake up out of his stupor and instantly became furious at me for... well... I don't know... me yelling at him for peeing all over the damn floor.  I guess you're just supposed to think that's okay.  

So he started yelling things like, ""You're such a bitch,"" ""You don't let me have any fun,"" ""My BBQ was the bomb and you know it.""  

I said, ""I'm not cleaning your pee off the floor.  I don't care how drunk you are, you need to get an old rag and clean it up and then go to bed.""  He said (and this is where it gets SO good), ""What?!  I don't know where any old rags are!""  He proceeded to get down on his hands and knees and lick his pee up off the floor and off the bottom of the toilet.  I stood there in shock, not knowing whether to try to get him to stop and risk further domestic violence, so I just stood there with my mouth hanging open.  He didn't even make a ""that's gross"" face.  He just finished and got up and walked out.

I did stay with him after that for about 6 more months on VERY rocky terms.  I guess because ignorant, young love knows no bounds.  lol... :(

Now I see pictures of him and his new girlfriend on facebook and I just think, ""Your boyfriend lapped his own pee up off of a bathroom floor and toilet.""  

It really helps me put things in perspective.  My husband and I started dating about 6 months after I finally booted this goofball to the curb, and I've never been happier.  Husband doesn't drink, smoke, or act like a total douche.  He is completely respectful and we have a fantastic relationship.  He is employed full time and we bought a wonderful home 2 years ago.  The worst thing he does is leave small messes around the house (not pee messes).  This is only because he is so busy working stressful shifts, taking all the overtime he can get, and making improvements to our home, that he has barely any time to sleep.

The moral of the story is, if your SO ever licks pee off or around the toilet, leave him immediately.  If your SO does little annoying things here and there, be happy he's not a complete and utter nasty, gross human being.  You can live with little messes here and there.  You cannot live with a pee lapper-upper.",7,20140520110522,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_261zsw,Not even sure where to go to meet guys. At a loss in my dating life.,"I'm not one of those /r/foreveralone types. I know I'm not going to be forever alone, but I also have no idea where to meet people interested in the same things that I am.

I've always been mature for my age. I'm 25, have a full time job, no kids, a vehicle, and am actually in the process of closing on a house. I'm not looking for someone to take care of me.

I'm also what people would call attractive. Probably a 7-8 on the 1-10 scale. I am taller than most women, but I've never had a problem with dating shorter guys. I work out and take care of my body and know how to dress in a flattering way.

Mainly I want to find someone who is compatible with me. Someone that I am mentally and sexually attracted to. I am very into nerdy things (conventions, anime, video games, etc), but it doesn't consume my life (I also enjoy reading, writing, and art).

I have tried dating websites, but the men I find attractive aren't into the same things that I am. The men who are into the same things that I am aren't sexually attractive to me. I feel like I'm constantly having to sacrifice one thing or another, and I don't feel like ""sexual attraction"" and ""common interests"" are all that different from anyone else's goals.

With OkCupid, I have met a few decent people. Though it seems the majority of men on there are looking more for casual sex as opposed to a relationship, something that I am *not* looking for. I want a monogamous relationship. The other handful of men tend to not have jobs or live with their parents and have no goals. I can't constantly drive someone around and baby them when I've been busting my ass since 18 to get myself a college degree, a great job, and a house. (After 2 relationships where men clearly used me for money, it's getting a bit old.)

I even tried to join Gk2Gk, since I figured a paying site would drive off people interested only in sex. Unfortunately, I don't have a high rate of matches on the site as there just aren't that many people who use it in my area, or any area to be honest. I've thought about trying Match.com, but I'm not sure if anyone would have the same interests as me.

I'm not a recluse. I do go out to conventions and talk to people, but a lot of the time (their words, not mine) I'm ""intimidating."" While this may be my height, I'm not sure what I can do to be more approachable. I don't really like going out to bars and drinking expensive drinks in a loud setting, so I don't really go for that.

I suppose I just need suggestions on how to go out and find someone. I feel like I would have more luck finding a living unicorn at this point.

Also the whole ""Don't judge someone on looks alone! Looks fade! You're shallow!"" Be honest with yourself. Do you send messages to girls on dating sites that YOU don't find attractive? I've gone on dates with people I was questionable about only to find we had no spark at all. Alternatively, I've gone on dates with gorgeous dudes only to find we have nothing to talk about.

My husband and I pulled a very stupid move, and didn't use a condom. And didn't pull out. It was a heat of the moment thing, and yes, it was very very very stupid. 

So of course, since then all I've been doing is freaking out over possibly being pregnant. Problem is, we only did this horrendously stupid thing 8-9 days ago, and I'm not due to get my period for another week and a half or two weeks. So I'm pretty sure it's way too early to test.

I have endometriosis and when we did it, it was *right* after my period ended, so I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been ovulating and regardless, because of the endo I have a lower chance of fertility anyway. I keep trying to tell myself those two things. 

I also keep trying to tell myself that it's way too early to experience any symptoms of pregnancy, yet I keep noticing weird things. Firstly, my pee keeps smelling really weird, even though I'm not eating anything particularly different (no asparagus, etc). Second, I'm peeing a lot more than normal. Maybe I have a UTI? I didn't pee right after we had sex. I've never gotten one before so I'm not exactly prone to them, but it's a possibility. 

I'm also feeling randomly crampy in my uterus area, but I'm thinking those could be caused by my freaking out. Which could also be causing my CRAZY emotional-ness. Yesterday during an argument with my husband, I went from a 3 to an 11 in like, 2 seconds, ended up literally screaming at him and tearing out of the house. I keep crying at random stuff on TV. 

I don't want to be attaching meaning to everything, because I know that I could just be noticing all this stuff more right now because I'm freaked out. But at the same time, I'm very scared. If it isn't abundantly clear, I really don't want to be pregnant. I don't want to put myself through the emotional yuckyness of having an abortion. I'm just very nervous about the future right now.

So I just needed to get it off my chest, I guess. Hopefully I don't get *too* many ""stupid slut"" PM's. Thanks for listening.",5,20140520084220,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_261g3u,"The girlfriend of my emotionally, sexually, and physically abusive alcoholic ex-boyfriend wants my help with his alcoholism","I considered myself a fairly normal, intelligent, good person with a good judge of character - until I met my ex, let's call him Roger. Roger is genius-level perfect-score-on-SAT smart, good-looking, well-mannered and has fairly rich parents. He's charming and charismatic, so we instantly hit it off and start dating. About two months into the relationship, he starts getting quiet, withdrawn, and shifty. I discover a few months later that this is due to alcoholism. I take many steps to help this man - including getting him to stay through a whole rehab program, helping him get back to school, helping him find a new job after rehab, etc. About 9 months into the relationship, things turn into hell on earth - he starts drinking again, he's constantly suicidal and depressed, and as a result, he starts taking certain liberties with my body that I didn't agree to. He grabs my arms, he takes a pair of scissors and opens up a gash that is still scarred over a year later in my hand, destroys property, tears my clothes off, and generally makes me very afraid - so afraid that, after three months of this behavior, it takes discovering I have an STD (that I must have acquired from him cheating on me) to cause the fatal rift in our relationship. We break up (at the time he had been living with me) and he moves out. The very next day, he breaks into my apartment - and I consequently call the police. 
The man is on probation (due to no priors - he was looking at 2 years jail time, but got off with a plea deal) for 18 months and has a firm restraining (""protective"") order against him. None of which, it seems, his new girlfriend knows about. 
I was unaware he was in a new relationship, unaware that his new girlfriend and I had a mutual friend, and have generally avoided any and everything remotely related to Roger in the year since our breakup. However, I received a phone call this morning from the mutual friend of his new girlfriend (we'll call the girlfriend Sheri). Sheri wants her friend, Jennifer, to give her my number, so that she can get poor Roger back into rehab - because he's apparently drinking again. I inform Jennifer of some of the details of our relationship, and tell her to tell Sheri (who I refuse to talk to) to GET OUT and get away from Roger. If he hasn't started his abuse yet, he likely will if he's drinking again. And now I feel panicked, I had put the man behind me, put the situation behind me, and it seems to have caught up with me again. I keep replaying some of the more gruesome events in my head and all I can think is that I'm concerned for the safety of Sheri. 
I don't know what to do. I feel like I should maybe talk to Sheri directly, try to get her to understand the danger she may be in, try to get her to see reason. But that may also be selfish - maybe he was just abusive towards me, and is trying to change. Should I really be so serious and fatalistic about a relationship I know next to nothing about? I don't know. All I know is that I'm a little terrified right now - turns out he's still in my hometown, in a relationship with a woman who attends the same college at my university, so I'll likely run into her even if I try to avoid it. 

TL;DR: Emotionally, physically, sexually abusive alcoholic ex-boyfriend has a new girlfriend who wants my help in getting him to stop drinking, and I'm terrified of even thinking about the past or talking to her, so I talked to her friend and told her to tell her friend to leave.

Every girl in the class raised their hand when the professor asked us which one of us has experienced street harassment, while the two boys did not. We then discussed how we individually handled it, and what feelings/thoughts arouse during and after the incident.

Some explained that they retaliated by either saying a remark or flipping them off, but most of the group explained that you just feel really terrible and scared and nervous. Even when we told stories of trying to stick up for ourselves, it was instantly riddled with fear, accelerated heart rates, and walking quickly to a safe destination. We even talked about how women are always told to take self defense classes, to carry pepper spray, to not go out during certain hours of the day, and to not wear specific clothing to arouse others to want to yell at us.

I guess I'm just asking, have you been harassed verbally in public and how did you deal with it? How did you feel after? Did you receive any support by strangers or people you may have been hanging out with? Do you feel like you can defend yourself without consequence?

t3_2610tb,Just got out of an emotionally abusive relationship. Still hurting.,"I was seeing someone for a few months. We were on and off for two weeks or so, but decided to leave for good this weekend. I thought I was breaking up because I have anxiety and trust issues, but a lot of what I was feeling was caused by him. I had good friends to tell me, ""hey, this guy is treating you like garbage."" When he found out I spoke to my friends he told me that at least he knows how to deal with issues on his own, unlike me.


He lied to me but still denies it, ignored me for days, turned everything around on me, called me emotional, obnoxious, and intense whenever I tried to talk to him about how he made me feel. His excuse for ignoring me was that it was easier than trying to talk to me.


Before this ended (which was Saturday) I hadn't seen him for a little over a month. Granted we live somewhat far and stuff kept coming up on his end. I believed him, but then he started to ignore me. I got fed up, but I gave him chances and was supposed to see him Saturday. All last week he spent time telling me how we'll see each other more, he'll communicate better, he likes our connection... then all day Saturday he ignored me. Only to EMAIL me Sunday saying his phone was off, and he knows I'm super angry and if I was free I should go see him. Like, if that is true why wait until the next day? To which he said I need to rely on myself more. 


I met him on OKCupid. When we became exclusive I asked that we disable our accounts. He lied to me when he said he disabled his account. He disabled it and reactivated it a few times. He blamed it on tech issues, and I tried to believe him but it really got to me. I would always worry, and he knew this. He knew it was eating at me, and he said he wishes it didn't because he wants to focus on us. I found out he was lying, and it wasn't a tech issues. But he went on with this lie for over a month, right to my face, and even in the end he didn't admit it. It came down to my trust issues.


I keep thinking about things he has said. For example, one weekend after he ignored me I tried talking to him through text. He was talking a bit, but once I asked what happened that weekend he got angry and said ""don't you have a job to attend to.""


I know I do have trust issues with men, and he knows this (and about my past with abuse) so it was easy enough for him to tell me that's what it is. And it was apparently easy enough for me to believe.
I fell for him hard, and I really liked him so I didn't want ""my issues"" to ruin it. Now I can see I was putting in all the effort for someone who treated me poorly. And I'm mad at myself for it, but I want to try to be kind with myself too.


Obviously you all are only getting bits and pieces. But the way he talked to me, treated me... it was shitty. A friend called it gaslighting, which I've experienced. And I've been in an abusive relationship before, and worked at a DV org. Gaslighting and abuse are huge words to throw out there, but the more I think about what he said to me the more it feels accurate.


So I told him I'm not going to be treated this way. That I find him manipulative or at the very least a huge jerk. He didn't care about my anxiety and depression, and made it worse and sometimes it seems like it was purposeful.


He sent me pictures and said I ""should consider seeing him"" because he didn't ""set out to lose a good connection"".


It hurts a lot to be honest. I really liked him, and wanted to build something with him. And he made me happier than any guy has in a long time. Things started out amazingly with him. Texted me every morning, asked me about my day and about my life...


I know it wasn't my fault, but I feel like shit. I wonder if he ever cared, if I wasn't good enough, but I have to cut that out. I hate how easily my mind goes to blaming myself.


I honestly have felt crazy for the past month or so. I use the term crazy purposefully because I don't know how else to describe it. Being ignored, and then having things turned around on you constantly. I feel so warn out, and I am getting better but it hurts. I feel heartbroken.

So, I have this ""perfect"" life: Lovely boyfriend [24/m] that l love, and who loves me, wonderful apartment, a good job in my field, a cat and a doge, best friends I see from time to time (because we live far) and so. But every now and then I wake up with the necessity of breaking up with everyhing and start fresh at some other place.
It has happened to me since I was a functioning and autonomous human, I got fed up and left everything to pursue some other thing, and so on. It didn't worried me because I was just accountable for myself, but now I have a lot of thing I love and I value and I don't want to loose them/hurt them, for a meaningless reason.
In the past months I moved from a former apartment, changed my hair style, moved the furniture around the house, adopted a dog and started a project to fullfill this need of constant change, but still every two months I have that leave-everything-behind feeling that I not commit to because I'm now a responsible and grown-up adult (right?) but I tell my boyfriend about it, in spite of honesty, and he's getting hurt by my recurring doubts.
Is this normal? It happens to (not everyone but) a fair amount of people?
It's just that I'm not true-happy and I should break up with things before I hurt (more) the people around me?

t3_2622ht,Feeling frustrated and lost because of unresolved health issues.,"Hi Reddit,

I'm not quite sure why I'm posting here other than that I am feeling lost and would like some other perspectives. So I guess I will start at the beginning.

I started menstruating when I was 11 and my periods were always heavy and painful but nothing that caused me much alarm. However between the ages of 16-19 I started getting stabbing shooting pain that would jolt me in shock at the beginning of my periods. The pain would feel like it was in my ass and vagina and was the most painful thing that I had ever experienced. I would sit and cry and beg for the pain to be over and try not to pass out or vomit. The only thing that would help was extremely hot baths. I went to numerous doctors. I was told by the first that it was just normal period pain. I was told by the second, (who gave me an ultrasound on my 21st birthday because of the pain) that he's seen it a million times and it's just because I have a small cervix. (So then why wouldn't I be having the pain since I first started menstruating?) And was told by the third that they just don't know but they are prescribing me an anti-inflammatory for people who have arthritis. After taking the medication, I felt like my life changed, I stopped getting the stabbing pain as much and it eventually seemed to fade in the last few years to the point where my periods have become pretty much normal.

However, I have been getting really bad sporadic lower back pain that shoots to the front of my abdomen and takes my breath away/makes me naseaus/ keeps me from being able to do things. So, I went to a new gyno who is really good and teaches at a university so she is very up to date on everything. She tested me for std's/cultures/pap/sonogram. Everything came back negetive but my sono showed that my IUD had dislodged and was starting to embed in my cervix.

Last week, I had my IUD ripped out and a new one put it. The pain was bad but whatever, I love my IUD. The problem is that I ever since I had a UTI/Kidney infection two months ago, I've been having pain near my left ovary. When the UTI pain was really bad it was almost like I could feel something moving there. I was tested for kidney stones/pregnancy and it all came back negative. No one seems concerend about it but it's only getting worse and has gotten worse since getting my IUD changed. The pain feels like dull pressure, and then stabbing horrible pain on my lower left side. I've been taking Ibprofen 800's for the IUD/period cramps and it numbs that fine but the lower left side pain is still present and gets worse when I walk. It brings me to tears.

I had a sonogram last week. If it were cysts wouldn't that have shown up? Why doesn't anyone take this pain seriously? I know this is a lot of jumbled information but I just feel lost.

I won't say I'm confused as to why someone (or many) is down voting every single one of my replies, but I think it's pretty ridiculous. I thought this sub was for sharing views on subjects like this. I wasn't proving a point, or forcing my opinion down anyones throat, or even being rude or preachy, I was simply sharing my experience with the subject lately. But, whatever, continue on with the downvotes.**

Hi everyone, 

I've seen a lot of posts recently about women sharing their positive experiences with Abortions, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the other side of things. 

For as long as I can remember, in regards to Abortions, I have always been very Pro-Choice. I always believed it was a woman's right to do what she chose with her body, including terminating an unwanted pregnancy for any reason. 

However, slowly over the past few years, my views have been changing, and they honestly took me by surprise. It started with a conversation I had with an acquaintance and the subject of a mutual friend of ours wanting to get an abortion. Our mutual friend was struggling heavily with the decision (she ultimately did end up having an abortion), and the acquaintance said ""Don't feel bad, I've have four!"". 

Before I knew it I blurted out ""You've have FOUR ABORTIONS?"" and she laughed, and said ""Well yeah, it's not like there's a limit"". 

All I could think then was, *well, there should be*.

Now fast forward a few years, and I am in my second trimester of my pregnancy, and am over joyed, as due to health problems I never thought it would happen for me. 

So needless to say now that I am pregnant, I seem to view abortion even more different than I did a few years ago. What really changed things for me, the turning point I could say, was during my first ultrasound at 12 weeks. 

I saw this little being, kicking it's little legs around, putting it's hand in front of it's face when the ultrasound technician would tap my belly to try to get it to move position, as if it was annoyed and just wanted to keep sleeping. I couldn't believe it. I have no idea, that at 12 weeks, I would see this little thing that is growing inside of me kicking and twirling around my uterus. 

Now a days, I can't help being against late term abortions, and abortions caused by apathy and ignorance (such as the acquaintance I mentioned above, who would proudly declare she would have unprotected sex knowingly with 4 different men in one weekend, over and over again, to end up making an abortion a regular thing for her). I have a friend who had a very premature baby at 24 weeks, and is now happy and healthy, and can't imagine...*terminating* that baby, that viable little being. 

I feel like I am still Pro-Choice, but apparently only within restrictions I form in my head, such as rape, age, etc., and feel like a hypocrite of my former self. I'm sure those of you reading will also think I am a hypocrite, but I just wanted to share my thoughts on the other side of the fence. 

I despise those who picket local abortion clinics with signs telling these women they're going to hell, that they are murderers, and would never in a million years protest an opening of these clinics or stand in the way of a woman wanting one. But with that being said, when I know a baby can survive at 24 weeks, and some abortions are still legal until what, 26 weeks, I refuse to believe that someone can say it's not a real baby yet. Regardless if it's legal or not, having an abortion at a late stage, is killing the baby. I don't mean that in a judgmental way, or a YOU'RE A MURDERER way, I simply am stating that the procedure is killing a baby. I mean, is that wrong, isn't that technically exactly what it is? 

Am I still Pro-Choice? Am I a hypocrite? Maybe it's all my baby brain. I don't know. 

Has anyone else had their views shift on the subject, to either side?

Thanks for reading everyone, but please remember especially with this subject matter, it isn't black or white, and I am just sharing my thoughts on how I've been feeling lately.

So a few years ago I was in an abusive relationship emotionally and physically-mostly sexually. He was my first and we were together for a while. I've been dating my current boyfriend for 3 years. We want to get married and buy a house and i'm really excited for our relationship to move forward. I'm extremely motivated and think of myself as a capable woman. About a year ago I realized I needed help with issues from my previous relationship. So, I went to therapy and things were going okay until I hit a bit of a snag. In theory I love sex.  It's a fun and amazing expression of love between two people. Unfortunately because of my experiences with my previous relationship I have like zero sex drive. This has been an issue with my partner, even though my guy has been VERY supportive. Sometimes I will give in and have sex with him when i'm not really in the mood (which is rare honestly) but when I do, I just sort of shut down. My experiences in the past have told me that my main worth as a female lies in my willingness to put out. I know its very unhealthy but my ex did a fantastic job of slowing teaching me that. Currently things seem to be going really well and then I just hit an emotionless wall of terribleness. Anyone have any advice on how to make sex feel like less of a chore? Or any other ladies who have gone through abuse have any ideas on how to cope or explain it to my partner in a way he might understand? To be honest i'm feeling a little lost right now.

On the 9th we went to a concert together, I got hammered, and he invited me to spend the night. We had sex, but I was really drunk and don't remember a lot of what happened. 

The one thing I do remember is that he asked me if I was on birth control and I said yes. **I lied. I was not on birth control and we had unprotected sex**. Drunk me wanted to have sex and thought it was a good idea to lie instead of just getting a condom. I hadn't taken birth control in about a month due to complications with the doctor's office and general laziness (I honestly didn't think I would be having sex for a long time). 

I took a pregnancy test today and there was a faint but clear 2nd line. Most of the sources I read online said that this meant a positive pregnancy.

For those who saw it: this week when the protagonists went to TechCrunch Disrupt SF, we finally encountered the first (as far as I've seen; I'm not counting anyone who may have visually been in the background) woman in any kind of coding or engineering role. Hey, cool! It's an attractive woman, yet one who doesn't seem to be at the conference in a ""booth babe"" role judging by her attire, and she's a Java programmer. I was really excited to see where they were going with that.

....Aaaaaaand then we find out that she doesn't write her own code, and just flirts with male software engineers to get them to write code and/or fix bugs for her. 

Was anyone else as annoyed by this as I was? It bothered me far more than most instances of sexism I've seen on TV, and here's why: apart from that scene, I find the show to actually be an astonishingly realistic, albeit a bit cartoonish, depiction of Silicon Valley and its startup culture. I know a guy who is exactly like the protagonist. I know a bunch of people who live in ""geek houses"" just like the ones in which the main characters reside-- and that house even looks exactly like the actual ones do, right down to the era of house and the objects contained therein. Those archetypes of the ""we're going to change the world of X via Y gimmicky app!"" startups, of illogically egotistical programmers, of comically out-of-touch rich execs or angel investors-- they're all simply exaggerated versions of very real things, which is why they're funny. Yeah, the show has had a few plot points that are implausible to the point of near-impossibility, like Jared's accidental island voyage, but those things seem to be portrayed in a way that is deliberately outlandish. If their plot point regarding the female programmer had been about a woman who codes but then she doesn't really code because she is in fact a hyper-realistic android created by one of the other startups at the conference and sent to infiltrate Pied Piper to gather recon and steal their ideas, then that would be fine, and probably even funny. But all they've done in this case is create a situation that started off rather realistically, but chosen to just turn the female character into an unrealistic sexist stereotype, instead of the cartoonish but still ultimately realistic portrayals of many of the other characters.

I find it a bit unrealistic that they've only shown one woman in an engineering role; I used to work in that very area, and I was far from the only woman. While there's still certainly an immensely disproportionate percentage of male vs female programmers, it's far from a 99.9%/0.1% split. But what I find really unrealistic and offensive is that when the finally did show a female engineer, she was a fraud.

There is such a stigma attached to people who have children while on welfare. I haven't been on it for a long time, less than a year. I had a good job as an LVN but I was laid off while pregnant with my 3rd child and decided that it would make more sense to just go back and get my BSN even if it meant being poor for three years. My youngest is only a year old and we were very careful about using protection because we both decided that we did not want another child. I don't think it would be fair to my other children since having another child while not working would take away from what little I have to currently offer them. I don't want to kill my child, but I also don't think I could raise another one. Adoption is out of the question since my oldest two are 8 and 5. My boyfriend says that he'll support what ever choice I make but I know that he does not want to have another child. I haven't told my family or my friends because I feel ashamed for getting pregnant in the first place and for not being excited about it.

Hi Ladies! 

Okay so this morning I was freaking out because I couldn't find my Mirena strings. I got the Mirena two weeks ago at Planned Parenthood and everything was going great until I couldn''t find my strings. I freaked out and walked in today to get it checked. The gyno checked and could not see it either. Then she slightly opened the opening to the cervix and saw that the strings were resting right at the opening. She said the IUD was in the right position and everything was fine. 

However, I am concerned because now I won't be able to check my strings every month because they are too short. So how will I know that the IUD is in the right position? I mean the whole point of getting the IUD is to have greater peace of mind. She told me that I should not worry and just live life normally. But if I really was concerned the only option would be to have it removed and insert a new one with longer strings (which would run me another $625).

What would you ladies do if you were in my position? Would you get it removed, reinserted, and pay up for the extra peace of mind? Or would you live with it and trust that its all okay? 

Thank you so much!

t3_2633wq,Can women and men be just friends?,"I have a great friend, who happens to be male. We met 12 years ago, and since then we've been the best of friends. There was one, awkward night about 4 years ago when he tried to kiss me. I wasn't having any of it. We talked about it, he agreed that it would have been a terrible idea to become romantically involved, and now we laugh about it. 
He has a steady, serious relationship now. They moved to Australia for a year, about 2 and a half years ago. Before they left, he and I were still really close. He would come over all the time, with or without her and just hang with me. Hanging out at my place watching tv, having a drink (or more) became a habit when I was a stay-at-home single mom. (I'm Canadian - 12 month mat leave, and have really supportive parents.) But since they got back, I feel like a lot of distance has grown in place of our close friendship. He doesn't come over as often, and has recently been canceling plans. 
His gf has anxiety and depression issues, and often leaves group events because of overwhelming social anxiety. The last time he had to cancel it was because she was ""freaking out"" and wouldn't let him ""have fun without her"", his words.
I was complaining about this with my mom, and instead of the support I was looking for, she told me I was wrong for pursuing a friendship with him. According to her, when in a relationship, friendships with the opposite sex are unacceptable.
I shut that conversation down, because there was no way we will ever see eye to eye.
Now, if he was choosing to put his gf and her insecurities above our 12 year friendship, and explained that to me, I'd understand. I'd be hurt, but I'd get it. But am I wrong for wanting to be his friend? Can men and women ever be just friends?

tl;dr: My mom thinks I can't be friends with a guy because he has a girlfriend now.",0,20140520211913,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_263cqm,Second Thoughts About Second Pregnancy,"I know this sub probably gets a lot of this, but I value a lot of the opinions on here. Thank you all in advance!

I've just recently found out that I'm roughly 7 weeks pregnant. I already have a son who is 15 months old. I can't stop going through the range from excitement to I-fucked-up. I already had to deal with everyone's judgment of me and how irresponsible I am to have had one child, and I know it will be even worse with two. 

Through my first pregnancy and the first couple months after, my long-term boyfriend developed a serious opiate addiction. We separated, he got on Subutex, got a job, and he recently became a part of my son's and my life again. I hope things will work out for him, but the thought of having another baby to raise on my own is not something I want.

I work part-time and started taking classes again. It's a struggle every day trying to find a babysitter for my son. I've looked into daycare, but everywhere I can afford is full. I've tried using family and friends, but everyone gets so stressed by him that they don't answer my calls or make excuses now. Because I live with my parents now, I don't qualify for state-assistance for childcare. My parents have already talked to me about when I am moving out/having my son here is stressful. I would not feel comfortable to stay here with another baby. I also know I would lose their support if I got an abortion.

I went to my first appointment before I realized just how mixed my feelings were. I know 100% that I am in no place to have another baby. I know I could manage, if I wanted to. I guess I just don't know if I am ready for it.

I'm sorry I'm all over the place! I don't have any unbiased people in my life to turn to, so again, thank you all for being there for me.",1,20140520230735,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_263ey2,"My closest friend and I have been through a lot, I feel anxious about seeing her this weekend.","This is going to be a very long post:

I have had the same best friend since I was 13. When I moved across the country 6 years ago our friendship suffered some blows.

The worst of which was in January of 2013 when she told me that she no longer wanted to be my friend but ""hoped we could find our way back to each other some day.""

It seemed to me that it occurred rather abruptly and out of the blue.

It was right after she came and visited me to enjoy some sun and surf. The whole week we spent together things just felt super tense. She seemed on edge and easily angered. After a whole week of her snapping at me and generally coming off as kinda pissed at me she went home. 

I did what I could the whole week to try and keep trying to get us back in the usual groove of our friendship. We went out and I picked up the tab, got manicures, tried to just enjoy some girl time together.

When she got home she was very upset when her on again/off again casual hook up blew her off at the last minute for some standing plans they had. She called me really upset and said that she didn't know how she could ""change herself to make him like her more"" and I told her she absolutely shouldn't change at all and a guy should just like her for who she is and if he didn't then they simply weren't compatible. Because she is awesome and deserves the best.

Normally, she always appreciated my honest advice. And I appreciated hers.

She blew up at me (like nothing I have ever experienced before) and I told her I really didn't want to talk to her while we were both upset, she sent me a couple angry texts and I told her I thought we should just talk the next day.

I thought she might just need a clear head to sort out her feelings about the guy in question just being a no good jerkward. But the next day I get an e-mail friend dumping me saying I had been a killjoy since my last breakup and she no longer wanted me in her life. In summary, that our friendship had run it's course and she was no longer interested in maintaining it.

 I was really devastated. We had small fights in the past but nothing on this level. I told her I didn't want that but I respected her decision. 

I feel like I really was at a place where I no longer talked about my past relationship and had started a new chapter of my life so to be called a killjoy for it really sucked. Also I felt I really made the week she visited an awesome vacation for her and she really couldn't specify why exactly she was so done with me other then we had grown apart and had separate interests.

I felt because she had been working alongside the department of corrections and spending so much time in the jails she was just being really negatively affected by her profession and that maybe her negative feelings would pass. But I respected her decision to cut me out.

I only contacted her twice after that once to get some stuff returned since it was pretty apparent she was done with me. I deleted her off facebook and tried to move on with my life as best I could even though it really sucked losing someone so close to me. 

Back in March I had to ask her for a contact number of a mutual friend trying to keep it positive I just said I hoped she was well and I still thought about her often and hoped she knew I didn't have any negative feelings towards her and just wanted to remembered all our awesome years of friendship fondly.

She said she had actually regularly snooped my facebook had seen I had gotten engaged, she congratulated me and said how much she missed me and wanted to be friends and catch up. So we have been kind of tentatively talking ever since and updating each other on our lives. 

I did ask if she had interest in being in my wedding party. It was hard to imagine my big day and planning it without her. But this weekend will be my first time actually seeing her since we mended our friendship.

I feel really anxious about seeing her and potentially having her be negative and easily angered around me again. But I also don't know how to raise the issue with her. She really wanted my fiancee and I to stay at her place which is a studio apartment and I really didn't want to be in such close quarters after everything. I want to carve out some girl time with her this weekend and try and ensure our friendship is back on the right track. 

But I also feel like I want to talk to her about how bad she hurt me. She had never apologized for terminating our friendship and I felt really used that she did it after I basically put her up on vacation.

How should I approach this or am I forced to just put the past in the past if I expect our friendship to have a future?

I genuinely feel like we have made some good progress in the past two months and I feel like she is genuinely happy for me in all the great ways my life has changed in the 14 months we weren't speaking to each other (I finished school and met an amazing man who asked me to be his wife). She seems to be in a good place as well. However, literally a week ago she dumped the same on again/off again guy because after going through another round of casual sex but no commitment she realized he was never going to change. I don't really voice strong opinions on the guy since she obviously really liked him, I just told her I thought she should be proud of herself for putting her needs first and ending it even though it was a difficult choice.

t3_2635jg,Do any of you ladies have this issue? (sex),"Okay. Let me just give some backstory: I am 21 years old, and lost my virginity when I was 19. I have had a total of 3 partners, one of which is my current SO who I have been sleeping with for over a year. We have sex pretty consistently (3-4 times a week, permitting). I have also been on Beyaz for going on two years now, and am up to date on my lady visits and have a clean bill of health down there. (Aside from a couple of yeast infections this year, thanks in part to antibiotics I had to take for illness). I am able to insert and remove tampons without issue. 

Anyway, EVERY time, without fail, initial insertion is extremely painful. It doesn't matter if there has been sufficient foreplay or not, it hurts and it takes a minute or two for it to be comfortable (I assumed when I first started having sex, it was because I was new to it, and that was why). My current SO and I have tried different positions for insertion, all have been painful. However, the pain goes away after those couple minutes. I spoke to my lady doctor about it, and she said it could be that maybe he is too large for me, I need to be comfortable, etc.

I am incredibly comfortable with my SO, he is the love of my life, and I never feel weird around him. I have done some Googling (I know, maybe not the best way to figure it out) and have seen a few sites that claim it could be a condition where my vaginal muscles just tend to tighten up like that, vaginismus, and it's involuntary. Whether or not this applies to me, I don't know. I've also noticed sometimes after sex, I cannot have sex for at least a day after that. My vagina gets inflamed, and any insertion during this time is EXTREMELY painful. 

Does anybody else have this issue? And if so, how do you deal with it?Anyone that I have brought it up to can't relate.

A petition was also passed around promoting a bit more leniency in the code, and gained a lot of support. The teachers ripped all the posters off the walls and threw away the petition. Not to mention, the girls got in huge trouble. Let me stress that none of this was done in bad taste, all of the posters and the petition were polite and professional.

t3_263n1c,"[Advice] As a Girl, Women are Scary","Sorry for the wall of text, ladies! I'm putting a tl;dr at the top, because I'm not entirely sure if this is suitable.

tl;dr: Cut a friend out of my life, realised she was abusing our friendship for years, now paranoid that all the other females in my life are like that too and I just haven't realised yet. Want to be friends with other women, don't know how, would adore some advice.

So I'm kinda young (22) and very sheltered. I was never much good at making friends with girls as a kid, but I met a whole bunch of incredibly friendly ladies at 15 and we hit it off. Four years later, I was in charge of an activity that the volunteer organisation we were all part of was running, with the closest of my friends my immediate subordinate. She works in childcare and is the oldest (and favorite) child, so doesn't take not being in charge well. She threw a tantrum in the first fifteen minutes of the first day, I handled it poorly due to it being unexpected and things fell apart from there. At the end of the event, I decided to give both of us a week's space to cool off and didn't attempt to either seek or offer an apology in that time.

Ordinarily, we'd text every day. After a week, though, I realised that our relationship was less than equal and not particularly healthy. I was being used as the ""ugly friend"", treated as inferior and was considered, essentially, an ear without a mouth, to be spoken at but not listened to. She did other things, too, which I'm not going to detail here.

She approached me and asked if we could talk. I'd realised over the time we hadn't spoken that she actually meant that she was going to lecture me and manipulate me into apologising for both her behavior and mine. I agreed to go, met her, apologised clearly for my own mistakes, but refused to apologise for hers, while requesting that I receive an apology as well. Despite the fact that I didn't receive one, I told her that she was forgiven, but I didn't think I wanted to continue being close friends with her at this point in time. She started screaming at me--in public--and, eventually, left. She commanded her boyfriend, his brother and several of my other ""friends"" to stop speaking to me, and they agreed.

Four years on, her behaviours haven't changed (still manipulating and hurting people) and I don't believe they're likely to any time soon. I've made attempts at polite interactions, but they've been rebuffed. 

The real problem, however, is that I'm kind of terrified of all the rest of my female friends and acquaintances now. I know it's not reasonable, but I'm so incredibly scared that someone else is going to snap at me over something tiny, start screaming, then tear away my remaining friends. I don't want to keep feeling like this. I want to make new, awesome female friends (or connect with old ones), because there are plenty of fantastic people out there and, honestly, not having anyone who'll understand the girly chat I need sometimes is getting old. My guy friends are great, but they don't want to hear about anything that doesn't relate to our shared nerdy hobbies.

t3_263sph,I get a UTI almost every time I have sex,"It is so frustrating and painful. Almost every time I have sex, the next day or a couple days later, I get that all too familiar stinging feeling when I pee and a constant pain in my UT. I always make sure everything is totally clean beforehand, both for me and him, but there seems to be no effect. The only thing is that I don't pee after sex. Don't get me wrong, I always get up and try, but the thing is... I don't understand how other girls do it? I can't have sex with a full bladder because that would be unenjoyable and uncomfortable for me, so I pee before sex. But my bladder doesn't just magically fill up within 20-30 minutes so I can pee again right after sex? And all the instructions always say to pee before AND after but I don't think that's physically possible for me. Does anyone have any suggestions?

I've had problems with UTIs all my life and had them constantly as a pre-teen and teen even before I started a sex life. Back then I even went on a preventative medication for 6 months which eventually did stop the UTIs from coming for years, until I started having sex. But I don't want to go on this medication again because I suffered a lot of hair loss from it and I have very fine, thin hair as it is. This was over 10 years ago (I'm now 23).

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the advice! I'm going to try adding cranberry juice and cranberry tablets to my daily diet, as well as drinking lots of water right before sex so I can pee afterwards.

I've had close friendships throughout my life, and life happens and people move or go to different schools et cetera.  Recently, my female friends have started to pull away.  I actually moved closer to most of these friends, so hanging out should be easier to make happen.  I've reached out to them and they either don't respond to my text messages asking to hang out, don't call me back, or give me some excuse as to why they can't and don't follow up with when they can hang out.

t3_263q5a,I am seriously considering getting a nose job.,"Hello Ladies! 

So I'm a 21-year-old female (almost 22) and after years of dreaming about it, I'm finally ready to get rhinoplasty. 

Some backround... Ever since I first started to care about looks, I've hated my nose. My nose tip is very wide and droopy when I smile and it seriously bothers me. I have small eyes and small delicate mouth and although my face is square shaped and quite wide, my nose just looks wrong. No matter how pretty I feel, I can't help but wish my nose was different EVERY single time I look in a mirror. I never ""truly"" smile in photos and that's very depressing. You're supposed to feel beautiful when you smile and I never do. If I'm happy and laughing, it doesn't take long before I remember how my nose looks and then I feel ugly. 

I have told one friend about my plans and she of course said that I'm crazy and I don't need to have anything done. I don't think she's lying because I don't think any of my friends need plastic surgery. They're all so gorgeous! She said that everyone has flaws but they only make you *you*. I have other flaws that I've accepted  but I've waited my whole life to be ok with my nose and that hasn't happened. It makes me so insecure! It's like in my head I'm beautiful but then I look in a mirror or take a photo and see a face that *isn't me*. 

I know it's a huge decision but I feel more confident about it every single day. I also know that I'm still very young but I don't want to take the risk of feeling like this till I'm 40 and regret that I didn't do anything sooner. I want to enjoy my life now damnit. 

How's that for a rant? Anyway, is there anyone in the same situation or someone who has gone through rhinoplasty? Any advice?

Since y'all are a default subreddit now, I figured I'd use one of my throwaways to get your opinion on something I've been having trouble with.

First, let's assume I make it very clear to any sexual partner that I am not interested in a romantic relationship. Like... literally saying that to anyone I am sleeping with. Multiple times.

With that said: If a sexual partner fails to inform me of their growing feelings for me, and continues our casual-sex relationship in the hopes that I'll somehow change my mind... at what point is it my responsibility to end the relationship?

Is it the second I SUSPECT they're being untruthful about their intentions? This is obviously a difficult situation to ""catch someone lying"" in, and it would be incredibly arrogant to claim to ""know"" someone's mind better than they do. Is there some sort of sign I should be looking for, or a particular moral compass I can ascribe to in this situation?

I don't like hurting people, and this problem has occurred a number of times. And while each partner has admitted they were the ones being untruthful, a recent conversation has me seriously considering a vow of celibacy.

t3_263uey,Not sure if I was raped or not,"(Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my regular account).  This happened a few months ago, but it's been on my mind a lot lately and bothering me.  I was trying to wait until marriage to have sex, not for a religious reason, but because I wanted to save something special for marriage.  I was very adamant on waiting until marriage and told my ex on multiple occasions ""Never ask me to have sex if I've been drinking.  I might say 'yes' but my real answer will always be 'no'"".  I was okay doing some sexual things (oral was as far as I was willing to go), but I had made it very clear I did not want to go all the way on numerous occasions.

We liked to drink white wine, and one night we had way too much.  I think I had a whole bottle or more.  I was intoxicated and I even remember the room spinning.  We were making out in bed pretty intensely and as my sex drive had been low lately (I think it's because my psychiatrist prescribed me Prozac for depression) I guess my ex wanted to take advantage of this opportunity and pushed hard for sex, asking if I wanted to have it.  I was unable to say no.

About seven seconds later I felt this feeling of horror come over me as I realized what was happening and pushed away and rolled over to the side of the bed.  But it was too late; my virginity was gone.  My ex was clearly irritated and asked a few minutes later did I want to have sex again because the first time was really short, but I said no.

That was the only time we ever had sex.  I got dumped a couple weeks after that happened, probably because I freaked out and acted weird the whole next week.  But it's still on my mind a lot, and I feel like I should have been able to say ""no"".  I'm very conflicted right now.  I don't even know what my thoughts are on sex anymore and if it's worth trying to wait again until marriage, or just give in and have it whenever I want it.",0,20140521041921,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_264spk,I'm so proud of my teenage daughter!,"At the beginning of the school year, my daughter was depressed, friendless, and felt bullied. Getting her out the door to school every day was a chore, because she felt like nobody liked her and that the teachers were out to make her life miserable. Through hard work, and a great therapist, in the past 9 months her attitude has completely changed. She has two amazing friends, a handful of acquaintances, the kids she had a problem with have since backed off, she's gone from C and D grades at school to all As, and her self-confidence is so amazing to see.

Just this week she took the plunge and told her best friend that she's bi. Until now it's been a subject my daughter has only felt comfortable telling a few family members about. Her friend didn't blink an eye over it, which gave my daughter a huge confidence boost.

It makes me so happy and proud to see the changes in her! I hope her life just keeps getting better and better, now that she realizes the world isn't out to get her.",1966,20140521120112,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_264cwr,Boyfriend Has Issue,"My boyfriend of 7 months talks frequently about sleeping with other girls. When I press him about it, he says that he does not ever sleep with other girls and we spend lots of time together, and I do not suspect that he does. Still, he talks about my friends, my co-workers, and other girls that he knows and says that he would like to sleep with them and sometimes tells me that he does, only to tell me later that he is just joking. It hurts me to hear this because I think he is being honest that he would like to sleep with other girls and I would like to be the only one he wants to spend time with.
The other thing that really bothers me is that he often will tell me to be quiet when he is getting his work done, saying ""women are not allowed to talk while men are thinking."" I know that this is just his sense of humor, but after reading this subreddit I am beginning to think that I should take issue with this. He also says other things like ""women are not allowed to talk while men are talking/sleeping/reading/etc."" Again, he smiles while he says this and tells me he is joking.

t3_265gpa,Naive girl here: How to discern safe/good renting offers on craigslist? Any red flags?,"Okay ladies, I'm sure this is an incredibly naive question, but I've never done this before. 
I'm asking this in TwoX since you ladies are probably most familiar with any concerns I might have about safety precautions.

I've got a summer internship at a major (yet rural) university and I found out last summer by experience that parking on campus was EXPENSIVE. So I plan to rent nearby (instead of 15 minutes out by car) and walk or ride the bus. My PI suggested I check craigslist, but **I honestly don't know how to gauge the safety of an offer or avoid crazy roommates and all that.** I'd only be there for about 2 months so renting a dorm room is absurdly expensive and awful sounding, but I'm a small [22F] and fairly naive so I don't want to take any risks. 

TL;DR: What factors do YOU use to gauge the safety of a craigslist offer around a university campus, and what are some red flags to look out for?

t3_264lol,I've been experiencing indirect harassment at work and it's time to put an end to it,"First of all, everyone should know that *indirect harassment is a thing*.

>This involves conduct that is not directed at a particular individual but results in an overall poisoned atmosphere. This can include:

>* demeaning nick-names, sexist or racist remarks, stories or emails, unwelcome jokes and cartoons, nude pictures, displaying of racist or bigoted pictures or materials; and

>* exclusive behavior and social isolation of one employee by others; and

>* any other pattern of unwelcome conduct that creates an uncomfortable or hostile work environment for one or more employees.

>Indirect harassment also includes conduct/remarks or malicious gossip about an employee that are not directed at him or her at the time.  If the employee becomes aware of demeaning remarks or gossip and is adversely affected as a result, then such indirect comments may constitute workplace harassment.

*From http://www.mfrresolutions.com/crucial-facts-about-conflict/workplace-harassment-and-bullying* 

Ladies, in my 16-year professional career, this is the first time I've really experienced anything like this. One of the senior managers at my workplace calls people inappropriate nicknames (one of them racist toward South Asians), intentionally excludes women from non-work social events like happy hour or sports games & tailgating, and badmouths some of his direct reports to their peers. *edit: all of this has happened in front of me multiple times. He tells me stories using derogatory names, bad-months my own team members to me when they aren't around, and invites my male peers to a ""team happy hour"" right in front of me and another woman, except that only the men from the team are named. I fear confronting him because I fear he will come up with his own name for me and bad-mouth me to others... If he doesn't already*

He recently told a male coworker to thank him for putting ""eye candy"" (a female coworker) on his project. and I've about had it. I've considered talking to this manager, but if I do so, I feel I have a high risk of not only getting my own nickname, but permanently damaging my potential to progress my career here. 

I've weighed my options, spoken to my boss about it, and am going to this director's boss tomorrow to formally report his behavior. I'm nervous about it, though I know I shouldn't be, but it's time to put this to an end. 

My purpose in posting here is this:  No one should ever have to work in an environment that is toxic, whether to themselves or others. Everyone should know what indirect harassment is, and that you have a right to work in a place without it.

**edit** My formal complaint will be that he is engaging, as my company defines it, in ""Misconduct or Inappropriate Behavior""  - not Harassment - because while he isn't necessarily breaking a law (maybe?) he is breaking several of our company policies.",25,20140521105217,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26543c,I need help explaining why sexual harassment can be so humiliating,"A man at my office has been sexually harassing people.  I don't know exactly what he's been doing to other people, but in my case he has given me an uninvited and unwanted kiss and spanked me with a stick(!).  He has said to me that he is just joking, and he thinks his behavior is rather minor, and he doesn't understand why it is a problem. The people who have to deal with this are taking it seriously, but they don't seem to be able to explain to him why this behaviour is wrong.  Their approach seems to be ""we don't do that sort of thing anymore, because some people find it offensive.""  They know that I find it offensive, and they accept that, but they don't really understand why.

This is a problem because they are not able to explain what is wrong with the behavior to the perpetrator, meaning that he does not really understand why he has to stop doing it.  Unless they can really understand what is wrong with sexual harassment themselves, I don't think they will ever be able to deal with it effectively.

I'd really like to be able to explain to them why it is so offensive, particularly in a professional environment.  I want them to understand that it is intensely embarrassing, and that it feels as if your professionalism has been instantly and completely undermined.  I think this is something that is quite hard for men to understand.  Does anyone have any resources which really explain WHY sexual harassment is offensive?  Or the ability to express more fully than I have?

EDIT: thanks for the advice y'all.  Unfortunately I still don't feel capable of explaining this to them.  I was sort of hoping someone would point me towards some pithy essay that would lay it all out really clearly.  I guess it's not my job to make people understand how it feels, just so long as they do the right thing.

UPDATE:  So the man that was doing this has now been suspended, which is a good result.  I agree with various people who have posted that this behavior is so ridiculous that it appears unrealistic; nevertheless, it happened.  It was altogether a surreal experience.  Maybe its helpful to point out that things like this do still happen, and that when they do, its hard to know how to react, and people are unlikely to believe that it actually could have happened.",21,20140521134946,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_264t0u,[throwaway] I can't stop panicking about tomorrow night's HIV test,"Logical me (who has another account and loves 2X), knows how ridiculous this will sound.  Anxious me needs support from internet people.  Anxiety is a cruel cruel bitch.

About a month or so ago, I met a guy on okcupid and ""dated"" him for nine days before I realized he was obsessive/a ""clinger"" and an alcoholic (that's a hell of a story, if anyone is interested). 

We had sex three times in those nine days, along with oral sex.  Actual intercourse always had condoms.  But, in the post-""breakup"" anxiety I was feeling because I was scared he would come to my house and harass myself or my roommates, I decided to get tested for STIs and HIV.  He mentioned he had friends who were recovering heroin addicts. My anxiety was taking over.  I went to the planned parenthood and was tested for the usual spread, and requested an HIV test.  I tested negative, but they told me it was too soon for it to be 100% accurate and to come back in 6 weeks.  My 6 weeks are now up, and I am going tomorrow night with a friend because I just need someone to hold my hand.

Logically I am aware that my chances are incredibly low.  Despite the fact that condoms to us are just a millimeter of latex, a condom to a virus is like trying to cross through the Berlin Wall with a plastic spoon.  We used condoms every time.  The probability of a heterosexual white male being infected and not treated is also very low.  My standard screen for STIs came back negative.

I know I sound like an idiot.  I am ashamed of the places my anxious mind takes me.  I have a friend coming with me tomorrow, and I am very thankful to her, but I'm just fucking scared.  I am convinced I will come back positive and will have to tell my family and friends and move to a metaphorical leper colony.

I'm not even 100% sure why I feel the urge to post this. Maybe I'm looking for other women who have been in similar situations.  Maybe I'm looking for other women to tell me my anxiety does not make me a fucking crazy person. I don't know.",13,20140521120414,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_265bu1,"What to do about my (mostly) sexless relationship... trying to get back to ""normal""","So I have been in a committed relationship for almost 4 years and things have been pretty good... including the sex, which happened regularly and was fun and good until maybe like a year ago. At this point, I had a horrible job that destroyed my self-confidence and kicked off a major struggle with anxiety/depression. The meds that were helping destroyed my sex drive, which was frustrating for both of us. I felt better but I didn't care about sex and that didn't feel right. Going through the motions didn't feel right (or comfortable -the meds don't just affect how you think about sex, it affected how my body prepared - or didn't - for sex). I went off meds and have been doing well with the support of a therapist. 
But the sex stuff didn't fix itself. Now I'm not sure what's going on. My bf has been mostly patient, though occasionally goes through periods of making petty comments about this - that I don't want to touch him, he's not attractive, etc. These things are not true, we're close otherwise - I enjoy being affectionate with him, the next part just doesn't kick in.
I'm thinking maybe just getting out of the habit has made me anxious about this - or made it seem unnatural. I do think about initiating again (since he's sort of given up) but that feels really forced and overthinking it makes me awkward and less likely to engage. Recently, when I've tried to start something - he's so confused/startled that he doesn't really respond and since I'm already being a weirdo/awkward, I back down really easily.
We were just at a wedding and stayed at a B&B... and it seemed like a really good opportunity. I was in our room undressed and thinking how to proceed when he made a comment about this and how he wasn't allowed to touch me (I don't remember exactly) - and it was snarky enough to throw me off again.
So it's been months with very little activity, and this is putting a strain on our relationship, obviously. I feel awkward about it, don't really know how to explain it - except that I have literally not been interested/excited by anything, so my general comment has been in the realm of ""it's not you, it's me"" but that has never helped anyone.

Some other factors - we have different enough schedules that we don't ever go to bed/get up at the same time, so I feel like this makes it hard for anything to organically happen with us. We share a bed part of the night but we're not really aware of each other at this time.

I've gone through horrible moments in past relationships, just like I'm sure many of you have. I was lied to countless times, and cheated on twice. It's a very difficult thing to go through, but I've put that behind me and I no longer have feelings of hatred towards the guys who have done that to me.   

Here's where the problem kicks in.   

I'm dating this FANTASTIC guy right now. He's nothing like the other guys I've been with. He respects me and I don't feel embarrassed to tell him things about myself that I would never tell anyone else. I'm in love with him and we're talking about moving in together in August, although I'm at his apartment basically 24/7 now. My problem is that any little hint of ANYTHING that could be taken as a sign that he's cheating on me, I take the wrong way. For example, he just started a new job 2.5 months ago and he often stays late to impress his boss, etc. My mind immediate jumps to ""he's cheating on me"" even though the rational part of me doesn't think he ever would. He's really close to a girl that he's known since childhood that he talks to sometimes, and although they live in different cities my mind is still suspicious. I want to be clear though; I know he's not cheating on me but I can't help for it to be my immediate reaction when something happens, and it always upsets me. He knows that I have these insecurities and trust issues and he's very supportive, but I know it frustrates him sometimes, and I don't tell him about my worries every time I get them. It's getting to the point where it happened last night, and I told him. He rolled his eyes a little and reassured me that I had nothing to worry about and that he loved me, but that was the first time it really seemed ""taxing"" to him. Our sex life is usually great, but last night he couldn't get hard and I couldn't get horny either. It's also turning into nightmares for me, and I want it to go away.       

Ladies of 2X, I'm hoping someone out there can help me. I know he's not the same guys I've dated before and that I shouldn't automatically expect the same things from him, but it doesn't help. My mind still jumps to the worst conclusion. Can anyone give me any advice?

TL;DR - My previous relationships have caused me to have rough trust issues and I need advice on how to get over these trust issues so that I can stop hindering my current relationship.",4,20140521083515,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

My name is Sharon and I’ve been studying in a male-dominated field for about a year now. I am one of only two girls in a class of thirty.

I decided to write to this subreddit because of a recent incident with a one-time tutor who was giving our class a workshop. We had never seen her before, and there is no denying that she was a very attractive woman. Obviously this got all of the guys a bit excited but one of them, - let’s call him Ross, - took it one step further, which has been bothering me ever since. 

Ross asked the guy in front of him to ask this woman a question, so that she would be facing backwards to Ross. When she was in the right position, Ross took out his phone and took a picture of her behind, - with flash, - while she bending over helping the other student. He then proceeded to send this picture to multiple guys in that class who then also shared it.

The whole affair made me incredibly uncomfortable and think less of the guys I’m in class with. What should I do/say?

t3_2663l1,I'm having a problem with this guy in my comic book club,"I've been a member of this comic book club for about 6 years or so, and I love it. Up until now, it's been awesome. But lately, I've been having a problem with this one guy.
D is an extremely talented artist. I've known him for nearly 6 years and have always considered him to be a friend. But he's been bringing extremely graphic work to our meetings, and it's making me uncomfortable. D's latest project was an incredibly graphic ""Wonder Woman"" parody comic wherein the lead female character was repeatedly raped. He talked at length about the project, referring to it as his ""obsession"" and claiming that he wanted to ""reinvent the Tijuana Bible."" He seemed to be fishing for compliments, as he also kept pointing out how ""well-researched"" his project was. We had three new female members that night, and they haven't been back since; I'm thinking that D's art drove them away. I'm not the only person who felt uncomfortable, but I was the only one to speak up. D was dismissive and said that I was overreacting and that I didn't understand his work. 
I was emailing my friend A, who moved away a few years ago, and she dropped this bombshell on me: prior to moving, she stopped coming to meetings because D made her uncomfortable. He had brought in an ""Archie"" porn parody about the girls' locker room being a secret peep show (because that's an original idea, sarcasm). A asked another male member, M, to talk to D about his art. M is one of the founding members of the club, and many people consider him to be a leader. M basically told A to talk to D herself. Since she didn't feel comfortable doing that, she just left.
I've talked to M about this, but he's wishy-washy about the whole thing. M claims that he doesn't support D's work and that he's offended by it, but he doesn't want to ban anyone from the group or dictate what people can and cannot bring to meetings. I agree that censorship is a bad thing, but I also think that bringing hateful material (whether it's misogynistic, homophobic, racist, etc) to meetings is inappropriate. M keeps insisting that D has already been ""raked across the coals"" and that he doesn't need to be ""raked across the coals"" a second time. I argued that D's behavior has driven people away from the group (on multiple occasions) and that something needs to be done. D is completely unapologetic about the whole thing; his attitude is one of ""oh, poor me, no one understands my work, I'm being singled out, etc."" In fact, he was baffled that I (and several other women) felt uncomfortable because of his artwork. 
I'm honestly angrier at M here. Whether he intends it or not, he is supporting D by allowing him to bring misogynistic work to the meetings. And the only message that D's artwork conveys (at least, to me) is one of misogyny. 
I don't know what I'm looking for here. I guess I just want to vent a little. I always thought of my comic book club as this little bubble where misogyny didn't exist. There are dozens of talented female creators in the group, and no one has ever discouraged them or pulled the whole ""comics are for guys"" schtick that's a common part of the comics fandom. But all of a sudden, there's an unapologetic misogynist in the group, and it's upsetting to me. D doesn't come to meetings a lot, but I don't think that we've seen the last of his offensive porn parodies. 
Thanks for listening, or reading. Any advice would be much appreciated.

t3_26643b,Best Gyno appointment of my life,"Without getting into too many specifics, it was awesome. She is a nurse midwife and can be used as a GP (because of some cool state laws here, apparently), and she spent 2 hours with me, covered a ton of mental, physical, and social health questions, and did a head-to-toe exam, which I don't think I've even gotten since I was a kid. She let me look at my cervix (incredible!) and proscribed an extra strength Naproxen for my horrible monthly crampage, as well as some herbs (herbs!) that will hopefully help my allergies and some other issues. It was incredibly empowering.

Ladies, I know we aren't all this lucky. It has taken me 15 years of gyno visits to actually feel like I am being listened to and heard by someone.

t3_265uml,Anyone decide on abortion after having kids? I'm considering it.,"I have two kids and found out a couple weeks ago that I'm pregnant again. When my husband and I married, we were both staunchly Catholic and pro life. My husband is even of the opinion that even NFP is sinful without grave reasons and consultation with a priest. I'm not Catholic anymore, a subject I am just starting to broach with my husband, and after the second child was born I started taking birth control. The problem was, I'm a stay at home mother and my husband works from home, so it took some doing to pick up the pills every month without him knowing. I just wasn't able to pick up April's supply in time.

I'm not against a third child, but right now I want to focus on the two we have, get them both walking, talking, out of diapers. I had a miscarriage before the first child and I don't mourn or pine after it, wondering what might have been, even. I don't think I would after terminating this one.

I'm in Missouri. Abortion is legal, but difficult to obtain with only one facility in the state. I think there is now a three day waiting period? In any case I'd probably go across the river into Illinois.

Every summer my husband goes on a week long camping trip with his family. That's when I'd do it, next month. I'd probably have to take the kids and stay in a hotel a couple days, or come up with a reason for my parents to take them. I have no support in this in any way from anyone.

t3_265m4y,Any female line cooks out there that can give a girl some advice? Or if you work any part in a restaurant.,"Doing this on a throw-away account because I'm a wussy and don't want this on my real account.  
  
I'm working at my first full time line cook position since graduating from culinary school. But I'm having some real problems with my male coworkers.  
**Back story, skip if you like.**  
The place that I work at is about six months old now. In fact, I helped open the kitchen. It was me and one other guy and together we worked out creating recipes, where equipment should be placed, what needed to be ordered, what responsibilities were to be given to who, all sorts of stuff. So maybe calling me a ""line cook"" is a little weak, because I do a lot to keep that kitchen organized and functional. Even to the point of telling my boss what product to order for the next day, keeping track of inventory, as well as a key-holder. (should also mention there are no managers, no executive chefs, just employees and my boss. It's a pretty self-governed work environment).  
The coworker I started with ended up quitting our very first Friday. Couldn't handle the pressure I guess. Since him leaving we've hired two additional line cooks, a prep cook and a dishwasher. To my surprise, the number of women in the kitchen is slightly more than men. There is me, our prep cook and one of the line cooks. My problem lies with the male line cook, and his friend/roommate who we hired as our dishwasher.  
Both of them were hired maybe three or four weeks after I began. I am technically the senior of the kitchen, if even by a few weeks. I am the only one there who had any part in the initial opening of this restaurant as far as back of house goes.  
**Okay. Back story over. Here it goes...**   
Despite my seniority in the kitchen my two coworkers seem to have no respect for me. Basically they see me as a female, not as a coworker. Both of them have what they call ""baby mommas"", meaning women they are no longer with but share children with. Both of them think they have women aaallllll figured out, simply because they have what sound like some pretty rotten ""baby mommas"". I can't seem to get them to realize that while they may have *one* type of woman figured out, they do not have *all* women figured out. I can't bring up a single reasonable concern about work without them excusing it as me just doing what women do: complain. I've have even approached them about not treating me so differently because of my gender, but it's the same thing.  
I am frustrated, and I don't know what to do. I have worked in all-male kitchens before, but never have I been treated this insignificantly. My physical strength may not be on par with them, but other than that I consider myself a hard working asset to the restaurant. I'm tired of being punished for their bad choices in women. I don't consider myself to be your average female line cook as far as personality goes. A lot of women I was in college with were real fierce and tough, practically ""one of the guys"". That's not me. I don't like aggression, and conflict makes me nervous. I don't have the line cook attitude, but I can tell I have some talent in this field. That's why I stay. How can I assert myself as someone who deserves respect from my coworkers that see me only as a woman in a kitchen?  
  
Should also mention that my boss is a total doormat who *also* hates conflict. To the point where if a customer has a complaint and demands to speak to someone in charge, he sends one of us out instead while he hides in the back. I don't think going to him about this problem will solve anything.",14,20140521164501,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

My vagina is..smelly. 

With that said..I'll be making this attempt brief. I've tried for a good hour to submit this. Just know I'm at the end of my rope here. I'm desperate. Basically, my vagina has an pungent smell. It's affecting my sex life. It's not him, it's me. He's been very sensitive through this all. 

If I don't wear panty liners I need to change my underwear frequently during the day. What started out as BV, turned into three heart dropping Doctor's visits. I'm in an exclusive relationship with my husband, but I do take my health seriously. So when the icky smell remained after medications I returned to the Doctor. Had my Paragard IUD removed and starting taking OTC probiotics, got tested for all the STD's and even had a Pap already on the calender.

I missed a couple of other days here and there, but again, we were not having sex. THe reasonable side of my brain is saying we're probably okay but there's still this side of me freaking out.

t3_265ov4,Sick and tired of my son's father.,"Shortest version of the story(I've posted most of this in a comment before); Now this was the man I was head over heels in love and have a beautiful son with. I found out he had been cheating on me with his ex wife. He disappeared, so I left him. He had moved back in with her before we were no longer together.
This was the woman that had him incarcerated under false charges, ruined his credit, didn't let him see his son for 2 1/2 years, and also filed with the VA that he was fully disabled from combat so she could collect $3300 a month. 

He didn't see our son for almost 2 months. I had to track him down to confront him. Now I'm lucky if he'll see him once a week for a few hours. When he actually does show up, he'll try to pass the baby back to me every chance he has. Now he's avoiding/running from child support.

I also found out a few days ago that he's been lying about me to our mutual friends, trying to ruin our friendships. I'm lucky enough that they came to me to talk about my ""gossiping"" before they stopped talking to me all together.

My biggest issue is that I cannot find where he and his ex wife live. They are completely unlisted. Child support services have tried ever option. I even used a site I have to pay for trying to find them. Its been 5 months since my claim has been accepted. He refuses to give me their address. His court summons has to be physically given to him.

t3_265uyf,Question about different experiences with IUD's,"Last week I had a Skyla IUD placed (basically the baby sister to the Mirena - less hormones, smaller). I've had two Paragard IUD's, both started to come out so I am hoping that the Skyla is a better fit (literally and figuratively).

However, for the last week I have had cramping every day. It lasts anywhere from 15 minutes to hours. They're very painful (worse than the cramps when it was inserted, though honestly insertion was relatively easy). When I am cramping, I am spotting. I don't notice any blood during the day when I'm not cramping. 

I didn't have this experience after either Paragard insertion. So my questions are these:

*  Do any of you have the Skyla? If so, did you have a similar experience?

* Those of you that had Mirena, did you experience this? I'm wondering if it has something to do with hormonal BC vs. the non-hormonal BC. I haven't had hormonal BC in years.

* If you've experienced this, were there any issues or is it normal?

I am going to contact my doctor if this lasts through the week. I tend to overreact to pain so I thought I'd look for comparable experiences first.

t3_265r5p,Do I need to get a new hairstylist? Hair dyeing question.,"I'm going grey. I finally decided to start dyeing my hair once it was easily 30 noticeable strands instead of just the one or two, and now I've been dyeing it about every 2-3 months with my hairstylist for about a year. In the beginning, he was just painting the ones he saw, and I was really frustrated that he didn't seem to be doing a good job because I would go home and comb my hair and immediately see hairs that he missed. But I thought, maybe it takes time to start covering them all and not missing any. After a few times of this and the problem not going away, I told him I needed something more aggressive. So instead of just painting those hairs, he started dyeing my whole head. But I'm still seeing maybe one or two he missed once I get home. Even worse, it seems like the dye fades off my hair very quickly. Right now it's less than a month since I last saw him and instead of beginning to see grey on the roots, I am beginning to see entire strands!

Having never done this before, I don't know what to expect. Is this normal? Is missing a hair here and there normal for the hairstylist? Is beginning to see the entire grey hair within weeks normal? I thought that you only had to touch up your roots, and the hair strand stayed colored. I'm starting to get really frustrated that I don't look much different from when I went in after a few weeks have passed. Is this to be expected, and I should go more frequently?

I have a great life, amazing job, nice house, etc. I know that people love and care about me, but sometimes it feels like I annoy the shit out of them. I think I care too much about their approval, even though I know that they approve of me most when I'm just being myself.

My best friends work with me. I'm not disclosing what my job is, but the setting I work in is basically like a giant family. My boss and coworkers are the best people I know, and we are all super close. However, there are these days where I feel like I'm the odd one out. It feels like I'm the younger sister in a family full of older siblings that are always going to be cooler and more successful than me. I get really worked up in gaining their approval sometimes, and I will feel left out when I'm not even being excluded. My coworkers are older and more experienced than me, and I'm a few generations behind with more room to grow. They're naturally cool; I'm naturally awkward.

The problem isn't that my life revolves around them. I have other friends and other interests. But having other things to be happy about doesn't take away that pang that I sometimes feel. Sometimes I just want to scream and cry because I love these people, but I'm so goddamn awkward and annoying sometimes. I know I can get on their nerves. They don't get that they are my favorite people to be around. I want to be all cool and collected, but I also want them to know that I'm upset so they can give me some comfort, but I also don't want them to know that I'm so attached, so I just try to get over it.

Of course, we support each other on serious issues, but we also help each other sort out what is serious and what is an overreaction.  With that background in mind, here's the situation.

My friend dated a boy for three or four months when she was in 10th grade.  He was her first and so far only boyfriend.  I thought it was a pretty good relationship at the time.  They cuddled and kissed and he gave her a stuffed bear for Valentine's Day.  He broke up with her rather suddenly without ever really explaining why.  He said something about she spent too much time on her phone (which is true, but he was also kind of needy).  However, he also apparently pursued one of our other friends a few months later and claimed to have liked her throughout his relationship with my best friend.

Details in post. x-post from /r/relationships","Last night around 8:30pm I went to my apartment complex's shared hot tub. There was 1 person already there, a middle aged man. He was sitting in kind of an awkward position. Usually people in hot tubs sit with their back against the tub, arms out. But this guy was rotated about 90 degrees -- his side was against the side of the tub, and he was kind of hunched a little bit over the side of the tub.

I thought maybe he was looking at his phone or something on the ground outside the tub, but when I took a closer look he wasn't, he just seemed to be concentrating very hard on the ground.

Also, I usually say hi and give a wave/nod to others as I get in the tub, but this guy didn't look up or acknowledge me in any way.

I kind of ignored it and got in the tub, but after about 5 minutes, I looked over, and he had rotated his body so he was facing the side of the tub, exactly where a jet is. He wasn't pressed up against the side, he was very awkwardly positioned about an arm's length away from the side.

It really started to look like he was masturbating, so I stared at him for a few seconds. His arms were submerged under the water, and the jets were on, so I couldn't really tell if the movement of the water was from the jets or from his arms.

I kept staring at him, and he never made eye contact at me. I was so creeped out I just got up and left.

1. Do you think he was masturbating? Or does he just have an odd way of enjoying the hot tub that doesn't involve being in a relaxed position?

2. What is the best way to handle this if it happens again? I was really close to saying something, but I honestly couldn't tell if he was masturbating or being inappropriate. If he wasn't, I would have felt like the world's hugest asshole. And I couldn't think of a polite way to say, ""Pardon me, but are you masturbating in the hot tub?""

I, on the other hand, get no attention (even from the right person), and I don’t care what other people think of me, it would just be nice if my own husband could bring himself to tell me I was beautiful. He says he doesn’t, because all I do is reply that I’m not pretty. **HAS HE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT TELLING ME I’M BEAUTIFUL WHEN I ACTUALLY FEEL BEAUTIFUL?** Not when I’m sweaty, or when I feel horrible, because at those times, and many more, I feel everything BUT beautiful. 



I’m tired of wondering if he’s even attracted to me anymore, or if he dreads coming home to me. I’ve even wondered if he regretted marrying me at times. But, all of those questions remain unanswered because he doesn’t think they’re worth answering. If only he knew that when he doesn’t answer, he’s breaking my heart into tinier pieces.


UPDATE: I talked to him when he came home tonight ( I had been crying a little, so I was kind of emotional). He didn't say anything. I told him exactly what was written here, and he said NOTHING. He just got up and walked away. So, yeah....my night? Shaping up to be grrrrreat.

t3_265z29,Tips/Advice for staying safe at a rock festival?,"Going to a rock festival soon with a female companion which has a camping aspect to it. Probably 75% men end up going to these things. Tons of drugs and drunk dudes with two tent sleeps could create issues. Anyone been to one of these before? Is it safe for a lady to be alone when it gets dark? Or should i be escorting her once it gets later? Who has festival experience to share?

Security was awful at this festival last year so I am a bit concerned for her and myself since I am not a huge guy if something happened. ",1,20140521190033,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_267efv,Today I let a front-page post really get to me.,"I don't know if I should post to it because I don't want to start a witch-hunt (though OP was not involved in my anger, it was all geared towards the comments sections.)

The picture was of a young woman. An average sized young woman in a funny pose that showed that no, she is not skinny, she is not athletically built, but she is completely fine and healthy looking.

I clicked the comment section hoping to see funny cat gifs (and I did), but I was not expecting the absolutely immense amount of harassment and cyber-bullying that was happening. I hope she never sees it.

It doesn't matter what my body-type is, I got **angry**. I was so upset by the mocking of this poor girl. And anyone can say, ""It's just reddit, they're arseholes don't worry over it."" But the fact of the matter is that reddit is *people*. Reddit is my college professor, the waitress, my neighbors, the clerk at the grocery store. How many people go about their daily lives actually thinking this hatefully? Do people judge every man and woman they see in such harsh negatives?

I truly do not intend for this to be a drama-inducing post. I just would love a discussion to give me some insight.

Edit: Some more insight after reading through so many comments. Should we really just ignore hatred when we see it, or be forced to toughen up? Is the correct response to bullying to turn around? Now, this certainly is a large scale issue, but if each person took it on themselves to be just a little better, I think the world would be a lot nicer. But I may just live in a world of corgis and daisies.

2nd Edit: I got a great response from someone pointing out how I had compared her being ""normal"" against skinny/large. It really made me think. Normal was the wrong word to use, and I wouldn't want to demonize any body type. So I edited my choice of wording. I've really learned a lot through so many of the comments (sure, I got a few messages telling me, a fat dumb bitch, to cry into my tampon...) and I'll definitely be approaching reddit, and a lot of life, with a bit different of a view now.",662,20140522075826,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_267bf3,Why have Feminism and Radical Feminism become synonymous?,"I feel like more and more (and especially on the internet) the word feminism isn't perceived to mean what it actually does anymore.  It seems that people are using the word to describe radical, man hating bigoted women.  Why?  How is this less upsetting than saying that all Muslim people are terrorists or that all Christian people affiliate with Westboro Baptist?  It really feels that I have to over justify myself when speaking about the issues of any size a lot of women face for fear of being written off as a (god forbid) feminist.  Anyone else feeling this way as of late?  Its a pretty significant bummer.

Edit: I'm so glad to hear all these well thought out answers, I'm glad we all did this. Also, I'm hearing a lot of ""well, sucks but they still call themselves feminists so you're gonna get that"".  That's kind of disappointing , isn't that still writing off the entire group before listening to what they are trying to say? Seems like a cop out. But there are many wonderful sides to consider in this, and I thank you all.

Edit again: probably should have used a different word than radical, because I dot fully understand all of the terminology surrounding this issue. Partially why I asked. I supposes I mean people who identify as feminists but don't seem to mind forgetting the equal rights bit. The tumblr femmes I guess. Although, I never knew that was a thing either.",238,20140522071615,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_266vwr,I regret being honest with my mother,"About a week ago, I was at home with my mom when she asked if I had had sex with my boyfriend. She has asked a few times since I've told her I was dating someone, and I've lied every time but this was the first time I wanted to be truthful, so I was.

Some background; I am a 20 yo I coming from a **very** traditional family with whom I don't share beliefs with. When I moved out she made me promise to stay a virgin until marriage, a promise I never had any intent on keeping. We are not emotionally close, though she believes otherwise. I support myself financially but my parents do try to help out every once in a while.

I called her this week to let her know I have some time to visit this weekend and she tells me she wants to talk. (Talking in my family usually revolves around them telling me what I should do with my life regardless of what I've chosen, I learned early on to just sit and take it) She tells me how disappointed in me she is and how she is losing sleep over it. She then goes on to tell me how a girl's virginity is very valuable, and how I'm basically worthless now that I've given it up. She brought up a bunch of mistakes from my teen years and how the consequences were a divine punishment for not listening to her. This goes on for about an hour.

In recent years, I've developed a complex about speaking my mind, It's something that I've spoken to a counselor about and have been working on, but I still find it really tough to speak up, even when I really want to or think it's necessary. There's a lot I do want to say, I just can't seem to form the words. 

I don't really know what I want to do or say about this situation, let alone, how.

t3_26794m,I have been lurking for a while and need a place for constructive criticism/advice/help,"I work with two sisters.

One of these women was already employed for a few years and when an opening came about she recommended her sister.

Her sister (Sister2)is hired, and it seems to be okay, despite them always chit chatting, not doing their work, or me having to reminder sister2 to get back to work or finish doing x, and y.

Now, both are pregnant. Both spend most of their day looking at baby clothes, furniture etc. 

Aside from this sister2 has been taking off. It directly affects my job, since she is suppose to help me with bulk of paper works company BS one human can't do on their own, at least not in a timely fashion. We all work for a small sales company so, legally we are not entitled for days off, maternity leave etc.

So after Sister 2 starts taking off more and more days, my supervisor brings in a new hire for per diem work. Sister 1 sees this, and is fuming. She's giving me attitude, she's not being helpful, she's being rude and even made a comment to me and my supervisor about US NOT FINISHING OUR WORK, while we were sitting and discussing business! Sorry we weren't looking through baby names on google, or at onesies...

They also constantly complain about not having enough money-meanwhile they sit and discuss all the social programs they are eligible for while coming into work with Gucci handbags, Burberry rainboots, just newly released Tory Burch bag, ordering sushi, popping into Sephora during lunch etc. Some clients have felt so sorry for the new mothers to be that they gave them cash gifts! 

My job, which I had formerly enjoyed is slowly becoming a nightmare, and I hate to say this, but I now understand why people avoid working with relatives and pregnant women...

Am I wrong to be pissed? Am I wrong to think Sister1 should be replaced by an employee who can show up to work?",48,20140522063726,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_266puo,"Asked to be a bridesmaid in a casual friend's wedding, but costs are adding up and I am not sure if I can afford it anymore.","The girl I have known since high school, though we are not particularly close. We hang out a lot, but we are not deep-call-you-if-something goes on in my life confidents. But we are friendly.

So when she became engaged I was happy for her. And she begin planning a -huge- wedding with about 7 bridesmaids, I was surprised to be invited but said yes. (Although her fiance having so many close friends probably played a large part). I had been a bridesmaid before and spent around 100 dollars. My best friend had been planning a casual wedding (that got canceled) and costs were similar.

We are young college students or newly graduated. Weddings are not exactly super grand. I myself graduated a week ago and could not even afford to walk! I have been unemployed since january when I began student teaching and went through my savings. All things she knew! While I am waiting tables this summer and applying for teaching jobs, I am in pretty bad financial state. 

Then she started planning. First was the bachelorette party- it -has- to be out of town. She wants to go to new orleans for four days and hit up the city. Sounds fun...a little pricey.. but ok. But her sister mentioned ""and don't forget, it's customary for the bride not to pay!""--- which I could get if we went out drinking in town or whatever, but not paying for a four day trip?

And then she sent out pictures of a dress. A dress that costs 250 dollars and will never be worn again. This does not include shipping or alterations! Or shoes or makeup or hair or jewelry. 

Tonight I broached it, when she brought it up and mentioned that I wasn't sure how I could afford both. 

She claimed it was cheap for a bridesmaid dress, when I told her it was more than a week's pay she asked if my parents would pay for it?? I was a little frustrated and asked if -her- parents could. 

Then she changed tactics and said I -had- to be at the bachelor party and mentioned that if I was going to new orleans with my boyfriend this summer then there was no reason I couldn't go to her bachelorette party in october (WHICH I ALSO DOUBT I WILL BE ABLE TO GET TIME OFF FROM MY HOPEFULLY NEW TEACHING JOB-which she also dismissed). 

I reminded her that we are couchsurfing and only staying for three days. Boyfriend refuses to take gas money. The whole trip will probably cost under 100 dollars. Not to mention we have been planning this since last fall! But she didn't seem to get it.

She has not formally asked me yet and I think is planning on making pinteresty invitations. Can I back out now?

t3_268dmt,I shaved my vagina today and it was great and this is why...,"I was in this relationship once. His name isn't important and he was emotionally abusive. I stayed because I was 19 and he was my first boyfriend, first sexual experience, first fight, first love. He wanted me to be completely shaven. That was the only way his little bare mouth would even consider heading south (birds of a feather, maybe).

My Dad's Italian and I'm Italian and our hair is resilient. Shaving became something I dreaded because it never turned out okay. I'm not fucking flexible. I can't hold my leg up over my head, bent around my shoulder just so I can get that patch of hairs around my inner labia - but I did. Every. Other. Day. Sometimes it paid off. Other times I had to sit on the toilet after unsatisfying sex, just looking at the red bumps all over me. 

We broke up. And I didn't shave for a very long. Having a bush is fun. There's always something to twiddle with while you're on the phone with loved ones. Periods suck less. Sometimes it tickles your inner thigh, like ""Hey girl, you're not alone."" 

But now that summer's here, I want to wear revealing bikinis because I'm lifting and I fucking want to. Today, I turned on Kanye, plopped down in front of my mirror, spread 'em, and brought it around town for forty minutes. Every once and a while I'd stand up and dance, just looking at myself, trying to decide which parts of me were newly emerging muscle groups or merely shadows. 

When I was done, my pussy looked beautiful. I mean fucking immaculate. Never have I ever had such a clean shaven vagina. I literally just looked at myself for like fifteen minutes, appreciating a part of me that I have been shamed into thinking was ugly and unappealing for more than a year.

t3_267epl,Pregnant & scared about my future [support],"Hi 2x this is a throwaway but I have been coming here for some time and could use some support.

I found out yesterday that I am pregnant. A second test today confirmed it. I am 19 and I'm planning on starting school in the fall to begin pre reqs for nursing. I work part time at a clothing store in the mall and I live at home still. My boyfriend is an on again/off again situation and right now we are off, unfortunately. 

I don't know how supportive he will be. I am pretty sure that he will want me to get an abortion... But I really don't want to. I feel really strongly that this is already my child, even though she is so small (for some reason I think she is a girl) but she is still a person and still mine. We made her, and now I'm carrying her, and I could never bring myself to harm her. 

I think my parents will be supportive. I had a rough few years in high school but I'm getting my life back on track, and they want to help me out through that. They know I am sexually active and they are fine with that as long as I'm safe... Which I was, by the way... I was on the nuvaring so I don't really know how this happened. 

Anyway. Just looking for support. I'm a little shocked still and nervous about what comes next. I guess I'm due in January or so? I'm thinking I should still take classes this semester at least. But I don't know what to do next.

I'm also pretty scared of labor and delivery. I'm scared of what will happen to my body. I have seen the criticism women get sometimes from being proud of their bodies after having a baby. Stuff like ""that's nasty, cover that up,""  or even something as simple as ""I would be so upset if I looked like that, I never want to be pregnant."" So I'm sad that my body will not be the same... I know it's superficial.

And I'm scared about doing this as a single parent. I don't want to deal with child support and custody and all that stuff but I guess it is inevitable... And I'm worried I won't finish school now.

Has anyone been through this before that can encourage me? Let me know that it's possible? I love my child already but I'm also scared and even mourning for the future I thought I had. I am sure this new one will be wonderful and challenging and beautiful in it's own way so I'm trying to remember that.

t3_2680hz,It feels like there's no winning with men.,"Maybe this belongs in /r/rant but I figured that some ladies on here can relate to my frustration and possibly give me their thoughts.

I work retail, and get asked out pretty frequently, which isn't necessarily a problem; I'm happily in a relationship and very politely decline the advances. However, the more this happens, the more it irks me. These men know absolutely nothing about me. Our conversations almost never leave the range of general small talk. They don't ask me about my interests or try to get to know me on a personal level. It's all based on my looks. In fact, I am often surprised when customers ask me out because it's always the guys who don't really talk when I cash them out; always the ones who have minimal interactions with me. 

I understand that shyness plays a big role in it, but most recently I've been very disheartened by it all. Basically, this guy gave me his number and told me to call him, leaving before I could explain to him that I was not interested. He seemed like a pretty cool guy, so I didn't want to ignore him. I texted him giving him the usual bit about how I'm I am in a relationship and not interested in any romantic pursuits. I then mentioned that I do think that he's cool and invited him to be friends with me, if he didn't find it too awkward. He responded with 20+ text messages starting out with ""It'd be too difficult for me to be friends"" etc (totally understandable). As I read on I started getting disgusted. He had transitioned into sexting me, after I had put in a thoughtful effort to let him down gently and expressed my disinterest with clarity.

I'm just not used to such aggressive attention. I've been with women throughout the majority of my dating experiences, and the boyfriend that I have now is the first serious boyfriend I've ever had. I've gotten male attention in the past, but I guess that it's always been short-lived considering my lack of interest in men at the time. I will admit though that when this was the case I didn't really ""look straight"" (whatever the fuck that means). Now that I don't have super short hair and wear more feminine clothing, I feel like men have been scoping me out more frequently.

It's reached the point where I feel unwillingly disgusted when someone calls me beautiful. It isn't a compliment to me. It adds no value onto the person that I am or to all of the things that I've worked towards in my life. I can't help the way I was born, in fact I often hate it. I don't put any effort into my looks at all and try to be the least amount of flashy as possible so as not to draw any attention to myself. I don't even wear any make-up. This doesn't stop the advances. 

I feel like most guys don't give two shits about my actual character or personality. This is only further confirmed by the fact that I've known countless women in my life who are interesting, brilliant, intellectually-sophisticated and completely deserving of love and appreciation that are often ignored by men solely because they do not fit into the ever-inflating beauty standards put forth by society.

It makes me so fucking tired. I've met a lot of great guys, many of them being the closest friends that I've ever had. It feels like this was the case because my interest in them was out of the question at the time. Why can't this just be the case now? Why can't guys just ask me to hang out and be friends? Even if they do have an attraction towards me, why is it made so fucking blatant right off the bat without any prior knowledge of my other traits? It's like I'm a piece of ass or completely nothing. I'd rather just not have the male attention at all.

I don't mean to come off like a man-hater or anything. I know that society suppresses men within their sexuality in a similar way that in suppresses women in the confirmation of their abilities. It's hard to blame guys completely for their conditioning, but it doesn't make the issue any easier to deal with.

t3_267so9,The belly pooch,"Hi ladies, I'm not too sure where else to post this but I know it's a common thing with women so I thought I would ask about it here. If there's somewhere else I can ask that I might get a good response from please direct me there. :)

I have had a belly pooch for as long as I can remember. No matter how much weight I lose or exercise I do I can't seem to get rid of it. At the moment I am 5'8"" and weigh around 118 pounds. I do exercise about 3-4 times per week and my calorie intake is naturally quite low (around 1400 - 1800. I was curious and logged what I ate on MyFitnessPal for a while, I'm not actually trying to lose weight and have been this weight for about 3 years). I don't eat processed or fast foods often. Maybe like once or twice a month I'll eat fast food.

Now, I know my belly pooch isn't (just) stored fat. I know that because it goes flatter and bigger regularly. Some weeks it's barely there, others it's like a mini pregnant belly only below my belly button. It looks odd because my stomach itself is relatively flat, then I just go out below the belly button. Anyway, I've read that it can be due to water retention and/or bloating. I've bought some pro-biotic capsules that also focus on Candida (because I heard this can cause it too?) as well as everything else.  I've also gotten some cereal that is very high in fibre but low in sugars to increase my fibre intake in case that's the problem.

I'm also kind of thinking I could be allergic to something I'm eating on the reg. When that area bloats it can be very uncomfortable and it can cramp badly, the cramps are very similar to period cramps. But it can be followed by a shifting sensation - as if everything is moving through your bowels and you can *feel* it all. I only get that sensation sometimes, and it lasts no longer than a few seconds but it's quite painful. How would I go about figuring out if I'm allergic to something? I have no idea where to start with it, since I eat a variety of things daily. Would a doctor be able to do tests on what I could be allergic to, if that is the case?

My main questions are, have any of you ladies had the pooch but then managed to shift it? If so, how did you do it/what was causing it for you?

t3_268eve,[SUPPORT] Struggling to come to terms with a particular instance of sex,"Hi TwoX,

I've been struggling to come to terms with this for quite a while and I've decided to ask for help.

Three years ago I was in an abusive relationship where I was raped. Almost a year later, I hesitantly began another relationship with a man I met three months after the end of the abusive relationship. We had been friends for a few months before beginning a relationship. He identified as a feminist, and was involved in gender equality and feminist movements since before I met him. When I told him about the previous relationship, he was incredibly supportive and never made me feel like there was something wrong with for it, or that I was in the wrong. I had lost faith in relationships, but my relationship with him helped to restore it. Honestly, the relationship was great.

About half a year in, I got sick with tonsillitis and it screwed with my sleeping pattern. I was already on antidepressants at this stage, and I was given 3 days worth of sleeping pills to help get my sleep cycle back to normal. The information leaflet that came with the sleeping pills warned that they may react with my anti-ds and lead to sleepwalking, sleep talking, and the like. My partner stayed over the first night I was taking them.

I took the pills right before lying down to go to sleep. They made me really sleepy quite suddenly. I thought I went straight to sleep. The next morning, my partner told me something along the lines of ""You were acting pretty strange last night"". I asked him what happened, and he told me I'd been spouting nonsense, saying things like my walls were made of stars and there was a walrus in my door, which he found pretty funny. He also said that I'd been scratching at my underwear or something like that, and that he started touching me because when he did I started to say weirder things. I asked if we'd had sex. He said we did.

I don't remember him touching me. I don't remember having sex. I don't remember saying any of those things he said I did. I developed vaginismus shortly after, and we had sex less often until I eventually stopped wanting to at all because it was so painful. Almost a year after the night I first took the sleeping pills, we broke up. I never explained to him how this contributed to it, or how it made me feel.

I still think about it sometimes, and it upsets me. I am still good friends with this man. We are still mutually supportive of each other, and I still feel I can open up with him. I feel like it wasn't consensual sex, and I know that if I told him this he would feel so awful about himself, which I don't want to happen.

I don't know how I should classify what happened to me that night. I don't know if I'm right to refer to it as non consensual sex. I feel so confused. I haven't talked to anyone about this before.",27,20140522140537,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_268iaa,"Who is an example of a ""Female Power Fantasy"" from pop culture - movies, games, TV - and why?","When discussing movies, tv, and games, it is often said that both male and female characters are designed to appeal to men. 

Idealized women are ""objectified"" to appeal to a male audience.
However idealized men are said to be ""Male Power Fantasies"" - they are designed to look how men want to look themselves, and not because women should find them attractive. They are handsome because men want to be handsome. They are muscular because men want to be physically powerful (and not because the muscular physiques are designed to appeal to women.)

So, for example, the reason that Wolverine looks [like this](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/51f67cd069bedded60000009/the-wolverine-slashes-past-the-competition--heres-your-box-office-roundup.jpg) on film and Batman is [drawn like this] is to appeal to a male power fantasy. Conversely, Black Widow [looks like this](http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/screencrush.com/files/2014/01/black-widow-poster.jpg) on film and Lara Croft [looks like this](http://cdn.pjmedia.com/lifestyle/files/2013/03/lara-croft-tomb-raider-2012-screenshot-cg.jpg) in games in order to titillate male audiences

So who is an example of a ""Female Power Fantasy"" rather than someone designed to appeal just to men? Theoretically, she should be attractive, have an idealized body type, be intelligent/skilled/influential (if the explanations of the male power fantasy hold true). 

How do you tell the difference between an idealized woman to appeal to men and a ""Female Power Fantasy"" designed to appeal to women? 

Who is the ""Female Power Fantasy"" you would choose to show your daughter?",25,20140522143752,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_268qeh,"Got blindsided by being laid-off by people I truly cared about; now I'm ""stuck"" (venting/support)","I'm usually a passive redditor, applying votes when I really like a comment or pic, but I'm in a situation that I could really use the community's input or support on, so here goes.

In Jan 2012, I started working on a contract basis for a family-run business that provided an online community platform for a niche hobby.  Initially, I handled email customer support, often completing 50% more cases than my co-workers. By March 2012, the father (CEO) and daughter (COO, my age) asked me to join the company full-time as her assistant because I ""was too smart and too valuable to be in customer support.""

Over the next two years in such a small company, I became a Jack of All Trades - marketing outreach, publishing, event planning, project management, online media, visual arts, public relations, B2B account management, plus executive assistant duties.  I pretty much handled everything the CEO, COO, and VP didn't either have time, nor interest in doing, like conference calls, report writing, and presentations.  

In addition to those actual office tasks, they had me running their personal errands, entertaining their children at times, baby-sitting co-workers who got too drunk at company events, planning their vacations, etc.  The CEO and VP have a pretty raunchy sense of humor, and since I was ""like family"" to them, I was often present for some really impressive sexist and off-color jokes.  The CEO was also touchy-feely, patting my stomach once and asking how I stay so rotund if I don't eat that much during a company lunch.  Since I had the type of relationship with him where I could tell him to f*ck off, I dealt with it that way, and preferred that he sent that kind of attention towards me than the other ladies I worked with because it made them so uncomfortable.

When some co-workers started high school-esque drama after our CEO announced I was his favorite, my COO said it was up to me to figure it out and smooth it over because I was ""the rational one.""

I worked an average of 65 hours a week and hardly took any days off.  Even vacation days, they'd call me because something couldn't wait. But all of the downsides to working for a such a small company didn't really matter to me because I loved what I was doing and I loved them.  The COO and VP were good friends of mine, especially since we're all the same age.

For my performance reviews in 2013 and 2014, I received nothing but excellent marks from them.  Having gotten a mid-year raise in 2013 when no other staff member did, I wasn't due for a raise in 2014, but I got another 5% raise with a 5% bonus plus 2 extra vacation days because, in their words, I ""work harder than anyone else in this company.""  By the end of 2014, they saw me joining the executive team.

In late March, I was moved to an Ops mgr position that had me drawing on my skills and previous experience as a customer service manager and B2B account manager.  According to my COO, this move solved all their problems with the poor service the support team had been giving.  Everyone was really excited about this transition.

I spent much of April getting that sorted out while working on another project that the VP had all but abandoned.  I worked every day for a month without a day off while the executives took a week off for Spring Break.  When that project finally finished at the end of April, I took a couple of vacation days to visit my family, still checking in and helping co-workers with items, and returned to work on a Thursday.

Wanting to do a post-mortem on the project, the CEO, COO, VP and I trudged up to the conference room and settled in.  Then the CEO told me that my position was ending.  At first, I thought he was joking because he started my review with that same line earlier this year, but then he continued that it was for no other reason than financial.

I just stared, mouth agape.  Finally I stammered that I'd just been given a promotion and was really looking forward to turning that department around, and you just gave me an unexpected raise.  All at once, they started explaining that I was their favorite, I never complained, I'm so much fun, I bring so many fantastic ideas and qualities to the company, I have so much heart, etc.  The COO and VP started getting tearful, at which point their dad reminded them firmly that ""the decision has been made.""

So I got a severance and a nice letter of recommendation.  My family, friends, and other small business owners I know think that if they wanted to trim the fat, so to speak, then there were other ways than to get rid of their most personally invested, longest term, most experienced, and well-versed employee. Considering one employee was fired earlier this year for performance issues and another recently left the company, and there's one staffer who can only be relied up to make errors or watch tv on her phone during work hours, it seems something smells bad in Denmark.  I'm finding myself emotionally stuck.  I've lost jobs before, that sucked, but this was soul-crushing.  How can I move on without having that vindictive yet worthless feeling in the pit of my stomach?

Oh, and the kicker is that we had a huge event just before my vacation where I made a lot of business contacts so they've been calling me non-stop.  Talk about awkward as I explain I'm no longer with the company and then have to text my former bosses that so-and-so needs help with this or that...

Thanks for letting me vent.

Tl;Dr: Rug pulled out from under me when I got laid off the day I got back from vacation after working in a family business with whom I'd grown very close to for 2 years.  Bosses always gave glowing comments about working with me, even when they were letting me go for financial reasons. Both a raise and promotion given to me earlier this year so I'm at a loss and not sure how to move forward.

t3_268gzl,Copper vs Hormonal IUD for women with heavy periods pre-insertion- advise please!,"I am currently trying to decide between a copper IUD (Paragard) and a hormonal one (Mirena). My doctor told me that the copper option can be less appealing for women who bleed heavily when not on birth control, which I do. But reading here on the side effects of Mirena (bad skin, cysts, intensified PMS) and the fact that it is hormonal has made me less convinced that it is the right option. If anyone could give me some advice from their own experiences and what helped them decide between the copper or hormonal I would be extremely grateful!

**UPDATE:** So after much consideration of the pros and cons on both sides I went ahead and decided on the hormonal Mirena IUD. Basically my choice was made because it seemed that terrible, increased periods and period pain were almost inevitable with the copper IUD. I already had terrible pain for the first day or two, so couldn't bring myself to increase that any more (despite having a pretty high pain tolerance). 

As to the choice so far- I got the Mirena inserted just over a week ago. OMG, it hurt like a bitch. I am usually pretty non-fussed by the ideo of upcoming pain (injections, dentist, tattoos) so wasn't really nervous at all. But once it started- shit... It lasted maybe a few minutes. There was the usual speculum discomfort, but then opening my cervix up- that was weird. It sort of hurt, but was more just unpleasant pressure. I wanted it to end though. That maybe lasted a couple of minutes- disinfecting whatever they were disinfecting felt pretty gross. Then came the real pain. Like 15-4 seconds of brain exploding, white hot pain. Like the worst cramps you could imagine spreading through my lower body. I tried my best not to tense up but it was totally out of my control at that point. When they finished it was the hugest wash of relief through my whole body. But I felt really sick. I thought I might throw up, and then I felt ready to faint (I faint on occasion due to anemia). I asked them to bring me water and just lay down staring at the ceiling for maybe 10 minutes. Then I hobbled out of there. I live in New York so I didn't have to drive anywhere, but I would strongly advise against driving yourself home. I walked the pain off a little and then I actually went a did some shopping, distracted myself from the lingering crampy pain, and rewarded mysel for surviving through it all (probably more convenient an excuse than legitimate). 

Now, a week in I am feeling good about my choice but definitely not feeling 100%. I had se with my partner the next day and that was all fine. Really great actually not to worry about a thing :) And no sign of the string poking anything so that was a relief (he is pretty big so I was worried). 

The only problem so far is that I have had cramps every morning and light bleeding almost every day. The cramps such. They aren't intense, but they make me feel weak. Waiting for the train to work is a bitch, standing and carrying laptop and handbag etc. I am hoping the cramps go away soon. From what I have read online they can last anywhere from a few days to 6 months. I guess I will just have to wait it out. 

But for the time being it is great to be sperm-proof! Hope this helps someone in the future in their decision making process.

t3_267zyg,My ex disappeared without a trace and I am having a hard fucking time about it.,"Hey. Just want to vent in a safe space. 

The long and short of it: I spent a great year and a half with M, who I considered to be the love of my life. We met here in the US because I was taking Dutch lessons from him for my upcoming move to the Netherlands and, well, the rest is history. We were inseparable for the first 11 months and it was the happiest relationship of my life, but 5 months ago he moved back home to the Netherlands and we had to finish out the days until the end of summer (when I officially move--something like 85 days from now) doing the distance thing. He became less responsive and things got strained. We went from being completely 100% committed and one the same wavelength, happy, in love and solidly looking towards marriage to... none of those things. Lots of confusion, hurt feelings and just... general ""out of sight, out of mind"" stuff. He has severe ADHD so he can't concentrate long and I'd always been mindful of that, trying to keep our Skype dates short. In person it's no problem but online it's a whole other kettle of fish. He has anxiety issues and doesn't like to be alone--so, while we were together here in the US he was never really alone, but once he moved back home to the NL it hit him that I was no longer there and he was anxious about being alone. This means he started going out a lot again (and late) with our mutual friends and spending less time at home or even checking in with me. One day he'd say he loves me, wants to marry me and that he'll wait and the next there was radio silence. It was incredibly hurtful to me.

Two weeks ago he just disappeared. He said he would call me on May 8th; I hadn't heard from him all day so I called him. Went to voicemail something like 5 or 6 times. And the next day, and the next. Until I saw him being tagged all over facebook at his soccer competitions and posting about them. I'm absolutely crushed. I never did anything to warrant this and in order to ease the distance I told him he could even sleep with other women, as long as we return to monogamy when I get back. I was 100% okay with this (truly) and I feel like I had been such a supportive, loving, fantastic partner. He and I both told each other that though we were allowed to, we have never slept with another person. He has never given me a reason to mistrust him, so I believe that. I don't know what happened, and he won't even talk to me anymore but he won't block or remove me from anything. I'm now going to end up in the Netherlands alone, so back to square one. The problem is my new job and university are about 10 minutes from him so I'll always be reminded of the ""what if?""

I fucking miss him and the not knowing why he did this hurts most of all. I want to call him when I get there (it's such a sad thought that the only way he will answer me is if I call from an unknown Dutch number...) and ask him out for a beer just to get closure, but what's the point?

Having said that I notice that there are occasional tensions with many of my close girlfriends. Like as far as I know we didnt fall out or anything, but for a day or two she cant look me in the eye or her voice will be a bit brittle when she speaks to me or her smile doesnt reach her eyes and if we are in a group, she will go out of her way not to address me. Most of the time the tension passes and nobody ever mentions it.

 I just had an incident of this nature where I spent the day with a close friend and another group of acquaintances. The close friend went out of her to avoid me to the extent that she chose to take a different train back. I wondered if I was imagining it, so I wrote down the days events and even setting aside my feelings, her behavior was really off today. I **know** in a few days, all will be well again. I guess I just want to understand why this happens. I havent had very much of the same with my male friends (again, in **no way** suggesting that those friendships are superior. They have their own challenges just not this particular one).

t3_267r02,So when IS it the IUD? (And what's next?),"I've had my Mirena for a little over a year now. It's the first form of birth control I've ever used (go for the big guns!) and I was hoping this would be the end all, be all for me. All of the things I was worried about symptom wise (weight gain and acne primarily) have not been a problem since having the Mirena inserted. Didn't kill my libido, either, which was a relief. On the flip side, I have developed a whole host of other problems, many of which I barely or never dealt with before having my Mirena inserted, including:

- thinning hair (like...worryingly thin. Not coming out in clumps, but I've noticed a bit of a receding hairline)
- two ovarian cysts (one ruptured and put me in the hospital, the other is a dermoid that will have to be surgically removed at some point)
- all sorts of stomach/digestive issues 
- Several yeast infections and one mild case of BV
- hip/joint/back pain. This is the most troubling part. It's gotten exceptionally bad over the past few months...to the point where I can't walk more than a mile or two without my legs/hips/back SCREAMING in pain. Day to day I have an all over achey/blah feeling. I'm getting some bloodwork done to check for arthritis (which seems to be a rarely reported side effect of Mirena) and I'm 29 years old, for goodness sake!

I have also had three really horrible colds and one tonsil infection since last April...after not getting sick for almost a year and a half before having the Mirena put in.

I keep trying to think of other things that could be causing these issues. Maybe the cysts were just a fluke. (Doubtful, according to my gyno.) Maybe I just need better shoes for the joint pain. Maybe the thinning hair/all over blah-ness is from stress. (I have been under an exceptional amount...mostly because of the emotional and financial strain all these medical issues have put me through.) At what point, though, do you think you CAN contribute symptoms to the IUD?

The situation is seriously stressing me out. Mirena has been great for it's intended use...condom-free sex is so much better for me and my boyfriend and I am not at all worried about any mishaps. I'm not sure I would be this comfortable with other methods...so the thought of having to switch to other options is (unnecessarily?) freaking me out. 

So I just want some opinions. Do you think the Mirena could be at fault here? Is there a chance that it's just taking longer for my body to regulate itself? 

For those who had Mirena removed...what was your next option? I don't want to deal with the Depo weight gain (after losing 95 pounds) and I have a hard time remembering to take vitamins, let alone a birth control pill. The implant freaks me out but I'd maybe consider it...though I watched a youtube video of it being inserted and I almost passed out. 

Thoughts on NuvaRing post-IUD? I don't know if the effectiveness is high enough for me to consider using it without a condom. I also don't want the hormones to turn me into more of a stressed wreck than I already normally am.

Sorry for all the questions...I'm just going crazy over the whole thing and I'm super, super bummed I might have to get rid of the IUD (even despite all the side effects it may be causing.)",9,20140522101718,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_268ki7,Brown discharge for a day.. Now nothing. Help!,"Hi there. I'm asking for help because google has only shown me scary unrealistic outcomes.. as usual.

So here it goes. I have an incredibly irregular period. Sometimes it will be a week, two weeks late. It can be heavy or light, last an entire week or three days, you get it.. So I usually go by how my body feels and the week prior. The week prior to my periods, my breasts are sore and I'm more emotional and irritable than ever.

It seems that this week or the week before should have been when I start my period, but alas, all I got was four or five days ago just a bit of brown discharge. That sometimes indicates I'm going to start in the next few days.. But it's been too late now.

Having said all that, it seems obvious that it is implantation bleeding.. Except  I've been pregnant twice already and remember the symptoms very clearly, and I had a lot more symptoms with it. I was extremely sick, I hurt, I was tired, My breasts hurt more than ever.. And I don't have any of those symptoms. But then again, I think I got those symptoms after the bleeding. :/ But I had an abortion last march, and my period was very late when it did come last and before that I had some complications with it. I had an infection afterwards and had to be on a regiment of antibiotics for some time. 

I'm not sure if that has anything to do with how my period acts now, but I've read on scary google that it can be a factor.

So please, does anybody have any insight on what I should do or what is going on?? I don't keep track of my periods because they are so out of wack so I'm a little lost. I want to go to planned parenthood but I have no insurance or money at the moment.

Anyway the guy I'm dating is that guy that's popular and god looking and all his friends are as well. Recently I've been getting hit on a lot especially by his really good looking friends. Now the issue here is that since I was so ugly at some point in my life I can't see my self as that good looking girl these guys are looking at. (don't get me wrong I'n not saying I'm a godess). I see myself as that pudgy looking brace face girl... I can't look at myself and say damn I'm hot. I don't know if this is how I really look (pudgy ugly and nerdy) or how these guys see me as an attractive, cool and funny girl. I see myself as average (on a good day) and maybe even completely below it regularly. I feel like a lot of the time these guys just hit on me because they see me that day in a fairly good light but regularly they'd see the real ugly version of me.

My best friend of five years told me she had a crush on someone the other day. I figured it was another tall, lanky swimmer or something like before. She was going to tell me the next day, when we went out for breakfast. Okay. 

I was impatient, and asked via text that night. She told me that the person's name started with an S, they're female, and a few other details. I let it go and went to bed. 

The next day at breakfast: *Ah, fuck it. Simpleminded, I like you.*

I politely tell her sorry, but she's not my cup of tea. She's my best friend, and nothing else. I don't want our friendship to change. I changed the subject and tried to act normal. Playing off normalcy is harder than I thought, and it's getting a bit tiring. I found out that all of my friends knew for months. 

I have no issues with her choices, but I really don't know what to do. Even though I'm trying to lay it cool, I'm going full on panic. It doesn't help that I'm asexual and predominantly interested in guys. 

This post is a mess, and I'm sorry. I'm just so confused and don't know what to do. I feel like acting like nothing happened might not help. I can't reciprocate her feelings. ",22,20140522225723,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_269kxf,So this is what a healthy relationship (and amazing sex) feels like...,"Just needed to write this out and share it with someone. 

I grew up in a conservative christian household and was sexually abused as a child for two years. My parents never knew and never talked to me about sex. I didn't lose my virginity until I was much older and bounced from one abusive relationship to another. Until 8 months ago, I had never had a healthy, happy relationship and had never had comfortable sex with any partner. I say comfortable because even though I had good sex a few times, I never felt comfortable in my own skin during it. I wasn't able to orgasm from intercourse and thought I was part of the group that needed clitoral stimulation for sex. My intimate partners so far have all been rather selfish. Yes, they were interested in me reaching an orgasm but that was never a priority and since it was difficult for me, I just pretended I was okay with not orgasming when I wasn't. Sex was always something shameful for me too. It was hard for me to feel good about myself after having sex, even in a long term, serious relationship. I always felt somewhat ashamed. I would find the need to shower immediately afterwards most of the time. I wanted to have great sex and really longed for it but I thought I would never be able to get there. 

I met someone a year ago. We knew each other briefly before we slept together one night. It was amazing. I thought it would be a one night stand but over the last eight months, it has developed into one of the most amazing relationships I have ever had. Who knew you could find someone you can have amazing sex with, laugh with, cry with, talk about anything under the sun with, and still be respected as an individual? I never had that. He's an amazing partner to me in every way. Not that my past relationships are a standard but I have never felt happier with someone. I have never felt more of a whole person in a relationship as I have with him. But what I want to share (and show off :)) is the sex. Oh my god, the sex! I am at my heaviest right now and it's the best sex I have ever had. I have NO trouble orgasming from penetration alone with him. I can come as quickly as within five minutes. He fulfills my needs completely. Things I never thought I'd enjoy before, I love doing with him. I hated giving blowjobs. I LOVE giving them to him. The idea of it turns me on so much and when I do it, I get surprised at how turned on I get. I never would let anyone go down on me but he makes me feel so comfortable and so amazing when he does. I can orgasm multiple times with him. Last week was six times in five hours (I was EXHAUSTED) and in just one 'session' that lasted about 50 minutes, I came three times. If a friend told me that in the past, I would wonder if that was true but oh my god, I BELIEVE now! 

I don't know what the magic combination is with this amazing man. I don't know if the sex is so good because even though I am the heaviest I have ever been, he makes me feel so comfortable. I don't know if it is because it's the first time I have felt so respected in a relationship or because he makes me laugh all the time. We can jump from talking about work, to talking about politics, to talking about sex, to talking about a tv show and throughout our conversations, I feel like I am heard. For the first time in my life, a negative conversation/interaction does not result in yelling and screaming and hitting. We don't do that. During every negative interaction, even the really negative ones, he never crosses the line. He gives me space, he takes his space, he comes back and talks to me and he makes me feel like I can say whatever is on my mind without invalidating what I am feeling even if he disagrees. Wow. I have never had that. These might be all be the norm in most people's relationship but I have never had an experience like that. I am tearing up even writing this because of how happy I feel and I can't believe I have this. 

I can't tell you how much having a positive, healthy relationship has changed me. I hope it lasts but even if it doesn't, for the first time in my life I feel like I will be okay. That there is hope. That I am not doomed for a life of horrible relationships and bad sex. It's easy to point out what a bad relationship is like. It's much harder to know and understand what a good, healthy one is like. I am so glad I have. I just needed to share this with someone. I feel like screaming it to the world.

t3_269awi,I need serious - and constructive - advice. I have no idea - absolutely NONE - of how to take care of myself.,"This may get quite lengthy, and any spelling or grammatical mistakes are because I am typing this out both in urgency and because I am on mobile. I'm using a throwaway because this will get personal.

For the first time in about six years - and only because I developed a very nasty illness I could not ignore - I saw a doctor. After getting lectured about how there is no excuse for me to not see a doctor, how actually my insurance does cover routine preventative care and with my consent, she did a full workup along with treating my illness.

It goes without saying that I am not nearly as healthy as I thought I was. Actually, I'm pretty sick, but with reversible issues.

The problem is that I have NO IDEA how to take care of myself. Sure, I possess basic life skills, but proper care and maintenance of the body is something that I can't grasp. I have neglected my medical care, my diet (I either eat not at all or the kind of foods you would see on a child's plate, and I am 32 and in before fat, I'm not), my physical and emotional self to such an extent that the doctor informed me that my life expectancy could be years and not decades if I don't fix this.

I was abused as a child. It was literally a matter of survival that I stopped registering pain/discomfort/sickness until they became unmanageable on my own or I was strong armed or bribed into getting proper care as an adult (I received proper care as a child). I don't know my body in the sense to find a way to fix it if something is wrong - I most often do not feel pain or any illness until they are completely incapacitating. I had to not. Survival.

I don't know how to feed myself a proper diet. I don't know how to tell if something is physically wrong. I don't know how to search for or vouch for a doctor - I just picked a name out of a book and saw if they accepted my insurance. I need a gyno, but I don't even know how to find one of those, and if I do they have to be someone who can deal with a certain level of crazy I get because I was sexually abused. I have terrible PTSD and can't be touched.

I feel guilty and terrible that I have neglected myself to the point where dying is a possibility. I feel terrible and guilty that what I went through was obviously this bad that I don't feel human, that I feel like an object, and that the thought of care frightens me.

Please help me. Give me advice. How do I...essentially be a person?",21,20140522193437,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I have a tendency to ramble, and I don't want to bore anyone so I'll try and make this as concise as possible. 

I guess my biggest issue right now is my body image, overall it's just miserable. I've found it hard to look at myself in the mirror for the past few years and honestly it just keeps getting worse. I can acknowledge I'm not the ugliest person in the world, but I am still by no means attractive. I actually dabbled with the idea that I was asexual for a while, before realizing that it wasn't that didn't have an sexual/romantic attraction for boys, just that I found myself so unattractive I couldn't fathom the idea of anyone being attracted to me, that it didn't seem worth the effort. **(Has anyone else ever felt like this? I've never told anyone that because I know it sounds ridiculous)** Like, the possibility of me finding someone seems so ludicrous to me that I've just given up on romantic feelings entirely. 

I know that's pathetic, and I know it seems like right now I'm looking for someone to throw me a compliment to save me from my sea of sorrow, but I don't know who else to turn to. My friends are all beautiful and out-going, and at this point in my life I just don't feel like I can keep up with them, and I guess that's hard to. I want to go out, and meet boys, and do stupid things but honestly most days I don't want to leave the house because I feel so *ugly*. 

I know I'm being dramatic and I know, I know, I shouldn't place all of my self-worth in something so superficial but the fact of the matter is I'm 19 and I just feel like I'm missing out.

t3_26978b,I just had a pretty alarming experience.,"I was walking home from work, essentially from the train really. It's late, around 1.30am. I was wearing a short ish dress, a summer dress really with a leather jacket, sandals and a scarf. There's no one around. I usually walk through a parking garage beneath apartments (it is on the ground though, so not underground) - and I'm just in my thoughts, tired and ready to get home and relax. All of a sudden I hear ""Hello"" and I am literally shocked, wondering if this person is talking to me...


So I turn around and it's this guy who seems to be a bit tipsy. I'm about 2/3 through the garage, he's at the entrance, I'm walking away from him. When I hear him, I stop and turn around and don't say anything. He then goes ""kom hitt"" which roughly translates into 'come here'. I go ""Nei."" (no) in a pretty aggressive and pissed off tone. He goes ""kom hitt"" again and I said ""NEI"" and start walking away. He then says something else like a little rant to himself, I'm not sure. I just keep walking away quickly and rip out my phone and desperately start calling my sleeping boyfriend. Walked the rest of the way back (about five minutes) with the bf on the phone.


I'm living in Norway and everyone says it is so safe here, but it's experiencing more and more crime. I don't care if it is 'safe' there is no way that a drunk guy in the early morning telling a girl to 'come here' in a parking garage - there is no way that is ok. And fuck him for saying 'come here' like I'm some fucking dog. Fuck him. He just stood there and expected me to come to him. Fucking loser. 


And so while I'm thinking these things, yes, it dawns on me. He did this in the early morning, with no one around, dark outside - in a parking garage. There is no way he had any good intentions. Because I'm wearing a dress he can treat me like that? Because I'm a girl? It is so fucked up. While I'm angry, I am also pretty freaked out at the same time.

t3_269t3p,I think my parents are shaming my sister about her abortion.,"My parents LOVE kids. Like, really, really love kids. They raised 12 kids (no we're not catholic) and although they aren't actively anti-abortion, their feelings are made apparent in their actions.

My sister got pregnant at a bad time in her life. She loves kids and wants a family - but she also wants to go to grad school and the dad wasn't in the picture. Wrong guy, wrong time. It was still a VERY hard decision for her.

Now that she's had the abortion, the whole thing is *very hush-hush*. Only talked about in whispers - always danced around in conversation. My sister recently brought up not doing grad school because of the expense and time. My mother said **'then it would all be for nothing'**.

It was meant to be encouraging but my sister didn't take it that way. As if my she owes the world something because the abortion. She has to live in this child's shadow for the rest of her life? Not to mention how no one can talk about it without whispering and acting like it was this big tragedy. 

She's having a had time dealing with her decision and they want to help, but I feel like they're going about it the wrong way. She knows it was the right decision for her, but that doesn't make it easy.

.


First let me say something strange. I love you for sharing about your rape in a way many don't understand, and not in a creepy or weird way. But in the same way I know some people loved me for sharing my rape. So let me share mine with you. I am a 6'5 masculine man. But when I was 5 I was kidnapped by a 17 year old boy, brought to an old garage, and raped.  He was caught and went into the legal system, but I never even got to know his name (as he plead guilty as a minor).  I had nightmares until I was 12.  Really awful nightmares. I also had a distorted sexuality, and was attracted to 5 year old girls until I was 11 or so, but thankfully never acted on it. I used to speak in college about 1 in 6 men and 1 in 4 women being raped or molested by the age of 18. That's over 20% of all children. And if you look in the room (saying this in college) you can count how many men and women there are, and on average how many of us have been raped as children.


I have never had someone look down on me for that. Not once in all the times I've spoken about it. I can't promise no one will look down on you, but the people you truly want in your life will love you more for sharing this. Just as people who have read what you said online love you more for it and support you unconditionally. You are a wonderful person, and when you ask us for help or advice it give us worth. It is no burden for me to help, and you know that because when someone asks you for help you love them more for it not less. Them trusting you is the hard part, you giving them a hug and a loving message is the easy part.


Don't ever feel guilty. If this had happened to someone else, you would have felt no guilt and considered it a ""natural consequence of that guy's action"" to get fired. And rightfully so. As you know, he's built himself up on lying and manipulating people into thinking he's a good guy then attacking the vulnerable. I think it's important that people know who he is and what he's done so he has real consequences. It's the best chance he has of every becoming a good person. Telling people what he did is more likely to help him, as he has to truly come to terms with what he's done and admit the horror of it to other people.  It may also hurt him, but generally, as they say, ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant"". And things get better and better as you let more people in and heal.


Never, ever feel shame for this. You never did anything wrong, and there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed about.

Be safe and be happy :) Ask me anything anytime.

(Trigger warning; sexual abuse)","So I have been struggling with depression and anxiety most of my life but am going through a really rough patch right now.  I finally reached out to get help and am doing all I can to get better, but right now that isn't much.  My friend, and roommate has been awesome at helping me but something came out at my doctor's appointment today that I have not told anyone about, ever.

I am pretty sure I was sexually abused by some teen-aged boys that lived in our townhouse complex when I was four or five years old.  It may have even involved my half brother(s).  I am not going to go into the details of the event, because I don't really even fully remember them, but I get flashbacks of that day.  The flashbacks started about ten years ago, and I was never sure about it, so I just kept pushing them back.

Anyways I want to tell my friend about this because he is my only support where I live right now.  He knows pretty much everything about me and wants to help me get better.  I want him to understand why I will be going to certain treatments or therapy or whatever.  (I am still waiting for the mental health intake program to schedule me for an intake appointment).  I also feel like this is something I need to start sharing so that I can start to accept it myself.  I am really reluctant to tell my parents because at this point there is nothing that can be done about what happened then and I don't want them to blame themselves for not protecting me.

Anyways, if you all have any advice about situations such as this or wouldn't mind sharing if you have been in a similar situation yourself I would love to hear what you have been doing to heal yourselves, and how you have handled telling the important people in your lives.

That spawned a conversation amongst the men talking about how messy it is being a person who produces semen. So i, feeling left out, attempted to join the conversation by explaining that vaginas are a constant mess and sometimes you flex your core to stand up at a restaurant and suddenly you have a watergun in your panties.

t3_26a418,I have never been able to talk about my abortion until I found this subreddit. I can't describe how much better I feel being able to tell my story without judgement and to get it off my chest.,"I have seen a lot of posts about abortions on here and have seen how supportive this subreddit is so I thought I'd share my story in hopes that it would help me let go a lot of my baggage. I saw myself as always being pro-choice,  and I still am, but I never thought I would ever have an abortion. 

When I found out I was pregnant it felt unreal, it in fact never felt real until I went to the clinic and they did the ultrasound. At times it still never felt real. My boyfriend was against the idea of me having a baby the entire time. He would spend countless hours trying to convince me it was a bad idea and not always in the nicest ways. I knew it was, I knew I could never afford a child no matter how much I worked or how much I made, it wasn't plausible. I also didn't want to subject it to a father who resented its mere existence and couldn't fully love and care for him the way I would want him to. Our relationship, which was a couple months shy of a year at that point, wasn't in the best of places at that time either. My best friend was also pregnant, when I saw how excited her fiance was that's when I knew abortion was the right choice, because that's how I felt it should have been with us as well. Supportive, excitement, I had none of this. Every reservation I had just didn't matter any more. 

We spent our one year anniversary at a two week check up. The whole ordeal brought us closer, as weird as that sounds. And he has expressed guilt about how he approached the situation. But he likes to pretend it didn't happen so we don't talk about it much. I haven't really been able to talk to anyone about it. I flat out lied to my mother and told her I had a miscarriage just because at that time I was going through so much pain I just needed her. 

Next month will be two years since I had it done and I am now letting go of all the shame I have  held on to these past years. I hope to one day I can fully let go of all of it and talk to my family about really happened. I now know it's not something I should be ashamed of because it was the right choice for me.

t3_26a01t,My sister [13F] is getting bullied and I [23M] have no idea what to do...,"First off, I had no idea this sub existed until it became a default so excuse me if I'm not adhering to the sub's norms. If I'm not let me know and I'll make the appropriate changes.

So my sister is in 7th grade and two of her old best friends are harassing her over text, instagram, and in school. She's not ugly (far from), she's smart, and can sing well. But unlike her classmates she's a bit different since she has two older brothers (me and a 24 year old) so her personal style is a bit...different. For example, she likes music but instead of listening to Justin Bieber she listens to Jimi Hendrix and instead of singing Disney sings she sings Lauryn Hill songs; naturally this disconnect in interests makes her somewhat of an outcast.

She's been having trouble with some of the girls in her class who have been talking shit. Today she came home crying because she found out people were calling her a slut because she wore - school supplied - gym shorts to free dress Friday. On top of that they're calling her an alien because she got head shots taken for a play she was auditioning for and posted them on instagram. I also found out that one of the boys in her class punched her in the shoulder and immediately high fived one of her female bullys. Now, keep in mind, she's not fat, ugly, or dumb.

Now the problem is that there's little we can do about it. She mostly confides in my mother who helps her by crafting appropriate responses to her bullys; my father wants to take a more proactive approach and talk with her teachers but my mom won't let him in fear that it'll just make her life worse. Which it probably will.

As a guy I'm a big fan of the right jab, left hook approach but that's obviously not an appropriate answer. If this were my brother or me our reaction would be to go with the blows and display our disinterest with the situation by making an spectacle of it. Both my brother and I are incredibly weird and carefree, but this made us popular and immune to most bullying. 

I know that she looks up to me and I know she listens to what I say and how I act, but it sucks to see the things I found effective be completely ineffective for her. I (and my brother) live across the country so were hardly around her, I'll be visiting until Saturday and want to say/do something to show her how to best handle the situation. 

I don't have many ideas since I'm - very clearly - out of touch with teenage girls, which is why I'm coming here for input.

I always (almost on a weekly basis)  hang out with him and his friends where I only know him. I was so stoked to have him there with us! This was very important for me. He was looking up baseball facts during the game so I looked over and the only thing I see is his message to his friend asking for help he was stuck with crazy girls at a baseball game. I seriously didn't mean to pry, I just caught him doing it. I'm immediately heartbroken told him he didn't have to come and ignore him for awhile. Thats the only thing I could do to keep from crying. 

There have been other instances similar to this not involving phones. Just little things where he is only thinking of him and not us. I go with him to anything he wants to do. We live together and I am always thinking of what he would want to do or if something would fit with his schedule. More and more lately he is only thinking of himself. 

Tonight was just another piece of wood thrown on the fire. I don't know who to trust. I guess I'm tired of being the only person worried about this relationship at all. Everything is 'just fine'  to him.

t3_26ae5u,Bringing an SO into counselling. Who's done it?,"Ive suffered from some depression and anxiety issues a lot of my life. I had a really bad period around the time I was finishing my college. I was good friends with my current boyfriend then, and we got together around the time I had finally gotten medication and started getting better. Since then Ive been recovering. No longer on medication. Still issues with depression and anxiety at times but since its not constant, or every day most doctors agree its not really an issue for them.

 I started seeing a counsellor a few weeks ago at the advise of a recent psychiatric assessment. and Ive been finding it helpful, the venting, to have my feelings acknowledged. I had seen forms of therapists all my teens but it literally took me until the the counsellor before this one in college to figure out exactly how to open up and make the most of it.

The place I'm going specialises in Systematic Psychotherapy. Which focuses a lot on relationships, family, partners, the people you interact with in your life. She's asked that my boyfriend, who I live with comes in with me. I agreed this might be good for us.

He was very reluctant to go, he's never had mental health issues, and never done anything like this. He's tried saying ""I don't need to see a therapist"". It took a lot of persuasion to get him to agree to go with me next week. I had to really plead, saying I needed him to do it for me. He's now reluctantly saying he'll go, but not promising results.

Im the kind of person with the mindset that anyone can benefit from counselling, no matter whats going on in their life, but Ive never done it with another person. My boyfriends been asking if I'll be in the room, if I can leave, worried about what I've said about him. I mainly just want to help him understand me better, how thing affect me. But also communicate about us and how we work together and such. 

I have no idea where to start it I want to prepare him. Or how this is going to go. 
  I'd kind of like to hear if anyone else has had a similar situation. Bringing someone else in on their therapy.  I'd post this to r/relationships but I didn't know if it would fit. Also I find their commenters to be harsher. 

Tl:dr:  My boyfriend is going to come see my counsellor with me. What can I expect. Anyone have similar experiences?

t3_26a4l6,Needing to talk through alleged SO cheating situation,"I apologize for the long story that is coming, but there are a lot of moving parts.

SO and I have been together for several years, and we are ending our undergraduate careers now. He went on a departmental weekend trip (I was invited but unable to go), got raging, blacked out drunk, and then apparently had sex with one of his female colleagues. 

I say apparently, because no one really knows what happened. Others saw him and the girl definitely flirting, holding hands, touching her legs, etc. but then when they walked away from everyone else, all the stories diverge. She is claiming that they had sex. However SO woke up alone, and fully dressed (buttons on pants, shirt and belt done correctly), and only remembers puking that night. 

The girl and I have previously met, and she knew we were together, yet is not sorry for her actions and was upset that they stopped having sex - she told him a few days after the situation that they stopped having sex because he was freaking out about not having a condom (he got tested today, etc.) 

The twist is that both my SO and I really doubt if they actually had sex. This is because he was puking a lot that night, woke up fully clothed, and the girl has changed her variation of the story a few times. But regardless of if they had sex, there was some sort of physical activity, hand holding, kissing, leg touching, etc. 

Because of our long history together and our immense trust, I am trying to work through this with him. I feel strangely 'okay' right now, and it's been a few days. I don't know if it's because I know that he was blacked out and the girl almost forced herself on him, or if I'm doing the classic, 'I'm not going to blame my SO but rather the other person', or simply repressing all my feelings about it.. but I don't want to be okay now, and have everything come boiling back up in a few months.

The thing is I have some other medical complications, like I have Iron Deficient Anemia, I have some random rare condition that has put me on a feeding tube and (I don't eat by mouth at all), I have some bizarre onset of arthritis or ""Joint Pain"" because doctors don't like diagnosing someone as young as me with arthritis.

In June, I'm going in for a procedure that involves swapping the feeding tube out for a smaller ""low profile"" one in June. I'm practically an expert at procedures and right now my parents (the ones financing this potential reduction - so they have a ""say""/power) want me to wait until the feeding tube is removed however that is like a life sentence because the tube is going to be in anywhere from Six Months - THE REST OF MY LIFE (worst case scenario)!

I know RIGHT NOW isn't the time, but I want to start the research part of getting this reduction. I'd ideally do it end of July/mid-August. I live in the plastic capital of the USA (Los Angeles) and figure I could find a really good doctor that could fix me up and help me greatly.

Obviously, I'm really sick of waiting for this. I think it could really help my back/joint pain in that area of my body. I always used to say before I got sick, ""I'll do it in x amount of pounds, when I'm fit."" Well the truth of the matter is I'm a normal weight now and I just need this done.


Fuck. I don't even know what to do. My family has made it very clear they aren't supportive of the idea unless the feeding tube is out but with another Six Months - THE REST OF MY LIFE range it just seems ridiculous. 

Ideally as well since I'd be going under for surgery I'd have them get rid of a little tummy/hip/tight weight too but with the feeding tube in I don't know how possible that is, and I'm cool if they don't do that. BUT I REALLY WANT THE REDUCTION. SOONER THAN LATER! While, I'm still improving on myself and doing nothing serious with my life.

The mansplaining will stop. The jerks constantly playing devil's advocate and arguing for the sake of arguing will stop. But it hasn’t.

 Yes, the mods do a very good job of removing abusive posts. But, often times it’s not quick enough. By the time these posts are removed, they’ve been seen by someone. And since this is supposed to be a safe haven for women, who are often in an emotionally vulnerable place, once the vitriol has been read, the damage cannot be undone. 

I love TwoX. In the two years since I’ve been a redditor, TwoX has been a huge support system for me. It’s a place where I can air my grievances, ask for advice, share my stories and provide support to other women who need it. It was a breath of fresh air, a break from male-central that is the rest of Reddit. 

But I just can’t do it anymore. In the two weeks since it’s become a default, I’ve gotten PMs telling me that I should stop “lying” about being raped, because “you know you liked it”. That I’m going to hell for having an abortion. That my inability to carry a child is punishment for being such a “stupid cunt.” Even after posting harmless, non-inflammatory comments. And I’m just one user. 

And to all the people bitching about having a “woman’s sub” as a default, I think you're missing something. You ask why there’s no “male equivalent” as a default? It’s because YOU DON’T NEED ONE. All of Reddit is a boy’s club. Don’t believe me? Observe the front page for a few days. Better yet, go watch /r/all. Every single day posts about blowjobs, boobs, attractive women, and being “friendzoned” make it to the front/all. Not to mention the circlejerks about false rape accusations. How often do the female equivalent of these issues get any attention (cunnilingus, naked, attractive men, being “fuck-buddy zoned”)? Rarely. At least, until TwoX became a default anyway. One post about period poops makes it to the front page and all the men lose their minds. That’s why we need this place.  

Thank you for everything TwoX. As much as I hate to do it, I think taking a break from Reddit for awhile will do me some good. Hopefully when I come back TwoX will be the awesome, supportive sub that it used to be, sans trolls.

t3_26as0z,How do I talk to my SO about equal labor / invisible labor in marriage?,"Throwaway, SO is a redditor... My older sister and I were on the phone the other day. She is recently married, and I am soon to be. We're both career-minded, working women, and we love our SOs, who are men, very much. They are good guys, who support our careers and are willing to do half of the ""third shift"" work at home. 

The problem is, at least in our experience so far, they don't really know WHAT to do to help. They will do a chore, if asked to do it. They will make dinner, if you tell them what to cook. If you tell them to ""think it up"" they will usually default to one recipe they know well. They will swing by the grocery store, but they have no idea what's in the pantry and what we might need. I think it's an issue of socialization - we were trained by our capable mother to do the ""invisible work"" of keeping a pantry inventory, keeping the calendar, thinking up what we'll cook for dinner. Doing ""half"" the housework (or, a fair share) to me should include knowing what needs to be done and when, and taking the initiative. We both have about the same standards for what ""clean"" means, so that isn't the issue. But for example, if the carpet needs to be steam cleaned once a year (silly, but go with me here), I don't want to be the only one who knows when, and who to call, and what to do to prep the house. He should be just as capable. I have to figure things out as I go along. So should he. 

My big question is this: how do we start our relationships right, and communicate this problem to them, without sounding like we aren't grateful that they are willing to help? I want to be a wife, and I want to keep my career, and I don't want to be his mother. I think he wants that too. Help, please. Men and women - how have you jumped this hurdle?

t3_26ammf,Being sexually assaulted by someone with learning difficulties?,"Hey 2x, I've got an interesting one for you. Using a throwaway because blah blah blah. I'll try and keep this brief.

I'm 21F and attend a college that also caters to people with various levels of learning difficulty/special needs. 


Yesterday, I was sat in the computer area of the library when a lad (tricky to age, but probably between 18-25) with learning difficulties sat down next to me. He stared at me for a while before poking my bottom with one finger. It made me jump and turn towards him, when he said ""hello!"" loudly. I said ""hello!"" and he asked my name, which I told him, and he told me his. I said ""nice to meet you,"" to which he responded by asking if I had a boyfriend.

I said yes, and then we carried on working silently. After about thirty seconds, he began stroking my hand (it was resting on the mouse). I said ""okay!"" in a kind of telling-off tone (I'm a trainee teacher, I'm mastering my stern voice!) and moved my hand. At this point, perhaps I should have moved but us Britons are terrified of offending anyone so I suppose I stayed put just out of politeness.

Not long after that, he rubbed my upper back. I sat forward, he dropped his hand away and I shook my head at him.
I have zero experience with people with learning difficulties so I had no idea how to handle this without being offensive or patronising. 

Again, we carried on working silently at our computers, although by this point I felt deeply uncomfortable and wasn't sure what to do and so
I was just pretending to do my work. I noticed him staring at me out of the corner of my eye. Then I noticed that he started masturbating through his trousers (as in, his hand was on the outside of his trousers).

 I completely panicked. I know that I should have got up immediately and told the nearest member of staff but I just froze. I can't explain it. I'm confident and assertive and have no problem telling a cat-caller to go f**k himself, but this was different. None of my friends were still at college so I fired an email over to a trusted teacher and asked if he was still around (this was after normal teaching hours). 

After I hit send, the boy reached over, slid his hand quickly across my thigh and grabbed my genitals. At which point I leapt up, shouted ""NO!"" And hurried over to the library supervisor. I whispered to her what had happened, tears in my eyes, and she initially **told me to just move computers**. After realising what she'd just said and seeing the look on my face, she got up and took the boy's name before asking him to leave.

He called over ""sorry! Sorry! Sorry!"" To me and I just nodded at him. I sat back down and the supervisor came over to talk to me and apologise for what happened. She took my name and said she would let the boy's tutor know, as he obviously needs to have some lessons in this kind of social interaction. I then sent my teacher (who had replied to say he was still at college) a quick email letting him know what happened.

I then left college and went straight home. I was shaken up and teary and confused.

How am I supposed to feel about this? There was a group of girls who saw the whole thing and laughed hysterically. Am I supposed to laugh this off and treat it as a sweet incident involving a misguided special needs kid with too many hormones to deal with? If I had been assaulted by someone without special needs in the library, it would seem more clear cut and I would be very angry at that person.
But I cannot be angry with this person. He is not 100% responsible for his actions. 

Any advice would be welcome! Am I overreacting?

t3_26ar34,My husband doesn't want me to get a half sleeve.,"We got into an argument last night because a couple of days ago, I mentioned to him that I want to start on a half sleeve on my left arm. Last night we finally got around to addressing it, and his response was, ""Absolutely not.""

First of all, I wasn't asking his damn permission. I wanted to discuss it with him because well done tattoos can be expensive, and we always discuss purchasing expensive items before actually doing so. He has zero problem with the cost; he just thinks that if I get this tattoo, I won't be taken seriously by any company I want hiring me once my contract with the Army expires. I explained to him that it's a half sleeve. I'm going to make sure that it won't be seen in my PT uniform (as per the new Army regulation). Therefore, it will only cover from the top of my shoulder to about 3/4 of my bicep. 

Secondly, it's MY body, and I already have tattoos. None of which you can see in uniform, but my second tattoo is on my collar bone. Does what he said hold any weight? Do many companies still feel that visible tattoos are unprofessional? If I needed to get hired on somewhere that badly, I guess I could cover it up during the interview, if it even showed at all.

t3_26avwj,[support] I got my pap results back. I have high risk hpv,"So, I just received the letter from the doctor. High risk hpv. The one that can lead to cancer. With a note to come back in a year. That was it. Just retest in a year. I have a lot of unanswered questions, I made an appointment with planned parenthood tomorrow to get my questions answered and to check on the swelling in my cervix. But I am still in shock with this news.   
I just started dating a guy a few months ago. The night I got the letter I called him to come over. It was hard to tell him. I couldn't say it, but I have him the results from my Pap smear. Breaking up with me didn't even cross his mind. He's going to support me through this. Odds are he might have it too. We haven't been able to really have sex lately cause of the pain in my cervix (which now makes sense). But we have discussed being careful so we don't continue to reinfect each other. And he's coming with my tomorrow so he can get more info from the doctor about this std.   
I just don't know what to think right now. I've gone through so many emotions in just a few days. I don't really know what to expect.  
I'm not too sure what I'm trying to accomplish with this post. Maybe just some support and advice. Or any questions that I should ask my doctor. I'm not too sure what to ask, aside from how can I help my immune system fight this quicker. How are we supposed to know when my bf has cleared it when there is no test in males. And what is the swelling in my cervix. I am trying to come up with every question so that I leave my appt tomorrow with all the information I need.   
  
  
  
[update] Went to planned parenthood today. She answered my questions and told me I will need to schedule a colposcopy soon. My bf came with me, but he wasn't allowed in the exam room. He's been really supportive though. I shared with him the info she told me and we both feel a bit better. I talked to an ex I'm still friends with and kind of mentioned the hpv. He said it's not that bad someone else he dated had it. But he wasn't very aware of hpv or how it's transmitted or how guys don't have any symptoms. So I think I probably got it from him.   
As for the pain around my cervix. It's probably not endometriosis. The doctor swabbed the area and there is some yeast so it could be caused from that. ",34,20140523095851,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26bf6c,Has anyone on here NOT experienced a form of sexism or sexual assault? (serious),"The older I get the more I realize how much bullshit us women have to go through, on a practically daily basis. I'm not saying men don't go through things (we know you do). I am simply stating that I don't know any women who haven't experienced a form of sexism or sexual assault and I am wondering if other women feel the same.

Examples of my own experience include:

- Being laughed at by male counterparts during a meeting in which I was presenting an idea
- Being surrounded by a group of men who told me they wanted to ""do bad things to me and get in that pu$$y"".
- Having my tits grabbed more than once by random guys
- Having my ass slapped or grabbed in a bar
- Being told by an ex that I (and most women) look like shit without makeup on
- Being called a bitch or a c*nt for not smiling at a guy when he asks me to

And the list goes on.

The older I get the less numb I become. It's very eye opening to see how many of us have experienced various forms of sexism and sexual assault.

t3_26bavx,"Confused: I let a friend ""sexually harass"" me.","This is weird and all over the place. I wanted to wait a while to collect my thought so that this would be coherent but it probably won't be. I made quite a few errors during this ordeal, so I'm not trying to evade the blame, I just want to talk it out I guess.

I made friends with this guy, let's call him Mike, last year. My relationship ended a few months ago and as such I was spending way more time with my friends, him included. Eventually, Mike admitted to be that he likes me but I was up front and honest about it and told him it was not mutual. He understood, we remained friends, and besides him making awkward jokes about it all the time, I thought we were fine.

A few weeks ago, I went to go visit my friend and him (they live down the street from one another). I live very far, so I planned to stay at her house, but turns out she had work at 6 am and the buses don't run until 10, so Mike offered me his futon. This isn't weird or anything, I've crashed there after pub nights and stuff (albeit, this is before he told me how he felt). 

We got drunk, played some beer pong, listened to music, and hung out like we always have. I got very, VERY drunk. Eventually, my friend left and it was just me and Mike. He brought up his feelings again and I, again, explained to him in nicer words that it would never, ever happen. We're sitting on opposite ends of the room, and all of a sudden he darts out of his chair and puts his hands around me. I was out of it and I thought it was a hug (an uncomfortable one at best). I didn't even reciprocate but the next thing I knew he tried to kiss me. I pushed him away, said no, and distanced myself.

He did this a couple of times. Tried to be romantic by pushing my hair away from my face, stuff like that. Each and every time I told him that made me uncomfortable and told him to stop. 

Finally, I was drunk enough to fall asleep. I went to go sleep on the futon and he offered me his bed (and he would sleep on the futon). Eventually I agreed went to bed. This next parts groggy, mostly because I'm a dead heavy sleeper, but I remember him coming in at one point and asking if we could share the bed because the futon was unbearable. I made a ""wall"" separating us with pillows and went straight back to sleep.

I wake up a lot during the night, and at one point I wake up, the wall is gone, and he is fondling me. He's in his boxers, he's straddling me, and his hand is under my shirt, on my boob. I just froze. I laid there frozen and didn't know what to do. I half shuffled away, pretending to be asleep, and got away from his touch. This happened a few more times. Every time I woke up, he was cuddling me. The last time I woke up, my bra was unhooked. I gave up and went to the futon.

The next day he asked me if I remember cuddling him. I lied, I said no. He said ""well, you agreed to it"". I don't know what he meant by this and frankly I don't want to know. 

I'm not saying I was sexually assaulted at all, I was aware of what happened, but it's just disappointing. I had a large amount of respect for this guy.

Now, the kicker. I gave him the benefit of the doubt after this incident. I hadn't seen him since it happened, but a few days ago we all went out for a friends birthday. There I met a friend of his friends who was very fun but very, very drunk. It was her first time at a bar and she came in with 200$ and ended up still having to use her credit card. She was out of it, like x10 worst than I was that night. They all go home, I stay for a bit with some other people, and we leave. All is well.

Mike texted me the next day saying ""wow this girl threw up on my comforter!"". At first I thought he just gave his bed to some one (he lives in a house filled with uni students, it's not uncommon for party goers to go crash). But it reminded me a little too much of our night. I asked who it was, and he told me it was that girl, the one who was so drunk. I asked if he slept with her, he said something along the lines of ""yeah but she was so out of it it wasn't even fun"".

I lost it. I called him out, he called me sexist (""because I was drunk to""... No, he was not. I saw him, he was fine). I told him why I thought he was wrong and he said ""sorry I don't want you to have a bad opinion of me"". It has nothing to do with me having a bad opinion of him, it has to do with NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULTING PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE DRINKING.

t3_26bo5k,Has anyone else taken a new job and regretted it VERY SOON afterwards?,"I know that this might not be the best place for this on reddit, but I just want some female opinions on this as my new boss is a woman as well. 

I recently took a job as a cook at a super fancy restaurant, lowest of the low on the totem poll but it pays more than the other serving job I was at and it's pretty crazy. I took it sort of spur of the moment because I was feeling the pinch of having my hours cut at the other job. I like the job, I do! I love food and the restaurant business and I always wanted to see how I could fare in the kitchen. 

The problem is, even after the second day, I knew that this was not the way I wanted my life to go. I don't want to be a cook. The hours are worse than my last job, and I already feel like my social life is kind of drifting away. The restaurant is so serious I feel little camaraderie with my co-workers. 

I have a college degree. I was applying before and I'm still applying to office jobs.  I want to work 9-5 and actually see my friends and family on weekends. I love this but I know that if I keep applying to those office jobs, eventually I'm going to leave, maybe even after only a few weeks. I worry that I will disappoint my new boss.

Sorry it's been so long since my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/21mdm7/pregnant_and_terrified/), I've just been extremely busy taking care of end of term school projects and sorting everything out. I'd like to take this chance to thank everyone who helped me in my time of confusion, your comments and advice really cleared my head and allowed me to make good decisions. 

I mentioned in my last post that I was almost certain that we'd either go with an abortion, or carry to term and adopt. However after a lot of thought and consideration, my boyfriend and I have decided to keep our baby and raise them with the support of those around us. In the time since my last post, so much has happened. We told both of our parents, who after differing reactions all came through and are fully supportive. It's going to be a huge change for my parents, but one that they're seeing as an opportunity instead of a challenge. The friends that we've told have, for the most part, been alright with it. Word obviously gets around, and there's one or two people who ""let it slip"" to others that I didn't want to know, but over the course of the next few years that's something I'm prepared to deal with. There's a lot of stigmas my boyfriend and I will face as young parents, and challenges as we continue with our education both during and after high school, but with the support of family and friends I know we can do it! We may have to take a different path to it, but in the end we'll still achieve our goals. And now we have some very strong motivation to succeed and build a good life. There's some good programs in our area as well that provide a lot of resources for people in my situation, and we're slowly putting plans in place to prepare for everything. 

Again, I'd like to thank everyone who has given advice in one form or another. I'm extremely grateful for it, as it reassured me that everything would be alright and allowed me to think clearly. You guys are fantastic :) ",6,20140523153828,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26b8ro,Should TwoX stay a default? Thoughts on the sub and a possible petition to have this sub removed from default.,"Exactly what the title says. Every day I see someone on this sub who has experienced negative consequences for having this sub as a default or discussing negative consequences they have seen. I am really tired of having this sub put through the filter of people who are unconcerned with its contents. It's become a less respectful and honestly more circle-jerky sort of place since the change has been made (at least from my perspective).

/
/

But when people discuss their unhappiness with the change, it's often a pretty negative discussion without ranged input or full of people who are very frustrated because they feel like they have no avenues of action.

/
/

I would really like to hear some honest feedback on this idea. From both sides. I am hoping it will be an open discussion without 'downvotes because I disagree', and I would really like to hear what people think of it. If people do support the idea of a petition, I would love to hear what sort of platform people would prefer, if it should be a vote sort of thing or a sign sort of thing(?). 

/
/

As for my thoughts, I think Reddit is a very male dominated space, and while I have plenty of love for then men and boys in my life, and appreciate the input of others, it was really nice to be in a place where I felt safe stating my gender, that was less reactionary and aggressive, that welcomed opinions and discussion on female topics. I think it is good that this sub is welcoming of both genders, but I am turned off by the idea of a female-topic sub being put on the feeds of mostly men. I think by having it a default for a site mostly dominated by boys/young men, it's changed the audience and is resulting in a lot of hurt feelings and feelings of... demotion to put it best. 

/
/

I am happy to discuss and/or answer question my opinion on it, but I want to keep my input short and sweet because I would really like to just hear what you all think. 

/
/

**TL;DR: what do you think of twoxchromosomes becoming a default? Would you like it to stay that way, or would you prefer it to be removed from the defaults? If you seek change, what sort of avenues do you like? How do you feel about the sub since the change, what seems different/the same?**

Thank you all, I look forward to reading this and just hope it isn't buried before anyone gets a chance to look at it!

t3_26aold,My self-centeredness is going to ruin all of my relationships,"Hi 2X. I had never heard of this subreddit before it became a default and now I'm so glad I did because I need some advice.

The title pretty much says it all. I feel like a huge asshole, but for some reason I can't stop being selfish and jealous and envying what other people have. Friend gets a really great promotion? My first thought isn't about how great that is for her and how hard she works (much harder than me), but it's ""why don't I get work promotions?"" Boyfriend is traveling for work and having a great time with his co-workers, going out after? I get irritated and my first thought is all about how I don't want him having fun unless it's with me. My cousin graduated from a great university and has an awesome job lined up? I immediately think ""Yeah well she's not all that great anyway she kinda sucks so whatever."" College friend getting engaged? Why not me.

Afterwards I always kind of hate myself and berate myself for making it all about me when it is clearly not all about me. Sometimes I'll hear the way I say things and INSTANTLY want to take it back because you can hear the annoyance and irritation in my voice. It's like I feel a need to compete with people I love for things I don't even want that badly, and it ends up with me taking happiness away from the moment because of my own selfishness.

You don't have to tell me that these are toxic behaviors; I know that and I hate it. I have always thought (and still think) that a huge factor of love is the ability to take joy in your loved one's joy, but I just can't seem to get there. I try to give the appropriate reactions when people tell me their good news, but I feel like my selfishness is holding me back from being as happy for them as I could be. This bothers me so much because I really DO love these people and want nothing for the best for them.

t3_26apon,Just a quick PSA from me to you about regularly seeing your OB/GYN (VERY text-heavy),"Just a little bit of background information about me: I'm a soon-to-be-24 year old young woman who recently graduated with her Doctorate in Pharmacy. I come from a family with multiple nurses and a pretty excellent health care background compared to most people. I understand the medical lingo, I take pretty good care of myself, perhaps lacking only in the physical exercise for the past few years due to the stress and time constraints of my education. (I was a was involved in multiple sports during my early childhood and until the end of high school.) I eat well and don't smoke cigarettes. I will admit to smoking hookah on a regular basis for the past 6-8 months or so. I eat well, cooking most of my own meals are rarely eating fast food. My BMI is probably on the low side of normal, but its been that way ever since I was little. Overall, I'd say I'm in pretty darn good shape. Now, on to my story...

I started seeing an OB/Gyn when I was around 16. I was having irregular menses, where I would skip a month, get my period, stop, then have it start up two weeks later. As a result, I was put on birth control, despite still being a virgin. It wasn't until I was almost 18 that I became sexually active. Then and until now, I have been almost entirely monogamous. (There was a time a few years ago where I slept with three different guys within 4-5 months, but they never overlapped.)

I believe it was January of 2012 when I went in for my yearly OB/GYN visit, with pap smear. I got a phone call stating that my pap showed abnormal results and I'd have to come in for a repeat test. It was only a few moments before the procedure that I found out what was actually happening. Not just a repeat pap, but a [colposcopy](http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colposcopy/basics/definition/prc-20014027). (You mean you're going to be cutting out bits of my cervix?! Excuse me??!) I was terrified and alone, which didn't help matters. It was also around this time that by doctor informed me I've had slight abnormalities on a pap before, which I was completely unaware of. My former doctor had neglected to give me this information. So I'm there half naked, alone, scared, and furious that my doctor kept this information from me. Not a fun way to start a procedure.

I don't recall the results of the colposcopy, but I had to have a repeat pap about around July 2012. That test, thankfully, came back normal. It seemed as if what they believed to be some sort of HPV infection had cleared.

January 2013: routine visit, no abnormal findings.

This year I switched doctors to a woman who was reported to have a much better bedside manner compared to the other one I was seeing. During my February 2014 visit, she was fantastic. She explained everything that she was doing (and even had a the speculum warmed up, it was amazing!) and was as gentle as one could be down there. She noticed a few abnormalities, some mild dysplasia. She took the smear and glanced at it under a microscope. No microbiology found, but she wanted to wait for the full pathology results before saying much more. I received another call a few days later: ""We would like you to come in for a colposcopy so we may biopsy the tissue and get a better idea about the dysplasia.""

Crap. Not this again. So I continued on with my schooling, finally graduating the beginning of this month, then getting the colposcopy done a few weeks later. Again, my doctor was as great as can be expected in that situation and ended up taking two biopsies of my cervix. And so began the waiting game...

Yesterday, I received a phone call from the office. As it turns out, one of the biopsies was [CIN1](http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=543118) and the other was [CIN3](http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=560661). Although I can tell you a ton about medications, diagnosis is another thing. Needless to say, I was scared shitless when I got home and looked up the terms. The office also scheduled me for a [LEEP procedure](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/gynecology/loop_electrosurgical_excision_procedure_leep_92,P07780/), which is effectively a hot loop used to excise the tissue. From what I've read, this procedure has up to a 98% cure rate for CIN2/CIN3 (according to one study). Even with that information, I'm still terrified. I haven't decided if I want children yet, and I read that the risks include cause infertility or premature birth. Scary stuff to think about when your 24th birthday is coming up in a few days, you just graduated, and need to study for 3 huge licensing exams in the upcoming month. (And to top all this off, my last living grandparent has been in the hospital for a few days with ""we're not sure"" according to the doctors.)

Now for my soap box. Please do not read this and feel pity for me. My situation kind of sucks, but I can only imagine how much worse it could potentially be if I did not see my OB/GYN on an annual basis. Who knows what could have happened if I was lax about my visits. I should also not that I have not received the Guardasil vaccine. I made excuses as to why I couldn't get it (school doesn't offer it, it would be a hassle to travel so frequently to my PCP that was three hours away from school to complete the series, etc). Now, especially last night, I could not stop thinking if things would be different if I had gotten it a year or two ago. Would it make a difference if I were to get it now? Unfortunately, I do not have the answers to these questions. But what I **can** do is urge all of you to regularly visit your OB/GYN *especially* if you are sexually active. Your reproductive health is not anything to fool around with.

t3_26aocv,Bonding with my sister,"Hey 2X! 

My sister is turning 16 soon and I want to do something special with her for this milestone in her life. I want this to be a bonding experience that will bring us closer together as sisters. I feel like I have failed the ""big sister"" role and I want to be there for her in the future. Recently, some family members have made comments toward my sister about how she is not as task oriented or focused as me and this has really hurt her feelings. I think some bonding time with her will get me to open up to her and tell her she doesn't need to follow in my footsteps and she can forge her own life. 

Any suggestions for activities or advice is much appreciated!

A little insight to me and my sister's interests:

Me- I work in IT. I steer away from very crowded places. I love music, practically all types. I love the outdoors (camping, hiking, etc.). Travelling is amazing :)

Sissy- Loves to craft! Everything from scrap-booking, making jewelry, and pottery. She loves shopping. She loves music (mostly pop, but she enjoys a bit of alternative rock as well). Kind of a girly girl, but she is open minded and willing to try new things. 

P.S. First post here, been lurking for awhile but this topic is really important to me.

Thanks! ",3,20140523082918,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26bmcx,Looking for some advice on communication/responding to severe low self esteem or body dysmorphic disorder.,"Hey 2x. So I was reading a post in another sub (choosing not to link anywhere/edit out a bit of the post for the person's privacy) that reminded me of a girl I used to be pretty close to. There were really no boundaries in the friendship as far as what's on/off the tables for discussion, so communication was usually good. 

That having been said, the one thing I could never figure out how to best react to was questions about what I think of her body, or simply how to respond to ""progress pictures"" when the sender was already criticizing herself on/off. We fooled around a couple of times, of course I was attracted to her and told her as much, but occasionally I'd sort of freeze up and not know how to respond in a situation where I was worried I might hurt some feelings. Anyways here's the example that reminded me of it all:


>I'm ridiculously preoccupied with my weight. I feel gross all the time, I take ages getting ready and go all out with makeup and accessories so I can distract from my fat but still feel feel like people are judging my body when I go out. I fantasize all day about how I would change my body and get depressed often. Even though my SO says he loves my body and thinks I'm beautiful I can't help but feel like he is lying to me to spare my feelings. I get told often that I'm not fat, that I'm tiny, that my face has no fat, that im beautiful, etc. But it's not what I see in pictures or in the mirror.


Realistically what is there to do or say, what would you prefer to hear? I don't mean from a stranger on the internet when posting something like this, but in a conversation with someone you trust and care for. If I find myself talking to someone in the future who feels similarly about themselves I'd like to be able to handle things better.",2,20140523143742,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I hope it's okay to make this post. I feel uncomfortable and really need another female's support in this.  
My period is 5 days late. I'm a 21 year old university student, currently not sexually active, and I have been getting my period regularly about every 30 days ever since I quit BC pills last November. I keep track of my period with an app and it uses my average cycle to project a start date, which in this case should have been May 18.  
I might be a little overweight and I work out regularly (I have a Strong (wo)Man Student Competition coming up!). I'm under stress all the time, because of my studies, but this hasn't influenced my period in the past.  
I only once skipped a period entirely, which was when I was 13 and me  and my family moved transatlantic and I had a rough time adjusting. I have been getting my period regularly ever since it started at age 12.

There is NO itching and I think it should be known that about 3 months ago I was diagnosed with chlamydia and BV and was treated with antibiotics and a vaginal gel. Well last month I noticed a fuck ton of whitish discharge and the same burning sensation so I went to tell my doctor and she believed it was again, BV. I'm worried and pretty annoyed with myself that I could have maybe possibly gotten chlamydia again because I recently had drunken sex with someone who told me they did NOT use protection. 


So my only complaint right now is my vagina has a burning sensation within it and for some odd reason it seems to be WORSE as soon as I wake up in the morning, this is when the burning is most apparent. As far as discharge goes, I haven't noticed any odd smells but I actually have noticed about a week ago an excess amount of it that feels really uncomfortable and exacerbated, like a gushing sensation of vaginal discharge from time to time.

t3_26bch7,Help me explain why my boyfriend is wrong,"Help me explain why my boyfriend is wrong. I recently had some conversations with him that left me angry and frustrated because I can't make him understand.

1) I commented about feeling uncomfortable because a bunch of the men at sporting event were ogling me. My boyfriend asked why it bothered me. I said I felt like a piece of meat. He said, ""Cry me a river."" He said having too many men find me attractive and having my choice of men had to be the ultimate first world problem. I said I wanted to be respected as a person and not objectified. He said he was sorry men find me so attractive.

2) I said the men were creepy, and I don't know they won't try to take what they want. They obviously don't respect me. He asked if I had ever been sexually assaulted or raped. I said I haven't been raped, but I've been sexually assaulted many times. He said he was sorry and asked if I was comfortable talking about it. I told him about a time when I was 13 and a boy at school walked up behind me and reached around to grab my breasts. My boyfriend asked if the boy was punished, and I described the way my friends kicked and hit him and then held him down while I kicked him in the nuts. The creeper crawled away in tears while everyone mocked him. My boyfriend got visibly upset. He said two wrongs don't make a right, and I sexually assaulted the boy. He said the boy could have been permanently damaged and made infertile. He said the boy was publicly humiliated. He said my friends and I acted disproportionately. I was left speechless. I feel ashamed, but I have a right to defend myself.

3) More recently, we ran into one of my exes, and it was really awkward. I reluctantly made introductions and then hurried my boyfriend away. My boyfriend asked why I acted the way I did. I explained how the ex made me uncomfortable because when we dated, he was always touching and escalating sexual contact. Seeing the ex reminded me of the fear I felt when we dated. My boyfriend didn't say anything for a while, and then he asked, what the ex did to make me afraid? I described a time when the ex and I were at a movie. I was wearing shorts, and he kept sliding his hand along my thigh trying to reach up inside my pants. My boyfriend got all cold and silent for the rest of the evening. When I asked him about it later, he said, he'd caressed my thigh at movies and slid his hand inside my pants in other situations. I said it was different with him because I like it when he does it. He said, he never asked me if it was OK before he did it. He just made the move. He said he is no different than my ex.

Help me explain how my boyfriend is different from my ex. Help me explain how it feels to be objectified. I love my boyfriend, but he can't see how wrong he is, and that makes me love him less.

t3_26bbud,"Drinking, poor decisions, maybe sexual assault. Advice needed.","I am feeling like complete shit right now and I just need someone to tell me what to do. I apologize if this is long. Some back story; I’m a 20 year old female and I was drinking last night at my friends house who I’ll refer to as S. S has been my friend for years and I thought I trusted him completely. We have hooked up twice in the past if it’s relevant. Besides me and S, the only other two people there were our friend ‘A’ and my best friend and fairly recent ex who I’ll call ‘N’. ‘N’ and I broke up about a month ago after dating for 4 years and living together for a year. It was an amicable break up and we still hang out and are on great terms. All four of us have been friends for years, and we were just drinking at S’s house to catch up since we are all back from college for the summer. I recently lost the freshman 15 I had put on last year and I hadn’t drank in a while so I did not anticipate how drunk I would be from drinking one 40oz. Last time I drank I could finish a whole one and would be drunk but not black out level at all. But last night I only got through half of my bottle and was already pretty drunk. The guys then wanted to play pong which is when things started to get really fuzzy. I stopped drinking then because I was really trashed at that point. The guys then wanted to go outside to smoke some weed, and I also smoked because I was drunk and thought I wouldn’t get that fucked up for some reason. After I smoked I can barely remember anything. The brief flashes of the rest of the night that I can remember are these:

When we were still outside smoking, I remember sitting on the ground and S put a blanket over me. Next thing I know I’m in the basement with N (my ex) looking for my spare lighter while S and A are still outside waiting for us to grab it. I remember N and I making out while we were in the basement, then we went back outside. Next thing I remember I’m alone sitting on the bathroom floor, everything is spinning and I’m trying not to throw up. Next thing I remember is lying on the bed in the basement being half passed out but not fully unconscious/asleep because I was still so dizzy. I couldn’t open my eyes. Then I felt someone kissing me. I knew it wasn’t N, my ex, because he has a beard and I didn’t feel a beard on whoever was kissing me. He kept kissing me even though I literally wasn’t moving at all, I was really close to passing out. I felt a hand on my right boob, and whoever it was moved my knee to spread my legs. The next thing I remember was puking in the bathroom. I don’t remember leaving the bathroom, but this morning I woke up in the bed alone, everyone else was asleep on the floor. 

I talked to N this morning about what happened. He pieced the night together for me. Apparently after I blacked out N put me in bed and no one had been left alone with me except for a half hour when N and A went outside to smoke again and S had stayed inside with me. This means that S had to have been the one who kissed/touched me.  

I guess what I’m asking is what I should do now? I am pretty sure S crossed the line last night. I have no way of knowing what exactly happened, if he just kissed me or what. Please, I just need some advice. I just feel disgusting. I thought I could trust him, I've known all of these guys for years, we've been friends since 9th grade. I don't know what to do

t3_26bqp4,"Husband thinks I don't help out enough at home. I disagree, would like some opinions.","Hello, everyone. First, the usual ""I'm sorry this is so long"" disclaimer. As with most things in life, my question is complicated. 

I'm the female in my straight relationship and I've never been good at maintaining my house. I know how to cook and to clean, but I don't do it efficiently, I don't motivate myself to do it, basically dread doing anything around the house (except for cooking, which is something I'm really good at and enjoy doing). 

My husband has a call-center job and he works from home. I am a paralegal at a law firm about a 30 minute commute from our house. He makes more money than me, and he had to go through extensive training to do his job, and he really dislikes the work. I also have a skilled job, and have to interface with terrible coworkers, terrible phone calls, useless projects, mind-numbing filing and transcription. My job is extremely high-stress due to a crazy boss, the commute, and the nature of the work.

When I get home, I usually find that a lot of the housework has been done. I'm usually exhausted. But my husband acts like his day is just beginning when he finishes work. He showers and gets dressed at 5 in the afternoon, before he goes either to class or is just hanging around the house with me. He's fresh and ready when I'm exhausted and feel like an empty bag.

A lot of the time when I get home, the first thing he says is that we need to go to the grocery store, I need to do the dishes, I need to fold the laundry. He then proceeds to do none of this with me because he already “spent all day doing that.”

Now, I never ask him to do any of the cleaning. He does this on his own. I could care less, honestly. But, he wants the house clean, and I'm willing to work with him within reason. There are things that I basically do exclusively: I fold the laundry after he runs it through the machines; I clean and replace litter in the cat box and rat cages; I feed and water the dog; I mop the floors (which, due to a disgusting gooey medicine our dog has to take, is an extremely labor-intensive chore requiring scrubbing and at least an hour of my time), I do the dishes occasionally, amongst some other tasks. While these things don't happen every day, I certainly make sure they get done when necessary.

Because of my terrible job, I never feel able to clean during the week (although I do it after we have an argument, most of the time. He always wins). He lords it over me that he spent ""all day"" cleaning, that he's constantly cleaning the house, that I don't do anything to help him. He acts like he can’t possibly imagine how I wouldn’t have time to do any cleaning, even though we spend 100% of our free time together—he knows when I’m busy, tired, doing a different project.

We are both part-time students who work full time. On top of that, I also volunteer with a group that pairs trained adults with children in the juvenile court system approximately 30 hours per month, a commitment that requires extensive training and continued learning to maintain my certification. I'm dedicated to my education, my job (as terrible as it is) and my kid who I volunteer with.

We're both busy, but my husband is AVAILABLE and NOT EXHAUSTED when it comes time to clean. He is motivated to clean and he gets it done. I believe that while equal rights in a relationship is important, it is straining our otherwise blissful new marriage. 

Oh, on top of that, my husband will be quitting his (much higher-paying) job to do school full-time very soon, and I have committed to waiting to do the same until he finishes his degree. This means locking myself into my job for at least another year and a half, while he pursues his passions at art school. I'm more than willing to do this for him, because his happiness is an important part of our relationship, and I am a huge supporter of the arts and film (his major)--I just feel that this should be taken into consideration when telling me that I don't ""do anything"" around the house, and I'm getting more and more upset that I'm making this huge commitment without recognition for the other things I do in our relationship.

I'm just ranting. I feel like if my situation was opposite, it wouldn’t be up for discussion. The woman always cleans, the man isn’t expected to clean as much as her because he’s tired and busy. Damn it all, I want to be that “man!” And I think it’s only fair based on our workloads, my personality, and his personality. Also, have read totally non-scientific articles in Time magazine and similar that ""perfectly equal"" relationships can be stressful and lead to higher rates of divorce.

*So here's the question, TwoX:* based on the info above, should I pull more weight when it comes to cleaning, or am I right in feeling that we don't necessarily *have* to be equal on this, and that he is better equipped to get a larger portion of this housework done?

tl;dr: I'm a girl but I'm crappy at cleaning and I hate it, and I have an insanely busy life that results in me being exhausted at the end of the day. My husband is good at it, gets it done regularly, but bitches and moans that I don't help constantly, says that we need to do exactly equal amounts of housework. I want to know if I need to just grow a pair and clean more or if I am right that he is more than able to take on a little more of that task. ",2,20140523152311,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I'm on my period and it makes me want to cry and I'm at work ffs. 

I've talked about this experience briefly before with friends but it's clear I'm still trying to process it because it comes up pretty often in my head. I have this debate about whether or not I was raped. My friends had no hesitation in affirming that I was, but it took me 2 years to really realize that was a possibility. I think the link really rang true because of all the times I haven't said no or fought back when someone was touching me and I didn't want it - it explained perfectly why I would do that. I had to copy paste the story from an email with my friends because i didn't want to retype it.

so, what happened was I was sleeping over at my friend's place.  this was 2 or three years ago. I had gotten pretty high and maybe had a few drinks. I went to sleep in the separate bedroom, and my two friends who were dating went to sleep in their room. now, I had had a couple of threesomes with them before, and everything went well. Let's call them John and Jane Doe.

i'm woken up by John touching me. I'm really confused, but mostly confused because it's just him. had it been him and his girlfriend, it might have been a pleasant surprise. He continues to touch me and I start asking if this is ok with his girlfriend. I'm still about half awake and very woozy. He doesn't answer, so I keep asking. Eventually he says ""Yeah, Jane's on her period,"" which isn't really an answer, but I relax a bit, thinking maybe she gave him permission? I might have said ""OK"" to recognize I had heard that, I'm not sure. I definitely didn't want to do it if she wasn't OK with it, and that wasn't clear, so I was confused. Things went really fast and we had sex. I was laying there like a fish since I was half-asleep. I don't even remember the entire experience coherently. All I know is it lasted about a minute before he stopped and apologized for it being so short. Then he apologized for not wearing a condom (!!) this is what tips me off: i'm not awake enough to ask about that, I'm not awake enough to tell whether he's wearing one or not and I'm like, oh shit, well good thing I'm on birth control. He leaves me to sleep in the wet spot.

I wake up the next day and am mortified. I pretty much know what happened wasn't ok with his girlfriend, but I try to pretend it is. I don't want to confront them about it, so I pretend it never happened, which blows up in my face later.

and i always thought, i didn't say no, i didn't push him off of me, sure he took advantage of me, but it wasn't rape, i sort of gave consent.  what also troubles me is that i didn't say no, but i usually say, well, i wasn't awake enough to know what was going on. and in other situations when i should say ""no"" or ""stop"", i haven't.

I don't know what kind of validation I am looking for, or advice. Just something so I can stop needling myself about whether I didn't do enough, was it really rape, how can I come to terms with the fact that someone I was friends with possibly raped me and probably doesn't think of it that way? He turned out to be a douchebag in several other ways, so I cut off contact. He apologized for jeopardizing our friendship when he told his gf about what happened - and he played it out to her like it was consensual. At the time I said I was ""out of it"", but I believed I gave consent - I think it was too scary to think otherwise? ",0,20140523145400,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26ch55,"Ladies, I give you a new use for cleaning up after your dog.","
Alright Reddit, since I've got new found insomnia sleeping in a different country than my own this past week and also recently falling in love with this subreddit...I've decided to share a story of street harassment of my own.

The setting: one of the biggest cities on the east coast

Late night after work, I quickly walk my dog before bed. At this point in my life I was living on the fringe of an up and coming neighborhood...needless to say, an early twenty something female should be massively aware of her environment if walking alone.

My 70 lbs mutt had just done his business at a small green square off of a main city street. Deciding he needed a bit more walking time before I took him back inside, i headed over to the main avenue since it was better lit. Standing at the corner of  a busy gas station, I had my dog sit and wait patiently for the light to change even though hardly a soul was driving at the moment.

Then, a car suddenly appears speeding to catch the light...or so I thought. The light is still green yet the car immediately stops at the crosswalk at my feet while approaching the intersection. Finding this odd since they have the green light, I look over at the car (a few feet in front of me) to see why this person has stopped (in my mind, for no apparent reason).

With the passenger side door literally right in front of me, I notice the window is down. Thinking the man inside was going to inquire for directions, I look at him to then realize he is locked in a creepy stare directly at me, furiously masturbating. Upon realizing the grotesque nature of why the fuck he was halting his car - I quickly unload a barrage of expletives at him. And without even thinking, throw the bag of shit directly at him, through his open passenger window. And no, it as not tied off yet.

The look on this face was priceless. So much shock, he drove away. Very, very fast. Completely shoo ken up, yet strangely proud of throwing dog feces at a complete stranger was certainly a mixed bag of emotions. But ever since then, I have never let street harassment bring me down, and actually severely enjoy making men deeply regret their ridiculous and insulting actions.I used to walk around with a chip on my shoulder in the city, hoping my bitch face would mark me unapproachable. Until this happened.

TL/DR: I threw dog shit at some fucking stranger exposing himself to me and have strangely gained massive street confidence since. Stand up for yerself, and if you can, hold onto that bag of dog shit until you get to your destination.

EDIT: Whoa! Thank you kind stranger for the gold, was certainly not expecting that as a super reddit newb. You guyyyyys :)

t3_26bxwu,Got catcalled and almost sexually assaulted today and for some reason I feel fucking horrible about it.,"I wasn't sure who else to share this with, I just needed to get it off my chest. I just feel so fucking violated and for some reason embarrassed and ashamed at the same time.

I have a summer internship that I work at two or three days a week, and today I finished my work early and was able to leave early, which was awesome. I love my internship but really need a paying job so I've been applying all over my city, and since I was off work early I thought I'd follow up at a place at an outdoor market that told me they might have an opening.

The market is really cool and actually fairly famous, but the neighborhood it's in has its ups and downs. It's a bit ghetto and sketchy in places, but also contains a ton of historic buildings, some trendy independently owned shops and restaurants, and a gorgeous park that is probably my favorite place in the whole city. It still has a reputation (especially amongst the middle-class white people in my area) for being hood as fuck and completely unsafe, but from my experience 99% of the people there are friendly, cool, and helpful.

Anyway, I stopped at the market, still in my work clothes (a simple business-casual dress and flats) only to find that the hiring manager had left early and I'd have to stop back tomorrow. But it was a gorgeous day, and not too late in the afternoon, so I decided to walk down to the park I mentioned earlier and enjoy the sunshine for a while, then maybe stop at some of the shops in the trendier part of the neighborhood to see if any of them were hiring. 

On my way down to the park, I realized that the street from the market to the park was actually pretty long, and pretty sketchy. Nothing I couldn't handle, but a couple of jackasses started catcalling me as I walked by (one guy said ""hey baby, lemme get a slice of that pie!"" y'know, shit like that). Ugh. I felt a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed, but I decided to ignore them and go enjoy the park, which I did (had a long conversation with a sweet old black lady about Frieda Kahlo, which was unexpected but cool--like I said, 99% of the people in this neighborhood are friendly and awesome) and then wandered down to the shops for a bit. 

As I started the walk back to my car (which was still parked at the market) I realized that I had absolutely no fucking idea where I was. I turned down what I thought was the right street, looked around, realized I still didn't know where I was, lather, rinse, repeat, until I was totally and thoroughly lost, on one of the sketchier side streets of the area. At this point I was a little worried, but I've gotten lost in worse places, so I just pulled out my phone with GPS for directions back to the market. As I walked in the direction it told me to go, I passed another guy, with several friends, who shouted ""mm baby, how much for that?"" 

I'd never felt more uncomfortable, but I just tried to ignore him and kept walking, even though he was still shouting shit at me, and his friends had joined in. At this point I'm near tears, my feet have blisters on them from my flats, I just want to get the fuck back to my car and go home. I get to an intersection where I need to cross the street. As I'm waiting for the light to turn, I glance behind me and this guy and one of his friends had fucking FOLLOWED me to the intersection and were right behind me, still saying sexually explicit things to me. I turned around to just tell them to stop, thinking maybe that would do something, and saw one of the guys reaching out to try and physically grab my ass.

 At that point I literally ran across the street, because fuck the don't walk sign, and walked as fast as possible back towards where my car was. I made it back to my car, happily, but not before getting catcalled by TWO MORE DIFFERENT GUYS.

I got into my car and literally just sat there and cried for probably ten minutes before I felt stable enough to drive home. I'm probably overreacting, I didn't get groped or raped or assaulted, but I feel so fucking violated and somehow also really embarrassed and ashamed, like it was my fault for wearing a dress and makeup in a sketchy area, or just being in that area in the first place. I feel like if I tell anyone then they'll tell me it's my own fault, I just feel so stupid and ashamed and gross and I don't know what to do or if I should even do anything. All I wanted to do was enjoy a cool neighborhood on a Friday afternoon. Why can't I fucking do that without becoming like some fucking sex object that only exists to be objectified? Fuck.

I'm sorry for the long story and the rant. I just needed to tell somebody. Ugh.

EDIT: Wow, coming back to see all this support really, really helped. Thank you all so much for the virtual hugs and reassurances that it's ok to be upset and that I didn't do anything wrong. I think the most annoying part is that I know with absolute certainty in the logical part of my brain that their actions weren't my fault, and yet for some reason I STILL feel angry at myself. I don't know why that is, and it's as confusing to me as it would be to anyone else. 

For people asking why I didn't put them in their place or defend myself, I should explain that I've never been catcalled by so many people in such a short period of time, and I'm not used to being catcalled at all in the first place (I'm from a pretty suburban area). When that sort of thing happens and you're not prepared for it, your head starts racing and so many thoughts and feelings hit at once, and before you can form a coherent sentence in your defense, even if it's just ""fuck you,"" the moment's over and the people are behind you. I wish I'd said something in retrospect, but I'm trying not to beat myself up about the fact that I didn't.",112,20140523164252,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26cg71,[UPDATE] being sexually assaulted by someone with learning difficulties,"Original post - http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26ammf/being_sexually_assaulted_by_someone_with_learning/

Firstly, thanks to everyone who took the time to reply to my post. I was very upset and confused when I wrote it and your kind, honest responses helped me clarify my thoughts and feelings.

Before I wrote the post, I had intended to leave things as they were and assume that the person who assaulted me would be spoken and we would all live happily ever after.

 But, as some of you pointed out, this probably isn't an isolated incident and this person is, to some degree, a threat to the welfare of those around him. I could have been a child or someone else with learning difficulties. That I am neither of those does not detract from the incident, but they were valid points and emphasised the need for me to take this further.

I have emailed the student liaison officers of the college to inform them that I was sexually assaulted on campus and that I expect a meeting to be arranged for me and any appropriate members of staff. I'm going to make it clear that while I don't harbour any bad feelings towards this person, he is clearly a danger to society and should not be left unsupervised as he has proven that he is capable of assault.

I will remind the college of my right to safety and will let them know that I intend to involve the police if this matter isn't taken seriously.

In hindsight I understand that I didn't handle the situation well at all, as some of you pointed out. However, sometimes it's easier said than done. In this situation, I just froze. I was in a blind panic. It was like my brain was begging my body to do something other than just sit there, but I just couldn't.

Anyway, it's done now. I will wait for the college to reply and keep you all updated.

Many thanks again for your kind words and interesting anecdotes and insights.

t3_26bvh4,Sexism in physics,"I understand that this may be a controversial subject for some people so let me explain:

I am a woman studying physics. I found the environment pretty discouraging and for various reasons I dropped out. After gaining more confidence, I am sure that this is the right career for me except for one thing - the sexism.

I'm not usually vocal about my feminist ideas but being in physics again for just a couple of weeks has made me feel like I need to be one of the guys to fit in. It's hard to feel accepted in the culture. I know that I inadvertently created more problems for myself by trying to be an engaged student: I am in a leadership position in the program and now find myself leading a group of young men (women are not active participants in the club) who are happy to doubt my leadership abilities and aptitude in science...

I brought it up but the men I brought it up to didn't seem to know what I was talking about. So I looked up ""physics and sexism"" on google and found this article which explains it perfectly:

http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/2011/07/20/is-it-cold-in-here/

I am really sad that I even need to talk about this. I wish it didn't bother me so much. I want to have some other explanation like I am interpreting this the wrong way and there just aren't enough women in physics but I know that's not true. I can see women shy away from actively participating in the program. I can hear conversations and see behaviour which would make my female friends uncomfortable. I think that the men in my program are uncomfortable talking about it or don't even realise it's a problem and that's why they don't engage in a conversation about it.

But I don't know what to do. My young sister is interested in physics. She could be a physicist one day! But I don't want to tell her the truth of what struggles she would have to go through. Like me, she has self esteem problems. I want her to go into physics but I don't want her to go into my program as it stands right now because I know that she might drop out. I also get sad seeing the women in my program avoid participating, even so much as putting up their hands in class. But most of all, I want to just be myself without fear of needing to change to fit in. I am past being liked at this point. I just want to be respected...

tl;dr: Any suggestions on solutions to improve the physics academic environment for women?

N.B.
I realise that these issues are not limited to woman in physics. Neil Degrasse Tyson can explain this better than I can:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM

Edit: I don't get what's with the downvotes.  If you disagree, say something.  I am pretty open minded to others' opinions...  

I don't care about being right or not.  I just want to find solutions instead of sitting back, complaining but doing nothing.  I want to inspire the women in my program to get together and help me do something about it, like building a community.  How do I do that when I rarely ever see the women in my program, and when I do, they don't stick around for long or speak up?  And the other reps aren't aware/willing to acknowledge of the lack of female involvement?  

I thought about going to the faculty about it.  Sadly, I don't know if they can do much...  It seems like my best option atm.  ",32,20140523161610,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26cso3,Was molested by my stepbrother when he was 13/I was 6. Was that a crime?,"Sorry for throwaway. For context, I am 26.

When I was 6, my mom married my stepdad. At the hotel at their wedding, I was put in a room with my two new stepbrothers. I knew them and had played with them before the wedding. The younger of the two fell asleep, but the older of the two, at the time 13 years old, proceeded to do sexual things to me in the dark. I don't remember what, but I remember not liking it. After the wedding, my mom and stepdad moved into a new house together, and my new stepbrothers joined us. The older one started convincing me to join him in the basement for games. Occasionally we'd play Simon Says, but mostly he just wanted me to let him put his penis in my 6-year-old vagina. I, thinking it was a game, allowed him to do it, and was told we weren't allowed to talk about it. One time, the younger stepbrother came downstairs and we immediately pulled our pants back up. I remember never wanting to play that game, and always wanting to go back to Simon Says, but he kept begging me to play the sex game with him. He called it -- and this part I have never told anyone because I absolutely hate the name of the game he came up with and it's hard to even think -- ""wiggle up the bottom."" *Ugh.* This went on for I'm not sure how long, but I guess at least a month.

Anyway, I told a few people (friends, mostly just guys I was seeing seriously) that I was, generally, molested when I was a kid by someone in my family. I didn't say who. I never told anyone in my family about it. At this point, that older stepbrother is married with 2 young sons, living in another state, and they all seem very happy and very nice. And honestly, it didn't really ever bother me as I went through life. I didn't really think about it at all until I started getting interested in guys: I told one of them about what happened (without specifics) and he was bothered for me but told me something along the lines of, ""well, it was only molestation, technically."" Like he was reassuring me. And that's how I heard it, and that's how I viewed it going forward: that it was ""only"" molestation and it was a very insignificant crime, if it even was one.

In October it will have been exactly 20 years since that started. and I was just reading something here this morning which made me think about it again, and really examine the details. And I'm realizing that it actually does bother me a bit, and that what he did to a 6-year-old was pretty fucked up.

But he himself was only 13. Technically still a child. I feel like even if I had told someone, nothing would have come of it since people would assume we were just playing. Sometimes kids explore their sexuality together, I suppose. But fucking goddamn, not FUCKING SIX YEAR OLDS, what the fuck... This is affecting me more than I thought.

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this here. Was it a crime? It doesn't matter. It was 20 years ago. Just, what do I do now? He has his own kids. Should I be concerned for them? That seems stupid. They're a happy little family. I will probably do nothing. Just needed to share.",25,20140523233052,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26c81z,Advice needed for diabetic mother with horrible eating habits and how it's hurting me,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post, but I love the community here and feel comfortable here.

WARNING wall of text!! 

My mom has type 2 diabetes, which she got when I was about 10 years old. She's always been a big lady, I'm not really sure of weight but I would say at her heaviest she was probably about 320 or so pounds. She's probably around 250 or so now. Her unhealthy eating and lack of exercise has lead to her getting diabetes, high blood pressure and sharko foot. Sharko foot has lead to both of her feet being broken in multiple places. Her feet are now both in casts (they have been since January) and the doctors see her staying in casts for a few more months. Eventually she'll go into walking casts, but they doubt she'll ever be cast free. 

How do I stop feeling so frustrated and angry at her for doing this to herself? She continues to eat horribly and not exercise. I came home from teaching English in Korea to take care of her (cook, clean, take care of the dog, go to the doctor's, etc.) and I'm watching as she continues to eat horrible. I feel as if she gave herself the diabetes, and her shitty diet lead to all the horrible complications. 

I do the cooking for supper, but she has her own decision for what she eats in terms of the other meals and snacks. I make fairly balanced meals, but she seems to eat around the vegetables. Some vegetables she'll refuse to eat (like a little kid!) and she'll leave them on her plate. She always asks for me to make potato wedges, and suggests ordering in all the time. The only fruit I see her eat are bananas, and I've never seen her take any other vegetable or fruit for a snack. 

I feel as if she passed on a lot of her shitty eating habits to me. I never saw her eat healthy as a little kid either. Fruits and veggies were always in the house, but usually went bad as we weren't really encouraged to eat them. We ate a lot of her cooking, which was greasy and buttery (but delicious).Other than that, she was an excellent mother that taught my sister and I to work hard and instilled great values in us. 

I'm a healthy weight now (although I was a chubby kid, and am still by no means skinny), I try to eat my fruits and veggies and I go to the gym 4 or so times I week. How do I stop feeling angry at my mom for what she's done to herself? Every time I've hinted about her changing her eating habits, she's gotten angry at me or cried. What do I do, if anything?

I decided to come off the pill a while back due to loss of libido. I spoke to my partner about it before and said I'd be more than okay with a 'happy accident' and if he wasn't up for this then it was up to him to use our condom stock. Well...He didn't take me up on that offer so we've had sex as normal without any contraception. So to me this means he's okay with the idea I may get pregnant.

So I'm late... I spoke to him briefly about maybe taking a test of nothing happens over the next few days and he's told me that he doesn't think we could afford/look after a baby right now.

I'm really hurt as 12 months ago I was also late and he told me he thought I should get an abortion. It's just mixed signals all the time. He always talks about 'when we have kids'  discusses baby names and things he wants to teach our child, then goes and says this when there's a possibility. 

For the record I would not get an abortion. I'd rather chuck his uncommitted Arse out the door, but it makes me feel ashamed that we had unprotected sex when I told him in the beginning the ball is in his court!

I have never told anybody about this so I am kind of nervous but  I guess I just need some perspective and/or some support if something similar happened to you. 

The summer I was 6 or so I went to a day camp at the recreation center in our town. I also had a dance class there at the rec center--I would attend the day camp, then go to the dance lesson--and then sometimes go back to the day camp if my parents couldn't pick me up right after dance. I (f) had a friend (f) who was a bit older than me (probably 8?) Anyway, one day I had gotten out of dance and was to go back to camp after. So I went into the bathroom to change back into my regular clothes to go back to camp that day. 

While I was in the bathroom, it turned out my friend was in there in the big stall. She invited me to change in there with her (I remember all us little girls had no trepidation about going to the bathroom together, etc. weird I know.) 

This is where my memory gets a little hazy... I spent the rest of my childhood trying to forget it due to the shame/embarrassment. I remember I was just trying to change out of my leotard into my day clothes and my friend suggested I stay naked. I didn't really know why but I did, and she took her clothes off too. I remember her saying we are going to play ""mommy and daddy"" and she was going to be the mommy. I was pretty clueless but I remember being pissed that I had to be the boy. But I didn't know why were naked or what was really happening... she told me that mom's and dad's have sex and that's what we were going to do. I still didn't really know what that was so I was shocked when she started rubbing her crotch on mine. I was super uncomfortable and I do remember trying to put some toilet paper in between us but she took it off and said that wasn't right. 

I can't really remember much else after that. This only happened one time and I guess I didn't really know what to make of this experience. I did feel so embarrassed and ashamed every time I thought about this but I am not sure if this counts as being molested or not? Do little girls molest other little girls? I am not sure what to think.

I thought this might be a better place than relationships/relationship advice seeing as I'm not interested in anyone at the moment and aren't looking for anyone, it's more about me.

* I'm 20, female, British
* I've lost 2 stone in the last year and am now a healthy weight
* I rarely get male attention
* I've had a rough few months and have been depressed and pretty much every aspect of my life has changed in the last year
* Things still keep going wrong and it seems like I'll never be happy and nothing will go right
* My first boyfriend ended up nearly abusing me and pretty much threatened to sexually assault/rape me so I left him. I was with him for just under 3 years. 
* After leaving him my sex drive was low and I struggled at the idea of trusting guys to be intimate with me
* A male friend who I thought was the nicest guy in the world told me that he liked me. He was very inexperienced. We got quite far quite soon. But then he kept changing his mind then dumped me. I felt kinda used and the reasons he gave for not liking me lowered my confidence.
* Other things that he and others have said have knocked my confidence. Plus they said that I'm the opposite of all the things that I'm happy about myself - personality and physically. So now there's nothing I like about myself
* I'm a nervous wreck. I'm scared that guys will either say they like me then use me and dump me ... or if they stick around, they'll turn out to be like my first boyfriend. 
* I have even less interest in sex than the time between seeing those two guys. But I just want someone to love me. But who wants to love a nervous wreck especially one that there's nothing to like about? I feel unlovable. 
* Before when I've been single I've not had much confidence/hope, but now I've got virtually none. And before there were things I liked about myself, that I hoped guys would see in me and like.

I have no idea what advice/support anyone can give me. Maybe one of you has felt this way before. I hope someone has something to say that helps. It's a bit of a getting things off my chest post. I've been to counselling about all of my problems including the way my first boyfriend treated me and its just made me feel worse about everything.

t3_26c5vk,Confused about a sexual experience that happened a couple of months ago.,"So when this incidence happened, I was a freshman in college coming home for winter break.  I was at work when a former coworker came in, and we got to talking and he invited me to hang with him and three or four other mutual friends that we shared.  I accepted, and was expecting to catch a movie with him and three other girlfriends of mine.  He texted me later that night and said that none of them could come, so I suggested that we go to a house party that was going on instead.  *I found out later that he actually already knew none of them would be able at the time that he invited me to hang out with all of them...the first thing that pissed me off about that night.*

This is where the trouble began.  Let me preface this by stating that we previously had a strictly friend based relationship- I never so much as flirted with the guy, and never indicated I was looking for anything sexual.  So we go to the party together and because I knew and trusted everyone there, I got shitfaced.  I hadn't been that drunk all year, and ended up puking into the toilet and unknown amount of times.  I remeber him looking in once or twice while I was puking and asking if I was okay, but that was about it.  Next thing I know I've somehow made it to a bedroom (I believe he carried me) and we are lying in bed together.  I was feeling incredibly dizzy and ill, so I didn't mind this.  I finally get to bed, and wake up to him feeling me up/kissing me.  This is not okay. I was asleep, and had given no indications that I wanted anything sexual from him previously.  However- I get turned on.  I consider myself a very sexual person, especially when drunk.  I admit that when he first started feeling me up I was very confused as to what was happening, but after a while I was participating in the acts.  To further complicate things, I never said no or asked him to stop, and willingly gave him a blowjob.  I am so confused as to whether I can even feel upset over this.  I never want to be the girl that gets drunk and sleeps with someone, and then regrets it the next morning and blames the other person.  To be fair, he had been drinking as well (but was no where near as drunk). 

I just want to hear others input on this.  Should I be upset about it?  I feel unjustified due to the fact I never actually asked him to stop and he could have interpreted my involvement as everything being a-okay.  But at the same time, he knew I was far more intoxicated than him and never asked it it was okay. Please give me your opinions, I just want this off my chest and hear what others think about it because I have received mixed comments from a few friends.

But I told someone only recently. This happened a year ago. This guy got really violent and I was terrified. I was able to get away after some difficulties, but I also let him get away. I feel awful. He's still going to that school and he could have done this to other girls and could still be doing it because I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyway.

However the organization decided to give the internship to me and one other person so now we are working half the time and each making half as much as we thought. This is not what is upsetting me.

I am upset because this person is a year younger than me, in the same program I am at university and seems completely unperturbed by the fact that he now has to share an internship. He sent his resume to me which apparently we were supposed to send to each other and I feel incredibly inadequate. I've been through student teaching, more coursework, had more time in the classroom and lesson planning, yet his resume and the fact that we both got the internship makes me feel like none of that matters. He's only a junior and already has done more than I have as someone who graduated and will be doing my Master's year. 

So this rambling may be confusing but the bottom line is that this person bugs me and I have to work with them.

t3_26c4tc,[Triggers] How should I go about telling the guy I'm dating that I was molested when I was younger?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So when I [22F] was about four or five I was molested by a ride attendant when I got lost at a theme park. Charges were never pressed because I didn't even realize what had happened to me until I was much, much older (about fourteen/fifteen). I've only told two people about it, my best friend and my ex-boyfriend.

So I met this amazing, awesome guy at college this January. Let's call him Jared. Jared and I clicked immediately, but because I had a boyfriend, we became fast friends and drinking buddies. We did a lot of stuff together and eventually I began to develop feelings for him. I broke up with my boyfriend (for various other reasons not pertaining to Jared), and now Jared and I have been dating for a while.

I am seriously crushing on this guy and I can see the potential for a long, long relationship with him. I told my last boyfriend about it when we were both quite drunk and he was very accepting and loving. 

I'd just like your advice, ladies. The only two times I've told people in person about this was when I was hammered. Should I continue this trend? It seems a lot easier to talk about it when I'm not sober. How should I even bring it up? It doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can just throw into conversation.

t3_26d7ng,I can't sleep without my SO- what the hell is wrong with me?,"I've lived with my SO for a few years now, we moved across the country together and have a generally great, loving relationship.

However, ever since we moved in, I can't sleep without him.

I generally consider myself independent, feminist, etc, would do just fine without a man, etc, but it's really late for me and I am tired and upset because my man is out.

When he's going away for a while, it's no problem- I just make an effort to have an extra relaxing evening before going to bed. And when I go away without him, I generally have no problem getting to sleep on my own anywhere outside of our home.

The problem comes in with spontaneous nights out. Tonight we were with friends, and some of our group split off. I was feeing a little unwell and decided to use the opportunity to head home and get to bed early, he was going to go on to the next bar. I had in my head that it would only be an hour or so; it's about four hours later now. He's posting on social media about how much fun he's having with his friend. 

I feel like it's too late at night and I'm too tired to control my emotions. I'm PISSED at him for leaving me alone in this insomnia. It feels like I'm paying the price for his night out (I never sleep in and physically can't, so I will feel awful tomorrow) without any of the fun. At the same time, though, it feels like I don't have the right to ask him to give up going out with friends at night. I'm a homebody and it's not his fault that my nervous system is screwed up like this.

I'm 18, and live about 500 miles from home due to college, This Memorial Day weekend, I'd had to travel back to my hometown to participate in a trial. The trial to try and find my rapist guilty of raping me five years ago.

Yes, five years. Which made me 13 at the time. I don't much like talking about it, but I'll give you a small run down.

I went to a little get together with my big sister and friend. None of us were drinking any type of alcohol. But I guess I hadn't been watching my drink close enough. I started to feel extremely sick and went outside with my friend, who then ran back inside to get my sister. The last thing I remember is getting grabbed.

Fast forward five years. I get a call, and it's the court system. Apparently, it took the hospital and police 5 years to put the rape kit through, get the information, and finally tell someone (thanks guys). And they found the guy who did it. He was one of my best friends. So I fly down for the trial and he's finally found guilty.

I'll be honest, I thought seeing him would be a major trigger, but it was actually more closure. Yeah, I felt threatened and scared, but after the case was finished and he was gone, I sat down and cried. Cried in relief that he was finally gone, there was no more threat of that same man coming back, and I'm finally rid of the grief I'd been carrying for five years.

t3_26e63f,I'm 24 and have never successfully used a tampon machine -- and I don't think I'm in the minority,"I realized at work last week, after taking out a tampon in the bathroom, that my stash in my purse had been depleted. So, no big deal, I figured -- there's a machine in all the women's bathrooms for 10-cent tampons. But after trying to stick a dime in the slot for probably a full two minutes (it was as if the slot was blocked, but there's was no ""out of order"" or ""empty"" sign), I gave up and head to the other bathroom, where the tampon machine does have an ""out of order sign.""

It brought back teenage memories of desperately trying to stick a quarter in those weird crank machines and failing, or realizing with dismay that there isn't one in a bathroom at all -- if I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure my ALL-GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL didn't have tampon machines in the bathrooms.

Because I never could figure those machines out, over time I just got used to always being prepared, or being comfortable with just asking a friend for one. I Googled ""how to use tampon machine"" today, and there's nothing but videos of young girls being confused and message board posts with a bunch of ""Hm, I dunno, never use em"" replies.

What the hell?! Isn't this the equivalent of a men's bathroom without a urinal? I'm guessing these shitty machines are never addressed because women don't feel comfortable complaining about them to management.

I jogged to the side as close to the grass as I could. I mis-judged my footing and tripped on the sidewalks edge a little bit. Of course I tripped and whispered ""whoops!"" right as the girls were passing me.





They started laughing and snickering at me. As I fast-walked away I heard them talking about how funny I looked as I fell. I turned around to look at them and one of them was doing an exaggerated fall on the sidewalk. I almost ALMOST said something. One of them looks back at me and says ""OMG she's looking at us"". 




Who the heck is teaching these girls respect anymore? Whatever happened to empathy? If someone had tripped in front of me I would have at least asked if they were ok or something polite instead of being a bully about it.

t3_26dhz2,Not technically cheating but yet...,"Throwaway because SO is a redditor.

Hi TwoX, sorry for this wall of text and any errors due to being on mobile but I just need some help. A couple days ago, I was looking on my bf's computer and noticed his Facebook was up. I looked to see who he was recently chatting with and saw a girl's name I had not heard him mention before. Their chat was full of sexually explicit things (sexual talk, telling each other how good the other one looked, all that fun shit). I was immediately in shock mode and all of these scenarios ran through my mind. When he got home, I confronted him. He sat me down and told me that this was a girl he had met online when he was 18 (he's 26), never in person, and was never intending to meet her. He said it was a moment of nostalgia and a narcissistic need to build up his low self esteem, that it was nice to feel that someone else found him attractive. It was not an ongoing online relationship and had only happened that night. He also said that, after immediately typing all of that out to her, he felt horrible and guilty and was intending to never talk to her again. He realized that he's not an 18 year old guy anymore and actually has someone who truly cares about him. He was upfront about everything, answered all my questions, never pushed blame solely on her or turned it around on me, assured me that he had never physically cheated on me or spoke with other girls online like this, and blocked her on everything. He kept telling me that I'm the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with, that I'm perfect, I'm ""it"" for him, and he's going to do whatever it takes to build my trust back up. It seems like he truly feels awful and terrified that he's on the verge of losing me.
I know this would not be considered by some to be cheating and is not as terrible as many of the stories on this sub, but it still feels like betrayal. This is exacerbated by the fact that he knew I had been cheated on before and that I struggle with self esteem and trust issues. I had completely trusted him and he's been nothing but amazing. He does everything for my daughter and I, we have an active sex life, has been supportive of me through everything and every day has always made me feel loved and beautiful. This is the man I want to share my life with, we have a home together, and the thought of not having him seems worse than this. Yet there's still something in the back of my mind telling me that if he truly loved me he wouldn't have hurt me like this, that I don't deserve this and deserve someone who would not even think about doing this to me. I'm still hurt and having a hard time coping. Even though I've been going back and forth, I think ultimately want to fix this and not throw away what we have. I guess what I want from this community are similar stories, advice, and people to tell me how I can move on from this and fix our relationship. ",11,20140524083742,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26e9qz,[TW:disordered eating] Chasing perfection has brought me to this point,"The internet is full of rants like this. I hope you forgive me for posting it anyway. My mother is coming to see me (we haven't seen each other for a long time) and I am getting a mild panic attack.  There is no one I can talk to about this and I really need to get this off my chest. 

I'm in my early 20s, but I feel like I am 70. There are days when I can barely manage to drag myself out of bed, because I am exhausted. My periods are a mess. I'm deficient in nutrients. My hair has fallen out. My teeth are covered in stomach acid burns. 

For the past 12 years, I've been chasing what our society calls “the perfect female body”. I received excellent instructions in this deadly game from my mother, who never hesitated to explain to me in great detail how hard life is for a fat woman in our society. Food was about humiliation and shame, every meal, every day, every week. I will never forget how once, when at a relative's house, I asked permission to have one more serving of chicken, she looked at me with a face of utter disgust and told me that I've had more than enough. 

 At age 10 we were counting calories together, drinking protein shakes and exercising every day. Then on the weekends she would get a fit of guilt and bake huge amounts of sweets and cakes and, I, of course would gobble them up. 
By high school, I was obese by all standards. The school nurse and doctor would routinely sigh when looking at my charts and give me weight loss pamplets. At home, whenever I bloated out of yet another dress size, my mother would scream, force me to take off my clothes and exercise while she supervised me. 

Fast forward a few years and I discovered bingeing and purging. For the first time in years, my weight plumetted. My mother was elated. Doctors applauded me for finally being a normal size. I smiled and nodded, thinking to myself “If only all of you knew, how I got here”.
But along with the weight, I lost my mental health. I was always paranoid of blocking the sink or clogging the drains. Once, after being forced to eat dinner, I took a walk outside and purged in the snow, hoping that no one would hear me.   My hair fell out and I would spend sleepless nights staring at the ceiling, because my chest hurt from vomiting. I had no energy to focus on my school work and nearly failed high school. On the day of my graduation, I was too weak and ashamed to get out of bed. So my mother bought me cake, which I ate and purged alone. 

I clung to the hope that things would get better once I go to college, but the constant threat of becoming fat did not go away. Before leaving me at my dorm, my mother bought me a scale and told me not to gain weight. I did anyway. The academic stress and pressure caused my to gain a dress size. My mother pursed her lips when I came home for Christmas break and told me, “You were so thin when you graduated high school.” If only she knew what losing that weight had cost me. 

I returned to college for my sophomore year and began exercising multiple times a day and eating as little as I could get by on. At nights, when the cravings kicked in, I ran to ACME and binged on unspeakable amounts of food. I knew by heart all of the secluded bathrooms in the school buildings where no one would hear me binge. By now, spells of dizziness and entire days spent in bed exhausted from exercise where the norm. I began skipping classes to binge and purge. Along with all this madness, came an endless cycle of stress injuries from sports. But I just couldn't stay away from the college gym, where girls with perfect bodies and smiling boyfriends ran on the treadmill while watching the Barefoot Contessa stir chocolate sauce on the Food Network (another masochistic perversion). Again, my mother carted me to one doctor after another ( because, gasp, I would gain so much weight if I couldn't continue exercising). I was told weight loss might help. Sure, I said. Sure. 

Now, I wake up every day feeling tired. When I get up my heart races and my head feels dizzy. I spend hours at the supermarket staring at food labels. Have I been good enough to deserve this amount of calories today? Should I? Should I not? I don't have many friends, because friends mean eating out and I can't do that. I sometimes find blood clots in my spit, my teeth have dark stains and my periods are completely out of whack. Everything I eat causes digestive problems; gas, bloating, nasty burps and diarrhea. I don't want to go to the doctor's anymore, because I am not “thin enough” to have an eating disorder. I am usually told that losing weight will solve all of my problems. Indeed. 

I just wish that no little girl would have to grow up to be me; the 20 year old woman, with a frail worn-out body. But I know that's not true. One everning when I was at ACME stuffing my basket with cookies, I heard a little girl, no more than 10 or 11, walking in the aisle with her mother. She was happily rattling off the calories of every product on the shelf. “We won't eat this, because it's got X amount of calories, right mommy?” And the mother nodded. I stood in the aisle long after they left, still staring at the cookies and crying.

t3_26dyaw,"Trying To Face My Past and Living With PTSD, I Found This And It Made Me Want To Vomit [TW: Sexual Abuse]","I was sexually abused as a child by this man. He was an older teen at the time.

I'm constantly trying to live a normal life, and recently I found the courage to tell my brother what happened to me. I didn't say who, but I did say that I was about 7 (It's hard to be precise with no one else to confirm details like this). My family has known for a long time that I have secrets, I started displaying severe PTSD symptoms around 13-14 and was diagnosed at 17. My understanding is that they believe whatever happened to me, happened around the time I started going off the rails, and I let them believe whatever they want to. It's easier that way. I have so many repressed memories that even I am unable to say exactly what happened. Sometimes I wonder if my brain made the whole thing up. But then why do I have these horrifying fragmented memories? Why do I leave the room when his name is brought up in conversation? Why is it so difficult to speak of aloud and on the very few occasions I have, my tears were uncontrollable?

So I'm trying to find out where he has ended up, if he is in jail, what part of the country, etc. Mostly hoping that he is safely in jail. Wondering if he's hurt anyone else.

I found an online article about a crime I knew he had committed, it is not recent, and it's so sympathetic it made me feel physically ill and I wanted to share my frustration. He tried to hold up a store with a syringe filled with blood. He went to jail for it, and this article talks about how he was 'sent away to live with his grandparents' and 'rejected by family'. Sob stories.

Yes, he was raised by grandparents. Who were strict but loving. He displayed disturbing behaviour from a young age, including tricking my brother into getting in a toybox, locking him inside and leaving him there. For fun.

He was into drugs and petty crime as soon as he was old enough to sneak out. He stole from his grandparents and staged burglaries and sold their possessions.

The family tried to help him. He went and stayed with other relatives in a different area to get him away from the criminals he hung out with. He found new ones instead. Throughout, drugs and crime were a common theme.

Eventually he went back to the grandparents. The behaviour continued. He would taunt his elderly grandmother, pulling faces, mouthing things behind his grandfathers head and denying he was doing anything. She became incredibly distressed and became very thin and unwell. He never once showed any remorse for any actions. Although once he was seen to gift some very angry male relatives a bottle of whiskey at a family christmas to sweeten them up.

Eventually, extended family deemed him beyond help and dangerous to the grandmothers health. He was sent away and told not come back unless he changed his ways and became a productive member of society. That was in the early 00's.

Reading this article, and seeing all the 'he never had a chance' bullshit absolutely sickens me. He had every chance and wasn't interested. All he ever wanted to do was have his fun at the expense of others. You could tell he enjoyed it, got off on it. You could see it in his eyes.

How do you deal with it when someone you know and see only as a monster, is treated so sympathetically? How can some lame-ass online 'journalist' write a biased article being soft on some guy who pulls out a syringe full of his own blood on a retail worker? Oh he wanted cash to 'get away', did he? Bull fucking shit. He wanted more drugs.

I need a hug and a stiff drink. This article has really upset me, even if it is 9 years old.

:(


Edit: I had to remove the link to the article. Sorry mods.

t3_26e6x9,"A friend kissed me last night without my permission, and I am in a relationship. I feel the entire spectrum of emotions right now.","This happened last night and I am filled with confusing emotions.

I am away on business (my job requires weekly travel), and my collegues and I decided to end a long day with a drink. A (male) friend of mine (let's call him X) shot me a text saying he was also in town, so of course I invite him along.

After bar closure we decide pizza and drinks at the hotel would be a fun way to prolong the evening, which was going fantastically. We have a few local friends over for a slice and some laughs. X says he needs to get going because his flight home was in the morning. I thought it was also time I hit the hay as the long day and the alcohol was kicking in. So we leave my collegue's room together. I was just down the hall and as I go for the hug goodbye, X lunges in for the kiss.

I was stunned, in shock, then pushed him away saying ""This is NOT okay."" I was oddly calm at first, then a fiery anger took hold of me. ""What the hell do you think you're doing? What makes you think this is okay?"" Then the aftershock of tears poured out ""What the hell man? You're my friend! You can't just do that! I have a boyfriend! You KNOW my boyfriend! What the hell am I supposed to tell him now??"" Then I took a step back and tried reasonning it out. ""Listen I think you're a great guy but I'm in a relationship that I am not willing to compromise..""

In the mean time X look guilt-ridden and blubbers out ""I'm so incredibly in love with you. I just.. I want you so bad. I'm sorry... I'm really sorry.... you're so incredible and mean the world to me and please don't be upset I'm sorry.....""

I told him I couldn't deal with this right now and needed time to deal with what had just happened.

This morning I feel stupid. I knew this guy had some attraction to me as it had been mentionned in the past ""Your boyfriend is a lucky man, you're such a catch. I envy him."" Etc etc. I feel like I should have had a bigger guard up. I feel betrayed from a friend; He made a move I was not okay with, without my permission. I feel loss at our friendship as I don't know if I'll ever be able to face him alone (and we had been close friends). I feel anger at him crossing the line. I feel guilt at having betrayed my boyfriend, whether you consider it my fault or not. I feel sadness at not being able to provide my friend with the love he direly wants (as odd as it sounds, I feel bad for him, and he just got out of an abusive relationship). In an alternate reality we may have ended up together; He is someone I really care about and he was good to me as I was to him, but I have been in a long term relationship as long as we have known eachother. And I had drawn the line very clearly in the past because I am in love with my boyfriend and I would do anything to protect the relationship, but a side of me can't blame X for wondering the ""what ifs"" because I had thought about it too; I just never dreamed of acting on it. (Rereading this paragraph I realize it's all over the place but honestly I don't know how to make heads or tails of these thoughts and it's hard to word them out.)

I called my boyfriend and he took it like a champ. He is happy I stood my ground and makes nothing more of it that I had the oppertunity to cheat on him and did not take it. Although I appreciate his non-chalance and his support, I am still in a turmoil of emotions.

Sorry for the wall of text TwoX, but I need someone to help talk me through what I should be feeling and handling this situation. I feel anger, loss, sadness, hurt, betrayal, filthy, guilty, gross and confused.

It was only a kiss, how did it end up like this?",0,20140524140910,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26dtbw,"Let me know what you think of my poem, reddit :)","Hey reddit!

I wrote this poem a while back and was curious how it would be received by others. I'm no actual poet by any means, but when inspired, I do occasionally love to write poetry and other forms of creative writing.

This poem is dedicated to my current boyfriend, and it describes the process of falling in love again after having been in love before, somewhat soon after ending another serious relationship with the man I used to think I loved. 

Because I am a dancer and have a serious passion for movement and music, I compare the two relationships to songs and note their similarities. This was inspired by the fact that at many points in my current relationship, I couldn't help but be intrigued by some of the things that both men did.

This poem was inspired by a single moment when I experienced a relationship ""deja vu"". I was sitting at a restaurant with my current boyfriend, realizing that exactly a year ago, for the exact same event (after my ballet show), I was there with my ex, and I experienced a sudden revelation of how lucky I was to have moved on from the pain of that relationship and promptly into another with a man I never could have even imagined existed. I realized what a better place I am in my life and how happy I was to learn that there was a rainbow at the end of that storm in my life.

I noticed striking similarities between my ex and my current boyfriend, but also discuss the important differences that explain why my current relationship has been so incredibly wonderful. As I describe in the poem, it's just like the moment when you hear a song you LOVE for the first time, and cannot stop listening to it. Suddenly, any other song you hear pales by comparison, and your whole world is changed from the beauty of this song. 

Enjoy!









And here we go again...

The sweetest deja vu you'll ever taste

Broken record? Almost, but not a note goes to waste

The most beautiful sound I forgot could be true;

The melody begins again, don't I know this tune?




You see, I've heard this song a few times before...



Danced in its glory, even begging for more

But little did I know as a queen (yet to) bee

That old song wasn't quite right, no, just wasn't the one for me



And now I'm sitting here with that devilish smile, for a reason you might never know


How I once sat here rocking to a different beat, right here, just a year ago


And the sweet sound beings again, different notes, but a similar beat

Without thinking, I let my body dictate the course of movement it craves to meet


You said you didn't like to dance, but with a dose of my venom, here you are

Dancing with me like there's no tomorrow

I never dreamt we could make it this far


Many of the old notes repeat, but now, it just feels so right

I may not be a synesthesiac, but your words taste unbearably bright


And every time the song progresses, 

The beat carries on, the notes repeat

But this song is different, 

since I have yet to grow tired of the sounds you bring to my feet


Most songs run their course, they have their hey day, 'til the DJ finds something new...

But your song to me is immortal, 

forever spontaneous,

t3_26difh,22[F] about to make a huge mistake leaving her 23[M] and I want to help her stop before its too late!,"So my friend is having boy troubles and, as a man, I don't know what to tell her.  From all my experiences with them, he always seemed like a really nice guy.  He is the best boyfriend.  I don't really like to go into *why* he's a nice boyfriend because the list goes on.  Really just a good dude.

Now for my friend.  She's fickle, whimsical, unnerved easily, and insecure.  I know her very well.  She likes to sleep with random guys on the weekends (when shes single) and she likes to... ahem... party.  Shes sexually liberated (which I love ;)) and she is a really fun girl but has her own issues too.  Anyways, here's the issue.

Her boyfriend is currently taking classes at the uni near where we both lived.  My friend, let's call her Claire, already graduated but is younger than the guy.  She's now studying for her CPA test and concurrently getting experience at her firm.  She's really growing into her own fast.  The guy on the other hand, lets call him Dave, is younger than her and still going to school.

Claire's parents are always making this fact known to her on a constant basis.  Everytime she calls them up now, it seems, they always argue about her boyfriend still trying to figure out what he wants to do in life -- which is totally not true, he's just juggling full time work, a kid, and school all at once while trying to hold down a relationship (and by the way hes doing an amazing job).

Anyways, shes ready to leave him.  Says he's a deadbeat, this and that, says he's going nowhere.  I keep telling her ""That's your parents' insecurity talking"" and that she should ""look at it through her own lense"" (Because she's a photographer too, get it? i thought it was clever).

She's never had problems with the guy before and she really loves his kid.  He likes her a lot and confided in me that he wanted to marry her and that he's currently saving up for a ring.  I personally thought it was a bad idea on his part because there is so much about her he still doesn't know but hey, who am I to judge?  He probably knows her way more than I think he does.  So you can imagine my issue with her decision to leave him.  I want them to be together because I know he is the only one who can... ahem... take care of her.  And also he's just a really good dude and as far as I know, has done nothing but been the best boyfriend.

So I turn to you, ladies (and gents), What do I tell my friend Claire in order for her to understand her terrible decision?",0,20140524084536,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I always though feminists were women who didnt shave their armpits, hated men and were possibly lesbians. I even thought feminism was shameful. Now I see that my feelings weren't my own fault but they were caused by the world. I was taught that I should sit down in my box and keep my mouth shut.
Last year I had a class, ironically it was with a professor I absolutely hated. It was Women's History Month and he was telling us about a poetry reading we should attend. He asked this class ""who here considers themselves a feminist?"". NOBODY raised their hand except for him. The class was about 10 females and 20 males. He was shocked that not even the girls raised their hands. 
He explained feminism in a way that I had never heard it before. He said he was a feminist because he wanted women to be treated as equals to men. He wanted them to have equal pay. He was deeply offended by slut shaming and stereotypes. He wanted women to be able to go out and have a career and not feel guilty about it. 
Once he said all that, I knew I was a feminist. I wanted a family and a husband, but I also wanted a career and I did not want a minivan. Nobody could make me feel bad about that!",48,20140524181803,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

I am for the most part fine with this, as there most certainly are other women there, but there are still few enough women that any person of unknown gender is referred to as ""he"".

Unfortunately, there seem to be a few people in some communities who have started taking some pills of a certain high-wavelength color. this has manifested as discussion about how men have are evolved to work and compete, while women are naturally programmed to be subservient, and other, similar things that you expect to see from that ideology. Luckily, the general community response typically varies from ""no, you're wrong, and here's why"" and a few people becoming involved in a gigantic flamewar with the pill swallower, to an overwhelming ""take you bigotry and GTFO"".

Old guys hit on me all the time and I flirt back a bit and humor them, mostly because I almost always never took them seriously. Well things quickly turned wrong. He started getting really explicit and nasty. At this point I froze up. Suddenly I wasn't talking much, because I didn't know what to say. 

He took that as an insult I guess, and he got mad and started telling me I needed a boob job, as well as several other mean things about my body.

Normally if I was on my own I'd just ignore him, but as my boyfriend was with me this time I had the courage to shout back, basically telling him to fuck off.

What really bothered me though was that this was a busy thoroughfare in London and not one person batted an eye at this kind of behaviour. It may not have been especially abusive or aggressive but it still made me incredibly uncomfortable and more than a little intimidated (having social anxiety anyway makes walking down the street stressful enough at times). It's almost like that kind of behaviour is deemed as acceptable.",4,20140525035831,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26gk80,A friend/coworker was arrested for lewd molestation of a young girl and I'm really bothered by how people are reacting...[Rant],"So, a guy I've worked with for about 6 years was arrested at the beginning of this week. The only official information that anyone knows is that he took a 14 year old girl shopping and wanted her to try on swimsuits, then took her to his apartment where he began to touch her after giving her some alcoholic drinks. She got uncomfortable and called her mom, and walked to a different location, and he texted her after she left saying ""You need to call me, what happens next could be potentially very important."" 

Now, this guy is 27 and has always been socially awkward, but overall liked among our coworkers and friends. I'm really bothered by everyone's reactions though. It seems like when it's come up, the majority of people agree that he shouldn't have touched her, but that she was probably asking for it, and she shouldn't have been hanging out with him, and that she shouldn't have been drinking etc. I feel bad for the guy, I do. But I don't feel that it's ok for justify that by blaming a child. And I'm becoming really disappointed with my circle of friends. ",281,20140525130641,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26geme,"""So,"" he asks, ""why have you gotten so fat?""","So last night after the BBQ that I went to, I had a quite unpleasant experience. 

I am friends with a married couple. The wife was my professor in undergrad. She and her husband are people I like a lot. They're both about 9 and 12 years older than me respectively. I've been living at home since I moved back after getting my Masters and their place has been mostly a welcoming refuge. 

Last night however, my professor friend went to bed early. I and her husband were finishing out drinks in the kitchen. He is like an older brother to me. We were talking about I don't even remember what and he comes out with ""So, why have you gotten fat?""

**Why have you gotten fat?**

Typically I appreciate blunt talk. This guy specializes in blunt forthrightness. But goddamn he might as well have stabbed me. I have gained a lot of weight in the past few years, for a variety of reasons. I feel absolutely horrible about myself and extremely ashamed of what I've become. To have him say something like this, even though I don't think he meant to hurt me, was like a confirmation that I am indeed as disgusting looking as I thought.

I wanted to leave on the spot but I had had a few drinks and had already planned to stay at their house in the guest room. He started asking why I let myself get so fat, what my hangup was, etc etc. I just felt totally ambushed. I wanted to die and have the earth swallow me up. I sat out on the back porch for awhile and contemplated just hopping the fence and running away. Instead I slept in the guest room and when I woke up about 6am I made my bed, grabbed my stuff and beat it out of there. I didn't wanna see either of them.

I don't even know how to feel. His words are echoing on a constant loop in my head. I'm supposed to be hanging out with them and another girlfriend tomorrow. Now I'm not even sure that I want to go.

Maybe I'm being foolish. I just wanted to share.",131,20140525115936,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26g7qb,I can't stop crying...,"Let's talk Period business. I've been living under the red tide curse for a solid seven or eight years now. Through the highs, lows, droughts and flash floods, I have remained emotionally stable. I've never craved chocolate, never cried, never spent the day in bed watching '80's rom-coms. 

Well, I never had....before last night. My day started out like a typical Saturday. Wake up early, head into work all day... It was around 1pm when my emotions decided to reign down like the new age apocalypse right in the middle of the testosterone fest that is the break room. Stemming from some texts from my boyfriend, every sense within me was heightened, angry, frustrated and hurt. I began crying. But, not just crying - I was sobbing. Where is the freaking life boat?! Someone save me from my own tears.

A few hours later, I hadn't heard from my boyfriend much more. He was having a busy day, while I was slow at work. What happened? More tears. ""Why doesn't he love me??!? Doesn't he want to talk to me?? Does he even like me anymore.... maybe he is planning on breaking up with me.""

I get home from work, climb into my bed and cry until it hurts. Then I wipe my nose, and head out for a 10 mile bike jaunt around the neighborhood. Cruising past houses lit up by a busy kitchen, or men returning home from work to happy wives, I started crying again. ""Will I ever have happiness like that? I just want to be a happy wife... I was a want happy... What if I never have a happy life? Am I doomed to hell forever?""

Back home. I made a stop at the grocery store and picked up a pint of Ben and Jerry's to try and soothe my hurting soul. I can't say the ribbons of fudge or marshmallowy chocolate ice cream helped at all. The taste felt raw and meaningless in my mouth. Netflix loaded up, I seduced myself with an 80's flick 'Terms of Endearment', ate my ice cream, and quickly drew bored before shutting off the computer, lights, and brain.

I think it was 2 hours of tossing and turning before I finally fell asleep. This is all mixed between tears, and tears, and more tears. I pondered the questions of: Why does my boyfriend not like me? Why am I doomed to a life of shit? and When will things ever change? None of which are questions I would ever consider in my right brain. 

I remember at one point, my boyfriend sent me a one word text. I believe it was a simple ""lol""...I read it and instantly burst into tears. WHY DOESNT HE WANT TO TALK TO ME?! I let the anger surge through my veins before my exhausted eyes decided to put the phone away for the night and attempt sleep.

But here I am.... I get the drama of being on your period.

I get it, I finally get it. I get the emotional shit storm that is otherwise known as ""the period"". For all the years of unspent emotions - they sure are spending themselves now!",62,20140525103304,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26g994,My 65 year old boss told me (20) that he loved me on the last day of work. Rant sorry -_-,"I'm a 2nd year engineering student, and part of my degree involves taking 4 month co-op jobs in a relevant field. So I just finished my 2nd work term, and on the last day, my 65 year old project manager sat me down in a meeting room and said some shit like ""now he can tell me what he couldn't say before"" and told me he loved me and that he was ""surprised I made my way into his heart"". Then he gave me a scarf and said ""I imagined you'd look good in this scarf. My imagination is rarely wrong"". At this point I felt totally creeped out and disgusted, but I sorta just smiled and nodded politely. Maybe he was just being a sentimental old man right?


He drives me home a lot, because I live on the same route he takes, and we work the same hours. So on the last day, he asked to drive me home again. I was kinda feeling iffy about it, because of what happened earlier, so I tried to stall by saying goodbye to everyone. He waited almost 45 minutes, after I kept telling him it's okay, I can just take the bus. So I pretty much had to get in his car. 


We made small talk, and he asked me what I was going to do that night. I told him I was going to play Age of Empires with my best friend, and his response was ""... I wish I could be there, but oh well..."" I went home and I tried so hard to tell myself that he was just a sentimental old man and didn't have any creepy intentions, but in the back of my head I knew something was wrong. I broke down and cried to my boyfriend for like an hour. I'm so glad he didn't do anything physical in the car. thinking back, I shouldn't have accepted that ride with him. 


I actually feel so grossed out and violated. My entire 4 month work term just feels wrong now, if I think about him thinking whatever thoughts about me. He's always commented on how nice my nails are, and how well I dress. It's so horrible that women in male dominated fields have to put up with this sort of implied harassment. I talked to a coworker about my creepy boss, and she told me that a coworker from her old job grabbed her boobs on the last week of school. And then I was talking to a classmate who was also working in a similar job, and a 30 year old married coworker kept asking her if she would date him if he wasn't married. 


These sort of unwelcome advances are more common than people think, especially in fields like engineering or computer science. It's so sad that young women who go into these fields have to put up with this shit from older coworkers or bosses, and can't do anything about it. Often people talk about physical sexual harassment and rape, but sexually implied verbal harassment hurts too. It makes you feel violated and dirty. I tell my male friends about this, and they're all so surprised that these things happen. They'll rarely experience a female boss hitting on them or a unwelcome female coworker grabbing their crotch. It's very unfortunate that women have to deal with this shit. ",16,20140525105233,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26gt3x,Need advice on how to help my cousin.,"A little background: we were born 5 months apart and spent the majority of our childhood together. My parents spent every single weekend at her parents house and we were pretty much sisters up until 14 years of age. (She also spent a good deal of her freshman year of HS in and out of mental wards, although hospitalization was probably overkill on her parents part.) Her parents went through a wicked divorce that caused a rift in the family and her and I ended up fighting over a guy and not speaking to each other for three years. We have since reconnected in a big way, we talk all the time on the phone and we see each other during the summer. The problem is, she lives in Hawaii and I live on the East Coast. 

Now for what happened. I got a couple of texts from her this morning that scared the shit out of me. ""I'm in a bad way, I just want you to know I love you, thank you for being there for me."" There is a huge time difference so it was 6am her time when I got these texts. I didn't want to wake her up so I just waited and she texted me about an hour ago. Apparently she got into a drunken fight with her boyfriend last night and yelled and hit him and according to her ""acted like a psycho.""  She doesn't know where her and her boyfriend stand. I suggested therapy but she doesn't want that. Right now she is just really depressed. ""I'm a horrible person, I wish I could crawl into a hole a die,  nothing I can do to fix it, I wish it had never happened..."" etc etc. I've been trying just to talk her down and tell her that she isn't a horrible person and that even good people make mistakes. Other than that, I have no idea how to help her. And I know she needs help. Hitting your SO isn't okay, no matter what the circumstances are. Being drunk is no excuse. She doesn't want to break up with her boyfriend and it seems like he doesn't want to break up either. 

I love this girl and I want to do anything I can to help her, which obviously isn't much because I'm so far away. Normally I'm good with advice but I'm at a total loss here. Anyone with experience have any advice on how I can help her?",13,20140525145626,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26gbtg,"Badgering someone into sex... consensual but kinda icky, or non-consent, or...?","This is sorta complicated, but basically my ex-boyfriend and I have a history where we've tried being friends, FWB, then friends again, and whatever. Last month I explicitly told him that we weren't going to have sex ever again. The next time I saw him and we hung out, he spent most of the time asking me over and over and over to make out with him/have sex. I told him no each time, until finally I caved in. 

He's actually done this many times, where I'll say no and he'll keep asking until finally I just give in. But each time I feel really reluctant/uncomfortable/gross afterward. I'm trying to figure out, in my own head, whether I should be angry at myself for caving in (which is weirdish because I cave in because I feel guilty for saying no), or if I'm just overreacting, or what.

I guess my question is, if someone consistently badgers you by asking you to have sex with them over and over, how would you define that experience consent-wise (from a moral, not legal standpoint)? ",11,20140525112449,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

  He's always been creepy, talking about which days you had off that week, what color shirt you were wearing the other day, etceterA. But lately, oh lately he's been stepping up his creep game and pushing his creep boundaries. Standing almost completely on the line asking the new girl when she's getting off, making drinks and asking the cashier girls to try it- walking around the restaurant looking for us on out breaks and touching a coworkers back last night.

   Management has, on several occasions told him he's not allowed to talk to us on our breaks, much less come find us to do so. They're all aware of his recent behavior but do nothing about it other than say ""no Glenn"" our general manager is tired of talking to him and is hardly ever around even if he would do something about it. Glenn doesn't bother the assistant managers and they're apathetic about his behavior. 
 
 It's not okay too feel creeped out by guests at work, and I have rights as an employee- but what do we do when nobody can be bothered to enforce those rights? What do we do about Glenn?

I do have things that like turn me on. And I enjoy that.. But then it's like after a certain point it's like I'm not interested anymore. Think of like a a timed light.

t3_26hn8f,How do you define being a woman/womanhood? I struggled to answer this question at a conference this week.,"This week I attended a social justice conference and decided to sit in on conversation about transgender issues. One of the questions raised was, what makes someone a ""real"" woman? My immediate thought was anyone born with two x chromosomes, but is it really that simple? We're surely more than our parts. Others thought a certain style, personality or aesthetic made someone a female. Such as kindness, maternal-instinct, or being graceful or girly in dress. I felt like this description left out say, butch or more masculine females, who certainly do identify as women. I struggled with this question way more than I anticipated!

t3_26ht4i,I've had a few weird instances of people not getting hints and dealing with awkward situations (described inside). How can I be more assertive in conveying non-interest?,"So, I'll start this off by saying that the reasoning behind this post is that I was browsing r/foreveralonewomen while thinking about my utter lack of previous experience with men. I'm only 20, so of course I'm still hopeful, but I sometimes use that browsing time as a time to reflect upon things I could have done differently - not negatively, just so that I will remember them in the future.

In this context, I remembered a pair of incidents from my fall of my freshman year of college (about a year and a half ago now) which I experienced and have difficulty interpreting.

I was taking a class on communications in the classroom, trying to determine whether or not I wanted to go into teaching, and the class size was fairly small. Over the course of the semester I made a few in-class acquaintances, one of whom was a guy named John. John was nice, slightly nerdy - which I normally don't mind but in his case it was in a bit of a socially awkward way, and displayed some interest in me. The class was in the mid-mornings, and I usually arrived there early because I didn't have a big enough break between this class and the preceding one to walk back to my dorm and rest. So, basically, what happened was that one day after class, as I was leaving, I ended up walking the same way to the one of the food courts - not one I normally used - for lunch as John. Having gotten to know him a bit, we began to talk, and wound up sitting and eating together. No problems so far.

Now, naturally, after lunch was over, I needed to head back to my dorm room to grab a few things before my next class. Normally, this would be enough of an excuse for the lunch to end and for the two parties to go their separate ways, am I correct? (John and I didn't live in the same dorm at all, his was much closer to this food court than where I lived.) Well, basically, not getting the hint that I needed to leave and move on with my afternoon, John basically followed me almost all the way across campus back to my room. Luckily, my roommate was there that afternoon, and I was basically able to make excuses and eventually he got the hint and left with a bit of awkwardness.

After this incident, I stopped really talking to John so much before class and afterwards would make a point to not linger or chat and then head straight back to my dorm room. In this case, I hadn't mentioned explicitly wanting to hang out or invited him, but being my nervous and sometimes overly-accommodating self I guess I didn't really make it clear that I needed to be alone.

But then it happened again. Only I was smarter this time. It was the week before finals the next time it happened, where John basically ended up following me to lunch after class at that same dining hall that I rarely went to but for some reason ate at one day again. Again, I made excuses about needing to leave to work on something, and walked back towards my dorm. Instead of going back to my room however, I had the sense to go straight to one of the heavily-populated study areas outside of a café in my dorm and begin to work on the project for which I had tried to excuse myself after lunch. John did follow me, and he sat with me at the table as I worked and tried to chitchat, though at one point I finally excused myself and put in headphones, after which he got the hint again and got up to leave. Before he left however, he invited me to a Q-and-A type event about sex and relationships in college, with an undertone of ""I'll be there too"" in his voice. Of course, I made a polite excuse and did not attend.

After having a year and a half to mentally cringe at the way I handled these situations, was there anything I could have done differently or better? Am I right to think that John was being creepy or at least a little out of line/awkward? How can I be more assertive in conveying my desire to be left in peace and not followed?

Part of my reasoning at the time - especially the first time this happened - was not wanting to come across as mean or bitchy if I outright rejected him/made it clear I wanted to be alone. Nothing like this has happened since then, in part because I am less outgoing in my classes now than I used to be. I didn't feel particularly threatened at the time in either instance because it was daylight out and in a well-populated area, but after a year I am feeling more creeped out/cringeworthy over the whole ordeal. To be clear, I've never run into John in the 3 semesters since, as my campus is a rather large state school. I am also no longer taking any classes in which I would be likely to see him, and on top of that will be out of the country next year. I just want some advice as to whether or not I'm justified in feeling creeped out by this behavior, as well as to what I can do to avoid or better handle situations like these in the future.

It is coming from the left side of my vaginal wall and it bulges out and feels like it is a sac filled with fluid.

t3_26h68y,"So Frustrated with BFF, need to vent!","I just need to lay this down here before I go to dinner with my best friend and her boyfriend.
My best friend recently got out of a 9 year relationship with an emotionally stunted, controlling man, and their relationship was more of a mommy/son relationship than anything. It was unhealthy for both of them, but you can only point out a train wreck so many times on deaf ears. I know more than I should have because she confided every aspect of their relationship to me.
She broke up with him, it was messy, but she did it. I give her props for recognizing a bad situation and leaving. I know it takes people in an abusive relationship a long journey sometimes before they can find the courage to leave it.
A week after this break up, she tells me that she wants nothing more than to be alone, live alone, be without a man and be a free woman. I encouraged this, since, while I am happily attached, I am a firm believer that everyone should be single for a while in their life to find who they truly are. I don't think you can love someone or have a successful relationship without being confident in yourself. She hasn't been single for the 15 years she's been dating.
Come to find out, she met another guy at a friend's wedding a week prior to breaking up with her LTR and hopped from living with the LTR guy to being in a full time, fully invested relationship with a new guy, whom she had never met before this wedding. They are 3 weeks into this ""relationship"", and already they're referring to each other as ""wifey"" and ""hubby"", and are wearing ""promise"" rings. 

Why am I posting this here?

Because I needed to vent to people that would hopefully understand and give me opinions. It's socially unacceptable to call someone out on their issues, and I am not perfect by any means, but I tried asking her if she should slow down on the new guy, but instead she changed her ringtone to ""will you marry me"" by bruno mars and is planning on moving out of state with this guy. 
I met the guy, and I'm trying to be nice, trying not to be a catty bitch, but he's been married twice before, has 3 kids with both exes, (which isn't necessarily a deal breaker, just seems relevant since they're obviously talking marriage already) and doesn't seem like too much of a catch to me, personality or looks wise. (Stated since someone could say she's only physically attracted to him, not because I'm that shallow)
She's turned into a sports fan because he is one, which is funny since she used to tell me how much she hated baseball, but now she's facebooking stupid photos of how ""real women like baseball"" and the like.
She's basically lost herself and globbed in to this guy, and it's sad and frustrating all at once.
I've kept my mouth shut about the majority of my opinions, since I have managed to learn that what goes on with a relationship isn't always what it seems on the outside, but I needed to vent to some anonymous ladies and gents who may or may not be able to inject some advice or opinion on this. 
Apologies if this isn't where it belongs, didn't know where to go for advice on different perspectives I may be missing.
I am aware I may get differing opinions than my own, but that's why I'm here. I know us gals all have different experiences we draw from where relationships are concerned.

t3_26hmz4,"a team member gets paid, while I don't, for the same exact position in lab","Hi, guys. I need some advice. I've been working on a project for about two years, and a friend and I are on a team processing data for said project. She started before I did, but we were trained for the processing job at the same time. Here's the thing: I've been doing it as a volunteer position for my entire time there, whereas she has been getting paid since last year. I've been ignoring it since last year, but I just recently realized I've done more work than her, especially because right now I have a huge folder to work on whereas she has nothing. It's really rubbing me the wrong way that I have to work on this outside of the time I am scheduled, without any sort of compensation.
She's worked with more folders because they contain less files, whereas every one I'm assigned has around 100+. I just don't think it's fair, but I'm not sure how to broach the topic, because not only did my friend not tell me about being paid, but I only found out because the file was in the downloads folder on the computer and I was curious when I went in to clean it. 
Like right now, I have work for class due tomorrow that I am putting off to finish this data set, and I just don't think it's right that she gets paid for all the times she is there, while I essentially do more work and get nothing.
Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. Should I bring this up with the supervisor or just ignore it? I plan on leaving soon anyway because I don't think I'm going to be getting anything more out of this project and I'm tired of spending 10+ hours every week for something that essentially just gives me nothing.

I've had issues getting it in perfectly sometimes, and it does shift and poke me slightly sometimes (my cervix sits at an angle or something according to the GNO) but for the most part it's been an amazing and freeing way to deal with my period. 

Right now and last month I've been getting irritation from putting it in and taking it out. It feels like I've nearly teared my vaginal wall, close to the opening and it's extremely uncomfortable. It feels painful and itchy (most likely itching from attempts at healing.) I just got back from camping so it wasn't the ideal situation to be putting it in (it was dry, at home I rinse it when I change it out.) 

Has this happened to any of you ladies? Is it time to replace my cup? The stem has been trimmed quite short since I first got it due to my angle and the slight poking. I could go back to using pads at night but I really don't want to do that either. Perhaps I just need to give my vagina a break or try a different model? How often do you ladies replace yours and how did you know it was time to replace?

t3_26h6cv,friendship troubles (rant),"I post here from time to time under my main account, but right now I really need a head check, and I'd rather do it anonymously/not connected to my main account.  Basically, I've been having issues with a friend, and due to a number of factors in my life which have me feeling emotionally off-kilter, it's possible that I'm being a total crazy-pants about this, but also possible that I'm not.  I guess basically I'm looking for a sounding board of sorts because of how ""off"" I've been recently.

So, I have this friend, and we've been friends for about 2 years.   Over the last few weeks, she's started being kind of bitchy to me.  Nothing huge, but talking down to me and making small comments that make me feel like absolute crap, like harshly telling me to ""shush"" when in a group (a few people, including me, were kind of talking over each other, but in a playful way), or making snarky comments about me being ""emo"" after I confided in her about some of the emotionally difficult things that have been going on in my life here lately.

Anyway, over this past weekend, this friend asked me to keep an eye on her garden for her while she was away.  She said that she had picked some veggies and left them in her fridge and that I should take them, which I did.  So, she gets home today, and texts me and says did you take the veggies, and I said yes, and she said that I was only supposed to take some of them and that she had left sticky notes saying what I should take and what I should leave.  Now, I made a mistake, and didn't read the notes carefully because I was in a hurry, so I took all the veggies.  I told her this and apologized, and offered to bring her what was left tomorrow (I can't until then).  She texts back and says her boyfriend will come to my house to pick it up in half an hour, which he did.  She never responded with an ""it's okay"" or a thank you for taking care of her garden or anything. I never wanted to take what's not mine, but it was an honest mistake, and I apologized, and it just feels shitty.  Her reaction has me feeling like I stole from her, rather than it being a genuine misunderstanding, but maybe I'm over-reacting to this in particular/to things in general?

Every time I hear them speak he is treating her like shit, and to top it all off dumped her right before he was shipped off to Korea, where he began to text her that apparently he hadn't had feelings for her for a while (like for most of their relationship...as if that weren't obvious), and that he didn't love her and never wanted to spend the rest of his life with her (she had talked often about them having kids and getting married; they had these conversations and decided together from what I could tell). I'm pretty sure he waited until he was shipped off to tell her these things because he's obviously a huge coward (this way he doesn't have to deal with the damage he caused).

She told him to never contact her again after he texted her those awful things (about never loving her, etc.) and he agreed. But then she started texting him. She apparently sent him a video of their dog (that she kept) and in her text to me about how he wasn't answering she seemed frustrated that he wasn't answering back.

Her mom is over with her right now, who she says is making everything worse. I have been texting her as well, telling her to take all the time she needs, that he was an abusive asshole and that she's better off. She says that her mom is telling her that she's naive for texting him and that she's letting people take advantage of her and apparently her mom has barely said anything to her other than that.


I have been telling her to take her time, start getting out there and doing fun stuff to keep herself distracted, repeating that he is an asshole and she deserves someone who wants the same things she wants. Which she says she can't do yet because he meant so much to her and she just can't let go. I think she's honestly waiting around for him to ""change"" for her. I don't really know.

I don't know what to do, twoX. I can 100% see why her mom is acting that way; her mom has had more exposure to their relationship (she says her mom never liked him) and from the little I saw he was pretty emotionally abusive. I want to be there for her, and I was honest with her and told her that she should definitely delete his number (I made sure to be super supportive of how she deleted him from facebook, so that's a good sign!), but she says that she's ""just not there yet.""

I had my Mirena implanted about two months ago.  I'm still really glad that I got it done, but I have a few questions for those who have been on it longer than I have about your periods after you had the Mirena implant.

I know that not all women will have the lighter or non-existent period side-effect.  However, I've noticed that my periods have a much longer length than they did both on an oral contraceptive and pre-birth control.  (Granted, I've been on oral contraceptives for the last six years before switching to Mirena.)

I've seen some women talk about how they had a few heavier periods before their bodies adjusted, but I'm curious how long that lasted.  I essentially want to know if I should expect my periods to continue to have a longer duration or if that is something that may change over the next few months.

He asked me why she would haves asked him that, and said he wondered if it had ""come up at home."" The woman in question is married. My boyfriend, god bless him, is a bit dense. I gave him a couple of scenarios that might have precipitated this, and mentioned ""she might have been flirting. Did that occur to you?""

He said it had occurred to him, and that about a year ago, at another happy hour, she had drunkenly kissed him, on the lips, briefly. No tongue. He informed a coworker, who found her husband, who took her home.  

Let me be clear. I trust my boyfriend. He wasn't hiding this from me, he just didn't think it was important.

Final edit: She finally got home around 6:30 a.m. and claimed to have lost her wallet so she couldn't pay me. She was also intoxicated. So badly so that she was barely coherent. I called CPS and told them about the house (trash and cigarette butts everywhere, no food, no baby wipes, hardly any clothes, drunk mom coming home when her son would be awake soon). Doubt they'll do anything but it'll be good to have on record if something worse happens or if this happens frequently. Going to leave it alone for now, and hopefully she doesn't have the nerve to ask me to babysit for her again. I'm going to warn all my babysitting friends about her.

t3_26i9e5,1 (21f) was severely sexually harassed/stalked by my teacher (45+m) in middle school. Advice needed. (Trigger warning) (X-post from /r/sex),"This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 
Also, I (21f) am going to attempt to give a solid background while trying to leave out any identifying info, so I apologize in advance for any vague statements. 

Okay, here it goes.
This all took place over the course of an entire school year in middle school. I was around the age of 12 at the time.  It started with a normal teacher/student relationship. However, he (45+m) began saying things to me both in private and in front of the entire class such as:

-""Efilym has such beautiful (insert color) hair.""

-""You have pretty (insert color) eyes, efilym.""

He would come up to me in the middle of class while working on projects/homework and rub my arm/back/shoulders and say things like ""Thata girl."" or ""You are doing such a great job, efilym.""

After this took place for a month or so, the harassment/stalking got progressively worse. On one occasion he used me and him having a baby together as an example in front of the entire class. He started off by saying ""Well, let's say Efilym and I had a baby together..."" 

On another occasion he slid his hand in the front pocket of my jeans and pulled out my lip gloss. He tried to tell me that he thought that I had a lighter in my pocket and he was trying to keep me from ""picking up a bad habit."" 

I had given him (as well as all of my other teachers) my school picture from that year. Idk if this was just at my school or if other schools did this too, but giving your teachers your school picture was common. He had a bulletin board in his room that he put all of his students pictures up on, except mine. My school picture was found in the drawer of his desk...with a frame of pencils laying around it.

The other kids in my school started bullying me because of this. They said horrible things to me almost on a daily basis such as

-""Is it a boy or a girl?""

-""I bet Mr. Perviwontratout likes that skirt you're wearing today.""

They would also call me a slut, say that I shouldn't get so upset because I flirted with him first, etc.

I told my parents early on what was happening, and I can't thank them enough for being as supportive as they were. My parents called the school, went and talked to the administration, talked to him directly, etc. to no avail. The school district simply gave him a slap on the wrist, and left him to keep harassing me. He admitted to everything he was doing to me over the phone to my mom and said that ""There's nothing you can do about it. It's my word against hers. No one will believe her over me."" 

He also began failing me in his class, despite the fact that I was getting very high scores on all of my assignments/tests. He accused me of cheating on an assignment and called me alone in his office to discuss it, something that, in hindsight, I realized was very intentional. I walked into his office, and he shut the door. I was already very aware and cautious of what he had been doing to me, but when I heard the lock of the door click behind me and I realized that no one could help, little-12-year-old me immediately went into survival mode. He kept trying to coax me into the corner of the room behind his desk so I could ""see the paper"" that he was holding while staring at me with this look on his face that I can only describe as pure sexual desire. I kept refusing to move. Eventually, he very calmly grabbed onto my arm and attempted to pull me to him. After multiple failed attempts, I managed to break free of him and I ran out as fast as I could. 

We filed a lawsuit, which we ended up being forced to settle for some amount of money, I finished the school year at home and only returned to school for final exams, and my parents packed the family up and moved us to a different school district. 

I decided to post this because, after months of lurking, I have had a hard time finding anyone with a relatable story. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience?

Also, the emotional effects that this has had on me seems more relatable to those who are survivors of sexual assault/molestation/rape than those who are survivors of sexual harassment. Does anyone know why?
For example, I have occasional nightmares (which used to be nightly) and flashbacks that often leave me unable to function normally for the rest of the day/week. These nightmares sometimes even include him assaulting me. Discussion of any type of sexual harassment/assault is sometimes a trigger for me. Sometimes, if I have had a nightmare about my teacher recently, encountered a trigger, etc., I'll try to be intimate with my bf and he will look at me with desire or touch me a certain way (like he's supposed to) and I'll panic and start crying. 

I think about all of the men, women, and children who have gone through much more terrifying events, and I feel like I'm overreacting. However, this is the man that introduced me to sexuality. He's the first man that ever lusted over me and I was aware of it...at the age of 12...and he was a middle-aged man. It's all just so confusing. I don't even really know what to call it. I wasn't assaulted, but it doesn't really feel like a harassment either. I feel like my story is pretty atypical, but I could be wrong! So if anyone has any advice or has gone through a similar experience I would love to hear what you have to say!

TL;DR I was severely stalked/sexually harassed by my teacher in middle school. Wondering if my reactions are reasonable and looking for similar stories/advice on how to cope. ",14,20140526025233,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

But just about all my friends complain about bras. I never liked them.

I always had a horrible expierence trying to find bras in my size, because according to society 38A doesn't exist.

I've since moved to Europe, and one of my colleagues never wears a bra (she's probably a C cup). And I always find them a hassle, so I tried today forgoing the bra.  And I have to say I love it. Of course I look a little flatter, but I like the feeling.

And after talking to some friends, one doesn't wear a bra either, though she's pretty small like me, and my sister told me to go home right now and put on a bra.

t3_26iikg,Seeking Breast Augmentation in Asia Pacific,"Hi TwoX!

I have a bit of a long and complicated story, but the tl;dr version is that I've lost a whole bunch of weight which has enhanced the asymmetry between my breasts - there's now at least 2 cup sizes difference :(  My boyfriend promised me that when I met my goal size (size 6) that he would get me an augmentation/lift to even the girl back out.  Well, I've hit a size 6 and have maintained it for 2 months now, so it's time to start researching surgeons!

But there's a catch.  We're currently in Canada, but will be moving to India in the next 4 - 6 months for work.  Considering there are a lot of world-class medical facilities in the Asia Pacific region and costs are a lot cheaper, I'm considering getting my surgery done over there (cost of travel is so cheap that even if we're based in India, a flight to Taiwan or Singapore or Vietnam or wherever is super cheap).

So this is kind of a long shot, but can anyone recommend a surgeon or clinic in the Asia Pacific that does fantastic breast augmentations?  Bonus points if the clinic has a doc that does excellent face lifts as well (that one's for the BF, not me :).

If you can't recommend a clinic, any other ideas where to look? Obviously a google search brings up a million clinics, but I can't find any sort of trusted source ranking/reviewing them.",4,20140526061811,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26i04b,"I didn't press charges against my attacker, is it too late to find justice? [Trigger Warning]","Two years ago, on May 12th, 2012, I was raped. My attacker was someone I had known for a long time. At that time, I was only 17 and naive. I trusted him into my home. It is difficult for me to share my experience, not only because of how traumatic it has been, but because I still struggle with accepting that it was not my fault. I hope that sharing on here can help me find my own justice, even if it is small.

[trigger warning]

I had a giant crush on this guy for the longest time. He was the quintessential bad boy, right down to the taste of cigarettes on his breath. He had all the friends. I was a sheltered girl from an overly-religious family, stuck inside her books and obsessed with being on the debate team. He easily pulled me in, his qualities were the exact opposite of mine, and I wanted to explore that difference. It was never an emotional thing, I knew that but ignored all the tell-tale signs. At first, it was just making out. Eventually it led to bruises all over my legs and arms. That wasn't enough to pull me away. On that night, my parents weren't home. As a teenager, that felt like the perfect time to just make out and have some alone time, since there were always parents around. I never wanted to have sex, but there's always that lingering thought that maybe I led him on or gave him some signal by allowing him in. While in my home, it took no time before I was underneath him and in shock. I had absolutely no idea how to stop what was happening. I told him no. My hands beat his chest and I tried to get out of his hold. I couldn't. I laid there, just trying to be strong. He finished and there was blood all over my legs and on my white sheets. He laid down next to me. I will always remember what he said to me, ""Are you going to cry?"" I still cannot believe that those were the last words that came out of his mouth. He stood over me watching as a cleaned my bloody sheets. I told him to go and he left. 

My body was in so much shock. I would wake up in cold sweat, night after night. I could not tell anyone. I did not tell anyone. My period didn't come for two months following that trauma. I was so scared that I was pregnant, but with no support, I continued on as if nothing happened. After my period came and I knew I wasn't pregnant, my mind completely erased the events that happened that night for a full year. 

It took an experience with MDMA a year later for everything to come out. It was during prom weekend and I was around a lot of his friends. I told everyone, but no one believed me. I remember crying and hyperventilating and that became the turning point for me. Admitting to myself that I was raped. Letting it come out of my mouth, even if it meant losing a lot of the people whom I considered my friends. Since then, I've gone through a lot. I suffer from panic attacks and a constant feeling of worthlessness. I go through periods of suicidal thoughts. Sometimes, it felt easier to have erased it from my mind. But I can't erase what happened to me.

I'm starting to feel like the only way I can heal myself is by bringing justice to myself, and to any other woman he has done or will do this to. I found out that he forced another girl to have sex, the way he did with me, and I'm afraid that this has started a trend. A violent one. 

So, I come to TwoXChromosomes to ask: What should I do? I have no evidence to prove that he raped me, but I have an overriding sense that I need to have justice; that he needs to learn his lesson and that he cannot get away. I missed an opportunity to put him to justice, but I don't want to live my life knowing that I never did anything to stop him. Please help me.

t3_26i9bo,"Mo' PMS, mo' problems. [rant]","It has been quite an eventful week for me and my boyfriend.

I've been a long time lurker of this sub, and this is the place I feel most comfortable posting my frustrations to. A little background on my relationship: my boyfriend isn't generally moody, but when anything even halfway dramatic happens, he pretty much shuts down and doesn't say much of anything. 

So last week, when I accidentally got a boot on his car to the tune of $140, he went into shut-down mode. I was already on my way to vacate my old apartment that I had lived in with some friends I had a huge falling out with, so I was already high strung knowing I'd have to deal with the three of them, and then I get a boot on his car and I couldn't pay it at the moment. He gave the guy his card while I sat in the van and bawled my eyes out.

Why was I crying, you ask? 

Well, I have pretty violent PMS.

SO naturally, this freaks my boyfriend out even more so for the next 24 hours, my boyfriend says a total of *maybe* ten words to me, if that. He didn't respond when I said goodbye to him when I left for work the next morning, didn't respond to any of my texts during the day, and wasn't at home when I got back from work. When he comes back from wherever he was, he gives me a deadpan ""hey"" and heads upstairs. That's pretty much boyfriend-speak for ""I'm still not really talking to you."" SO naturally I pretty much sat on the couch and started crying.

Later on in the evening it comes time for WWE Smackdown, which the bf and I are both big fans of. I get it all ready to go and I text him from downstairs that he can come down if he wants to watch it with me. I can see that he read it right away, but he only comes down 45 minutes later, sits on the opposite end of the couch, and doesn't really respond when I say hi. So in my stupidly hormonal state, the only natural reaction is for tears to start streaming down my face. And boy howdy, these were *tears*. Alligator tears. However, they were silent, because I was trying not to freak him out by randomly crying. 

I was dumb. He looked over at me and immediately noticed that something was wrong. And he asked me what was up. All of my wat. You practically ignore me for 24 hours and then don't understand why I'm crying? Okay. Whatever. So we talk it out, and his reasoning is ""I just needed to not say anything after last night."" Even more of my wat. 

Ever since then, he hasn't quite been back to normal. I've done my best to kind of get back into our old routine. So yesterday I asked him if we could go to the beach today, and he said he'd think about it. This morning he told me he didn't wanna go to the beach. So later in the afternoon I see him in his swimsuit and he says he's leaving. 

Turns out his friend asked him to hang out. Where, you ask? 

The beach. 

So I let it slide. I figured he needed some time with his friends to just kind of mellow out. He gets back at eleven thirty and again with the whole deadpan ""hey"" and retreating upstairs. I come upstairs half an hour later and he's on the phone. He promptly goes downstairs when I come upstairs. And when I go back downstairs a few minutes later, he comes back up. And he stays on the phone until two AM. 

So here I am typing up this wall of text to you lovely ladies of 2X with tears in my eyes, wondering if my PMS is getting the better of me or if there's some sort of foundation to my waterworks. I'd post this in /r/relationships but they don't understand PMS and I need this viewed through that lens.

t3_26jcb2,Re: A way to help women in need,"Ok TwoX-ers! This thread is a follow-up to /u/littlelibertine's idea in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/261i1l/i_am_not_ashamed_of_my_abortion_venting/chmw9fv) about women seeking abortions: 

> You know what would be really handy? A network of women offering a bed/couch to other women who need somewhere to stay in that time between the ultrasound/class and the abortion. If there isn't one, we should make it.

I promised that I would talk with my partner, who is a software developer, about creating something that would help. Here's the results of our discussion:

* This should be web-based. An app could come later, but not everyone has a smartphone. 
* It would need to be perfectly safe and anonymous for the women looking for a place to stay (at least until she contacts her potential hostess) and the women doing the hosting. This is the trickiest bit. **HOW do we keep out the creepers?** 
* OPTION 1: We can't do an Airbnb-style layout where you reveal lots of info about yourself in a profile, but we could do mimic the way [housesitting sites](http://www.trustedhousesitters.com/house-and-pet-sitters/9095-SirRied/) are setup. You can upload a police background check, photos of your home, a video and/or anonymous reviews (that are verified behind-the-scenes by the site).
* OPTION 2: We could setup a mostly-offline system that keeps the potential for abuse very low. Think of it like a book club. One TwoX-er volunteers to be the den mama for her city/town/area. If any other ladies want to volunteer to be involved, she can meet with them in-person at a coffee shop and make sure they aren't a blatant creeper, and even check out their references. This obviously involves more legwork, but if you're willing to drive someone to/from appointments, or let them stay in your home, you're probably willing to do a bit of work up front to prove that you're honest. We could put a link to a searchable database in the sidebar; women in need could simply enter their zip code and find their nearest den mother to contact.
* OPTION 3: We here on TwoX have a history of trusting each other. I see women offering rides, couches and beds to other women all the time. We're a fantastic community (with or without the influx of people from r/all). Should we begin by talking to the mods and making it Reddit-based? ~~Maybe the mods could keep a list in the sidebar of users who are willing to be contacted and their general regions? (This could be a problem with us being a default now. Maybe we should make a separate sub for this?)~~ Update: The mods say this is a no-go, but I like u/thisisappropriate's [idea of a private sub.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26jcb2/re_a_way_to_help_women_in_need/chro029)

/u/littlelibertine also said she has a friend who runs a non-profit, and they would be talking to their local Planned Parenthood about it, which I think is a fantastic idea! It seems to me that we either need to go very low-tech, low-visibility, OR high-tech, high-visibility via a partnership with an organization like PP. They could act as the ""den mothers"" in the ""book club"" option I described above.

I'll be letting /u/littlelibertine know about this thread so she can post an update here if she chooses. But I'm also interested in what ideas you other TwoX-ers can come up with! 

Take it away TwoX! Let's do some good!

**TLDR: Let's make a network to help women who need a place to crash when traveling to get an abortion. IDEAS?**


Edit: My partner is extremely busy at the moment, so he probably can't do too much to help out in the next two months. But he's always available to answer programming questions about what is/isn't possible.

Edit 2: Just to be clear, I'm not claiming sole ownership of this idea. I'm self-employed and probably not able to start an entire non-profit from scratch right this second. If anyone wants to take these ideas and run with it, feel free!

**Edit 3: So many good ideas (and concerns), you all ROCK! Here's what I'm currently thinking: we create a searchable database of the existing local resources that so many of you mentioned. We could expand upon this if we create partnerships with local clinics, non-profits or Planned Parenthood. If there are no resources available in the woman's area, she could then request that the clinic set up a fund for her. We could work with the clinic to collect donations to cover her hotel and bus fare or car rental. That way we keep out of *almost* all the privacy and safety concerns, while still giving women an easy way to find help. Thoughts?**

Edit 4: Thanks for the gold, kind Redditor! **Anyone have any good ideas for a name for this site? I thought of ""BackHer"" or ""SupportHer"" but those appear to be taken.**",373,20140526125843,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26jjed,Someone tried to break into my apartment this morning.,"Hi guys. This happened hours ago and I'm still really shaken; I think it could help to share what happened.

I live in a small apartment complex, and I'm on the first floor. It's a  studio, with a big window near my bed. My girlfriend was at work, and I was sleeping in til 11. We leave the window open when we're home, even if asleep, since it's a pretty safe neighborhood, and we're not on a main road or anything.

I wake up around 10, to the sound of rustling blinds. I sleepily call out for my girlfriend, thinking she's home for some reason. A mans voice then says, 'hi,' very shocked, like he wasn't expecting anyone home. I then slur, 'who are you??', still half asleep. I get no answer, and figure it was a dream, so roll over back to sleep.

I wake up shortly after, and just for peace of mind, check the window for signs of tampering. The screen has been pushed over, leaving it open. I panic, push it shut, call my girlfriend and mom, and cry. 

We decided not to call the police, since I doubt they could do anything at this point. It's an hour later, I touched the screen so there won't be any fingerprints, and nothing was stolen. We're calling the apartment managers when the offices open tomorrow, though, to inform them what happened. 

We figure he saw the lights off and the window open, thought no one was home, but scared off. I'm just terrified, since this is a very safe community, and I never thought I'd have to deal with this. I'm very petite, I don't have a gun or anything but a kitchen knife, and I'm home alone a lot. We have to have the windows open if we're home, or else it gets humid and smelly in here. We'll start closing them at night, though.

t3_26jqy6,I have some questions about the Diva Cup!,"I've heard of menstrual cups a while ago but I was younger and my mother said no right away. I'm about to turn 20 and I realized that my mother no longer controls what goes in my vagina so I really want to look into switching. 

*The number one thing that pushed me to want them is they're more discreet. Basically my boyfriend (about to turn 22) still lives at home. We usually hang out in his basement because his mother feels that we shouldn't be alone together until we're married. There isn't a bathroom in his basement so I have to go upstairs to use the bathroom. You know girls clothes and pockets. I'm not good at hiding tampons in the waistband of my pants. So if his mom hears or sees me sneaking upstairs she'll ask what I'm doing, if I'm okay, if I'm hungry, and eventually she'll ask me what's in my hand. My boyfriend and I have been together a long time and we're in a very serious relationship and plan on getting married. I'd say I'm close to his mom but I still don't want to talk to her about my period. I know it's a stupid thing to be embarrassed about but I am. And let's not even talk about if his dad saw me! I think I'd run away crying. (I probably should mention I have anxiety. So I probably worry about this a lot more than I should.) My boyfriend is leaving for almost a month and I can't say goodbye because I won't go to his house when I'm on my period. That way probably too much back story. Sorry, I'm really upset that I'm not seeing him.* 

Anyways, on to my menstrual cup related questions! 

*Like I said I'm 19 about to turn 20. I've never had any children. So I'd assume I'd need a small one? But I've also read that ""bigger"" girls need bigger cups. I also heard how much you work out factors into it? I'm over 200lbs, probably over 230 and am around 5 feet 3 inches tall. I'm chubby but not too big. I don't work out much now because I hurt my back but I'm hoping to be able to go to the gym 5 times a week again soon. What size should I get? 

*I know there's multiple brands but the only one I know of that's available in the US is the Diva Cup. Is that a good choice? 

*I have terrible cramps and I heard using the Diva Cup can stop them? Is that true? Could this make cramps worse? 

*I read something somewhere about there being suction. Does it hurt? Because a suction cup sucking my cervix sounds painful. 

*What do you do when you go out and have to change it in a public restroom? Won't you have blood all over your hands when you walk out to the sink? 

*Do I have to change it every time I pee and poop? 

*The little stem you use to pull it out looks sharp and painful. Is it? 

*Can you feel it inside you?

*Honestly, how hard is it to get in and out? 

*I'm thinking about switching from the pill to an IUD. Should I not use a menstrual cup if I have an IUD? (That's what I read about when I read about the whole suction thing!) 

I did do my own research but I wanted to hear some personal experiences!

Let's all remember, the job of the news is to make headlines that are explosive. For Emma Thompson, time off as a parent is a [societal norm.](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/leave)  For Americans and others, it is fantasy. What we should be TRULY outraged about is that it is not more of a societal norm; that parents of all sorts, birth parents, foster parents, adoptive parents, do not get much more support, and that Emma is somewhat right - it is hard to be a working parent! We need to recognize that very fact, how hard it us to work and parent and be away from the very people that you are working so hard to support.  

Yes, Emma Thompson makes much more than any of us, I'll wager...it IS hard to be a great parent, working or not, but her reported 50 million net worth* (corrected by /u/plentyofrabbits) can't hurt.  But I do not believe that she is saying that working parents are in some way less than a parent who has the ability to be away from work.

t3_26jqjo,"ladies, how do you make new friends? would love help/advice! i'm so clueless! (gentlemen welcome!)","A here. I'm a fairly attractive 21 year old heterosexual female. I have an easier time befriending men than women. Lately, I've made male friends using OkCupid or Reddit. But problems arise if/when the guy find me attractive and expects things from me because of his attraction to me.

I'd love to make new female friends because I feel like this wouldn't be an issue with them. I also love girly things like shopping and gossip and sharing our lives, but...

I feel like my weirdness gets in the way. I was diagnosed on the spectrum a decade ago and that often plays a bigger role than I'd like it to. While I've worked hard and come a long way - most of my boyfriends/friends said they would never have guessed when I tell them. But little things have happened at work (see below).

I work full-time right now, so I'm trying to be friendly with people at work. But they have a life outside work and I'm not really sure about mine. I want to hang out and have conversations, but I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing/things.

What should I talk about? What should I say/do? How friendly is too friendly? Should I work on my listening skills?

Right now, I try to say hello and ask how my co-workers are. If I've heard a story from them, I'll ask for updates about it. I'll give tips to avoid getting people in trouble (i.e. you should put your coat on, the boss will say your shirt is inappropriate) or ask them for their phone number so I can contact them if need be (and vice versa).

Other people seem to have it easy and I'd really like it to be easier for me too. I'm willing to work hard and make the changes necessary to be a more likable person. Any advice or stories would be appreciated!

**TL;DR: I make male friends but their attraction to me creates conflict. Would like to make female friends to avoid this issue, but unsure how and what the best method would be. Trying at work, not sure how to improve. So far strategy is being very polite.**

**Any tips on what not to do would also be appreciated. Nothing is too dumb, seriously.**

Little things:
-tried to help a co-worker interact with guests - I could tell by her body language she was uncomfortable - rushed over and interrupted her mid-sentence. humiliated her instead.
-when I space out, I position myself in comfortable ""spots"" - even when there's someone else there!
-fear of approaching teenagers at work - and often many people - without support: in the form of a co-worker's presence or open nagging.",10,20140526152904,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26is6b,I hate my housemate and I feel trapped when I'm at home. [rant],"[support]

Ever since she moved in she's been making my life hell. Nothing I do is good enough, and I can't have a single conversation with her without it devolving into a conversation about my faults. When she has a bad day she comes home and expects my undivided attention and support, but when I have a problem it gets swept under the rug as ""it'll work out"". She has depression, which I try to help her with, but she knows that I have anxiety issues that she seems to actively be setting off. I've started having panic attacks because I feel so trapped at home. 

I need to move out, but I have nowhere to go. 

Edit: Thanks **so** much to everyone who commented. I wrote this while I was really upset, but now that I've calmed down I'm going to try and talk to her (we have spoken about it before, but I might not have been as assertive as I should be). We were friends before we moved in together, and I think that's part of the problem - she has very strong expectations on how a friend should behave, and it's difficult for me to be able to live up to those without sacrificing my ability to look after my own mental state. I'm going to go see a counsellor to try help my anxiety. I really appreciated hearing all your stories about similar situations!

t3_26jpze,One of my breasts is swollen and a bit painful. That breast has a lump.,"I'm 25, and my right breast feels swollen and a bit painful. Nothing major, but enough for me to notice. Actually both breasts have been feeling a little swollen and tender, but nothing major going on with the left one. 

The right one, however, feel strange. I feel some pain at times, and some itchiness that starts from the nipple and like extends to the middle of the breast. It's not like an external itch, it's strange.

Today I looked at my breasts in the mirror and the right one looks bigger. It has always been bigger than the left one. But now it looked slightly bigger. I asked my boyfriend if he had noticed this and he said he had noticed that my right breast had been feeling a little swollen.

I have a lump in that breast. I got it checked a while ago and they said it's a fibroadenoma, which is common a this age, and that it's benign and nothing. That I should get it checked out every 6 months or so. I have to get an appointment, but I'm scared.

I'm on birth control, but I've been on this pill for over a year already and this hadn't happened. Maybe I got sore breasts every once in a while... I had my period like 2 weeks ago, so it's not PMS (I've also never struggled with PMS), and to my knowledge I'm not pregnant (and it should be extremely difficult, since I take my pill religiously and I think I may have fertility issues due to insulin resistance).

What freaks me out the most is that my breast seems to have grown these last few days. I hope it's nothing, but I'm scared. Breast cancer doesn't run in the family, though some relatives have died of other types of cancer.",6,20140526152308,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26ix47,Need to get something out / could use your womanly wisdom,"Lovely ladies I need to get something off my chest and also could use your wisdom, encouragement, knowledge or any other applicable talents. I am 30 and married now just under a year to the man I've been with for nearly 5 years and have been having some serious doubts about our relationship. He's unemotional except for his anger. So, not a lot of happy reactions to things, never sad, but gets very upset at little things like not finding his glasses (might start throwing things, yelling, slamming doors) or he'll get upset with me being emotional. For example, I'll tell him something I'm upset about unrelated to him, and he'll yell at me to stop crying. Obviously this makes it extremely hard to share things with him. A lot of times he just won't respond at all, which isn't any better to me. Anyway, I worry about how I'm going to handle a lifetime of this. He takes it very poorly if I bring it up, and basically thinks he reacts to things just fine. So, anyone else have a similar experience and/or advice?  He's a great provider and takes care of me and of course I do love him or I wouldn't have married him in the first place.  

Now for the more despicable part on my end.  With this all going on I've been working with a man at work who I've become very close to. He's basically the opposite of my husband, and we have much more in common with one another. We've become very close, and while nothing physical has ever happened it wouldn't surprise me if it did, and terrible as it sounds I think I would like that. I've broken all the rules for these sorts of things. We share lots of details of our lives together, we see each other outside of work alone, he's my main champion in helping me with my career, and probably my best friend. We work long hours and spend just about all of it together, so it's all but impossible to separate myself from him unless I were to quit.  So, I feel terrible know that this is a pretty inappropriate relationship and yet being around this other man is incredibly fulfilling.   Any words of wisdom or advice would be much appreciated. A big part of this for me was just getting it off my chest.

I called my doctor last week and she explained this was totally normal and you don't get a full period on yasminelle you only get a light bleed.

I asked her if I should take another pregnancy test and she said this was unnessessary. 

I'm not looking to get pregant. Apart from the pill (which I take at the exact same time everyday) we don't practice any other forms of birth control. I like having my period each month as reassurance that I'm not pregnant. And I'm sure it can't be totally healthy for it to just dissapear.

I think that as a guy, I should have just as much a responsibility to keep my significant other safe from pregnancy as she does (and yes, I do think of it as a responsibility for us BOTH.)

Condoms can be ineffective ~~and much to a misandrist's disappointment, I don't want to be chemically castrated.~~ Besides, we enjoy sex. A lot. (I'm an idiot; that's how some birth control works. Still, no Depo-Provera for me. I like my sex drive.)

What is /r/TwoXChromosomes opinion on male birth control? Do women think that we, as men, should be just as responsible as you in this case?

(I honestly don't know how women feel about this. Excuse me if this is an issue women have or something they disagree with; I really have no idea.)

EDIT: OP is not ""fishing for virtual blowjobs,"" OP just wants to know if women are okay with the idea of sharing the responsibility of staying ""not pregnant."" If she were to get pregnant, it'd be just as much my problem as it would be hers; I still have to raise the kid with her. I don't think staying safe should be a one-sided thing. If you're having sex (which generally involves two parties; in my case, a male and a female) you ought to be responsible about it.

Fuck me for a) looking for another person's perspective on the matter, and b) for not wanting to have a child as a university student and ruin my girlfriend and I's lives, right?

t3_26ji6n,I (25f) need advice on managing a relationship with an older (48m) guy. I don't want him to be devastated and hurt when it has to end.,"(forgive the blathering writing style, weekend off, on a throwaway, he knows my main account)

I live in an out lying bourough of NYC. Born in Russia, came to the USA as a child, worked my ass off in school, got an MBA at 23, work in finance. In order to save $, I still live at home.

So I never learned to drive. I took lessons six months ago at a school and met this older guy who is an EMT and works at the school on the side.

He is older than my mom's age. To make matters worse, she dates a (healthy) 78 year old guy (still works, travels, super rich and super active.) who is my grnamother's age but looks and acts younger.

So driving school guy had employment issues years ago as a cop (won't explain) and barely makes enough to pay his bills. However, he is really sweet. He looks younger, is healthy, but has this mild depression thing. He helps my mom and I with chores and errands and little projects (builds our IKEA purchases and escorts us to the car service center).

CURRENTLY: Our relationship is friends but no benefits. I end up paying for things, ostensibly as a reward for doing me favors but I do enjoy his company. He listens. He is calm and patient. He does not go on about himself. He makes me feel safe when we are out in public. And yes, I have Daddy issues so there is that and now I want to have sexual experiences with him. He also knows how to speak russian (it was his thing in college). Charming for my family.

PROBLEM: Aside that he is over 20 years older and a bit paranoid. Example, he never wants to leave his apartment because it is rent stabilized. He never wants to leave nyc because you can get around with no car, etc.

MY CONCERN: We have sex and then I have to end it and he gets clingy or can't handle the break up. When we go places he is always scanning as if we are going to get attacked. When my cousin came to visit with her two year old baby girl, it was heightened to the point where he actually thought the girl was at risk of getting kidnapped in front of us. When were at parks etc. he held her hand and would not let her run off except in an enclosed playground. And even then he did this scanning thing as if some abducter was lurking in the shadows. But he was very sweet to her and every waking moment he was not working he escorted us to child related outdoor activities (which I paid for). 

This sort of annoyed me and made my ovaries gush at the same time.

TL:dr I am seeking techniques from experienced women on how to date an older guy without him getting clingy if it ends. Attentive guy can mean stalker. Ugh I have dealt with that before.

t3_26k3s8,"A few hours after the Santa Barbara shooting, a man in Stockton CA shoots at 3 women for refusing sex. And yet there is still denial about the societal issues involved.","[Link here](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/05/26/3441640/california-man-allegedly-fired-at-girls-for-refusing-to-have-sex/)

When I read something like this or the Santa Barbara shooting or other anti-women crimes (other shootings [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_L%C3%A9pine) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Collier_Township_shooting)) I am aware of a few societal factors that most likely bolstered the likelihood of these events.

-Women are viewed as this unrelatable other. The ""whole men are from mars, women are from venus"" shtick is insidiously pervasive in society. Rather than looking at a woman and thinking ""She is a person, let's interact with her like she's a person,"" it's ""She is a woman, she is different. Let's interact with her like she's different."" 

-Since the woman is less of a person in their eyes, some men put women on a pedestal as some sex trophy to be won. Basically, the woman's capacity to be a person, to have complex emotions, motivations and intelligence are ignored. This is pervasive in much of society (movies, TV, video games, campus culture, marketing...Reddit's front page). Women are presented not as people but as objectives.

-The most illegal thing I've done is shoplifting from Wal-Mart but despite lacking the experience, I'm guessing it's much easier to commit fatal crimes against those you don't value as people. 

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that there is conditioning from the very beginning to see females as completely different, and while it definitely does not always lead up to more extreme misogynistic attitudes like the kinds TRP espouses, it does lay a foundation. And we need to be more aware of this. Elliot Rodger undoubtedly had some sort of mental illness but I'm getting really sick of seeing that used as an excuse while his potent misogyny is disregarded. His kind of mentality comes with years and years of othering women, of viewing them as objects to be won rather than as people. He's not alone in having these kinds of attitudes. 

Most of the men I know (and love) have some of these attitudes, though to a much MUCH lesser degree. 
Guy friends complaining that a girl doesn't sexually reciprocate after being bought dinner/tickets/an iPod, guy friends saying they don't ""understand women"" and that ""bitches are crazy"" as opposed to actually listening to what their girlfriends are trying to communicate to them. These aren't huge issues, but they point to the bigger problem of women still not having the same personhood as men (yes, gasp, even in the Western world). It's a societal problem, and has a heavy influence on the perpetuation of violence against women. But for some reason there's still denial over its existence, which I find incredibly frustrating.

I know this is long and I apologize, I just wanted to rant a little and get the opinions of others on this.

Edit: I've had multiple people tell me that this is also an issue of the expectations of masculinity  (and some tell me that it's *only* that issue, and that the misogyny isn't real or something) and that this needs attention too. Which it does, but I created this thread to vent about the feelings I had in relation to my experiences as a woman. Not to say I haven't glimpsed the issues men face. I've seen my boyfriend, brothers and friends affected by them. But I don't have the personal experience or the necessary depth of knowledge to address these problems, and it wasn't what I was seeking to do anyway. I wanted to voice what my concerns were in relation to my experiences. That's what this subreddit is for.

 Additionally, I am in no way trying to detract from his mental illness. I believe that is also an important point to consider. But I don't believe it's right to say that the mental illness existed in a vacuum, and there weren't societal factors contributing to his view of women. 

Lastly, this kind of blew up (not used to this much responding to people) and I need to finish True Detective so I don't think I'll be responding anymore within the comments. But I do appreciate the efforts of anybody who contributed constructive commentary. Those of you who PM'ed me asking to see my breasts, I hope spiders get in your nose while you sleep tonight. 

Edit 2:
I've gotten so many responses saying that this is not an issue about women and that it was all on his mental illness. So let me tell you a little about how [psychology](http://chekhovsgunman.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/britta-community-basically-a-therapist.png) works. Autism is a developmental disorder. One of the functions it hinders (to varying degrees) is social abilities, yes. But it does not imbue the person with an automatic hate for women. That comes from stimuli the person absorbs from their environment, their society and their culture. What's my point? That we have detrimental views of women present in society. Which someone like Elliot Rodger absorbed and then turned into fuel for his heinous actions. Blaming his autism for his actions is not only inaccurate but also insulting to the many, many people who live with this disorder and function just fine as non-murders. 

Edit 3: 
There are also some replies saying that I basically have no right to bring this issue up because there are worse things happening in the world. Seriously? Please tell me the next time you talk about a problem that's less severe than poverty or world hunger so I can try to dismiss your opinion too.

Edit 4: You have to wonder when all the voices saying that this isn't about misogyny are male.",1061,20140526175107,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26jx4b,A positive experience reporting rape to the police (obvious trigger warning),"A little over a year ago things with my former live-in boyfriend started to go really bad. We had been living together for nearly a year before there were any signs.

He stopped paying rent and started drinking. At first he would just yell and break things like dishes; at one point he smashed my brand new iPad in a drunken rage. 

Eventually he started doing cocaine. I tried to kick him out a few times but he would come back after a few days or a week very intoxicated and angry. I called the police on occasion, at one point they arrested him and kept him overnight but it didn't keep him away for very long.

The culmination of this violence came when I didn't see him for over a week. He would disappear for up to two weeks at a time so he could drink and do drugs 24/7 without my nagging (and most likely meet other women). I started to think that maybe he was gone for good when he returned at around 4 AM while I was asleep, drunker than I'd ever seen him and smelling worse than I could ever describe. He hadn't showered the whole time he was gone, and he smelled like puke and body odor - like garbage juice.

I was raped violently that night and he tried again on my 21st birthday, but this time my best friend was staying the night. She overheard us and burst in the room and tried to pry him off of me. He injured her very badly, and she went to the hospital. They took pictures and when I saw her a few days later I couldn't believe how bad she looked. She had bruises on her face, her legs, her arms, her side. It was so apparent that she told me her professors reported it when she went into class the next day.

I never intended to report any of this. I grew up in a very violent household and I've called the police many times without much done. I didn't see any point.

My friend thought otherwise. She continued to call the DA nearly every week for the past year to try and get the ball rolling. She never got so much as a single call back no matter how many dozens of voicemail she left. I kept telling her she was wasting her time until she finally got a call. Apparently they had closed her case because the cop who it was assigned to was just plain lazy. The assigned a different cop and she came up to visit me so we could sit down with the officers.

Luckily for us, the new officer is awesome. It wasn't easy to talk about but he was very warm and gentle and just an overall nice guy. He personally apologized for the cop who hadn't taken us seriously. He told my friend ""we're not all like that, me and my partner are going to take care of you."" So far he's been following up on everything and has been wonderful to work with.

I'm not sure why I felt like posting this but I kind of wanted to get it off my chest and also because I hear so much about how reporting rape gets you nowhere, or even worse - the victims receive consequences. If you're thinking about stepping forward, it's up to you but these things shouldn't be forgotten or ignored and people like this shouldn't go unpunished.

TL; DR not all cops are bad, don't be afraid or ashamed to talk about what has happened to you. ",323,20140526163724,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26k0p1,Boyfriend has never introduced me to his friends. Is that odd?,"**EDIT: Here's the update: http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26o7js/update_boyfriend_has_never_introduced_me_to_his/**  


EDIT: Well, this kind of blew up! Lots of comments (I've read them all) and lots for me to think about. I really appreciate all the help and advice. It's definitely helped to talk about this.  

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, sorry. I hope it is OK.  

I'm feeling really torn up about this and on one hand I think I'm being a bit sensitive about it and on the other I feel a bit miffed. I'd love some advice.  

I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years. We have lived together for 4 years, we have a child and we have often talked about marriage since that is where we are headed (just we are saving for more important things like a house etc.). We have a pretty great relationship. He is my best friend, we are very open with each other and I trust him 100% that he's not cheating or lying to me or anything.  
The thing is he has never introduced me to his friends. Is that weird? I introduced him to mine. I'm scared that he's ashamed of me. He used to go out with them every weekend and while his friends often invited their partners he never invited me to go out with them (even before our baby). I mean that's fine, we all need time to ourselves but to never ever invite me out with them all? Now we live 200+ miles away from his friends but he still goes away to see them for one weekend every month and he never asks if I want to go with him (my family and his still live there, so I would be taking our child to see grandparents while he is out partying) he always wants me to stay at home.  
Now a few of his friends are getting married and the invites to the ceremonies and the receptions are all addressed to him and only him. I, nor our child, are invited while other people's partners and children are. He says his friends haven't got the money to invite us which is fine if that's the case but I just feel like the baby and I are invisible and don't exist to his friends.  

I don't know, am I being stupid?  

EDIT: Also when he is out with his friends he completely ignores me. I try not to bother him but sometimes I will text him because I'm bored/lonely/the baby did something cute/funny but he never responds, even when he's gone for the entire weekend. One time he was gone I was super scared because someone tried to break in to the house on the Saturday night and I left him a ton of voicemails and texts and he didn't even acknowledge them until he came home on the sunday evening.  

How do I bring it up with him without turning it in to a fight? Should I even bring it up? I'm happy for him to go out and all that, I'm glad he is maintaining his friendships. I guess I just want to be acknowledged. :/",294,20140526171604,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26kr47,I'm on a mission to get past depression and low self-confidence. Feeling discouraged about my professional aspirations.,"Hi ladies. I've been in a really negative place this past semester. Basically, I'm in a Master's program which is made up of 95% women and I feel like I'm constantly comparing my academic and professional success to theirs - even when I try not to. This problem is compounded by the fact that my program (higher education) is extremely incestuous and everyone is competing for career opportunities at the same place (or nearby) where they go to school.

For instance, three weeks ago I applied to a job opportunity in alumni relations at my university (and got an interview). I asked a classmate for advice (since she works in the department) and she told me, ""Oh, X already asked me the same thing!"" Then, I found out via Facebook (and overhearing during a networking event) that she got the job and I didn't. And this week it happened again - a classmate announced they got a job I had also applied to (and everyone congratulated them). What's worse is that I know job opportunities have been intentionally kept from me from classmates who share similar career interests - I know this because I asked someone about opportunities in their office and they told me their weren't any (and it turned out that there was a job opportunity they had applied to but not shared). 

I feel so disheartened by the whole thing - it would be one thing if I could apply to a job and forget about it but my program won't let me. I feel like my failures are in this giant spotlight and every time I go to class or on Facebook I hear about how another person got 'the job of their dreams' when I've been searching for four months and have found nothing. I feel like I can't function in professional settings (like networking event with my classmates) because I completely shut down. I feel like the only thing that is going to get me over this hump is if I can find a job, but all I can seem to do is look at my classmates with anger because I can't get over the feeling that they are stealing what should be my opportunities.

EDIT: Forgot to ask my question - Has anyone else ever been in a situation like this and what did you do?",5,20140526222151,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26kdg5,Need Help/Advice! Can't talk with mom - about boobs...,"OK, so I joined Reddit just to ask about this, lol. There is NO WAY in heck I am speaking with my mom about this, more later.

I will be entering high school next year, a year later than most because my parents elected to start me later (birthday on the borderline). But I have this problem, well TWO problems.

Right about this past Christmas, I started getting boobs. Yay! Right?  I spent the whole first part of the year thinking how far behind I was (I'm pretty tiny, used to be known as ""Stick Girl"" :(  ).  I was NOT looking forward to moving to high school.  

Then, about Christmas, my chest got really sore. Like, super sensitive, and at the same time All my jeans got too short, lol.  So, I tell my mom, and she's like ""oh, sweetie, you're starting to get your breasts"", and she says this out loud in the family room, and my brother gives me a goofy ""well isn't that special!"" look.  Anyway, mom took me out that weekend to look for a ""real"" bra (her words).

So, sure enough, I got boobs.  The problem is, they haven't stopped being sore, and the BIG problem is they haven't stopped growing.
Mom took me out two more times to by bras, when I complained.  The last time, I tried on a 32c and a 32d.  The ""d"" fit much better I thought, but I was freaked out.  My mom seemed angry - she made me get the 32c, and told me ""that it fits fine"", and that was the end of that.  She wears a 38c, by the way.  I looked one day through her drawer, because it would feel weird to ask.  Mom and I aren't ""best friends"". :(

Anyway, that was almost three months ago, and I haven't stopped growing. I'm now like two and a half inches taller than I was at Christmas, and I'm almost completely unable to wear the two 32c bras mom bought.  I brought it up like a month ago and she was pretty snippy about - said the ones she bought were just fine.  What's up with that???   Is she blind?

So, my friends and I were at the mall about a week ago, looking for clothes for the summer.  I said I had to go to the restroom and left them, but instead went up to the third floor of Dillards in the mall, where they have the lingerie. I was scared to death someone would see me or I was followed, so I just grabbed a handful of what looked like HUGE bras in the 32-34 band range, and ran into the dressing area.

Bottom line, the 32dd fit great! Didn't hurt, cut my shoulders, or just sit on the tip with globs of me hanging out. I wanted so much to be able to tell my mom that I had found a bra that fit, but...

I couldn't - 32dd freaked me out! And my mom was so irritable last time we talked about it, when it was a 32c.
Ok, so here's my questions - 

1. How do I talk to my mom?  Why does this irritate her so much? 


2. Now I'm STILL scared about going to high school, but for a different reason. I'm 5'3"", weigh about 100 and wear size 0 or 2 jeans - and I guess a 32dd bra.  How are people going to treat me?  Will they make fun of me? Will guys be rude or hit on me non-stop?  Will my brother be embarrassed??  He already looks at me funny.  Not THAT way, but like he doesn't know me any more. he's 4 years older, and will be a senior next year


3. And I guess I should ask - am I OK?  Is it normal to go from basically nothing to 32DD in 6 months?


If anyone has any experience in this, please offer some advice.  I've basically got three months before I start school. I'm scared :(",6,20140526194218,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26ktim,Realizing I need new friends...,"I met a great group of people earlier this year and while I do think they're awesome, I just don't feel like I fit in or am really part of the group most of the time. It's not a super obvious thing, but little signs pop up every now and then. For example, invites don't always come to me, or they don't keep me updated on plans when they say they will. For the latter, I do check in, but I don't want to have to do that all the time. It's like I'm not really part of their inner circle and just on the fringes so I'm often forgotten. (BTW, I do initiate myself too, and generally get a positive response, but I still notice the things above/below). 

The group is fairly big, but when I'm with certain people, I definitely feel disconnected. They're all nice and everything, but like I said, there are subtle signs. When we walk together, you'll often notice that some of them try to stay together and I'm left on my own walking behind or they specifically speed up to stay with the another person or group versus stay with me. Or one person will go around the group and ask everyone the same question, but will skip me, so it's almost like they don't make a lot of effort to really talk to me or get to know me. These things have happened several times so I'm pretty sure I'm not paranoid.  

It seems like everyone is super outgoing and have all these wild and crazy or fun stories to tell. I feel like they just think I'm a boring person because I never contribute any stories (unfortunately, I don't really have any). My life has been rather boring, particularly compared to them. I haven't traveled as extensively or gone on as many adventures. I just don't feel like I measure up. And while I do enjoy hanging out with them... the little things just remind me how much of an outsider I am. I almost feel like the unpopular kid trying to fit in with the cool group... it's not a good feeling. =/

This is hard because I feel like all I've been doing for the past 3 years is trying to find people I get along with well. The few friends that I've been able to get close with have since moved away and I'm just tired of always having to start over I guess. I had such high hopes for this group, but at the same time I really don't think it's panning out. I don't think our personalities mesh all that well and yeah, I maybe overly thinking things or super self conscious but like I said, the little things I'm noticing are adding up. And that's fine... I mean, you can't get along well with everyone, but it still sucks.

Anyways, I just wanted to vent because I feel like I've done everything I can to try and improve my social life but I always end up at the same place. Things I've tried: organizing and attending meetups, reddit meetups, reddit, picking up new hobbies, etc. 

I'm starting to feel like I'm just destined to be a loner... =( Or all my relationships are just going to be shallow and/or activity based, but I really need/want more than that. ",3,20140526225230,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

The one night I decided to, I clearly stated that he could ONLY touch me from the waist up, nothing below. 

So we made out for a while, and he just shoved his hand down my pants. I froze. I couldn't really speak. I'm a highly emotional person, and honestly, I just remember crying, and asking him to please take me home.

I love this subreddit and think everyone here is just super nice and helpful when it comes to womanly times and just need some feedback and advice. Also apologies now for errors, typing this on my phone.

So about two weeks ago I went and got an IUD put in. I(23) have never had children and have always been on the pill but lets be real, I forgot to take it more times than I actually remember. So I needed something less daily and still be effective. Had some slight cramps the first day and only minimal spotting. But overall couldn't be happier.

Well the next week I had a biopsy scheduled because past pap smears had shown abnormal cells and they wanted to be sure it wasn't cancerous. (It isn't, yay) That was another fun filled day of cramps and spotting. I was informed that it would last a few days and be like a light period and if the bleeding should ever soak through the pad to contact the doctor immediately. 

So fast forward to today and i've got real cramps that are just irritating and the bleeding, although not severe, is no longer the spotting it was a week ago. I am both frustrated and nervous because I wanted the IUD so I wouldnt have to have periods but also concerned something isn't healing right. I was told to not use a tampon the first 24 hours but I still waited 48 just to be safe. I have only used one a couple times when I know I'll be at work for long hours and not have a chance to freely change a pad. (Retail is very demanding :/) and haven't been having sex either since well I'm bleeding and cramping.  The cramping is worse when I wear a tampon so I've invested in a large bottle of 500mg Tylenol (allergic to ib profuen) and take those accordingly. When not on BC I would get mind numbing cramps and would be out of commission for a few days until I could tolerate the pain again. 

So what is going on with my body right now? Has anyone else had the same symptoms after a biopsy or IUD insertion? I'm going to contact my doctor tonight and hopefully schedule an appointment later this week but until then I just need to ease my mind a little. 

TL;DR: Have had an IUD inserted and a biopsy done less than a week apart and am still bleeding and cramping today.",3,20140526171906,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

That last bit is changing as soon as school starts again though, my university has a women's clinic on campus and is a lot cheaper, so I'll just wait until then. (Also financially speaking, I have no choice but to wait.)

My problem is, no matter how hard I try and shove those things in there, I can't! It's becomes too painful. The farthest I've had one up there is about half way. I have to admit though, I haven't tried too many different ways to do it. I've only ever tried while sitting on the John. I'm not sure what else to try. I'd be alright with pads for the rest of my life if:

* It didn't feel like a dam broke in my pants every time I got up for my chair

* I couldn't feel the flow and scraps of uterus coming out

* It didn't feel like I was wearing a diaper and worried it looked like I was

* I didn't have to be paranoid that I had leaked on the side (my anxiety level skyrockets during that *special* time of the month)

* If I could play sports comfortably (the major reason I've decided to make the change)

But that isn't the case. I've been cursed to use the mighty pad since everyone's favorite Aunt decided to drop in every month. So! Besides going to see the gyno, any ideas on what's wrong with me or what I can do to shove the cotton rocket where it belongs?

As I stated in the comments, they are pretty controlling, and didn't want me to have my car or job so I could focus on God's will for my life. But, if we can come to an understanding between the three of us, it would be a safe place to recover from all this until I am able to get a place of my own. I haven't told my boyfriend I am planning to leave yet, as I want to have a plan in place before I do. I will update again if anyone is interested.


My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. During our relationship, he fell into a heavy heroin addiction, and pulled me into it also. We have both gotten help in this area, and it's getting better, but I have other concerns about our relationship. One is sex. I can count on one hand how many times we've had sex in our three year relationship, and for the majority of it we have lived together, so it's not like it was a distance issue. Heroin kinda killed his sex drive, which I can understand, but another thing is he's into something really kinky, and says that the only way he can get off is if I participate in this kink with him. I've given it a try, as I want to feel intimate with him so bad I'd try pretty much everything, but I have a hard time feeling comfortable with it. It doesn't make me feel sexy. When I try to talk to him about it he gets offended, and says it's just a sacrifice I'll have to make if we want a sex life. He'll tell me I'm pretty, but hardly ever initiates sex or any heavy petting. If I'm feeling horny, sometimes he'll get me off, other times (most often), he tells me to just get myself off. It's really frustrating that he doesn't show that he desires me, or that I feel like he's attracted to me. He has no problem watching porn and jacking off. Also, he has been clinically diagnosed as a sociopath. Sometimes he is really sweet, and other times he gets really angry over nothing. The combination of this, and the lack of sex, has me pulling away from him. I still love and care about him, but I don't know if I can deal with this for the rest of my life. But I'm afraid to leave. One night after a fight, I was going to leave, but he tried to kill himself. I literally had to get between him and where the gun is kept to keep him from getting it. He says he has no purpose in life without me, that he can't live without me, and that I am his whole world. I just don't know what to do. ",0,20140526202201,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

He told me that I was clearly working really, really hard, and that I was the kind of person he'd want to hire. He handed me a business card and told me to give him a call if I was interested in working this summer.

I'm just starting to get over a breakup and when this really cute guy came up to me and asked for my number, I kind of got my hopes up about him. He seemed like a really great guy and I was excited to get to know him. 

So I googled his name tonight, just to see what would come up. Here are a few gems from his Twitter: 

""you know whats worse than a loose pussy, a dirty smelly bitch ha thats what""

""if a girl dont know how to get down in bed, dont expect a second call #hoe""

""roses are red, sky blue suck my dick so i cum on you :)""


I'm just kind of grossed out and ashamed that I judged a person so wrongly. It's things like this that make me want to crawl back into bed and not bother with dating anymore. I feel like I'm never going to find anyone who measures up to my ex.

Also wanted to say **THANK YOU** to those who have commented being so supportive, we have such an amazing community here and it is so nice to find people who understand.

t3_26lib6,I was molested by girls. (trigger warning),"My childhood was drastically altered because of a girl. 

I am a girl. I was two years younger than the daughter of a family friend that my mom used to babysit. We were best friends, her the ringleader, me the cheerleader. I would do whatever she told me. The earliest memory I've been able to recover is when I was about five years old. The girl (we'll call her Tina) was very much interested in horses, and I, being the granddaughter of a man with a small farm, showed her around the horse pen, the tack, the trailer. The movie Spirit had just come out, and Tina asked me if I had seen it. I excitedly told her yes, and she asked if I wanted to play pretend. She generously let me be Rain (the girl horse) while she played Spirit (the male horse). We ran around pretending to be horses, and eventually she led me into the horse trailer. The details get fuzzy here, but the next thing I remember, she is humping me like a horse would. Despite my efforts to escape (after growing bored -- I had no idea what was being mimicked), she holds me in place and continues until she collapses and my uncle calls for us outside the trailer.

This, unfortunately, was only the beginning. Her obsession with horses, mating, and using me as her puppet continued to escalate until, for reasons unrelated to the molesting and inappropriate behavior, Tina was no longer allowed at my house. 

I don't remember if she ever directly penetrated me, but I remember always feeling dirty and tainted with her, yet I still longed to be her closest companion. 

My oldest and closest friend (not Tina) is also a victim of her abuse. We have never discussed it. As a kid, I played dirty with her too, although not to the degree as Tina played with me. Mostly just with dolls. I feel so guilty for occasionally reciprocating and then mimicking the behavior. It eats at me. 

When I went through puberty (at age 10-11, 5th grade), I had trouble fitting in. I had boobs but no bras, I stank, and I was new. A girl who wore massive amounts of eyeliner took me in. We'll call her Susan. Susan frequently talked about losing her virginity, having sex, and the benefits of being young and looking older. She had apparently had sex many times. Eventually, talk progressed to her being interested in girls. She grabbed my breasts and butt almost every day, before and after school, complimenting me on both. I don't know why, but I never told any authority figures. 

I hope that there's someone out there who knows that they aren't alone. It took me a long time to talk about any of the abuse I received, let alone indirectly gave. My friend probably would never have been introduced to such grossly perverted things if not for me. Tina recently had a baby, and my mother threw her a shower because Tina's mom died years ago. I didn't attend, but I never said why. I see Tina frequently, but I don't think I'll ever mention what she did to her.

And through all this, I wonder who did something to Tina and Susan. Maybe a guy, maybe a girl like her. Where does it start? I don't know. I just don't feel like there's a lot of support for stories like mine. We're all sisters here, with emotional bonds. Yet, here my sisters were, using my emotional bonds against me.


Sorry, this kind of turned into a rant. I just wanted to share, in case there's someone out there like me who needs someone to talk to.",58,20140527062357,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26la62,Ending things with an abusive and unavailable cheating boyfriend. [Support],"TL;DR (apologies for the novel. I had to write.) I found out Bf of 2 yrs had another gf, cheated with (at least) one other girl too, does meth, and is incredibly good at manipulating me.

I just need to get this off my chest. Like the title says, I have ended things with him. This time really for good. I have tried to end things twice before...and got sucked back into the vortex of his manipulations, emotional abuse, and annoyingly great sex. I am feeling really emotional and sad about it because I tried SO HARD to help him, but I know no one can help him but himself. He is a good man and has so much potential. But he has been buried under combined deep depression and serious OCD...basically since I met him and his life fell apart. I met him at such an unfortunate time. It took me far too long to realize how unavailable he was most of the time. Just kind of checked out, or angry.

The straw that broke the camels back was back in November when I found out that not only had he cheated on me with at least one random girl, but he had another girlfriend too. I found out because I had known about her the whole time, but he had lied to me and convincingly told me she was his ex. I actually emailed her almost a year previously telling her about me and him and my suspicions, and when she never wrote back, I asked him about it and he made up some kind of excuse about her not wanting to talk to me.
Anyway, in November when I was with him on a road trip, I drunkenly texted her (got her number from his phone) a picture of us kissing, and because he had me convinced she was a jealous ex who still wanted to be with him, a mean note. I felt bad about it in the morning and texted her an apology, to which I got a phone call reply. Her first question was ""Who ARE you??""... And that's when my stomach dropped through my feet and my heart started pounding in my ears. She had NO IDEA who I was. She didn't know I existed.
We talked on the phone for at least an hour (he was asleep still and I went outside to take the call), and basically her side of it was that they had been together for almost 3 years but things had been increasingly rocky and she had tried to break up with him many times. I had been dating him for the latter 2 years basically. SO MANY THINGS suddenly clicked into place...that ""friend"" he'd go stay with in the city when he had ""work"" for the week or the weekend? Her. Keeping his phone and computer with him at all times and never letting me see his Facebook or email. Never posting pics or statuses about us on Facebook. Not answering texts or phone calls for hours or days at a time. Why he showed up hours late for thanksgiving the year before. Grosser realizations like why I kept getting BV, and we had sex in the same unwashed bedding. Etc etc.

I felt really bad for her. At least I had my suspicions and knew about her. She was completely clueless and thought they were in a rocky but exclusive relationship. She had the same realizations - about the phone being off and not responding to texts; him disappearing for days and weeks at a time; BV infections. She almost couldn't believe me and burst into tears when I said I’d go wake him and she realized I was on a trip with him. I woke him up and held the phone out to him. He saw the number and hung it up. I told him I knew everything, that I had just talked to her for an hour. We talked, he was angry, he calmed down, he cried - I just felt completely numb.

Since we were in the middle of Texas on our way to California, I knew I either had to somehow scrape together money for a ticket home, or ride with him and talk it out over the next few days. I wish I had been able to just break things off with him then and there, but I didn't have much of a choice. I was broke so the decision was pretty much made.

Driving together for 12 hrs a day and staying in the same hotel room each night meant a lot of talking. I got a lot out of him. He admitted to fucking another girl right after a festival we had both been to (he told me he loved me for the first time at that festival), and then again when he went to her town to work another event a month or two later. Again, this was a woman I knew about and had suspicions about, but he convinced me she was just a friend. While on the road, I contacted her on facebook. she had no idea about me either and was convinced she had a special thing with him.

Another HUGE blow was, on the second day of driving after this blew up, he admitted to me that he was an active meth user. I was blown away and immediately more dots were connected - his irrational outbursts, his inability to sleep sometimes for days, disappearing by himself when we were out together and coming back with more energy than when he left, his weird on and off again sex drive. He said he used when he was really depressed so he could be productive and feel better, and had been using on and off for four years. I can still hardly believe I never saw it.

Needless to say, that trip was long and painful. But, after talking for so long on the road, and giving him a few weeks to grovel and apologize and profess his love for me, I fell back into it with him. I was tentative, and was very clear with him that he had broken every shred of trust I ever had with him and I was taking it slow. He was soooo smooth and knew just how to get me back, knew the right things to say and how to say them...

Then, I caught him in another lie at the end of January - I was checking his text messages (something I have never done before with any bf, wtf), and saw some flirty messages and confronted him. He got pissed that I was looking through his phone and vehemently denied there was something going on, made up a story about how she was the married lady next door to the house he was working on and she had a harmless crush on him. Of course I didn't believe him so I took the number and texted it myself. It was a woman he had met on okcupid and gone on a date with literally a few days before. I confronted him again and told him I was done.
Then, he flipped his shit.

That night, he broke into my house through the unlocked kitchen window, stole food out if my fridge and left me terrified. Then, he started threatening me, sending me horrible text messages (I counted one night - he sent me over 90 messages in one afternoon/evening). This went on for 2 days and I was terrified every night that he would break in and every day that he would fuck with my stuff (steal or break things). Finally, I was able to talk to him face to face and make him stop and leave my town. Two weeks later (and tons of long messages from him constantly), he started to get to me again.

Now, the reason I kept in contact was because I was scared he would do something to harm himself. I cared about him a lot (still do), and want him to do well. I was scared and wanted to be there for him. That was my mistake because he sucked me right back in. I was even more trepidatious than before, but I allowed myself to believe him when he said he was sorry and he was doing things right now. We have been slowly working things out and it's been getting better and better, until two weekends ago when we went out to a big weekend party with all my good friends. A lot of them knew him but only a few knew what I have been through with him. It was kind of a test. I wanted to see if he could have a good time and be relaxed and happy and get along with everyone.

He didn't. I mean, mostly he did, but afterward I got a lot of confused feedback from my friends as to why he was so angry and aggressive. I took that feedback, and the comments from my friends who knew the story, to end it for good and proper. No contact. No allowing him to slip into my life and suck me down again.
I am young and have a lot going for me. He needs psychiatric help, a steady job, and a real home. I REALLY hope he gets all that, but unfortunately I can’t wait around to see it. He was a ball and chain I am sad but relieved to be rid of.
(that was long but it felt really good to write. If you made it all the way through thank you for reading.)

EDIT -- I just blocked him on facebook and email. That was surprisingly difficult. The emotion that is bubbling up inside me now is mixture of anxiety and grief. I know that no contact is the only way to be able to move on though. Thank you for your support and kind words, TwoX.

t3_26lbfg,How do I tell my potentially long-term partner that I have been faking vaginal orgasms since the start...,"So... I have always faked vaginal orgasms. I love vaginal sex, it feels great and fulfilling, but its not gonna get me off. And thats fine! I have come to terms with that!

But for many of the men I've been with, not so much. When I am honest about never having a g-spot orgasm, many are convinced that ""I can ALWAYS get a girl off, you just havent been with a man like me."" Others dont have as much pleasure from the experience, because they enjoyed 'making me feel good' and dont understand that I could still enjoy the process without the orgasm at the end. Either way, I have just learned to fake it and everyone is happier.

So my current partner started out the same way, but turns out we fell in love and have been together for a little over a year now. We have moved in together, started sharing finances, etc. But I have never told him that I fake it when we have sex.

Now of course the clitoris gets lots of attention which is great! He does a damn fine job. I know I am being dishonest, but it seems like a bit of a white lie - it makes him feel good about the sex and about himself. And there is nothing he could do 'better' even if I did tell him, since my vag is just a bit numb and doesnt orgasm. 

So do I tell him? And how? I am just anticipating a bit of a dramatic reveal, where he yells ""how could you lie to meeeee""

t3_26l4kt,Need to vent about a 'discussion' I had with my brother.,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I really need to vent.

Before I continue let me mention a few things about my brother. He's 25 and I'm 23. We both live at home and work for our parents and dependent on them financially. He is currently finishing his junior year of college since he took two years off after the first semester of college due to an appendectomy. During those two years he didn't do much, from what I know. He would wake up and sleep late. He would spend his time playing poker or some computer game day and night. Currently, both of us work for our parents in a small shop. He works once a week, whereas I work six times a week. Every time he 's done with his shift I spend nine cleaning his mess. Honestly, if he wasn't my brother I would have him fired. He leaves the place a mess, and even after working for more than a year at the same place he still doesn't bother to learn about the things we sell.

So, tonight after watching a movie we went to have dinner. I mentioned how I enjoy a certain friends company because of the discussions we have. He said that the only reason why I enjoy it because she agrees with me. I disagreed with him saying that we disagree with each other but we accept each other's opinion. He said 'you're right.' And I joked 'like always'.
He said 'not really'. I said that it's just him agreeing with my opinion but it isn't right or wrong. He then mentioned something about how he's right most of the time since he thinks a lot more than me. I was offended. He doesn't know how often I think and how I think, and I told him that. He said he does by the way I do things. I told him that unless he's inside of my head and knows my thought process he can't know how I think. I told him that just because I have a certain behavior doesn't mean I think a certain way. 

He kept saying that he knew me and he knew people. I felt that was very condescending of him to think that way. He brought up our age difference and how he's wiser and smarter because of those years. I disagreed. I told him that I don't know if he is or isn't wiser than me and he shouldn't be so confident in knowing me. I also said that sometimes age isn't a factor in being wise but rather experiences. We argued the entire way and he was very adamant on changing my opinion. I told him that I wouldn't change it because it's what I think. I made sure to mention that I'm listening to what he has to say but I disagree and my point as to why I disagree. The whole thing ended when I got home and said, 'it's not about winning or losing but rather you accepting that I think different. I'm not gonna say you're right or I'm right.' He said, 'Exactly you won't say that because you don't want to think about it. We can discuss this for hours if you want but you can't since you don't want to think deeper.' I didn't reply and went to my room.

The reason I'm venting is because I feel like I was put down. I live in an household where they take my thoughts very lightly and believe that my brother is smarter than me. I don't voice my opinions too often because every time I do there is always someone trying to disprove me and I get emotional. What was worse was that we had my cousin sleeping over and every time I mentioned something I believe my brother would laugh and my cousin would laugh with him. It's really hard to hold your ground when they laugh at your opinions.  

tl;dr: Brother and I had a discussion which turned into an argument,and I feel put down.",0,20140527013417,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26ly8r,"""All women need and want to get raped."" The story of how I fended off a rapist. [Trigger Warning] and [Support] welcome.","I need to get this off my chest. I'm tired of telling this story, but I need to talk about it because it is bothering me. 

Saturday night I went out for a night on the town with a few coworkers. I got back around 2 am, was pretty intoxicated, and managed to lock my keys in my car. The drive from the bar to the complex was short as the bar was literally down the street, but I shouldn't have been driving.

Either way, I ran upstairs and got my sleepy roommate to unlock the door so I could grab a wire hanger. I changed out of my dress and into a loose t-shirt and shorts and went back downstairs. After a while of fumbling with my door, my keys were successfully back in my hands and I was ready for bed. 

A car pulled up behind my car. I stood at the passenger side and as the man got out and asked me if I needed help I just smiled and told him ""no thanks! I locked me keys in my car but I've gotten them back, so I'm good now!""

He kept walking towards me. I stood there, staring at him. He was talking as he walked. 

""Look, I know exactly how things work. Women are inferior to men, men are superior to women, and every women in this works wants and needs to get raped."" He grabbed my left arm and held it against the car. I popped off with ""is this some red pill bullshit?!"" Because A. I was drunk and didn't want to make any sudden moves and B. I had to mask the loud clicking noise that my 5.5 inch Smith and Wesson knife makes when it's opened. Having been born and raised in the deep South, I religiously keep it in the hollow of my right hip. 

He went on to talk about all of the extremely vulgar things he was *going* to do to me and pressed himself against me, flattening me against my car. 

He was shorter than me and I work out and lift weights every day. That and pure adrenaline made me capable of pushing off my car and spinning around with my knife plunging down towards his jugular. I stopped with the tip at his neck. I got in his face and put on my best crazy eye. It was then that I realized that he had super ""buggy"" eyes, like your typical meth head.

""Do you really wanna do this with ME OF ALL PEOPLE?"" Drunk me was pissed more than scared at this point. 

He stumbled backwards, screaming obscenities the whole time with his hands in the air. As soon as he got a good distance away, I bolted. Thankfully, my apartment is around a corner and he didn't see where I went. 

Drunk me is quite the problem solver. You see, when I don't know what to do, my solution is PASS OUT. I woke up the next day and my eyes shot open. My memories seemed like a dream. I ran outside and found my window on the drivers side smashed. Lovely. At this point I called the cops. 

The police officer was amazing. After about an hour of communication between me and his PD, and find out that a guy with the exact same car, physical description, and clothing got the cops called on him about an hour before for domestic abuse with his girlfriend, who has the *same exact physical description as me*. He has been quite the trouble maker for a while now and they needed something to get him off the streets. I would be contacted by a detective and will eventually go to a lineup. 

The officer also told me that he had a gun. It wasn't on him when he pressed up against me. I would have felt it. But, the officer told me multiple times that I should have stabbed him in the neck. My dad also said the same thing. ""He couldn't have shot at you if you had sliced him open"". Drunk me was worried about liability and just plain not wanting to kill someone. 

I would love to say that I feel all badass and confident, but I spend every second in this complex  looking over my shoulder. I have nightmares and spend my time pacing in this apartment when I'm not at work. I am moving in 4 days. It was going to be a month from now, but I can't take it.

I have 3 more days of work. Then I'm gone. 

Edit: It's not a true reddit post without someone messaging me and telling me that the most traumatic thing to ever happen to me didn't really happen. If mods want proof, I have the officers business card with the case number and pictures of my window.",165,20140527095611,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26m2gg,Is it okay to just flat-out not like your own mother? A discussion.,"I'm using a throwaway because I'm about to admit one of my darkest, deepest secrets.

I know that we are told by society that we have to love our mothers.  That we are family and we have to stick together.  That as women, our mothers should be our best friends.

But is it okay to just flat-out dislike your mother?

I often lay awake at night, unable to sleep because I am distraught over my feelings about my mother and how they conflict with how we are programmed to feel.  I know that if we weren't related, I would never speak to her.  I also know that if I didn't feel so horribly guilty about abandoning her, I wouldn't speak to her now.

My mom is incomprehensibly lazy.  She is a narcissist and her selfishness knows no bounds.  She lives in a fantasy world in which she  is never accountable and everyone else is to blame.  She cannot handle the truth.  She also believes everything is about her and nobody could possibly be more sick, more tired, more stressed, or more overworked than she.  And the worst part is that I think she is, deep down, jealous of my sisters and me for whatever reason.  Being around her makes me physically ill and stressed out for days after a visit.

The truth is, I deeply dislike her.  And these feelings make me sick.

t3_26lpfn,"As a house-girlfriend, I don't feel like I am doing enough.","This is my first time posting here and I don't really know what to say, so I guess I will emotionally-vomit and hope I feel better afterwards.

Apologies for the mess that follows.

So, my SO and I have been together for nearly 2 years now. We're planning on getting married at some point when we are more financially independent and then start a family. At the moment, I'm mostly a stay-at-home girlfriend. I cook, I clean, I do all the laundry, and I'm here to do other things that must be done during ""banking hours"" that could not, otherwise, be done.

However... I feel like I don't do enough for the household. I've expressed this to my SO and he's repeatedly told me ""I don't care whether or not you get a job, I just want you to be happy."" I'm paranoid and depressed (with depression, not like sad all the time) and so sometimes that feels like... not enough. I'm sure I am being judged by basically everyone because he works 40+ hours a week at a job he loves and I probably do about 10 hours of ""work"" at home when it comes to household work.

I know my family thinks I'm a worthless piece of shit because I don't work. This is mostly because, in my family, your value is determined by how much you do and how much money you make.

To be fair, I guess, I am kinda, sorta work-working. I bring home enough money with my highly sparse and variable job as a transcriptionist a month to pay for 1/2 the groceries and all bills I incur by myself (cell, credit cards, etc), but...

I dunno. I guess I want support? I don't really want to work (edit, I phrased this poorly in that the work I am qualified to do is something that doesn't make me happy), and I have very little energy to really do anything. Going to school 15+ hours a week is extremely exhausting and leaves me stressed and whatnot, but during the times I don't I school, I feel that same exhaustion even though I don't do nearly as much.

I run, I eat fruit and veg and I drink alot of water, but I know I'm never going to look like those girls. I'm always going to be a bit chubby, have armpit fat and a lack of a thigh gap, I just wish I didn't feel like such a failure for not wanting to do all this stuff.

t3_26me5e,(Update) [Support] Standing up for myself,"OK, I'm a bit nervous posting here cause of the new default and everything I saw, but the last time I posted 4 months ago I got some good comments and pms so I wanted to update everyone/ maybe provide a good story for someone in similar shoes who can't find the strength to stand up for themselves.

About four months ago I posted this... http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1vvl0p/standing_up_for_myself_trigger_warning/

At that time I was lost at what I could do. I was scared and felt like I was reverting back to the younger girl I used to be who got abused several times and did nothing about it.

So the turning point with these feelings was getting back into school. My new school has been so helpful with picturing my future and helping me get everything set up for trying to get into grad school that I started getting my self confidence back. When the semester was almost over I was ranting to a few classmates over the situation and they gave me some good advice on tasers and pepper sprays to look for.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to find a place to work that will work around my school schedule so it was back to the farm for me this year.   I have been talking to the owner of the farm and she and I thought it was best to not discuss the situation where I called the cops until we could meet face to face. Well due to our schedules that day wasn't until today.

The owner was very nice about everything. She made sure before we talked that we went into her office where it would be private. I explained the situation to her and she immediately felt bad. She informed me that he was at the farm right now in the fields. She then said, ""We were already trying to find a replacement for him but we will be speeding the process up and the second we find someone he's gone."" She then said he will only be in the fields and at all times be kept so far away from me (kinda like a farm restraining order which I liked). If A so much as comes near me or tries to talk to me unless it's 100% necessary for the farm operations he will be fired immediately. They will be sitting him down and discussing all of this with him before I come back to the farm.

I told her that I will be carrying mace/pepper spray/ or a taser with me just in case since he's not stable and if he does approach me there might not be enough time to warn anyone. She was completely ok with that which makes me feel a lot better about all of that.

All in all I feel like I got my control back on the situation. If he tries to approach me, I know what I need to do and I will not be holding back. He will be fired from the farm which will make things better. It will also be good records for the police for just in case he tries anything. While I couldn't get any protection from him legally yet, my boss has been more than willing to implement her own form of a restraining order of sorts which will keep him away from me and always a field away from where I will be. Also, I will be taking on more responsibility on the farm and might be heading the busiest farmer's market we do this year which means more time and money for me before the next semester begins.

So I just wanted to thank the people who replied to the first post I made and who sent me pms. Everyone here gave me the right amount of support and stories to help keep me on the path I of sticking up for myself and taking control of the situation. I do admit I am still a bit nervous because he is so big compared to me, but I also know that I have a support group behind me that takes away any of the control and overpowering nature he had.",11,20140527123615,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26mvqk,Feminism IS NOT about elevating women above men and why we need feminism. (WARNING: May Contain Extreme Sexism),"[My previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/24oyzs/so_i_got_a_lot_of_shit_for_being_a_feminist_and/) about my experience as an Asian woman and a feminist had garnered much attention. I’ve decided to make a relevant post but this time about Western women, specifically white women. The following are based on my encounter with western white expats I had met while doing volunteer works in Asia. Let me first say this is just SOME of the expats I’ve met and by no means am I trying to stereotype.  The purpose of this post is to illustrate how SOME men still subscribed to these awful misogynist attitudes, and let me warn you, it ain’t pretty. 

1.	Some of the vitriol they spilled against western white women is just palpable. They think that western women are “ruined” by feminism. That they have turned into man hating femnazis, and they don’t know how to appreciate a “nice guy”. Unlike their eastern counterparts whom are demure and knows how to take care of a man.  

2.	Slut shaming western women.  Saying how the sex-positive aspect of feminism has turned them into sluts. They ride the “cock carousel” in their younger years and as they get older they desperately seek a schmuck to settle down. This is damn hypocritical coming from people who flew half way across the world to get laid. The gross part is a lot of them are English teachers who are there to teach little kids. 

3.	Apparently if you are a woman and when you get fat and old you ain’t worth shit. They say that Western women do not age well and a lot them are fat, while Asian women age better and are slimmer. I explained to them that is partly due to eastern society being very heavy on fat shaming and that puts a lot of pressure on young Asian girls. The response I got is all sort of excuses and mansplaining about why this fat shaming is actually good. I agree for health reasons people should stay fit, but it just reeks of hypocrisy seeing how a lot of them aren’t in the best shape and they want a slim woman. 

4.	They seem to have no empathy for sexism and other issues that women experience. You know how sometimes when there is a post decrying sexism and some dudes would comes in trying to marginalized the conversation and turn it into “what about the menz!”, or they would say that we are just overreacting? Well, that happens a lot in subs like AsianTwoX. Whenever we have posts about yellow fever creepers and microagressions we had experienced as Asian women, creepy dudes and expats would come in trying to derail the conversation, saying that we are just overreacting. Apparently if you have an Asian gf or wife that makes you the authority on dictating what Asian women should or should not find offensive. They would even take our posts and cross-post them to subs like /Chinacirclejerk (full of sexpats) to mock us and call us whiny cunts. I guess it hurts their ego that the “submissive and demure” Asian women are speaking out against them. 

What’s worse is they actually think they are the victim. They think feminism have turned women against them. Oh no not because of their backward-ass misogynist thinking /s. 

Some of you may probably still feel feminism threatens your masculinity, but consider this; would you want your daughter or niece or your love ones to be with any of these men?

t3_26mtm8,Mixed information on how often to get pap smears...,"So I am 26 and had a pap in 2011-3 years ago, and by most information I am finding, I am reading that it would mean I am due for one. When I went to Planned Parenthood a year ago, they said that I was due for one even though it had only been two years...and then when I did get my pap smear that doctor told me it was every 3, which is why last year, it didn't make sense to me. 

Last week, I went to a different doctor in urgent care because I was afraid I had strep throat (I didn't) and the doctor mentioned pap smears and she just outright asked if I get pap smears and I said yes and she said, ""Every three years OR every five if it's normal."" I had a normal pap in 2011, have not changed sexual partners (have only ever had one) so I'm wondering if what the most recent doctor said is correct. I'm only reading every 5 years for women over the age of 30. 

Does anyone know if every 5 years if it's normal for women my age is a new thing? I have an appointment for a birth control consult to get my rx refilled, but not to get a pap or exam and when I made the appointment, no one told me that I was due for it. If it truly is 3 years then I might want to change my appointment so I can take care of everything all at once and not have to come back, but if its every 5 years now with normal paps, I'd really like to not have to go in yet, because no one likes pap smears!!! 

If they tell me at my appointment that I am due for one, I suppose I could just ask them about the 5 year thing, and if I am in fact due for one then I guess I'll just come back sometime this summer. ",2,20140527150415,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_26moii,Sertraline decreasing my sex drive... need advice that doesn't involve adjusting my medication.,"Throwaway because boyfriend is on reddit. 

So, a little background, ever since I hit the sexual part of puberty I've had a very high sex drive all throughout high school. This of course continued into college when I met my current boyfriend. He was a virgin, so basically I was his first sexual experience. Since my sex drive was so high we had sex as often as possible, practically every day of the week. 

This continued until a sebaceous cyst on my vaginal entrance (I know, nasty) burst, then my high sex drive lowered a little bit. Then this year was particularly dramatic and I was having a ton of issues with anxiety and depression so I started taking zoloft/sertraline. I started at 20mg in January and now I'm on to 100mg. It's improved my mood a great deal, so I don't plan on taking a break at the moment. 

A common side effect of it, however, is a lowered sex drive. So instead of having sex 6-7 times a week, it's gone down to 2-3, sometimes less if I'm busy.

Now of course this hasn't gone well for my boyfriend. Since I practically trained him to having sex so much, I can understand that suddenly cutting down is difficult. However it saddens me to see him so disappointed when I say no. He appears to take it personally even though he understands I am on this medication. I am still indeed attracted to him, and no one else, but I just don't feel like having sex most of the time anymore. 

I've gone to two people about this, my mother and my therapist. Generally I see them as very supportive and loving people but their solutions to the problem have been frustrating. My mom suggested I skip a day or two of it and my therapist mentioned different SSRI's. 

While I'm pretty sure they would help I'm a little annoyed that **I'm** being seen as the one with the problem that needs fixing. I honestly don't think that sex 2-3 times a week is that unhealthy!

So, any ways of working things out with my boyfriend that do NOT involve changing my meds?",0,20140527141616,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_26m087,*Could* this be a UTI?,"I've never been to a doctor before, I've always been really normal and healthy and the like. Been to a chiropractor for my scoliosis for two years but that's it.

However, based on guessing (my dog has had one before) I *think* I might have a UTI? I really don't want to bring it up unless it's a serious possibility and I feel like I might be blowing it out of proportion.

- I've been getting like super super mild period cramps that last for 20 seconds maybe once an hour, but not on my period.
- I've been feeling really dehydrated despite drinking about the same I usually do in my life.

t3_26lp8c,I had a revelation today.,"I have followed from a distance feminism and other egalitarian ideological stances. Me being what i am i held a slight skepticism towards them. I held the view that they were valid and basically correct views. Feminism was one were I have more than one objection but that's not for here to discuss for right now. 

My revelation was a more intimate encounter with what a woman can go through. I was getting groceries and i went to the check out that had a very shy nerdy looking girl at the register. first I thought she was kind of cute. nothing wrong so far. Then I had a sexual fantasy pop in my head. I would rather not say what it was but it was not a non-consensual fantasy. anyone have a theme of fantasy when you see a person of a certain type? That's what made me feel strange at first. Then i realized something. She looked trusting, weak and exposed for some dickhead to use and abuse. She might not have been, just that she could be what I described. 

I know I can't understand completely but I feel that I know just a little better about your point of view. I hope you don't have this happen to you for real. I hope this isn't too much of a downer. Because I feel pretty bad right now.

I just made this account to tell this thing so I guess this is some what of a throwaway.",0,20140527081316,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
