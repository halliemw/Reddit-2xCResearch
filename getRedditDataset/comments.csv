Is there some kind of bizzaro version of everything here that they've given their own names to -- a kind of parallel universe?

The imgur 'community' perfectly illustrates Plato's cave allegory:

>Plato has Socrates describe a gathering of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them, and begin to designate names to these shadows. The shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality. He then explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall do not make up reality at all, as he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners.


The 'imgurians' are the people chained to the cave wall. All they see on imgur are shadows. They know nothing of their origin or context until they venture outside the cave that is imgur.

All is going well until I realize we are out of one of them and I have to tell her I have to order it for the next day. She was ok with it at first, but then I see tears building. I ask if she is ok and says yes, so I continue typing up the prescriptions (I want to say there was about 8 or 9).

Next thing I know, she begins crying. She starts telling me that she was just released from a psych ward and she had tried to kill herself a couple weeks back. She rolled up her sleeves and her arms were covered in deep cuts.

She began to ask me if I thought she would ever get re-accepted to nursing school because apparently they kick you out after getting admited to a hospital for psychological symptoms. I had no idea what to tell her except that I hoped she got in and that if she worked hard they should give her a chance.

I have been in similar situations (though none so drastic as that young woman, for which I am thankful). I'm sick, I'm exhausted, I'm depressed and trying my 5th medication, and there's something wrong whether the prescription can't be filled or my insurance isn't covering it.

Sometimes the pharmacy tech was just fine -- patient, professional, told me kindly to come back if I needed to make some calls first. Sometimes the tech was rude/impatient. But there was this one tech who was AWESOME. She was explaining possible side-effects of this anti-depressant (standard) and I was just about in tears because I was so tired of hearing it and she just looks at me and says, ""Oh honey, this isn't the first one you've tried, is it? I really hope this works for you. You just keep trying. It'll be alright."" And she smiled.

Just that tiny bit of humanity made my week. Even if the young woman in your story didn't go back to school, it probably meant the world to her that a stranger of a pharmacy tech took the time to listen to her and said something kind.

Third year of medical school on my family medicine rotation which I'm doing on my med school's campus academic health center. Electronic medical record shows 24 year old with chief complaint of cough so I go in to interview her where it comes to light she's really there for vaginal itching. Finish up the interview and tell her I'm going to grab my attending for the pelvic exam. My attending tells me she'll let me do the pelvic if the patient consents (I had already done ob/gyn at this point and was quite comfortable with it) but we both agree I'd likely get asked to leave the room altogether. Lo and behold, patient consents, I do the pelvic, we write her a script for some antifungals and she goes home.

Two days later, I'm teaching a small group of first year students how to perform an abdominal physical exam (teaching is a requirement of the family medicine rotation) when, during introductions, I come face to face with my patient who never mentioned she was a first year student. We both play it off really cool at first but during the session, her partner asks me to show him how to do an inguinal/femoral hernia examination on a female patient AKA his partner. While I'm doing my exam, she breaks out in hysterical laughter which causes me to lose it and start laughing at the absurdity of the situation as well. She played it off like she was ticklish and I said something stupid like ""I thought of something funny, don't mind me.""

Two weeks later, she returns to the clinic for a follow up and I go see her. We talk for a while about how she's feeling, how awkward our second meeting was and then just shoot the shit for a bit when she goes ""So when are you going to take me out to dinner?"" I politely declined and explained I had a girlfriend at the time and never saw her again.

20140423065828,MADTurnUP,"Working in ED at a large hospital without any paediatrics or obs-gyn. Just about to finish night shift when I am asked by a nurse to quickly see an 18 year old with abdominal pain. I was exhausted and didn't want to pick up another patient but I just had a weird feeling.

Went to see the patient. She was a thin girl lying in bed under the covers in the fetal position with her worried mum sitting nearby. I ran through a brief history and was about to examine when she stated she needed to go to the toilet. She looked to be in a lot of pain so I asked for a nurse to escort her. At this point the patient, her mum and myself thought it was a burst appendix.

Next thing I know the nurse yanks me down the corridor and shoves me into the bathroom. Before me stands a thin 18 year old girl bearing down in a squat with a now noticable baby bump repeating ""don't tell mum, don't tell mum, don't tell mum!"".

I throw her in a nearby bed and charge into the resus area leaving the mum unbeknownst in her cubicle. I grab my boss who goes white and starts shouting ""Why's she here? Why's she here?!?(And not the obstetric hospital"". We run back in by which time she is fully dilated and pushing. We successfully deliver a beautiful baby boy while constantly freaking out about the lack of pediatric supplies. We didn't even have clips for umbilical cords but we improvised.

Throughout this time the girl is either pushing or begging us not to tell her mum while we keep saying ""she drove you here! You can't hide a god damn baby"".

The girl wanted to keep the baby and ultimately we convinced her to tell her mum. I told the mum her daughter was safe but there was something I needed to show her. The look when I brought mum into the resus room was unlike anything I have ever seen: Anger mixed with concern mixed with joy mixed with confusion.

What.a.crazy.Fucking.Day. that.was.

20140422231523,fudgemental,"Being a resident in Saudi Arabia, there' a huge stigma attached to male attendings examining female patients, especially those with gynecological issues. Also, being a foreigner residing here, some customs and practices catch me completely off-guard at times.

That being said, I was once in charge of my consultant's OPD during a ob-gyn rotation, said consultant having left early thinking all major cases and appointments had been dealt with, and left me to clean up any stragglers in the last hour.

In walks a 40-ish year old mother with her 18 year old daughter, both completely covered from head to toe in burqas, who then proceeds to throw a tantrum about how the consultant wasn't there for her appointment, and how she left a male resident in-charge of the OPD. A cursory examination of the daughter's file didn't reveal any history which would've helped me decide if my superior should get involved.

I then began to try to talk her down, asking her what her appointment was about, and how I was in-charge of the department (I didn't dare reveal I was just a lowly resident) and I would do everything in my power to help her out with any issues her daughter had been having.

After a lengthy conversation I find out that the daughter was there for virginity verification because she was to be engaged and subsequently married off that month (and appointments in my hospital's OPD are a bitch to get), and they needed to present that certificate along with some others (regarding finances, geneology and a few others) to the prospective groom during the engagement ceremony.

I went completely numb, detached, examined the poor girl silently (she was in the stirrups naked from the waist down and burqa above that - not even an eye slit), and discovered, for the first time, a stack of thick, extremely official looking certificates in a desk drawer, to be given to women who pass the examination.

I have since performed that examination close to 30 times, and have seen quite a few females who didn't have an intact hymen, and actually sobbed quietly in shame during the examination. I try to explain to the family that hymen rupture is in no way a sign of promiscuity or even sexual penetration. To those people I know wouldn't understand, I just certify their duaghters' virginities and tell the girl to come up with an excuse later on to their families.

Damn, someone tells on me and I'm gonna be facing one helluva malpractice suit.

Even fairy tales kinda just throw you into the middle of whatever is going on and you have to just accept it. I've been working on a story for a while now and I couldn't decide how to start, then I decided that all I had to do was get the main character thinking/talking and the rest just fell into place. I'm really happy with how it turned out. 

I find the easiest thing to do is to have your character in the middle of some task, it can be significant or mundane, but don't explain why your character is doing this task right away. Let the reader figure that out themselves. 

If you are introducing your character to a universe that he is unaware of, then the reader will be able to follow along and learn as the main character does (ie Ellen Page's character in Inception) There is a formal name for this type of character, but I don't remember it. I just call it the ""newbie strategy.""

If your character is already aware of the universe then it's usually a simple task of having him/her reflect on the past to explain the things that can't be inferred or have a ""history buff"" (Obi-Wan) character explain the setting and backstory. Hope this helps. 

Btw if anyone is interested I may post my story when I find a good stopping point. It won't be anywhere near done, but I'm curious what people will think about it and I'm a bit nervous to show it to anyone I know.

Haven't really done much practice so far because it's a loud instrument, and I'm a very self-conscious person sometimes, living in a block of flats where I do actually talk to the other tenants, so I'd feel really awkward playing basic scales over and over, knowing everyone could hear my shitty playing...

And no one stares. All the extras in the scene go about their business as though nothing weird were going on. In real life, they would be shocked and scared and would gawk awkwardly at the cops who came to interview them about their DEAD CO-WORKER!! Whose body was found yesterday! The boss faces the camera, marches forward while delivering a monologue/answering interview questions and lets the cops follow him/her around the entire damn place. What is this, a tour?! The cops didn't ask you for a tour of the place!

If someone came to interview you about something as serious as A MURDER, you would invite them into your office, make sure the door was shut, sit down face-to-face with them and politely answer their questions. Making someone interview you and follow behind you while you walk around and go about your daily business is SUPER rude. Also, broadcasting info about your dead employee and company secrets within the hearing of dozens of people is just bad for you. That would make you look really bad. ",130,t3_23qnlt

One of the Dark Brotherhood missions involves assassinating a bride during her public wedding reception.  You get bonus points for killing her as she's making a speech on a balcony with her new husband by her side.


Already pretty evil, right?  Well, I decided to get creative.


One of the fun things you can do with pickpocketing in skyrim is planting a poison on the target which will then take effect.  So here's what I did.  I planted a black soul gem and a dagger enchanted with the soul trap on the groom, stole his existing weapon so he'd go right for the dagger in the event of a fight... then planted a powerful *frenzy* poison on him.


Not only did the groom spontaneously lose his mind and brutally murder his bride in front of a crowd of horrified onlookers, he stole her very soul, too.  A guard killed him shortly thereafter and I took that his bride's freshly harvested soul from his corpse.",423,t3_23q8nb

Let's say I have a goal and i know if I complete this goal I can feel accomplished in life.

So let's say I'm constantly giving 97% and thus am not reaching my goal.

It would appear from my POV that my goal is one of their unattainable goals but unbeknownst to me, it is possible I just have to keep going and give it a little more, and keep trying and keep my mind to it.

20140423035321,Badwriterthrowaway,"I'm late to the party on this (but hey, it's better than coming too early right), so this will probably get buried.  However, if it helps just one person satisfy their partner better then this will all have been worth it.  For the sake of disclosure, I am a heterosexual male and will therefore deal with my own personal experience. I'm going to stick to relatively vanilla stuff for now, but if there's demand I can delve into the darker arts of sex.

**Your Partner**
Remember, this is (at least) a two person experience and your partner's satisfaction should for the most part be your primary concern.  I genuinely believe if you are **both** interested in pleasing the other person, the sex can and, with work, will be mindblowing.  I'm assuming you're reading this because that is of importance to you.  As I'm sure many have said, communication is extremely valuable and you need to be comfortable making yourself vulnerable with your partner in order to find out what works for them and how you can improve (I'm assuming that this isn't referring to one night stands, but there's no reason it can't be applicable).  

I appreciate that it is awful to have to make yourself feel vulnerable, but once you do it it will be thrilling, so step out there and do so.  Even if this is just a one night stand, a sentence like ""if there's anything you want me to do differently, don't be afraid to tell me.  I want to make this as good as possible for you"" is never going to get a bad reaction.  In my experience it only turns them on more.  **Remember**, your partner is not identical to any other person in the world.  That means what works on one, may work on another, but it equally may not.  

**You**
To really enjoy it, you're going to have to put yourself outside of your comfort zone.  I think that's true for a lot of things.  That doesn't mean you have to be hog-tied and anally impaled by 8 German businessmen (unless that's your thing), but you do need to be confident and willing to make yourself vulnerable as stated above.  You need to be confident, willing to try things and comfortable with your own limits.  

Although your dedication to making somebody else satisfied is wonderful, doing something that makes you feel uncomfortable will not help with that aim.  People can tell these things and if you're not enjoying it, stop.  Similarly, if they're not enjoying it, stop.  Being nervous is fine, being uncomfortable or feeling pressured is not.  Consider different situations that may arise beforehand and think about whether you are comfortable with them.  Note, this answer may change in the act.

**Kissing**
I know you're thinking, I've got this down, I've had my technique locked since I got my first kiss behind the bike-shed at 14.  This is the first place you need some flexibility.  Most people have their own preferred technique, whether it's pecking or face-eating.  I've had compliments on my kissing not necessarily because I'm great at one style, but probably more because I reference their style.  

There are times where the passion of a situation may completely override this, but when you're first getting to know someone and kissing them, start with pecking and work up.  People who don't like much tongue tend to feel uncomfortable when there's too much, but those who like a lot are less fussed when it's not there because you can always graduate to it.  The three predominant styles I've noticed are pecking, pulsing tongues and the washing machine.  

Pecking involves more rapid, short kisses using the lips, perhaps with one person's lips locking around the other's but very little (if any) tongue involved.  Pulsing tongues involved tongues that explore the partner's mouth but don't stay there.  For want of a better way of describing it, it's like licking their tongue.  The washing-machine involves putting your tongue in their mouth and whirling it around.  This is my least favourite method, but I've known girls who only kiss this way.  People (at least where I'm from) tend not to discuss exactly what you're meant to do and so if you do something completely different people may think you're weird.  However, I find reciprocating kissing techniques a good way to relax your partner and make them feel comfortable around you.

Kissing doesn't just involve the mouth of course.  Explore their body with your mouth.  Areas you may wish to focus on are ear-lobes, behind and under the ear, the neck (if accessible the back of the neck has proved popular in the past).  Don't rush past these points if you have the time.  Although you might sense they want more, or it might seem boring to you, building a sense of anticipation is very important if you're going to drive them crazy.  

**The Breasts**
Congratulations!  You've just spent 5-10 minutes kissing them and their necks and the same amount of time fumbling with their bra clasp while muttering ""I don't get it, I've never had a problem doing this before"", simultaneously trying to show that you're actually experienced but showing you're slightly insecure too.  Don't fret if you can't do it easily.  Yes, it would be nice to get it right but don't let it play on your mind if you can't, even make a joke of it.  It's not a big deal and nothing to worry about.  Anyhow, they're out now, so what to do.  

**Again, it depends on the person.**  They are, in my experience, considerably more sensitive than male chests and nipples, so treat them with care.  Of course, if the sex is passionate you can be more rough, but don't use them as bongos or try to permanently change the shape as if they were play-dough.  Treat them more as a soft dough, kneading them with care.  In my opinion, it's considerably more fun to use your mouth here anyway.  

Don't make a beeline for the nipples right away.  Use it as another chance to enjoy building some anticipation.  Enjoy watching the nipples get smaller and more erect before sucking on them.  After a while, I recommend graduating to nibbling, but be light, you're not pulling the pin from a grenade here.  Roughness is something you can build up, but again, don't go there too quickly.  Even if she likes it rough, unless she's specifically told you, there's a chance being too rough too soon isn't a good choice.  It's always better to err on the side of caution for now.  You've enjoyed your time on the first nipple, now, as a guy, you're probably thinking ""I don't want to leave the other out"", so get on over there and give that some loving too.  Once you feel that it's time to move on, you can head further south.  Again, build some anticipation and don't just go mouth -> breasts -> vagina.  Spend some time over the stomach, working up the inner things.  Then, you can move on to the vagina",34,t3_23pw9d
20140423035343,Badwriterthrowaway,"**The Clitoris**
Find it.  If you can't find it, ask for directions.  Yes, I know, we're male and we don't like to ask.  We'd rather sit and look at a map, puzzled before doing what we thought in the first place.  While that's great for finding the hotel (ladies may disagree here), it isn't acceptable when it comes to the clitoris.  Some tips for finding it:  It's at the top when you work your way down from the stomach, about a few centimetres above the hole.  

If it's hard to work it out, ask her to tell you where feels good.  A word of warning, the clitoris and the pee-hole (I'm not a doctor, can you believe it), are relatively close to one another.  Be careful, if you slip  towards that it can be exteremely uncomfortable and spoil the mood.  That said, don't let that stop you.  Sadly, we learn by our mistakes and it's how we get better.

The next thing, once you've found it is appreciate two things.  The first is that it can be very, very sensitive.  Be very gentle the first time, until you really know how your partner's anatomy works.  You don't have to be feather-light, but imagine that the lightness of touch you'd like someone to have if they're holding your left testicle between their thumb and forefinger.  A little pressure is fine, too much is not a good idea immediately.  The second, and as I've said before, is that everybody's is different and it may take a very long time for somebody to attain an orgasm in this way, if they're able to at all.  My advice is stick at it, and tell them how much you're enjoying doing it.  People can tend to feel uncomfortable if they feel it's taking ages so reassure them.  Let them know that you're loving it, it will help them to get into it.  

Some people will not be able to come this way no matter how long you're there.  There's a good chance they'll stop you before you you even get there.  Don't insist if they stop you, even if you think this is your biggest skill.  

If you've got there, don't just go side to side or up and down like a nodding dog.  Mix things up.  For most guys this will mean the alphabet trick (spelling every letter on their clit).  If you want to write something you'd like to do to them.  If you're confident enough you can tell them what you're writing (again, it depends on your connection with them).  The changes of direction generally get a good reception.  If they're really getting into it, you can start to ramp up the pressure.  With my gf, by the time she's climaxing the force of my head is against it with my tongue and lips all working it at the same time, my head shaking side to side.  

Again, build it up slowly and appreciate their limits.  If you find you can apply a lot more pressure, do it as it can help lead to a climax.  It's harder to tell when you get a climax here, but you will feel like their vagina is pushing against your face and they will likely be moaning quite audibly.  Keep going until they tell you to stop.  Additionally, when guys come, our dicks get sensitive.  The same can happen with clits, but not always.  Have fun finding out.

If you're using your fingers here, make sure you've got some lube or at the very least use your mouth to keep your fingers wet.  If it gets dry the friction can make it uncomfortable for them and that makes it harder to enjoy it.  I find it much more difficult to stay on the right point with my fingers, but the advantage is they can hold their hand over yours and guide you.  I like this as it gives them what they want and I find it hot.

**Penetration**
Good news and bad news.  The good news is, the g-spot easier to find than the clitoris.  If you put in two fingers and curl them back towards you, you should feel a slightly spongey but ribbed ""pad"".  This is the g-spot, a source of immense pleasure.  The bad news:  Not all girls can get off on it, with some finding it very uncomfortable when it receives too much attention (or so I've been told).  The great thing is though, if you can spend time working on it, this can be a great way to give an orgasm.  

When I was younger, as a result of too much porn, I had a complex about the size of my penis.  As it happens, it turns out mine is actually above average and not every guy is weilding a gigantic pole (and not every girl wants that).  This was, however, the best thing that could have happened to me.  As a result, I researched (extensively on left-handed websites) how to use my fingers and my tongue to satisfy a woman, even if I couldn't with my penis.  I spent plenty of time practising these and as a result, I got pretty good at them.  So the fingers are my go-to if I want to get a girl off.  If people think fingering is for 15 year olds fuck them, they're missing out.  Anyway, depending on circumstances, use lube.  Even if they're really wet, the movement is somewhat abrasive and lube tends to make it more pleasurable.  

I tend to use my middle and ring finger.  If they are flat on their back, and you kneeling over them, slide the two fingers in and stroke up and towards you (on the g-spot).  Again, follow the rule of gentle at first, increasing the pressure.  Use the index and little finger to stabilise your hand against the tops of their inner thighs.  This will take the pressure off of your wrist and allow you to go for longer.  The great advantage of this is it frees your mouth for kissing or dirty talk.  

Speaking of dirty talk, even if you don't feel too comfortable, I recommend you say some things.  Ask if they like it, but do so by describing what you're doing ""Do you like it when I rub your g-spot?"" for example.  If they say yes, you could use this opportunity to step it up, telling them how naughty they are.  Then you can start to build up more by asking if they'd like you to do other things or telling them what you want to do to them.  Avoid offensive terms for now, you can build up to them.  As it is, although my gf likes being called all manner of things in bed, sometimes ""naughty little girl"" is all it takes.  If you start to feel like they're getting tighter and the muscles pulsing on your fingers, congratulations, you've made them come.  

By this point, if they're not faking it, you may well hear audible moans, and see an arched back and hands gripping at the sheets.  Don't stop as soon as it starts, keep going until the moment passes or they tell you to stop.

Now full on sex time.  Use protection kids.  Remember, even if you're not massive, you don't need a huge penis to stimulate the g-spot.  It will likely depend more on the position.  Experiment.  A lot.  Find the ones that they find really good.  After a year of great sex with my gf we were still finding new positions that worked.  I usually start out on top, and I like to talk to them and kiss them at this point.  You can use this as an opportunity to remind them to tell you if they want you to do it faster or if they like something and they want more of it.  This usually gets a good reception.

Although by this point, you may be desperate to come, try to keep it going for as long as possible, as you have a greater chance of pleasing her.  Some girls cannot come from penetration, although I've known girls to say they can't but have.  I think some will say it to take the pressure off, but for some it can be an issue.  Remember, experiment with a lot of things.  Regardless, if you've followed the above you should have given them a good time by now and if you're unable to give too much here, don't worry, there's always next time.  You may want to get behind her so you feel more in control, or give her control by letting her ride you.  Find out what works for you both and enjoy it.

20140423035406,Badwriterthrowaway,"**troubleshooting**

Erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation are common and they are nothing to be embarrassed about.  I suffered from the latter for a few years (as a result of the aforementioned complex) and it was completely psychological.  The more pressure I put on myself to last longer the quicker I'd come.  It seems my brain only listened to the word ""come"" when I was saying ""don't come"".  It wasn't enjoyable and I felt a failure. You have to remember in this situation though you can still show the other person a good time.  Even if you're met with ""did you finish already?"", you can still please them.  Or you can explain.  

The way I got past it was being up front with partners before anything happened.  It usually needed alcohol and something like ""tell me a secret"" or such conversation, but once they knew it was possible, the pressure was off entirely.  As for ED, the same principle applies, the more pressure you put on yourself the more difficult it will become.  You need to talk about it with them.  In both cases, they may think it's their fault, which it's not, but remember it doesn't devalue you.  When I managed to open up and talk about it, it went away and only comes back in extreme circumstances now which are complex enough for me not to worry about them.

This took about 1.5hrs so I hope it's been useful to someone.  I know it got a little rushed at the end but I had places to be.  If there's any specific questions I'd be happy to try and answer.

As is the story of my life, that was longer than I thought.  I hope it helps.

The sound of the young man's heart and the heavy breathing of the old one accompanied each other, waiting for the sun to rise, or maybe waiting for the universe to end.

""What are you looking at grampa?""

""Oh Ian, I didn't see you there... I was just... I'm trying to catch a glimpse of the sky, but it's too cloudy... I was hoping it dissipated a little but it looks like it's not gonna happen."" His eyes turned back towards the dimly lit room.

""Why do you wanna see the sky? It's just gonna be black, there's no moon out tonight.""

""I know... I know... That's why I want to see it. It reminds me of the time	I spent out there."" He paused a moment. ""Did I tell you about the time I was trapped for four days on the Mars Orbiter 4?""

Ian had heard the story the day before at around the same time, he just didn't have the heart to tell him that he did.

""No, what was that about?""

""We had been waiting for observation instructions, I think it it was the year 2611. They had told us to wait for instructions, and it was just me and your grandmother you know? That's where we met. Anyway, the war with the Julians was going on strong in those days, and as we sat there, looking at our beautiful red world, one of those... umm... I don't remember the name, but it was one of those big war cruisers, one of them passed right by us, and its electrical field sent my little orbiter back to the stone age."" 

""Really? I didn't think they had orbiters in the stone age.""

The old man chuckled. ""You're a smartass aren't ya?""

""Yeah... I guess I am.""

""No. You're a nice boy. Come here and get my bed closer to the window. I want see if the clouds cleared up a little.""

Ian complied and sat back down, and the old man directed his eyes again towards the dark clouds of the night.

""Anyway... We sat there playing card games for hours, we even made up some... some... We were bored out of our minds..."" the old man's speech began to slur as he fell prey to the inevitable cycle of sleep. ""We talked about the future..."".

Ian watched his grandfather's eyes close and he leaned over to see if he was in a comfortable position.

""You know something Ian?"" The old man whispered.

""What's that?""

""I know I already told you that story yesterday... I just like telling it... It reminds me of better days, and I want you to remember me like that. Not like this frail old man."" He opened his eyes briefly and smiled. ""Now go on... I know you want to see your friends. Go have fun, I'll be sleeping here.""

Each went their own separate way unaware of the other's destination. While the old man thought Ian was going to visit friends, he instead left the hospital to take a long walk in a park nearby; And while Ian thought he was leaving his grandfather to sleep, the old man instead took the opportunity to die in peace, to embark on the lone man's journey alone, gazing at the dissipating clouds of the city of Avantis.",17,t3_23qcti

They left partway through The Mummy which outraged childhood me so I went upstairs to chew them out and tell them about the awesome movie they were missing. I get to their bedroom door and I hear this noise. Clap, clap, clap. Not only had they abandoned Brendan Fraser and I but they had LIED! They were in their room, awake and playing some god damned clapping game and so of course I yelled ""I CAN HEAR YOU GUYS CLAPPING IN THERE"". Awful.

The simplest answer would be: Have sex. And do it a lot. Just try your best to get it done while you are still young and fit. If you are gay you should do it even more, just to piss homophobes off. And because sex is awesome. 

On a less primitive note I have some suggestions:

Learn another language. Or try to get familiar with the basics of several other languages. Like getting to know how words are pronounced, learning some elementary grammar and a good amount of different phrases. This knowledge can be useful in everything from visiting foreign countries to understanding the basics of another country's cuisine. Or you could just use it to impress people by casually share your wisdom whenever you get the chance. They will not be impressed though. Still, it's a lot of fun!

Learn everything about something interesting! Be it vintage cars, analogue synthesizers, film history, fashion, Ancient Rome, cheese, the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow or Gaben, knowing you know everything about something less common than American Presidents or Justin Bieber is a great feeling. Now that I come to think about it this is probably a natural process, but fuck it. It's nice any way. 

Fucking know your planet. Don't embarrass yourself by knowing nothing about the world outside your country's border. Look some places up and go there. Outside of your own country. And don't just go to a nice resort with an all-inclusive hotel and a great pool along with a tourist trap of a city. Get out and see how people live and what they eat. Italy is not just pizza, France is not just the Eiffel Tower and Japan is certainly not just Tokyo and noodles. I'm not telling you to become a globetrotter (unless you want to) but there is almost nothing bad about visiting another part of the world. 
I realized the importance of this when I spoke to a girl from Georgia (the state, not the country) about some countries in Europe which she had never heard of. Turns out they were only learning about Georgian history in geography class (nothing wrong with local history but why not in history class?). 

I'm not judging you as a reader. I'm sure you already know this, fuck, you probably know more about the world than I do. However, I love the fact that there are so many cultures in the world. THINK OF ALL THE NICE FOOD. 

TL;DR: Fuck a lot of women/men (bonus points for being gay), learn about the rest of the world, and become a knowitall. 

I hope this inspired some of you!

One girl liked to make really snide comments about me, specifically about my hair, my weight and other things. She was goth and I think she thought she could get laughs from her friends for doing it to my face and didn't think I would say anything back. At first I didn't, because I knew that my high school experience was better than most, and knew she was probably doing it because of some negative situation in her life. We lived less than a mile apart from each other and rode the same bus in middle school. I actually tried to reach out and be nice to her despite other kids being ugly then and we were kind to each other, though not really friends.

The comments stung, but one of the defining moments of the experience was when she sat in front of me during a pep rally and threw things at me from the stands and made loud comments about how she said she could see hair in my underarms and could smell me from the stands. The cheer captain noticed and confronted her which stopped it for awhile, but not for long. 

Eventually, I reached my breaking point. During lunch she was behind me in line and was making comments about my hair. I spun around and loudly said, ""At least I wash my hair. Go take a bath."" I think she was so surprised I stood up that she didn't have anything to say. She never said anything else to me again. I felt bad because I felt as though I was being cruel, but knew that it had to stop. 

Compared to these other stories, I know this is minor, but I think people forget that despite your social status, people are cruel to other people just for the sake of being cruel.

Oh and cause my name happened to be the same as that of a popular cartoon character who also happened to be a monster, I would constantly get nicknames and taunts about that too all through elementary school.
I would also get constantly asked to do other students' work and when I refused they would react like I just refused to give a homeless puppy some food. 
And my spanish teacher would constantly harass me for not picking up the language as quickly as her top students who could already speak the language quite fluently as a first language. Once she even tried to force me to quit my martial arts lessons in favor for spanish class, which was already mandatory at my school. If I had the choice, I wouldn't even have taken the class.  
Yeah, elementary school was fun. 
Oh and in middle school I was pegged as my math teacher's ""pet"" just because I seemed to understand the material. This one girl in particular would constantly ask me for the upcoming test, and when I got confused would get frustrated with me and say ""*scoff* Since you're a teacher's pet, you're supposed to have the test already!""

Well, this guy wasn't the brightest, cause he would give access to his account to just about anyone who asked. As a result, I would get a lot of inappropriate messages from this guy's account constantly and once after I had asked for this to stop in a reply to a message, he or whoever was using his account instantly created a facebook page pegging me as a slut, and used my picture as the page profile picture.

Man, reading through these comments are giving me flashbacks. I was bullied off and on, by both family and classmates, until I graduated from high school. The physical abuse was somewhat intermittent, I learned early on if I beat the aggressor fairly severely I'd be left alone, so that's what I did.

In first grade a bunch of my ""friends,"" decided to chase me around the playground, throwing things at me, as the teachers watched. They ran me to the ground and started to kick and stomp me until recess ended. As I tried to pick myself up one of the kid's started to laugh at me crying, and I snapped. Ended up breaking his jaw and slamming his head against the ground while the teachers tried to stop me.

Things were peaceful until about fifth grade, they'd call me names but they wouldn't hit me. During a game of basketball one of the kids that was bullying me slammed my head into a concrete wall from behind and I ended up blacking out. I came to as the teachers were trying to pull me off him, he was unconscious on the ground and they were afraid I would beat him to death.

Shit like that happened off and on. By the time high school hit I realized I just needed to act crazy for them to leave me alone, and that's what I went with. The ones that decided to push the issue had a bad time.

They made classes hell, and they would go to the school counsellor (who I also went to) just before my appointment every week to tell them that I was a massive problem, and a horrible person, and they just needed to get rid of me because I was making them anxious constantly.

The teachers and counsellor took their side, and I was treated as if I was a compulsive liar for even the issues I was having at home (I was abused; a lot). This escalated to the point where I was ""banned"" from going to see the counsellor because I was a ""problem"". I still have trust issues when it comes to counsellors/therapists.

Anything to do with big ears or nose or both. I don't have big ears though, they just are flat on the side of my head, though obviously being kids they didn't listen.

A new family moved onto our street with two boys my age, joined my school too. They proceeded to join in the bullying before, during and after the school.

I don't know why I didn't tell my parents sooner. My Dad when and had a word with their parents and they stopped, then I never saw them again a few days later. It wasn't till I was long out of school my Dad told me what had happened.

He was a social worker for abandoned/orphaned children at the time I might ad, so when he knocked on the door and two 12 year old boys answered the door and no adults were to be found, he got concerned. Their parents use to leave them daily for hours on end without adult supervision. It was no wonder they acted out.

But the bullying still continued at school. I remember my best friend turning on me, recruiting his new best friend who was a lot bigger than me, to pick me up and tombstone me in front of most of my class.

I worked as an HVAC technician for residential homes. I was on a call for a furnace making strange noises. I diagnosed the issue as a faulty gas valve and it needed replaced because it was a safety issue and could cause a fire hazard. It was an owner/ tenant situation. I called the owner on the phone and explained the issue to her, she declined the repair because ""it cost too much"". I documented all the problems on the work order and shut the machine down by turning the switch to the furnace off. Our company policy is not to discuss the repairs or diagnosis to anyone but the homeowner or the person who placed the call for service. The tenants asked me what the problem was and I could only tell them they had to ask their landlord. The landlord had a maintenance person turn the furnace back on later that day without correcting the safety issue. 18 hours later, the furnace caused an explosion that burned the house down and killed 3 people (1 was a 7 year old boy). 

Our company was questioned by investigators, my work order was scrutinized and I was questioned (with our company attorney present). Big surprise the property owner said that she was not told of the issues. Part of our company policy is we video record any furnace issue that is declined. I followed policy and left the camera recording audio as I called her and described the repair issue. It was determined that the recording was able to used as evidence because she did identify herself on the recording. I also told her at the outset of the call that I was recording the situation and that I could email the video for her to review (she lived in another state) is she wanted to see it. 

End of the story, myself and my company we found not liable for any wrongdoing. The homeowner was found guilty and went to prison for 2 years. When she got out of jail the victims family filed a civil suit and won a judgment of $17,000,00 (US). 

Sometimes I wish I had disabled the furnace further, so it could not have been turned on when I left. That is against state law in our state and I could have been fired, but at least those people would still be alive. Even though I was not liable and the decision was out of my hands I still struggle with the memories of looking the tenants in the eyes as I was leaving and not warning them of the danger the furnace posed to them.

I didn't want the day to end; hanging out with friends, enjoying one of the first beautiful days, not writing or studying. I thought, ""I'll express this feeling with words!"" I could have said, ""I want this beatiful day to last forever,"" or ""Boy, I'm not looking forward to starting all these projects.""

Give group the basic colour-code method of simple triage categorization, in which people are labelled 'green', 'yellow', 'red', or 'black', based on the severity of their injuries.  
I describe a scenario, labelling each hypothetical injured person, and we discuss the order in which we would prioritize helping them - which is, first the red people, then the yellow people, before the green people.  Which leads to the relevant quote..

     Anyway, I had this crush in high school who was very into track. I never really talked to her until track season started in January. We had mutual friends so I talked to them while my crush was there. I can't remember what we were really talking about, but it had something to do with Lint. (My family was Catholic so we could not eat meat on Fridays except fish.) Well me being me, I panicked and said something so disgusting, that it made my friends laugh but not my crush. I told my friends, "" I want to eat camarones(shrimp) and octopusé."" 
     Oh my god, it felt like I had died. For those who don't understand, I tried saying octopus in spanish which is pulpo, but I had forgotten what it actually was. Instead I said Octopusé, which sounds like octo-pussy. She just looked at me disgustingly in the face and walked away. I tried talking to her that I meant eating octopus, but she just said, "" It sounds like you were trying to eat octopus vagina.""

Suddenly I was confronted by a single member of the enemy team (I think his name was Kyle).  For those of you unfamiliar with this kind of standoff, it's really challenging to defend against - Since I was in hostile territory, if I got tagged, I was going to be out.  If I turned to run, Kyle would leap at me and get me while I was turning.  I could try to run to either side, but even then Kyle could reach me faster.  The only hope in this situation is to get Kyle to jump at you while you go a different way.

Not trusting the 50/50 chances of a feinted run, I had a stroke of inspiration.  I threw the bubble wrap up into the air and ran to the right.  *Ninja vanish*.  Kyle, utterly confused by the plastic that had sprung up in his face, flailed at it and momentarily forgot to chase me down.

One time at the airport I saw girl around my own age who was reading one of my favorite books. Being one of those creepy people who talk to strangers, I stuck up a conversation with her. After the conversation died down I was just sitting there and took a glance at the screen, when I saw ""cancelled"" next to my flight. I pointed it out to the girl, and we went to the service counter to find out what was going on. Apparently there was a mechanical malfunction and the flight was getting delayed till the next morning. I was slightly panicking, because I thought I'd have to spend the night in the airport, but they set us up with free hotel rooms and meal vouchers. We grabbed our stuff, took the shuttle they sent for us to bring us to the hotel, and on the way we decided to tour DC together. We visited the white house, the washington monument, etc. The hotel we stayed at had a restaurant on the top floor, so we had a fancy dinner there. After dinner, we were both bored (the hotel didn't have complimentary wi-fi) so we decided to play poker in my room. After we realized poker without bets was boring, it turned into Truth or Dare Poker. At first it was just innocent stuff, but eventually the Dares started getting a bit intimate, like ""Rub my feet"" and ""Nibble my ears"". Then it got really intimate, like ""Let me touch your boobs"", and ""Take off your shirt"". Then *we* got intimate. Next morning I woke up to her playing with my Morning Wood. We got intimate again. Finally we cleaned up, got our stuff, had breakfast together at the hotel buffet, went back to the airport, and got on our flight. Most memorable night I've ever spend in DC.

That's the set up. Now for the actual Mile High Club story.

So when we get on the flight, our seats are about 8 rows apart. That kind of sucked, it would have been romantic if our seats were next to each other after the night we spent together. But that's life, it doesn't always work out like in the movies. That's what I was thinking, but it turns out this girl has a lot more experience flying than I do. She calmly walked up to the man sitting next to me, and asked him if he would switch seats with her. He was a good man, he agreed to switch, and he gave me a thumbs up behind her back. So she's sitting next to me, and after we watched all the in flight movies, and ran out of conversation topics, she whispers in my ear, ""Bathroom. Sex. Now."" Hell yes. That was when I joined the club. The thought that we were doing it 40,000 feet in the air, and surrounded by other people, was a real turn on. After we were done, we went back to our seats. After some time, when I recovered, this time I whispered in her ear. We did this over and over and over, until the lights turned on and people started waking up. It was an 18 hour flight. I'm really glad I had bought a new pack of condoms the night before.

TL;DR One night stand turned into lots of airplane sex",3,t3_23qska

Months later I get a bill in the mail saying I owe $190 because my insurance didn't cover generics.

 Though the opposite could also happen. Get a situation going where men are predominantly homosexual and view women as something to just put the seed into once a year to pop a kid out and further the species. If it becomes too much a hassle on society such as a situation where men are occasionally briefly horny but around a woman in heat are constantly to the point its bothersome, teach them artifical insemination and ship them off for the month with sperm tools and eachother. Then boom you have full year productivity from men and 11/12 from women.

____

If both take a dive to 0. Or men are only horny when a woman is around in heat I could see technology going up as there would be a lot of good time without worrying about courting and all that. Followed with a month of nothing as women would cause men to constantly be wanting / needing release.

Could also see men becoming more of a commodity then they are today. Selective breeding becomes easy when men just generally are not interested unless pheromones or other chems are involved. Then suddenly you get the option to go into the room and breed the lady that wants you and your mind becomes trapped by a need to rut chemically instead of out of desire / romance / whatever. All it would take for a situation like this would be for women to become intentionally geographically seperate some how.

____

An interesting thing would also be seeing population drifts and changes. For example some species are affected by tempurature changes, so over the long term global warming could mess with things if we were one of those species. Would the northern countries shrivel cause the women there had 1 cycle where the tropics go four times.

About your chem test, though. If it's at all doable, I'd suggest you try reading through the material you need to know just *once* straight through. Yes. Read a textbook like a novel. It'll be boring as sin but just do it. Then eat a full dinner and do whatever you need to get a *really* good nights' sleep. As many hours as possible. Comfiest pillow in the house.

You probably won't do as well as you'd have done if you'd been studying all along, but going over the data and then giving your brain a chance to process it overnight should theoretically be better than nothing. Give it a quick look in the morning just for a refresher and stay relaxed during test time. If you fail, whatever, fuck it. This will make it easier to remember things.

Whatever you do *don't* stay up all night cramming (or redditing) because this pretty much guarantees you'll be too tired to function tomorrow. Your brain solidifies memories while you sleep so the best way to absorb data is to get some shuteye.

The movie begins with some scientists investigating a cave near a lake in the American Midwest.  They find some cave drawings of humans fighting dinosaurs and take it as indisputable proof that humans and dinosaurs co-existed.  Shortly after that, a meteor crashes into the lake and the impact heats up a fossilized egg on the bottom (Implausible, but it's a Sci-fi movie, so I'll allow it.)  The egg eventually grows into a plesiosaur (like Nessie).  You'll notice that the cover art is a T-Rex.

The main characters in this film are two good-ol-boys, who's names I have forgotten, so I'll just call them Cletus and Jim-Bob.  They own a boat-rental business on the lake.  In the morning, they rent a rowboat to this guy, and all seems well.  Cletus and Jim-Bob discuss the upcoming ho-down, and Jim-Bob admits that he wants to ask a special girl.  Neither the ho-down nor the girl are mentioned ever again.

We go back into the middle of the lake.  It's night, and there's ominous music.  Shit is about to go down.  The guy sees rippling in the water, and looks around.  Nothing.  Suddenly, he is knocked out of the boat and falls into the water.  After some screaming and struggling, he is dino-food.  We cut back to Cletus and Jim-Bob in the daytime.  It's about four pm and they're discussing how the guy has been out on the lake all day.  IT'S THE SAME DAY.  The boat drifts back to shore, filled with blood.  Like at least four inches of blood on the bottom.  Never mind the fact that the dude was killed IN THE WATER.  They call the sheriff.

We cut to a different character.  A man is in a hotel room cleaning a gun.  We'll get more of him later.

Cletus and Jim-Bob get into an argument on the lakeshore.  It escalates to fisticuffs and they both fall into the lake.  They discover the head of the eaten individual nowhere near where they found the boat.  The sheriff shows up and Cletus and Jim-Bob get out of the water, completely dry.

20140422202851,KANNABULL,"General overview of Scientology. Scientology begins with L. Ron Hubbard, a fictional writer of science and fantasy. In the late 40's he developed a self help system he procured from helping mental patients and fellow veterans in mental wards. The system consisted of evaluating his patients using a method he dubbed 'auditing' where in which the auditor, or person doing the interview, will ask the patient a question or give a leading command to be answered. Using the answers would determine how much therapy and the difficulty leading up to that therapy would be.

Eventually the system progressed into a complete book called 'Dianetics'. The cut and dry is that millions of years ago, a bad alien named Xenu decided to solve a population problem on his galactic colony by exiling a bunch of fellow aliens 'thetans' on planet Earth. 

 He then blew up the planet and when the souls started leaving the bodies, he trapped them and brainwashed their souls into believing a made up history, allowing them to wander and attach themselves to the eventual human population making us confused as to what's really going on. This supposedly made us believe a false history as well despite all the evidence of most of it actually happening.

The revised modern edition of Scientology and the indoctrination process is a cruel version of brainwashing by atypical standards. The interviewee is audited and assessed, and then tested to see how corrupted by thetans they are by using an [E-meter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWBw88Rt9vs). 

The church has a very sordid past of absolute corruption involving everything from flat out murder to overthrowing the government. Despite these facts, it's central role as a religion still holds sway to this day amongst elite celebrities mainly disguised under a clever advertisement of basic moral principality and enjoying life with the help of the church. 

It is hard to maintain an objective point of view with solid evidence of the indoctrinated doing overwhelmingly bad shit to normal people and holding it's top members in the spotlight.

It just never seems worth the risks to kill folks when life in prison is essentially a ruined life anyway. ",1,t3_23q5f2
20140422222457,PLS_PM_ME_TITS_GIRLS,"First off, I'm on mobile so sorry for and typos.

I don't think the death penalty should be set for anyone. I'm not big on taking one stance, because usually I couldn't care less. But for this topic, I'm one sided all the way. 

Let's say, for example, a man goes on a ""rape and murder spree.""  He kidnaps 7 teenage girls and rapes and tortures them before murdering them.  The police catch him and he is set for the death penalty.  That could probably be one of the best punishments that man hoped for.  Doing all those horrible things to young kids, most likely destroying the rest of their life.  We should let that fucker rot in a cell for the rest of his life.

He'll have to sit in a cell in prison, thinking about all the horrible shit he has done.  Not only will he be miserable with his own thoughts, when the word gets out to other prisoners that he raped, tortured, and murdered those teenagers, think of what will happen.  Those guys are already in prison for life, what other punishment can they get for kicking the absolute shit out if the rapist.  Let him Roy in a cell getting tortured by the people around him til he dies.

Of course this will never happen because people think this is immoral (which I can't disagree with).  Just my two cents on the issue.  Your thoughts?",1,t3_23q5f2

20140422183940,CowboyLaw,"In De Architectura, Vitruvius argued that all architecture should be measured on 3 bases: firmness, commodity, and delight.  Firmness, of course, is structural soundness.  Commodity is just a polite way of saying expense.  And delight is just that---does the architecture make you happy, impressed, interested, etc.  With that in mind, let's apply that to food.
    
My first inkling was to vote for steak.  Certainly, it is firm: steak is strong in both tensile strength and compression.  Regardless of the ""butter knife"" advertisements, virtually all steak will require utensils to eat.  Firm, indeed.  Similarly, steak evokes delight.  It can be presented any number of ways, and steak tartare seems an entirely different animal than blackened Cajun steak.  Commodity is a comparative problem---at a restaurant, you can easily pay upwards of $40 for a good steak, and even at the grocery store, $20 is not an outrageous sum to spend.  But my primary problem is that steak isn't architectural, even in the way some food could be said to be.  It is a singularity.  It is not a constructed food.  Therefore, we must move on.
    
Casseroles, pastas, and any number of stews and soups would score well in both commodity and delight, but have essentially no firmness whatsoever (certain very thin soups would score well for compressive strength, insofar as water is noncompressable, but what you're really testing is the strength of the containment vessel, as the soups would simply pass the load laterally on to the walls of the vessel).
     
I thought hamburgers might be the final answer.  They are certainly constructed, and their scores in both commodity and delight are very high.  A good burger would also score well for firmness.  But further thought led me to only give burgers the silver medal.
   
The gold medal has to go to the club sandwich.  Again, it is certainly constructed, and indeed it has a decent degree of difficulty, being 1.5 sandwiches in 1.  Commodity is certainly satisfied, as club sandwiches are frequently among the cheapest items on the menus on which they appear.  A good club sandwich will also be delightful.  But what really seals the deal, and puts the club sandwich over the burger, is the firmness.  The firmness of club sandwiches is given special attention by the addition of a central stabilizing column.  That column serves to hold the individual ingredients in place around the fixity of the column.  And while the column serves an excellent structural role, its designer also gives a nod to architectural concerns by adding a completely superfluous, but very decorative, colored cap to the column.  In sum, a superior food product that scores very highly on each of the three measures.  Virtuvius himself would be honored to eat it.",6,t3_23pvgv

1. Massive wealth redistribution

3. Gut social security and welfare. Replace with a Universal Basic Income. 

4. Strengthen existing unions and shift labour rights to the worker. 

5. Implement a five year plan to encourage renewable energy.

6. Cut the work week to 32 hours. 
7. Create a parliamentary system to accurately represent the entire population.

8. Nationalize the educational system and restructure it from the ground up. Offer trade classes in high school. College is now free.

9. Nationalize banks. 

10. Nationalize the railway system. Encourage people to travel by train (which would be heavily subsidized).

11. Improve public transit and promote telecommuting. Encourage people to use public transit.

12. Implement an Autobahn type highway system with truck lanes.

13. Subsidize grains, vegetables, fruit and meat produce. Tax sugary shit food.

14. Tax corporations appropriately.

15. Subsidize communications infrastructure.

16. Legalize gay marriage.

17. Promote and encourage egalitarian policies. 

18. Legalize all drugs that would be issued through government operated dispensaries. All dispensaries would also function as treatment centers where addicts could receive treatment.

1. Go through every law, if it doesn't actually hurt anyone other than the person breaking the law BURN IT. (gay marriage, marijuana, distilling alcohol, etc.) 

2. Go through every law, if it is redundant- BURN IT. (gun laws- *murder is already illegal folks*, fucking speedbumps, etc.)

3. Clean up the bureaucracy (if i'm in the wrong line at the DMV, and the worker for that line could easily do what I need in 5 seconds, they can't redirect me to the correct line because GODDAMMIT)

4. Simplify taxation- No taxes on necessities (food and non-bedazzled clothes), No income tax (because that shit is so hard to keep track of man), X% sales tax (however high is necessary to balance the deficit). Kill all loopholes with acid.

5. Restrictions on foreign aid/involvement: The citizens of the US must want us to be there (simple majority), The citizens of the country we are aiding must want us to be there (simple majority).

6. Eliminate all intermingling of government and religion. 

7. Pay off our debt. 

8. Continuously scale social security to 95% the most recent census data for average lifespan. (so 74 years of age with 2011 data)

9. Things government should pay for: education up to and including a bachelor's degree, healthcare, roads, military. 

10. Things government shouldn't pay for: everything else.

2. Introduce approval voting for all national elections

While these changes seem small, it would effectively kill idealistic partisan headbutting in congress. These changes would kill the monopoly our two parties have on capital hill and thus create more room and creativity there as well. No political parties removes the leg up the two parties have on the others and approval voting would open races to candidates with a wider appeal thus dismantling the two party system. 

Some may wonder why I want to dismantle the two party system, but in honesty, it's unhealthy. The benefit of the two party system is you know what you are going to get, it's flaw is that it discourages creativity and compromise in legislature; if a politician votes across party lines as he believes is best for the country he runs the risk of losing funding from his party and even possibly having to face a more ""ideal"" champion of his party in the primaries. 

That's all I'd do, I'm just an uneducated, but in my eyes the largest problem with the united states government is the government itself; fix the government and policy issues should just sort themselves out :)

They left my brother and I for date night and I decided to call up some friends for a party at my place. What I didn't know was that they called some of their friends too. 

The house was flooded with early teens and beer while I was telling my brother what could possibly go wrong? A little before midnight my parents call and say they won't be coming back any time soon, so my friends (old and new) for even more excited to party and ordered pizza. After I got seven large pizzas upstairs I saw in the living room a drunk dude wearing one of my blankets as a cape, our cooking pan as a hat and a toy sword in hand sitting in the only arm chair of my house, I laughed and continued on to the kitchen, what I didn't realize was the crystal animals where his peasants. 

Half the audience were in the kitchen and I just kept wondering where the others were, so I went out to check the living room and there was a circle of people laughing there brains out. The king was on the floor crying because he sat on the small crystal duck and it went up his ass. He was bleeding n was about to crap everywhere so we rushed him out of the house and a friend of his accompanied me to get him to the hospital. We reached the and they started asking questions as to why a 15 year old boy is drunk and has a crystal duck up his arse. Nervous about the situation the other dude abandoned me there as I waited for this new guys ass to be stitched. We went back to the house and were greeted by my little brother urging me to get them out of the house because our parents are returning. Turns out 80% of the people couldn't handle their alcohol and I had to call cabs for everyone. 3 of my friends weren't drunk and helped out in dropping them home. Parents were about to get home and I cleaned up everything except the duck. I forgot the duck in the hospital. 

I stopped one of the cabs and rode to the hospital. Waited 20 agitated minutes for the fucking duck. The doctors returned with a rubber duck someone else had shoved up their ass that night, that's when I lost my shit and began panicking and my sentences made less sense than a Charlie Brown's mother. Thankfully one of the nurses remembered me and brought the duck they kept in the Lost and found. Got back home before the folks came in. 

My parents came home and were fighting and didn't notice the poor cover up i did for the mess. Their fight escalated and my dad began breaking shit. He then proceeded to break the crystal animal set *threw it in the ground - Lonely island started playing in my head *. They decided to get a divorce and I hate ducks. ",4,t3_23qocl

My room was on the second floor. There was a partial wall at the top of the stairs that my parents put in. The wall was fully constructed, but it was never painted. So it was just exposed sheet rock and wood. Additionally the wall had a triangle shaped hole at the top, it was a converted attic space, so the ceiling had the roof slopes and angle. I think my parents thought the opening at the top of the wall made it look neat.

This provided access to where the sheet rock and the wood supports met. There was a wood support a little more than 1 foot below the top wood support. So, using a tool crafted from a hanger, I was able to drop magazines into the wall between the sheet rock and the wood beams, and they would sit on top the second wood beam down, then I could use the hanger tool to pull them back out. Worked great.

The magazines are still in the wall. We sold the house. Cant wait to see the post on reddit some day in the future when someone remodels the attic and finds porn in the walls.",1,t3_23qocl

After the conversation died down I was just sitting there and took a glance at the screen, when I saw ""cancelled"" next to my flight. I pointed it out to the girl, and we went to the service counter to find out what was going on. Apparently there was a mechanical malfunction and the flight was getting delayed till the next morning. I was slightly panicking, because I thought I'd have to spend the night in the airport, but they set us up with free hotel rooms and meal vouchers. We grabbed our stuff, took the shuttle they sent for us to bring us to the hotel, and on the way we decided to tour DC together. We visited the white house, the washington monument, etc. The hotel we stayed at had a restaurant on the top floor, so had a fancy dinner there. After dinner, we were both bored (the hotel didn't have complimentary wi-fi) so we decided to play poker in my room. After we realized poker without bets was boring, it turned into Truth or Dare Poker. At first it was just innocent stuff, but eventually the Dares started getting a bit intimate, like ""Rub my feet"" and ""Nibble my ears"". Then it got really intimate, like ""Let me touch your boobs"", and ""Take off your shirt"". Then we got intimate. Next morning I woke up to her playing with my Morning Wood. We got intimate again. Finally we cleaned up, got our stuff, had breakfast together at the hotel buffet, went back to the airport, and got on our flight. Most memorable night I've ever spend in DC.",3,t3_23qp1h

Day one they met some locals girls at a club and started hanging out with them for the entirety of that week. Well, the last night before their flight, the group decided to go out with a bang and went all out. One of those night you don't remember. 

The following morning my friends friend woke up thinking that the girl was going to be there to at least ""waive"" him off one last time. Nope. So he spent a little bit cleaning up and packing up his things when the bathroom mirror caught his eye.

In big bold letters, written in lipstick, the girl left him a note, ""bienvenidos al club.""

He didn't speak spanish and wasn't sure what that meant so he got one of his buddies and the girl he was with to see if they could help him translate it. She told him it meant, ""welcome to the club.""

The girl began to hyperventilate and get worried and started mumbling under her breath. This freaked out my friends friend, who now demanded to know what the hell was going on. She explained to him that in Mexico, there was a group of people, infected with HIV, sleeping with random strangers to spread it.

I hit the breaks, shocked that someone would do that. Then I turned slowly to get around him, and he swung his arm in a pitch to my open window and I thought he was throwing something at me as hard as he could. I was 15 and I didn't know how to react I was so scared. Then the little fucker turned behind him and started laughing hysterically and three other teenaged boys started laughing at me with him. If I didn't have quick reactions or didn't happen to be especially looking out, I would have run over a little kid who was probably dared to do that. 

When my friends ask why I drive slow (aka the speed limit) its because of that kid, I was going slow & had time to react. And ever since I've had 4 other people walk out in front of my car (different car) because they can't hear it when its on the electric engine so I'm thankful for the lesson.

20140422200200,freshsalsa,"Not quite a note but I wrote to an Apple Chat rep, you know the chat box that pops up (or used to) on apple.com.  It was a really powerful conversation.
We talked about her depression and how she felt overwhelmed by life and whatnot. I was a junior in high school but we chatted for about 20-30 minutes and it made a huge impact on me. I can say more if people someone would like.

EDIT:
Ok, it seems like some people want to hear the full story. So, this was actually my senior year of high school (sorry I lied) and I was looking to purchase a laptop for college so that is how I ended up on the apple website. Like I said above, apple.com used to have help pop-ups to chat with an apple rep and ask any questions you might have--and I did! So Jessica (not sure if thats her real name, probably not) and I were talking for a bit about my computing needs and whatnot and I began asking her how she liked working for apple, what her background was, etc. It was funny to me because I never really imagined the person typing on the other end, but we were having a really nice conversation. I'm not sure why but I asked Jessica if she was happy with her job and she said ""Im sorry but Im not supposed to talk about personal things"" or something like that but then followed it up with ""But things are OK."" I took that as a ""if you want, you can keep asking me questions"" because I figured she could always just disconnect or something if she was truly uncomfortable. Anyways, question lead to question and she started to really open up about her lonely she was, how she wasn't satisfied with her job and her life situation and how she was just really sad. My heart was really hurting for her and I told her that. I told her that though I am just a customer I really did care about her, as more than a bot typing in a chat box. That she mattered and was cared about. That she was special and important even if she didn't feel that way right now. She was really nice and said she was really glad that we had talked but that she had to go. I told her not to forget what I told her and that I really meant it, then we were disconnected and I've never heard anything since. I sat at my computer for like 10-15 min just scrolling through our chat log re-reading what we had said.

Im not sure where this stuff came from, as I was still pretty young (17) at the time but for some reason it was really emotional to me, to somehow find this connection to someone who I would never talk to again but at the same time someone who I felt needed a friend. I still think about it to this day when I pass by the apple store/apple.com and wonder how Jessica (or whoever it was) is doing today.

Turned out her roommate was moving out for unknown reasons and she was sad because she thought they were good friends.  She was pretty okay afterward.  

TL;DR:  Gave a hot chocolate and sympathetic note to a girl crying in my dorm's lounge.  She's okay ~",2,t3_23q8cd

The one lady that owns one of the shops is always very rude to us and puts notes on our cars saying ""Tow this dumb driver"" because we park in the alley way that we are all supposed to SHARE. One day I decided to put a note on her car and it was polite per se but was definitely mean. It just so happened that I looked out my window while she was discovering the note. The look on her face was priceless and it felt so satisfying to see her get so absurdly mad at me with no way to get back at me. Haven't heard anything from her since surprisingly

One morning this woman comes in visibly distraught, face blotchy from crying. She ordered a bagel in a rush and went to go talk on her phone while I prepared it for her. On a napkin I drew a smiley face and wrote ""Don't worry, it'll get better."" I bag her bagel, note, and extra napkins and bring it out to her. She thanks me in a hurry and leaves. 
Fast forward a few hours I get a call in on the phone. It's her. In a watery voice she asks who wrote the note, I admit to it. She then starts bawling and thanking me. She said her father just passed away and seeing that someone else cared was heartening to her. Needless to say I started tearing up. I told her that I understand how hard it is to lose someone, but celebrating their life is better than mourning their death. She took a bit of comfort in these words and thanked me. 
Now, two years later, she's a regular at my work and she's gotten a lot better.

Yes, ~50% of marriages end in divorce but only 30% end within 10 years. 10 years is pretty good for a relationship.

*""In 2006–2010, the probability of a first marriage lasting at least 10 years was 68% for women and 70% for men.""*

A woman with a bachelor's degree has 80% chance her first marriage will last 20 years.

http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf

Also, if you're above the age of 25 when you first marry the divorce rate is lower. (22%)

If you are both full time employed the divorce rate is lower.

If you're not black the divorce rate is lower.

Most of the kids there had severe behavioral issues due to abuse and neglect, I was depressed.  Being surrounded by all that suffering and the evil that had caused it made me unbearably sad and I wasn't able to get any therapy done.

A few months later I ended up in an adolescent psych ward and that was immensely helpful.  There was a very strict regimen of activities: Cleaning, personal hygiene, meals, medication therapy, group therapy, free time, special therapy for various flavors of crazy, school, and a small amount of movies and unstructured fun time.  Someone would inevitably disrupt each event and be more or less gently directed to the 'time out' room.

The best thing about it was the lack of pretense in social interaction: First of all, we were in a nut house, and secondly, we'd all flipped out in group therapy in one session or another.  There was a lot of gossip, wild crushes and intense friendships as well as a general sense that distance should be kept.  I had a good time playing ping pong and talking to people.

It's a bit selfish, but the biggest benefit was realizing that I was mentally unwell, but that others had it much worse.  I'd say about 25% of the kids were back more than once.  Some had hallucinations and delusions that made it impossible to be well, but more were escaping horrendous family situations through stays in the psych ward.

This didn't cause to many problems,  but it was weird. I was stuck there for 11 days. The kept me there prolonged because I still had suicidal thoughts. I always have suicidal thoughts,  but, as usual, the doctors can't differentiate those from suicidal urges. I cried the first night I got there, but it got better over time. I eventually earned the right to listen to a CD player. The entertainment wasn't that good but I didn't complain, because it was better than nothing. We watched the same pg movies over again and had thirty minutes to play a selection of games. We sometimes got to watch tv during lunch. We saw a redskins game and learned about Chris Brown's DC arrest. When I got out I was happy to eat a giant calzone because I had been served horrible food for a week and a half. I got out right before Halloween, so I was also treated to alot of candy. 

After my stay, I went to a bunch of groups, go to a therapist, take medication, and switched some classes. I finally accepted I suffer from major depression, after my second suicide attempt. I no longer trust doctors because they forced me to take prozac after I yold them I had before and it didn't work, and because of another situation that took place in a group I went to.",2,t3_23qfk9

After the show, they dropped black beachballs from the rafters and Lars handed me one of his drum sticks... so it was pretty memorable.

I also really recently saw Avenged Sevenfold with Ghost B.C., Ghost - while I'm not really a fan of satanic themed music - kicked ass so hard that I'm pretty sure they blew a speaker. Once A7X came on, we were so amped up and the energy was unbelievable. They were phenomenal, and the only reason I would say it wasn't *as good* as Metallica, is because we were in a box (but who can say no to free tickets, especially when they're my second favorite band...)

I've eaten whale meat before. It was delicious. I want to eat it again. 

Whales are smart. That doesn't mean we shouldn't eat them.

Whales are endangered. That doesn't mean we shouldn't eat them, just eat them in limited amounts.

Most importantly, one group of people shouldn't be dictating what another group can or cannot eat. Hindus consider cows sacred. They don't force others to not eat beef. Jews and Muslims won't eat pigs. They don't force others to not eat pork. 

I see no reason to end whale consumption, except for the fact it causes some people moral outrage.

Umm no, neither cows or pigs are an endangered species, this would certainly be an issue if they were.

Whales are endangered. That doesn't mean we shouldn't eat them, just eat them in limited amounts.

Actually yes it does mean we shouldn't eat them... 

I don't see this as one group of people dictating what people can and can not eat, of course there's moral outrage you're eating an endangered species and I'm pretty sure humanity has done this before and wiped out species in the past.

I've never tasted whale, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't try it even if given the option but if you're simply for whaling for food then maybe you should think about eating something else. Honestly with all the different foods out there, there's got to be other options.

20140422234220,Le1tus,"More then a time or two I've thought about ending it one way or another. I'm not proud to say it but one of which came from moving. I was two months into my sophomore year in the city that I had spent most of my life living in and my mother got the news that she would be losing her job come the summer. (Some back-story is that I have never met my dad and I've been living in a single parent family since I was born.) Anyways she opted to find a new job as fast as possible, lucky enough she did within a couple of months. 

It was decided that we would move to a very small town a few hours away from the city we were currently in. At first it seemed to be ok, most of the people were nice, some I could have definitly gone without, and there was this group of girls which me and most of the school hated with almost every fiber of our beings. The hardest part about that group is that they all were in FFA, FFA and 4-H were the only things keeping me sane after moving and having been there for a while I though I was doing good.... That was a lie. 

The worst of them was the girl that lead the group, lets call her Meg, that I had come to call the ""Bitch Squad"" everything that they said was off-putting to most people, but for some reason she really took offence that I was there. Meg thought it was in her best interest to be mean all the time, constantly put people down, including me, and then she turned to social media. 

When it comes to social media, I keep a fairly small footprint, but like everyone does I like to Google myself from time to time to see what I have been recognized for. This time I was directed to Meg's Twitter feed. When I found it it was just before I went to bed. If I remember right it was national FFA convention and the tweet went something like this, ""I swear if it see Le1tus's face I'll straight up freak."" That night I spent more time then I would like to admit thinking about killing myself, how I would do it, and how it would help me. 

When I woke up I made a list of everyone that would be affected if I went through with it, all the things that I would miss out on, and finally why I couldn't do it. From there for the next few months I was doing great, I was living the way I wanted to, stayed out of her warpath, and stayed happy. The problem is, she couldn't leave it at that. I hadn't had contact with her for over 3 months, but then I was Googleing myself again, mostly because I was looking for contest results from over a year ago to get a job, and lo-and-behold Meg's twitter feed came up again. I couldn't leave it where I found it, this time not only did she send it 10 feet away from me on a FFA bus ride, but it made me feel even worse. It was something about making a bird shit on my head because it would only be an addition to the pile of shit I already was. 

I was low.... so low that I made another list of why I should kill myself. One of the only reasons that I didn't go through with it was because I couldn't do that to my family, and most of all I couldn't do that to my mother. I finally decided that I have more then enough to live for, not only did I have a wonderful career to look forward to, I had the mind to look forward to a family, and many new friends! 

I'm coming on a year after this all happened, I have never looked at her twitter again, I live each day to its fullest, and if I'm ever low all I do is look for the bright side. I know its kinda cheesy but that's what helps, that and knowing that leaving this world would only mean that she would win. Being fairly competitive I knew that letting her win wasn't an option. The thing of it is when applying for scholarships, and various other things to get ready for college I know know that my list of 15 names that I would have affected by killing myself is more like a list of 50 or 100 and most definitely more. Through reading the letters of recommendations that I have received I now understand what an impact I've made in my state, the lives of people I've come to know and be friends with, and most of all my mother. The biggest reason I've never done anything is because of her, when she had cancer I was her rock when we moved she was mine. Anymore when thinking of it, some of my best friends faces come into my mind first and I immediately stop thinking about it. 

I know this is long but for anyone making it this far, thank you for reading this, it is not as easy as I thought it would be to type this but I believe this is another step in the healing process. Along with that I've been accepted into the college of my dreams and I'm going on a work experience to learn new skills this summer and feel every day getting better and better.

The first awesome Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles live action movie. Batman: The Animated Series. Animaniacs. Freakazoid! Will Smith in a time before he started pushing his kids on the world. Pogs. Magic: The Gathering before it became a hot mess with too many mechanics and too many damn cards to choose from. Decipher's Star Wars CCG. The first and only Matrix. That modem handshake sound. AOL in it's day. SNES. The first Playstation. N64. The rise and fall of Sega as a gaming giant. The end of the ubiquitous arcade. A time where we could make bomb and gun jokes without being arrested and treated like criminal scum. Extremely low levels of helicopter parents. The Discman becoming common. The East/West rap feud. Biggie. Tupac. The first two big solo white rappers (Vanilla Ice and Eminem, amazing how much changed changed in a decade in that respect, lol) OJ Simpson's chase and trial. Multi-line phonecalls between a group of friends. Finding an amazing stash of porn somewhere outside and treating it like the discovery of the Holy Grail. Jim Carrey when he was still outrageous and really over the top funny. Almost everything was cheaper. Surge and Jolt soda being everywhere. Pokemon phenomenon starting out. Dragon Ball Z getting big and paving the way for a larger US audience for anime. Game Boy and then Game Boy Color (Advance wasn't until 2001). Scrambled TV porn. Finding out about game cheats and secrets through word of mouth or from friends instead of the internet. Online chat rooms on AOL or Yahoo. AIM. Zubaz pants. Starter Jackets. Reebok Pump shoes. Michael Jordan and the Bulls dominating. The Buffalo Bills going to the Super Bowl 4 years in a row and losing every time, lol. The Monica Lewinsky scandal and hearing about the President's jizz stain on her dress. Dolly the Sheep is the first cloned animal. Jurassic Park. Terminator 2. Toy Story and the beginning of successful 3D animation. Home Alone.  WCW/WWF Monday night wars. The nWo. Degeneration X. The Simpsons first became huge. The Mighty Ducks being a movie and then becoming a real NHL team. The rise of grunge. Nirvana was huge and Kurt Cobain killed himself. The rave culture was getting big. Rollerblades. JNCO. Tamagotchis. The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union. Beanie Babies. Furby. The Macarena. The start of the International Space Station.

Fun concepts for kids games, cartoons and series hadn't all been done before, it seems people still had a shit-load of imagination when bringing you concepts.

""Tesla says the 60-kwh battery provides a range of up to 232 miles (the EPA pegs it at 208 miles), and the 85-kwh battery (a $10,000 option) provides up to 300 miles (the EPA puts it at 265 miles). Here are some examples for recharging times: With a single onboard charger plugged into a standard 110-volt outlet, Tesla says you will get 5 miles of range for every hour of charging. From zero to 300 miles would take about 52 hours at that rate. With a single charger connected to a 240-volt outlet, which Tesla recommends, the pace speeds up to 31 miles of range for each hour of charging, and a full 300-mile charge takes less than 9.5 hours.

Step up to twin chargers on the car and connect to a 240-volt, high-power wall charger (an extra-cost charging unit, not just a 240-volt line) and the charging speed zooms to 62 miles of range per hour, and the total charging time drops to under 4 hours, 45 minutes.

Really in a hurry? Stop at a Tesla Supercharger station and you can top off the tank with 300 miles of range in just an hour, as long as your Model S is configured with Supercharger capability If a Supercharger station is out of reach, most public charging stations can recharge the Model S at the rate of 22 miles of range per hour of charging.""",0,t3_23qnha

20140423223802,eveolene,"Ok, this is a long story, because it happened over a period of just over a year, starting roughly 4 years ago. Lived in a really nice neighbourhood, low crime, quiet suburb, neighbours friendly. We lived in a house converted into an upstairs and a downstairs flat, we had the downstairs. When we first moved in, a really nice older lady lived upstairs. She was a bit of a partier, but really very sweet. About 3 months later, though, she moved out and her daughter (K) + daughter's boyfriend (D) moved in with their 2 year old son. They seemed ok, but a bit on the chavvy side. I don't judge, prepared to like them and get along with them. They did a lot of gardening at first in our shared garden. We had a sliding door that went directly into the garden, so would sometimes go outside and sit and talk to them while their kid ran around. The first time we did this, D mentioned he'd been in prison for burglary. No biggy, we're not going to judge anyone, and I figured K couldn't be too bad, her mum being so nice. My fiancé was working chef's hours, so would sometimes come back to find D standing outside our house smoking. They'd chat a bit and through those chats, we found out K was pregnant. About 2 weeks later, we found out she'd had a miscarriage. Then they got a cat. I saw this cat once when it was a tiny kitten, maybe 2 months old when it ran out their door once, but they shooed it back inside and I didn't see it again for a long time. Around this time, me and my fiancé went to our friend's wedding. We stayed a weekend with him and his new wife, got to see our godson, came home and thought everything was fine. We'd locked our valuables in a closet, just in case, but we didn't really think anything would happen. Went to go get all our big electricals out (computers, monitors, TV, Xbox 360)... Xbox is missing. Looked around, didn't see much else missing other than our spare keys that had been in a kitchen drawer. Frankly, the lack of other things stolen was weird. We'd borrowed DVD's from a friend and they were sitting in a plastic bag on the sofa, untouched. Our Xbox games were mostly intact, but a couple were missing. Even one of our controllers was still there. Thinking maybe we were going crazy, we rang round our friends and his family to see if we'd given one of them the spare key and forgotten. Nope. Police calling time. Mentioned our neighbour had been in prison for burglary, but didn't really want to accuse him. The police officer, really nice guy, knocked on their door but D claimed his bike had also been stolen, so they didn't go in to look around. I noticed after there was a garden table that wasn't in the back garden when we left, pretty close to our bedroom window. Forensics popped round to find out how they got in. Surprise, surprise, top bedroom window which is about 2 metres off the ground in the back garden. Updated the police officer in charge of that case on the garden table, but nothing ever came of it. Well, we didn't have the serial number, because that is literally only written on the Xbox itself (note to everyone with consoles, go write down your serial numbers *right now* and keep them safe), so time moved on and we got over it.

Fast forward about 6 months. We notice their cat is crying outside quite a lot. Really pretty thing, very fluffy, white and grey fur and a slightly snub nose, but very skinny. Definitely got some pedigree in its near ancestry. After about a week and a half of this cat screaming to be let in and clearly not being fed, I let her into our flat, fed her a nice hearty meal of roast chicken and then put her outside again. Over the next couple of weeks, feeding her became more common and we stopped putting her outside, just got a litter tray for her. We realised pretty quickly she was pregnant. This cat story isn't really relevant, but it definitely didn't help improve my opinion of K and D as people. D saw the cat running out of our house one day and said ""You can keep it."" I made it clear I intended to, and we never spoke about the cat again.

Now, I probably should have mentioned the police had been round a few times to speak to D, presumably about burglary. He'd also come round a fair few times asking us if we wanted to buy somewhat suspicious things (a bike, a TV, a George Foreman grill), but we brushed it off. It wasn't affecting us and we didn't want to get involved. Anyway, shortly after the kittens were born, they moved out. A police officer, K and her mum came round to collect some things and told us if we saw D there or heard any movement upstairs, we should call the police. They then told us he had knocked over the pram with their newborn in it (I didn't even know she was ever pregnant again) in the middle of an argument and she had a restraining order against him. We did hear movement upstairs a few times, but always very early in the morning and the police never came soon enough to catch him. Then one day a knock on the door. My fiancé answered, shirtless, and he's a big guy. The first words out of D's mouth are ""Jesus, you've got big tits."" then proceeded to ask if we had any tobacco to spare. Nope, and my fiancé went straight to the phone to call the police. This time, they arrived on time, but some kind of huge miscommunication had happened. For some reason, they thought my fiancé was D turning himself in. After explaining the situation quietly indoors, some idiot police officer stood outside shouting on the radio ""Yeah, no, <my fiancé's full name here>, the downstairs neighbour, he's the one that called.""

Well, great, now D knows we called the police on him. We had some very serious words with the police officers about complete lack of discretion, they apologised, broke the door down, chased D down after he jumped out of a first floor window into the garden and that was that. Or so we thought. Not only did D come back, but K came back, too. We were informed by our landlord that because of D's previous actions, he still wasn't allowed to see his kids unsupervised. By living with him, K had forfeited her right to the same. Yes, choose this guy over your kids. Smart girl. Our landlord also told us that they were technically squatting, but he couldn't legally kick them out until they had somewhere else to go. We stayed well away from them and I genuinely felt really intimidated, wondered if my house would be smashed to pieces when I got home, worried about the kittens and what would happen if D smashed a window and they got out, all kinds of things. I mean, this guy, who clearly had anger issues, knew with 100% certainty that we'd called the police. In the end, nothing happened until after they finally moved out and got the hell out of our lives for good. Then the only thing that happened was D passing my fiancé in the street, waiting to be far enough away and then shouting ""I'm going to burn your house down"". We obviously called the police again, although we didn't take the threat seriously, and were promised he'd have a strict talking to about unacceptable behaviour.

And that was finally the end of that. Really a horrible year. Next neighbour was very nice. Not a peep out of her but the occasional sex noises. No complaints.

Oh, and I did get a letter about 3 years after the Xbox theft that someone had admitted to it. Never found out who, always suspected it was D or one of his friends.

Always read through the teacher's directions completely and follow them as best as you can. Leave a note about how the class did. Good? Bad? Be specific. And if there was a problem with the directions. You never know what kind of supplies the teacher will leave out, so bring a couple of pens, some paper, and blank hall passes if the school uses them (you can get them in the main office). Also, while you're in the main office, check to see how to quickly call them from the room in case there is a problem.

And more importantly, and even if only one kid does what you ask in each class, be sure to say something nice about each period. (along with the bad)  As a bonus (especially for aspiring subs/teachers) leaving a positive note almost always got me a second (or more) call from that teacher for future jobs, because they figure you handled their class better than most if nothing ""bad"" happened.

Talk to your neighbor teachers between classes (99% of the time they will help you if you need it) and be prepared to be moved around. Many times when I subbed for a teacher, they would move me to another room during my scheduled sub job/teacher's planning period.  While nervous about getting lost, these were often my most fun classes. (History teacher here/had a blast subbing for Spanish and art class)

I worked in the trauma department mostly, so no end to gore and drama; I actually got desynthesized to it after a while.  But nearly every time I had to go to pediatrics ICU, it was going to be bad.

I have three particular cases that stick out in my mind.  The first was an 18 day-old infant.  He hadn't been responding to his parents for about 24 hours when they brought him in.  They said they figured he was just lethargic.  The baby had a sever bleed in his brain.  The damage was consistent with shaken-baby syndrome.  His father, who was there, has a history of physical abuse, both with his wife and his other children.  The baby's heart stopped during surgery and they revived him.  He was brought to the Peds ICU.  He was a multi-code patient, meaning his heart and breathing stopped multiple times over the next several hours before passing away.  I had to be there, because it was my job, but the parents wanted nothing to do with me.  It was so hard to look that father in the eyes.

The next case was with a 15 month old toddler.  She had been put down for a nap on a bed at home.  She rolled off the bed while she slept, falling in the crack between the wall and the mattress, suffocating in her sleep.  It was no one's fault but the intensity of the situation, in particular the mother's inconsolable grief, that made it hard.  She had a perfectly healthy little girl an hour ago and then she was dead.

The Doctor orders a radio-frequency ablation to get to the bottom of it.  We're sitting around shootin' the shit waiting for transport to bring a stretcher and take him to his procedure.  His *entire* family is in the room talking with us.  I'm talking mom and dad, brother and two sisters and an aunt.  

He starts coughing sporadically and making little wheezing sounds.  His mother gets all freaked out and I tell her that it's normal and not to worry.  I get halfway through that sentence and the guy goes into full cardiac arrest.  His monitor is screeching and he passes out and goes as rigid as a board.  Everyone in the room starts screaming and his father throws himself on top of his body with his hands moving all about his chest like he's desperately trying to fix him but not knowing how.  A doctor and four other nurses burst into the room with the crash cart as the code blue goes out over the intercom.

As they start compressions and the doctors bark orders over the chaos of screaming family members and shrieking equipment, I peel off the lid of a chocolate Jello pudding cup and lose my grip on it.  The lid flutters to the floor and I have no time to react.  It lands....*face down.*

When you work in an environment like that you're supposed to become numbed to that kind of trauma.  But some shit just sticks with you.  Some shit...you can't unsee.

As cliche as it sounds, it does get better. I found a close group of friends, who while not always getting me, accepted me, and even a few that gently guided me towards being socially graceful (or at least tried.) College was amazing, because no one gives a fuck, and I majored in fine arts, so social quirks and oddities were common place. Being out in the professional world has taken a good amount of adjustment, and a loooooooot more learned behaviors as to what's appropriate workplace behavior and whats not. I still have bad days and do stupid shit without knowing, but my manager at least understands that I'm trying. 

That being said, I'm 24, and still refuse to wear socks or shirts with buttons. I don't shave my legs frequently, not because of any feminist leanings, but because smooth skin+ pants feels weird as fuck. I still flap and pull my hair, and talk really, really loud when excited.

20140423121830,Major---deCoverley,"I have to disagree with portions of what you said. It's true, there's never been a complete episode devoted to her changing her appearance, but I believe it's brought up that her weight is a defining part of her personality.

Hannah's character is unarguably insecure, and she specifically tells Marnie that shes overweight and it has ruined her whole life/is ruining her life. That's.... a big deal. 
When we are introduced to Hannah, she gets weighed by a doctor, Adam pinches her fat (and CALLS her fat), and there IS an episode where Adam takes her running in an effort to lose weight. What I'm saying is that Hannah's weight is one of the ways her character is defined (her sloppiness, her insecurity, her awkwardness, her lack of social cues). Even the way she dresses seems to highlight her body -- her wardrobe is specifically revolved around making her seem bigger and unflattering. 

That being said, I don't disagree about her being a body positive icon. I think Lena Dunham's use of her body is superb and admirable, but I think it is incorrect to say that Hannah, as a character, is not defined by her weight because she definitely is. ",2,t3_23pplb
20140423014618,ErynSMA,"I cannot imagine anyone, guy or girl, dressing like Hannah does in Girls and being taken seriously in the professional world. Even in this day and age, people need to care about their appearance to some degree- I certainly wouldn't want someone working for me who looked like they couldn't be bothered to spend 10 minutes making sure they look decent.

I'm overweight myself and all about loving yourself and your body, but I really don't think Lena Dunham's Hannah is an exemplary  role model for the real world just for that reason.",12,t3_23pplb
20140424043621,tapdancepanda,"If she doesn't live in the professional world, why would she dress like she's in the professional world? Isn't she an under-employed writer?

It also seems worth mentioning that a lot of the clothes she wears are actually pretty fashionable and expensive. I've recognised brands like APC, Marc Jacobs and Dusen Dusen. I'd love to own her wardrobe. She wears unconventional clothing, and she dresses down when she hangs around home. ",1,t3_23pplb
20140423055858,small_havoc,"I think that's part of the point though. Hannah really doesn't dress well, she doesn't dress in the most flattering outfits for her body - she just dresses like Hannah dresses. I'm not overweight myself, but I find her choices refreshingly gutsy. It changed the way I think about how I dress too. I want that dress that makes my butt look a bit big? I will wear that dress. I like the rest of the dress, I like how I feel in it. That's all that matters. 

Now, having said that, I agree that it's not always in your own best interests to dress like Hannah for work environments and stuff.

Hannah's also a wee bit of a bitch (and a horrifying mirror for a lot of us), and is so self involved that it would take someone who is very much able to look outside herself to create her. We're not meant to 100% support any of the characters, or their decisions, and that's what make a good script (in my opinion anyway - I'm not one for ideal role models). Love the spanx thing.

Absolutely! Just like most sitcoms (I'm thinking of Friends specifically though), the characters all together sort of make up the full personality of one person - we all fluctuate, we all reach some extremes sometimes, but it takes a plethora of different characters dominated by more overt traits to make us see that reflection in ourselves. Personally, I feel Girls does this in a realer way too me than any show I've watched. I feel like I'm perceived like Hannah, I identify a little too much with Shosh's anxiety and desire to control it, I'm terrified I come across like Marnie all the time, and I wish I could embrace anything I see of Jessa in myself.

Be a mother when you are ready to love it.

I love my kids, and we paid particular care during the first 3 years, because of our interest in early childhood psychology and neurobiology, and in learning to be a different parent than those that raised us, bringing in our life experiences.

20140422214755,icarusocean,"I was in a similar position to yours about two months ago.  A little worse off maybe, but close enough to understand the distress.  Even though I knew I could not take care of a child, it was still sad, simply because of what could have been.  One day, you will love your children, if you choose to have any.  You will love them with all your heart, and you know that.  It's hard to close the door to someone you know you will feel that way about, even if it's far too early.  Once the pregnancy hormones start to wear off, the burden gets lighter, and its easier to accept that you made the choice that you needed to in order to be the best parent you can be when the time is right.

I really regret that I had to arrange my abortion by myself and sit alone in the clinic, and endure the event itself in secrecy.  If you can, bring someone with you for support.  The staff should be kind and very gentle and help you make sure you are certain about your choice, but the quiet time waiting before your appointment is a little sad and scary and pretty lonely.

Now for the nitty-gritty of a medical abortion.  If you don't want to think about the actual process too hard, or are easily upset by semi-gory explanations, I'd stop here.  Personally, I really appreciated what straightforward information I could find beforehand, as not knowing what to expect was one of the worst parts.

I had virtually no protesters at my location.  The most I saw was a protest van parked across the street on my way out of the clinic, so I have no advice about this part one way or the other. 

I don't know how far along you are: I also had a medical abortion, at about 8 weeks (right at the limit for age for that procedure).  For me, it hurt quite a bit.  You are essentially condensing your period, a process that takes about a week normally, into the space of two hours.  There's going to be quite a lot of blood for the first few hours (and tissue for the very beginning part), even after the lining of your womb expels itself, so try not to panic, just keep an eye out to make sure you don't start bleeding TOO much (the doctors will tell you how much that is).  Leave yourself some space before you plan to go to bed or you will either be exhausted lying in the bathroom late into the night or be staining most of the things in, on, and around your bed.  For the first few hours, you will NOT want to have to move anywhere.  Make sure to bring a pillow, some distracting entertainment you don't need to focus on (TV, music, the like), WATER (thirsty business), and some snacks.  Heat pads are your friend.

If your doctor gives you painkillers, TAKE THEM.  They don't do much for the contractions themselves (Lord, will you be grateful for anything that takes the edge of those), but they help numb the muscle aches and milder spasms later on.  Just try to take deep breaths and keep calm until the rough patch is over.

Don't put anything into your vagina for a while (infection, and the cervix is dilated so things could get up in there just as easily as come out), but after the first 24 hours or so, you may want to check your cervix to see if there's any tissue caught, which you should be able to ease out very gently.  If you can't don't stress out too much.  You don't want to hurt yourself trying to pull anything out, and you shouldn't be at too high of a risk for infection before your check up appointment.  In my case, the embryonic tissue itself was caught in my cervix and had to be removed by the doctors, and then I had to do another course of the abortion drug.  The second round is a cakewalk compared to the first: half the intensity of a normal period, no severe contractions to speak of.  This round of drugs, along with the followup checkups were covered under the original cost of the procedure (Thank God for Planned Parenthood).  You are going to start to smell before your checkup.  A lot of old blood draining for two weeks makes everything smell like a slaughterhouse, but this doesn't mean you have a horrible infection and are going to die (Unless it's REALLY bad and your blood turns a color it shouldn't.  In that case, I'm a stranger on the internet, I don't know everything.)

You're probably going to feel pretty sad for a few days, even if you truly believe in your choice.  I think this is pretty normal: it's an immense issue to have to deal with for just one person.  If you have anyone to lean on during this time, definitely go to them for their support.  This is a hard thing to have to do, and it's good to reach out to people to try and cope with the overwhelming, confusing waves of emotions you might have about this.  Just knowing you are loved is so important.

I believe you are making the right choice for the family that you may someday have, and for yourself.  But the only one who will ever have the final say here is you.  Good luck tomorrow.  You are very brave, and deserve a great deal of respect.",8,t3_23psjo

There were no protesters where I went, but it was very crowded. I waited a long time. The people who work there were very matter-of-fact with me - not super supportive but not unsupportive either. They told me what I needed to know. I asked questions. If you have them, ask! It's okay! 

You will want to take your painkillers - it was recommended to me that I take mine about 20 minutes before taking my second pill, but follow your doctor's advice since they might put you on different meds. They might talk to you about birth control options depending on your state. They might have to give you an ultrasound - they did for me. I chose to view the ultrasound but not listen for the heartbeat. If you're early enough along to be able to have a medical, the pregnancy just looks like a bean. 

The cramps for me, with massive amounts of painkillers, were like period cramps. But, I bled a lot, so make sure you have lots of the super diapery overnight pads. You'll be changing them about every 30 minutes or less. In hindsight, I think a pack of adult diapers might not have been a bad idea. I watched musicals on my couch with a heating pad. I was a little dopey from the painkillers so I just sort of sat there being high. I remember feeling very tired for the next day or so. 

The bleeding will subside in a day or so, but take it easy for the next couple of weeks. My stupid self had to move apartments, and I kept trying to help out which meant I kept starting to bleed and cramp again even though I knew better. No lifting heavy things.

I felt very bland. I wasn't particularly sad because I knew I was doing the right thing. I wasn't happy either. I just...was...for a little bit.

But, I'll tell you this: this was the second pregnancy I terminated, and neither haunts me. Sometimes I get a little wisty, like, what-if.

20140505200703,sadbun,"Update:
I am going to write down my exact experience in case others are thinking of going the route I went.

I decided to have an abortion very very early in the pregnancy. The most helpful thing was that I have been using an app on my phone for almost a year where I mark down when my period comes, when I have sex, and keep notes in general. So when I checked the app (it's called Clue) and saw that I was 4 days late which is very unusual for me, and I could also see that I had sex when I was ovulating, I was pretty sure I was pregnant and also knew exactly how far along I was.

When I had my medical abortion, I was only 23 days pregnant. The fetus could not even be detected in the ultrasound, and they only knew that I was pregnant because of my urine and blood test.

I had been warned on reddit and by the doctor at the clinic that the process would be very painful with a lot of blood. 
When I took the first dose of misoprostol on Friday, nothing happened for the entire day. 24 hours later on Saturday I took the next dose of miso and again, nothing happened. Then on Sunday I started light bleeding. Over the next 7 days I bled roughly the same amount as a period, with mild cramping for one day. I didn't have to take any painkillers, and was able to go about my normal daily routine. I took a blood test a week after my first dose of misoprostol and it showed that I was no longer pregnant.

My case is pretty rare. I think most wait a couple weeks more than I did to have the abortion. From the time I found out I was pregnant to the time I found out I was no longer pregnant was 12 days. 

I feel relieved and I am confident that I made the right decision. I'm still a bit emotionally up and down, but I'm ultimately glad that I did it. Thanks so much to everyone who left comments and advice. Your support was really encouraging.",1,t3_23psjo

Time for beauty to emerge, time for the soul to arise, time for life to meet the sun.

Or just go with your friends? I promise you'll still have fun, you just have to let go of how you expected it to be and allow yourself to have a different, but equally fun, experience. People will say that prom isn't important, and that's true, but it's still a great experience that you should have if you want to! I can think of tons of things that I wouldn't care much about now but I'm glad I did at the time, because it was a great experience! :) 

Beyond that, if you feel really burned by all this (which you have every right to feel) then definitely keep going with it and do your best to settle it. It seems like more than anything, you're bothered that he went back on his word to you without a second thought - and it's made worse by him going to prom with that girl before. If you allow yourself to simply continue feeling like your boyfriend wasn't considerate of your feelings, you will resent him and always go back to it. 

 I had a very similar situation happen to me with my long term boyfriend in high school, and I never really hashed it out with him. As a result, I resented him and always questioned how he felt about me because of it. It ended up being a huge factor in us breaking up.

As a two year old most of his games involve imitating what he sees in his day to day life - especially cooking, cleaning, drinking tea (I'm British - he sees a lot of tea drinking). This is all firmly categorised under girl toys and usually come in a lurid shade of pink (not a problem to have a bit of pink about but I'd prefer some variety). Meanwhile toys that involve construction or building are filed under boys (and come in all the colours of the rainbow apart from pink).


I find this especially irritating for toddlers who have very little interest in whether they're boys or girls anyway. Playing is actually how they learn at this age. Pretend play (imitating cooking or playing with a tea set) is very important stage in development (they're developing concentration the ability to observe and imitate appropriate behaviour and also to understand that one object can represent another which paves the way for maths). The fine motor control and physical understanding from building toys is also really important as it sets the stage for learning to write and just generally understand the world.

I do suggest trying to find the closest help to you, if you can not get access to a therapist, or counselor, see if there are public mental health buildings or services in your community. 

If you try CBT, it is there to get you re-acclimated to situations that you typically would not panic at. It sounds like you are very frustrated with your situation and understandably so. 

Trust me, when you've been dealing with something as horribly traumatizing as this, you need a helping hand to get you to where you want to be. Try to remember that EVERYONE needs to get assistance at one time or another, and it sounds like you would really benefit from outside help.

This man will not leave his wife for you.  Do not expect that.

If you decide to get divorced, accept that you just may be single for the rest of your life.  If that is preferable to being married to your husband, than maybe divorce is the best option.  but get counseling first to determine that it's logical thinking and not emotional catastrophizing.

It's hard in non-agency environments, because they want you do go so far beyond your original role. It takes a special type of person to work in-house positions and you sort of have to just roll with the punches. The only time I'd say no is if I had a male co-worker in the same position who did not get invited.

20140423133157,CaitCat,"Any titles in particular you would recommend? I regret not taking a Native American history course, and I would love to do more reading on the subject. ",3,t3_23rqfw
20140426153902,sassXcore,"Sorry, I forgot to respond to this! I tried to pick out books that are fairly accessible & not loaded with anthropological jargon or the like. 

* If you want a really concise overview of Native American history, I recommend [North American Indians: A Very Short Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/North-American-Indians-Short-Introduction/dp/0195307542). Theda Purdue and Michael Green are/were (Green recently passed away) very important historians in Native American history. (Plus it's adorable that they're married.)

* One of my favorites is Tiya Miles's [Ties That Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom](http://www.amazon.com/Ties-That-Bind-Afro-Cherokee-Slavery/dp/0520250028). I like how it shows how race played out in the South in much more complicated ways if we include Native Americans. It reads like a story more than a history book.

* Tiya Miles also wrote [The House on Diamond Hill: A Cherokee Plantation Story](http://www.amazon.com/The-House-Diamond-Hill-Plantation/dp/0807872679). I haven't read it, but I've heard it's good.

* Nancy Shoemaker's [A Strange Likeness: Becoming Red and White in Eighteenth-Century North America](http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Likeness-Becoming-Eighteenth-Century-America/dp/0195307100/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398543382&sr=8-1&keywords=nancy+shoemaker+a+strange+likeness+becoming+red+and+white+in+18th-century+north+america) is an undergraduate-level analysis of the ways that both Europeans and Natives constructed their identities in opposition to each other. Each chapter covers a specific topic. 

* While I haven't read it, Daniel K. Richter's [Facing East From Indian Country: A Native History of Early America](http://www.amazon.com/Facing-East-Indian-Country-History/dp/0674011171) is a commonly assigned book in undergrad classes. It places Native Americans at the center of American history, rather than focusing on Europeans.

* Another commonly assigned book for undergrads that I haven't read: [Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee](http://www.amazon.com/Bury-My-Heart-Wounded-Knee/dp/0805086846).

* Linford D. Fisher's [The Indian Great Awakening: Religion and the SHaping of Native Cultures in Early America](http://www.amazon.com/The-Indian-Great-Awakening-Religion/dp/0199376441/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398543560&sr=8-1&keywords=linford+fisher+the+indian+great+awakening) is a bit more academic due to the topic, but I think it's still pretty accessible. If you're interested in learning about how Native American religions adapted & blended with Christianity, it's a good account. 

* A really important book is Kathleen DuVal's [The Native Ground:  Indians and Colonists in the Heart of the Continent](http://www.amazon.com/The-Native-Ground-Colonists-Continent/dp/0812219392). Like Fisher's book, it's a little more academic, but it talks about how Native Americans controlled interactions with Europeans in the Mississippi/Arkansas River Valley areas. Instead of Europeans destroying Native cultures, there was a period when Europeans had to adapt to Natives' demands. 

* I find the Red Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s fascinating, but the books & articles I've read are organizational histories and wouldn't be that appealing to a non-specialist. [Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee](http://www.amazon.com/Like-Hurricane-Movement-Alcatraz-Wounded/dp/1565844025/ref=pd_cp_b_2) is the most popular book about that movement, but I've never read it. 

Sorry for so many suggestions, but I thought I would give a bunch so that you can see what might appeal to you based on your own interests. All the above books are important because they help change our understandings of Native American and American history. Natives are not passive subjects in the books but are active in shaping their own lives. ",2,t3_23rqfw

Tennessee is a state where abortion is considered a crime, and legal abortion is an exception to that crime (that's some OG shit). That means that procuring a miscarriage is an unlawful act. If it results in a pregnancy loss at any stage, that can be prosecuted as an assaultive offense.

I'm not saying that people should be down on themselves all the time if their love life isn't working out. But I'm saying that it is good to ask ""what can I do better to achieve better results.""

This woman's post didn't really explain much about what she's like as a person, aside from saying that she is obviously very independent and has her life together. 

One thing that I did pick up on though is that she gets into relationships with guys who pursue HER hard and then gets sad when that pursuit fades away. 

Maybe it is time for her to initiate some of the dating and find a guy that she can pursue. 

Also, she doesn't really say where she is meeting these guys. If she is meeting them all at the club, then of course it's going to be hook up central. If she's looking for a solid long term relationship she needs to look elsewhere. 

It sounds like many of the guys she ends up with are looking for a fuck buddy, or a ""way stop"" on the way to where they want to be. She needs to find a way to weed out the guys looking for fuck buddies from guys looking for LTR. Maybe in the beginning of the relationship she can try communicating her needs. She can flat out say, ""I'm not looking for a fuck buddy"" or whatever. 

Long story short, the advice was: You've lucked into bad relationships, don't do anything, it's not your fault.

However, when I was living in a dorm in college, I mentioned that I was considering being a video game designer to a few guys.

One of them said, ""Oh... really... what kind of games do you play then?"" My standard answer to this is, ""Well, I play a lot of genres! I don't really have a favorite,"" which is true. I mean, how can you answer such a broad question? He asked, ""Do you like first-person shooters?"" I said, ""No. I like third-person shooters and shoot-em-ups, though!"" which is also true since I get heavily motion-sick when playing first-person games. He then asked, ""Do you like sports games?"" I said, ""No,"" because I find them boring. He then gave me a condescending smirk and said, ""Well, what other games are there then? Clearly you don't like any games.""

The upside I suppose is that I swindle these men when I'm bartering for ammunition and for used guns. Equally my husband and father-in-law are quick if not quicker to correct those who make these assumptions. Individuals do look a little ashamed after I put them in their place.

And it doesn't mean you're going to waste it.... it just means you've hit some roadblocks and you're miles away from home with a partner who isn't experiencing the same things as you are. Yeah, it sucks but you can turn this around and make it one of the best summers of your life. You just need to get some control back.

You should identify what you wanted to achieve and what's no longer possible first off. Clearly, you feel as if your career is stalling and that's pretty scary stuff. Think about what aspects of your job you were supposed to be doing while abroad and then get in touch with your boss. You want to get a situation where even if you're not exactly where you want to be you're still searching for opportunities within your job to exercise your skills and learn new ones. Without knowing the ins and outs of your job I can't be more specific, but I'm sure you can do this. 

Second, identify all the things that being in Italy enables. Naturally language skills - you're probably not going to be at the specialist professional proficiency in a few months but you can certainly improve from where you are now. How? By getting out. Sure you're working from home but honestly could you do that work in a public space? Flexitime? Get out and engage with locals and other expats. Try meetup.com and other networking sites to see if there are others around who you have the faintest thing in common with and then get out and meet them. Do things. Hire an italian housekeeper for a few hours a week and get her to teach you how to make a killer dish. 

Third, this is only temporary. The absolute worse case is that you spend until September working on your tan. You'll soon be home, so if you really feel that your job is not working for you then start searching for a new one. Might as well if you're logged on waiting for emails, right?

We moved overseas for my job last year and my husband works from home; while his work has gone better than yours has I know it's been a big adjustment for him as we went from a pedestrian-friendly, greenspace-filled North American city to a hot, dusty, traffic-filled, sidewalk-less city in the Middle East. 

I agree with other posters that your best bet is probably to do some heavy-duty ""silver lining"" action. It'll feel hokey, but just go for it. Eat gelato! Learn some Italian! Use meetup.com to plug in to other expats, check out hash house harriers if you run and/or drink, take a class in something. Living in other countries is never without challenges but it's also an amazing opportunity. Since this hasn't been a great year for your job, figure out what you can get out of your experience so that it's still a worthwhile year for you - whether that's learning a new skill, starting a blog, or just wandering around soaking up your host country's atmosphere.

It's also important to talk to your husband about this. When we were preparing to move, we took some courses through my work about adjusting to overseas life, and a common issue is that the working spouse adjusts much more quickly than a spouse who's at home, because when you're working your day is often very similar to how it was at home. You need to flag to your husband that you're struggling, because he should recognize that you've made a big sacrifice for him and he needs to support you - whether it's by just making sure you guys get some high-quality couple time in the evenings or making an effort to introduce you to people, or whatever. 

I'd also recommend checking out the [US State Department's blogroll](http://www.afsa.org/foreign_service_blogs.aspx) as there are a lot of spouses who blog and what you're feeling is definitely a common theme - it can help to see that others are in the same boat and vent to people who know what you're going through, instead of people who think you're being ungrateful (because of course, living overseas usually sounds dreamy to our friends and families at home!).

To me, it doesn't seem like a divorce/career change is necessary, but something needs to change for you to be happy.

SO many people say that they would loveeeee to work from home. I did it for 4 months and hated it. I chose to be unemployed rather than make bunches of money (for my age). My work involved many confidential documents that meant I had to work from home on my secured network. Is your job something you can do from a cafe with a laptop? Maybe even a public library? That way you can kill two birds with one stone-get out and get work done. I've also heard of groups for people that work from home and get together for lunches perhaps you could find something like that? 

Being an expat is hard, but you don't have to do it alone. Try your cities subreddit/meetup groups and try to connect with people who are going through something similar. 

I'm currently an expat SO, following my boyfriend. His company offers tons of stuff for the husbands and wives that are displaced because of their spouses. They do events for all sorts of interest groups and there are always interesting people there. Maybe your husband could talk to his boss/HR and see of there is something you can get involved in there. 

Most importantly talk to your husband! Let him know you love him, support him, and am trying to be there for him but it's very hard for you at the moment. Try to work out a game plan for how you can both make things improve for you. 

Ask him to reach out to his colleagues and see if they have any spouses that wouldn't mind meeting up with you (expat or native Italian , either work).

That's not what really happens in most cases.  In most cases, the parties still have strong feelings for each other, and the reason people stay in abusive relationships is that there is still a lot of ""good"" and the good oftentimes outweighs the bad, at least in their minds.  It seems like in your relationship there was still a lot of ""good"" that was irrationally clouding your emotions and making you ignore the bad.  That feeling of ""love"" is a powerful fucking drug. 

And your ex sounds like he's a guy going through some terrible mental problems.  He obviously has some serious issues but he also does seem to feel some remorse and care about you. 

But here's the thing: you need to just leave and not look back.  From an emotional standpoint, it makes sense for you to still long for it, but rationally you just can't have this person in your life.  It is wrecking your self esteem and inflicting physical damage on your body.  You need to cut all contact and move on.

I know what you mean, I shouldn't agonize & try to spend day after day trying to figure out what happened and why. Picking it apart and spending time living in the past.

On the other hand though, I just thought it would be a little comforting to have other people weigh in on this and give their own point of view. See if anyone can give me some things to think about and throw around in my head.

Believe me, hes not in my life. He hasn't been since I pressed charges and I plan on keeping it that way. We have a no-contact order which is practically a court-issued PPO. The only contact we have is the couple times we make eye contact in court. I have no plans of interacting with him for the rest of my life. Like I said, he is dead to me, and I think it should stay that way. 

It IS sad to think about the good times we had. How high he made me in the beginning. The times I felt happy and loved and complete, sharing my life with another person. Its hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember. But yes, I am moving on & forward with my life and have been taking as many steps as it takes to heal. ",2,t3_23s25l

About the guy-to me, it seems like he did/does care about you. Maybe he was scared of losing control like that again, and hurting you even worse, and that's why he wanted to end it. 

Still, he's obviously in a lot of pain and very unstable. He needs professional help, and i do agree that you need to cut all ties with him for many reasons-  to stay safe, to move on, and to show him he can never treat someone that way again, no matter how bad he feels.",3,t3_23s25l
20140423152127,what_a_cat_astrophe,"Maybe I can shed some light to why you're feeling this way. 

What your ex did to you was horrible beyond words and you did not deserve it one bit.  He was supposed to love you and be on your team, but he beat you instead.  Yet you still love him to pieces and despite your bruises, you wished he would stay.  Of course, this is where a lot of people would tell you to walk away, but it isn't so easy, is it?  

The fact your ex realizes what he has done is a good thing.  He's clearly going through some issues right now due to a rough upbringing and it's good he can address his anger.  That doesn't make what he did OK though.

**Why I think a lot of us end up staying**

In the beginning of your relationship, all was well.  And over time, there was a slow drip of emotional abuse.  Such a slow drip, in fact, you hardly notice it coming on and things proceed to feel pretty normal.  You still regard and respect him as your lover because of the ""good times"" you have had, and the ones you still have.  So you find yourself holding out for the good days.  Waiting around for things to get better - the day when things will be back to normal again, because they weren't always like this.  

**Why I think we sometimes blame ourselves, and make up excuses**

Perhaps you might even blame yourself a bit too and wonder if a part of you deserved that treatment, because the man who used to treat you like a princess in the beginning now treats you like scum.  So you make up excuses as to why it's OK to stay with someone who makes us feel so bad.

**Having the last word**

I know that you feel like *you* should have had the last word.  You deserved to, after all - he was a total pig.  Sometimes having the last word feels a lot like justice.  It's one part of the closure process, and for some of us it can be a big one!  The fact he left you makes you feel cheated.  He's the asshole, not you, and he deserves to be the one who is walked away from because you want him to feel the pain he deserves.  You want him to know that he screwed up and that you were the one who was strong enough to walk away from it.  It's entirely understandable, but you need to remember that that is all it is: having the last word, and walking away feeling empowered from what made you feel powerless.  In short, he humiliated you.

-----

My emotionally abusive ex (also had an abusive childhood) left me the second he found a good reason to.  He cheated on me, but I blamed myself and made excuses as to why his behavior was OK because I figured if things were good in the beginning, there was a specific reason why they weren't anymore.  He abused me emotionally so often that it crushed my ego.  I couldn't stand up for myself because he would find a way to break my confidence whenever I did.  I refused to let him just cheat on me without a fight.  I wanted to prove that I could be an awesome girlfriend and make him feel sorry for what he did.  All I wanted him to do was realize I was a good person, so I stayed with him for five long months until he came up with some dumb reason to break up with me.

And of course he was sorry.  After some time, he realized what he'd lost and understood he fucked up.  But most men do after a while, and some of them may even try to come back to the ones they hurt.  Because when an abuser starts to miss the person they hurt, they think they can be better because RIGHT then and there, they want to be.  But fact of the matter is, if they have found a reason to go that far with you once before, they'll do it again.  It took my girl friend THREE times over four years to figure this out with her physically abusive boyfriend until she finally was able to walk away forever.

It's a long road, but eventually you will learn to get past all the humiliation he left you with and start to understand that what's important is that you're OUT.  It doesn't matter who left who - what matters is you're safe now.  And someday, you're going to find ""the one"".  He will love and respect you like crazy and you'll wonder why you ever settled for a life with someone who made you feel scared or miserable.

20140423152018,La_Fee_Verte,"Have you wondered about why you stayed with him for so long and what are your mental and emotional issues that made him so irresistible to you in the first place?  

The history of abusive relationships likes to repeat itself.  

What helped me was the book - 'women who love too much ' by Robin Norwood. Maybe you could have a read and see if it's any helpful!? ",1,t3_23s25l
20140423201347,mcrfreak78,"I do think about that too. I was scared to be alone and frankly I just fell hard for him. He made me feel important and I had never felt loved before. He was my best friend, my first boyfriend. We lived together and talked about our future. When he hurt me he would apologize, sweet-talk me, cry, comfort me, buy me stuff, tell me he was going to change so much etc. 

When things got worse I was still clinging on to the little bit of hope it  would get better. I was more in love with the memories and feelings of infatuation I had with this person more than him himself. He was the first person I fell in love with. 

By the times things got so bad I didn't want to leave because I couldn't imagine being so alone. I cut ties with a lot of friends because I thought he was all I needed. I depended on him to help pay rent and bills. When they say ""love is a hell of a drug"" they arent lieing. I was completely addicted to the feeling of being in a relationship (no matter how miserable I was) Despite everything I was scared of the thought of having no one to talk to. Coming home to nobody. Sleeping by myself. It was overwhelming to consider at the time because of how weak I was. 

The thought of going from being someones everything everyday to being alone terrified me. By that point I was too emotionally invested in the relationship. I felt him growing away and becoming distant so I tried pulling him closer, only to have him pull away harder and so on. In a way, at the end it wasn't even a relationship. We were on opposite teams. He was putting down to build himself up. It was almost a parasitic  relationship, & extremely emotionally exhausting to say the least.

But I digress, Ive had time take a long hard look at myself and why I did everything I thought I wouldn't. Anyways I will look into that book you suggested. Thank you so much.",1,t3_23s25l
20140423140953,Celarcade,"My abusive ex was never physically abusive to this level, but he abused me all the time mentally, physically, sexually... One of the ways that abusers do this is by making you believe you 100% need them and by scraping away your confidence and self-esteem. He's probably been subtly (or not so subtly) manipulating you and making you dependent on him for a while now. I used to spend hours in guilty feelings, considering all the things I had done to supposedly deserve my abuse. Our relationship was very volatile, and having said somethings I wasn't proud of either in the heat of arguments made things more confusing. He'd ""apologize"", but always blamed me for his outbursts. He always twisted things to relieve himself of ANY and ALL responsibility. Does any of this sound familiar? 

When this ex of mine split up with me, I struggled with the same thoughts: Shouldn't I, the injured party, have been the one to break it off? Why did I beg him to stay after everything? 

Truth is, being abused by someone doesn't mean there's no love in the relationship. It means that between all the good times, there's terrible times of fear and anguish. When you're ""in it"", you always see both the good and bad times. You don't just see the man who hits you, you see the man who brought you flowers and sang you songs.

I don't know if it's always like that, but I was only able to really gain perspective on my abusive relationship after it had been over for a while. From a more distant perspective than yours, I'm just glad he's away from you. This man is dangerous and I'd keep my distance, if anything, to let yourself heal emotionally and gain some perspective.

You're right, I do feel stupid and beat myself up. I still have feelings of guilt, regret & doubts even now, three months later. I need to stop constantly wondering whether it was my fault & if I could have prevented it. Or constantly asking myself if I turned him this way.

Its comforting to hear someone has been in the same situation(not that I don't feel for you, of course)- with the whole him leaving you. I was always told they will beg for your mercy and youd take them back and the abuse would continue, so I was so hurt and confused when he left me because I always thought it didn't go that way. & always wondering ""if he left because he cared, why did he hurt me so bad""

Thats so true, I was so blinded when I was in it. I would always tell myself & him ""the day you punch me will be the day its done forever"" and he'd say ""Id never do that to you."" Then when the situation arises and the heart gets involved, all logic & reasoning completely fly out the window to make room for feeling & emotion. Hindsight IS 20/20. When I reminisce I cannot believe how long I let myself be miserable. I'd always give my best friend shit for dating a guy who was rude to her, without in a million years thinking I'd let a guy doing everything he did to me.

They can be bulky. Less bulk and you'll probably need to change them more often. Soaking them in oxy-clean like cleaners helps stop staining.

Reading the questions asked in the survey I would say that I used to be the type of person that silenced myself.  I was this way since I was a child.  In fact, my siblings would call themselves the ""partners in crime"" while I was labeled the ""dream child.""  

I think that all that has changed for me because I resented having to hold so much in.  I say no more now.  I bring up difficult, uncomfortable topics with my fiance rather than just avoid confrontation.  That being said, I'm silencing myself less, but there are times when I still bite my tongue, so to speak.  

I can't tell you how to change, but in my case I learned to speak up more because I know that that's the only way my relationship is going to work (my fiance is a self silencer too).  If I don't speak up, I know he won't and then it just grows into resentment on both our parts.  Be willing to say no too.  You can't do everything.  Sometimes you do have to put yourself first, especially if you're in school.  Ask people to help if you think you need it.  For example, while in my PhD program my older sister, who is very assertive, called my parents (who were going through a divorce) and basically told them to chill out and leave me alone, especially during finals.  Or just have someone that can help remind you to take time for you.  ",3,t3_23rpna
20140423171742,missyb,"I read this, and realised that I used to be very silencing of myself, but I'm not anymore. For example, I was brought up to believe that you had to do everything for other people, and stay with people forever, etc etc. It led to me staying in a very emotionally abusive relationship for years, because I thought that you had to just stay with people, once you'd made the original choice to be with them. Well I got out of that relationship, was messed up for a few years, did some counselling, thought about things- and realised that I don't really believe it. I don't believe that bullshit I was taught. I can see why my parents cling to it, but it's not true in all cases- and I don't have to be with someone, if they're not right for me. And I realised that I would rather be on my own, than be with the wrong person. That was SO FREEING for me to realise. I just could not be arsed anymore, worrying myself over the other person, twisting myself to be what I thought they wanted. It just seemed so much more relaxing to be on my own, and be my own self.

So I feel like you wanted help, you asked about the steps people took. So, I went to counselling. I got the right meds for my depression and anxiety. I did a lot of CBT and thought about WHY I put my own needs last. And CBT teaches you to challenge those thoughts. So now when I read that list, I would read 'I need to put my own desires last to not be selfish' and I think 'no, I need to look after myself otherwise I will be miserable, looking after myself is a basic prerequisite for allowing me to have good relationships with other people.' So now I automatically have helpful, healthy thoughts about things- because I have sat down and asked myself questions like 'why do I think it's okay for people to mistreat me? What am I scared of if I say no? What am I scared of if I am myself?' So I would recommend CBT to everyone, it really helped me.",2,t3_23rpna

20140423121830,Major---deCoverley,"I have to disagree with portions of what you said. It's true, there's never been a complete episode devoted to her changing her appearance, but I believe it's brought up that her weight is a defining part of her personality.

Hannah's character is unarguably insecure, and she specifically tells Marnie that shes overweight and it has ruined her whole life/is ruining her life. That's.... a big deal. 
When we are introduced to Hannah, she gets weighed by a doctor, Adam pinches her fat (and CALLS her fat), and there IS an episode where Adam takes her running in an effort to lose weight. What I'm saying is that Hannah's weight is one of the ways her character is defined (her sloppiness, her insecurity, her awkwardness, her lack of social cues). Even the way she dresses seems to highlight her body -- her wardrobe is specifically revolved around making her seem bigger and unflattering. 

That being said, I don't disagree about her being a body positive icon. I think Lena Dunham's use of her body is superb and admirable, but I think it is incorrect to say that Hannah, as a character, is not defined by her weight because she definitely is. ",2,t3_23pplb
20140423014618,ErynSMA,"I cannot imagine anyone, guy or girl, dressing like Hannah does in Girls and being taken seriously in the professional world. Even in this day and age, people need to care about their appearance to some degree- I certainly wouldn't want someone working for me who looked like they couldn't be bothered to spend 10 minutes making sure they look decent.

I'm overweight myself and all about loving yourself and your body, but I really don't think Lena Dunham's Hannah is an exemplary  role model for the real world just for that reason.",13,t3_23pplb

It also seems worth mentioning that a lot of the clothes she wears are actually pretty fashionable and expensive. I've recognised brands like APC, Marc Jacobs and Dusen Dusen. I'd love to own her wardrobe. She wears unconventional clothing, and she dresses down when she hangs around home. ",1,t3_23pplb
20140423055858,small_havoc,"I think that's part of the point though. Hannah really doesn't dress well, she doesn't dress in the most flattering outfits for her body - she just dresses like Hannah dresses. I'm not overweight myself, but I find her choices refreshingly gutsy. It changed the way I think about how I dress too. I want that dress that makes my butt look a bit big? I will wear that dress. I like the rest of the dress, I like how I feel in it. That's all that matters. 

Now, having said that, I agree that it's not always in your own best interests to dress like Hannah for work environments and stuff.

Slightly off point, I see a lot of people confusing Lena for Hannah, and I think it's important to remember that there's always a reason for a way a *scripted* character acts and behaves - it's part of their character, and not dependent on the actor. Hannah's also a wee bit of a bitch (and a horrifying mirror for a lot of us), and is so self involved that it would take someone who is very much able to look outside herself to create her. We're not meant to 100% support any of the characters, or their decisions, and that's what make a good script (in my opinion anyway - I'm not one for ideal role models). Love the spanx thing.

Absolutely! Just like most sitcoms (I'm thinking of Friends specifically though), the characters all together sort of make up the full personality of one person - we all fluctuate, we all reach some extremes sometimes, but it takes a plethora of different characters dominated by more overt traits to make us see that reflection in ourselves. Personally, I feel Girls does this in a realer way too me than any show I've watched. I feel like I'm perceived like Hannah, I identify a little too much with Shosh's anxiety and desire to control it, I'm terrified I come across like Marnie all the time, and I wish I could embrace anything I see of Jessa in myself.

Be a mother when you are ready to love it.

I love my kids, and we paid particular care during the first 3 years, because of our interest in early childhood psychology and neurobiology, and in learning to be a different parent than those that raised us, bringing in our life experiences.

20140422214755,icarusocean,"I was in a similar position to yours about two months ago.  A little worse off maybe, but close enough to understand the distress.  Even though I knew I could not take care of a child, it was still sad, simply because of what could have been.  One day, you will love your children, if you choose to have any.  You will love them with all your heart, and you know that.  It's hard to close the door to someone you know you will feel that way about, even if it's far too early.  Once the pregnancy hormones start to wear off, the burden gets lighter, and its easier to accept that you made the choice that you needed to in order to be the best parent you can be when the time is right.

I really regret that I had to arrange my abortion by myself and sit alone in the clinic, and endure the event itself in secrecy.  If you can, bring someone with you for support.  The staff should be kind and very gentle and help you make sure you are certain about your choice, but the quiet time waiting before your appointment is a little sad and scary and pretty lonely.

Now for the nitty-gritty of a medical abortion.  If you don't want to think about the actual process too hard, or are easily upset by semi-gory explanations, I'd stop here.  Personally, I really appreciated what straightforward information I could find beforehand, as not knowing what to expect was one of the worst parts.

I had virtually no protesters at my location.  The most I saw was a protest van parked across the street on my way out of the clinic, so I have no advice about this part one way or the other. 

I don't know how far along you are: I also had a medical abortion, at about 8 weeks (right at the limit for age for that procedure).  For me, it hurt quite a bit.  You are essentially condensing your period, a process that takes about a week normally, into the space of two hours.  There's going to be quite a lot of blood for the first few hours (and tissue for the very beginning part), even after the lining of your womb expels itself, so try not to panic, just keep an eye out to make sure you don't start bleeding TOO much (the doctors will tell you how much that is).  Leave yourself some space before you plan to go to bed or you will either be exhausted lying in the bathroom late into the night or be staining most of the things in, on, and around your bed.  For the first few hours, you will NOT want to have to move anywhere.  Make sure to bring a pillow, some distracting entertainment you don't need to focus on (TV, music, the like), WATER (thirsty business), and some snacks.  Heat pads are your friend.

If your doctor gives you painkillers, TAKE THEM.  They don't do much for the contractions themselves (Lord, will you be grateful for anything that takes the edge of those), but they help numb the muscle aches and milder spasms later on.  Just try to take deep breaths and keep calm until the rough patch is over.

Don't put anything into your vagina for a while (infection, and the cervix is dilated so things could get up in there just as easily as come out), but after the first 24 hours or so, you may want to check your cervix to see if there's any tissue caught, which you should be able to ease out very gently.  If you can't don't stress out too much.  You don't want to hurt yourself trying to pull anything out, and you shouldn't be at too high of a risk for infection before your check up appointment.  In my case, the embryonic tissue itself was caught in my cervix and had to be removed by the doctors, and then I had to do another course of the abortion drug.  The second round is a cakewalk compared to the first: half the intensity of a normal period, no severe contractions to speak of.  This round of drugs, along with the followup checkups were covered under the original cost of the procedure (Thank God for Planned Parenthood).  You are going to start to smell before your checkup.  A lot of old blood draining for two weeks makes everything smell like a slaughterhouse, but this doesn't mean you have a horrible infection and are going to die (Unless it's REALLY bad and your blood turns a color it shouldn't.  In that case, I'm a stranger on the internet, I don't know everything.)

You're probably going to feel pretty sad for a few days, even if you truly believe in your choice.  I think this is pretty normal: it's an immense issue to have to deal with for just one person.  If you have anyone to lean on during this time, definitely go to them for their support.  This is a hard thing to have to do, and it's good to reach out to people to try and cope with the overwhelming, confusing waves of emotions you might have about this.  Just knowing you are loved is so important.

I believe you are making the right choice for the family that you may someday have, and for yourself.  But the only one who will ever have the final say here is you.  Good luck tomorrow.  You are very brave, and deserve a great deal of respect.",7,t3_23psjo

There were no protesters where I went, but it was very crowded. I waited a long time. The people who work there were very matter-of-fact with me - not super supportive but not unsupportive either. They told me what I needed to know. I asked questions. If you have them, ask! It's okay! 

You will want to take your painkillers - it was recommended to me that I take mine about 20 minutes before taking my second pill, but follow your doctor's advice since they might put you on different meds. They might talk to you about birth control options depending on your state. They might have to give you an ultrasound - they did for me. I chose to view the ultrasound but not listen for the heartbeat. If you're early enough along to be able to have a medical, the pregnancy just looks like a bean. 

The cramps for me, with massive amounts of painkillers, were like period cramps. But, I bled a lot, so make sure you have lots of the super diapery overnight pads. You'll be changing them about every 30 minutes or less. In hindsight, I think a pack of adult diapers might not have been a bad idea. I watched musicals on my couch with a heating pad. I was a little dopey from the painkillers so I just sort of sat there being high. I remember feeling very tired for the next day or so. 

The bleeding will subside in a day or so, but take it easy for the next couple of weeks. My stupid self had to move apartments, and I kept trying to help out which meant I kept starting to bleed and cramp again even though I knew better. No lifting heavy things.

I felt very bland. I wasn't particularly sad because I knew I was doing the right thing. I wasn't happy either. I just...was...for a little bit.

But, I'll tell you this: this was the second pregnancy I terminated, and neither haunts me. Sometimes I get a little wisty, like, what-if.

20140505200703,sadbun,"Update:
I am going to write down my exact experience in case others are thinking of going the route I went.

I decided to have an abortion very very early in the pregnancy. The most helpful thing was that I have been using an app on my phone for almost a year where I mark down when my period comes, when I have sex, and keep notes in general. So when I checked the app (it's called Clue) and saw that I was 4 days late which is very unusual for me, and I could also see that I had sex when I was ovulating, I was pretty sure I was pregnant and also knew exactly how far along I was.

When I had my medical abortion, I was only 23 days pregnant. The fetus could not even be detected in the ultrasound, and they only knew that I was pregnant because of my urine and blood test.

I had been warned on reddit and by the doctor at the clinic that the process would be very painful with a lot of blood. 
When I took the first dose of misoprostol on Friday, nothing happened for the entire day. 24 hours later on Saturday I took the next dose of miso and again, nothing happened. Then on Sunday I started light bleeding. Over the next 7 days I bled roughly the same amount as a period, with mild cramping for one day. I didn't have to take any painkillers, and was able to go about my normal daily routine. I took a blood test a week after my first dose of misoprostol and it showed that I was no longer pregnant.

My case is pretty rare. I think most wait a couple weeks more than I did to have the abortion. From the time I found out I was pregnant to the time I found out I was no longer pregnant was 12 days. 

I feel relieved and I am confident that I made the right decision. I'm still a bit emotionally up and down, but I'm ultimately glad that I did it. Thanks so much to everyone who left comments and advice. Your support was really encouraging.",1,t3_23psjo

Time for beauty to emerge, time for the soul to arise, time for life to meet the sun.

Or just go with your friends? I promise you'll still have fun, you just have to let go of how you expected it to be and allow yourself to have a different, but equally fun, experience. People will say that prom isn't important, and that's true, but it's still a great experience that you should have if you want to! I can think of tons of things that I wouldn't care much about now but I'm glad I did at the time, because it was a great experience! :) 

Beyond that, if you feel really burned by all this (which you have every right to feel) then definitely keep going with it and do your best to settle it. It seems like more than anything, you're bothered that he went back on his word to you without a second thought - and it's made worse by him going to prom with that girl before. If you allow yourself to simply continue feeling like your boyfriend wasn't considerate of your feelings, you will resent him and always go back to it. 

 I had a very similar situation happen to me with my long term boyfriend in high school, and I never really hashed it out with him. As a result, I resented him and always questioned how he felt about me because of it. It ended up being a huge factor in us breaking up.

As a two year old most of his games involve imitating what he sees in his day to day life - especially cooking, cleaning, drinking tea (I'm British - he sees a lot of tea drinking). This is all firmly categorised under girl toys and usually come in a lurid shade of pink (not a problem to have a bit of pink about but I'd prefer some variety). Meanwhile toys that involve construction or building are filed under boys (and come in all the colours of the rainbow apart from pink).


I find this especially irritating for toddlers who have very little interest in whether they're boys or girls anyway. Playing is actually how they learn at this age. Pretend play (imitating cooking or playing with a tea set) is very important stage in development (they're developing concentration the ability to observe and imitate appropriate behaviour and also to understand that one object can represent another which paves the way for maths). The fine motor control and physical understanding from building toys is also really important as it sets the stage for learning to write and just generally understand the world.

I do suggest trying to find the closest help to you, if you can not get access to a therapist, or counselor, see if there are public mental health buildings or services in your community. 

If you try CBT, it is there to get you re-acclimated to situations that you typically would not panic at. It sounds like you are very frustrated with your situation and understandably so. 

Trust me, when you've been dealing with something as horribly traumatizing as this, you need a helping hand to get you to where you want to be. Try to remember that EVERYONE needs to get assistance at one time or another, and it sounds like you would really benefit from outside help.

This man will not leave his wife for you.  Do not expect that.

If you decide to get divorced, accept that you just may be single for the rest of your life.  If that is preferable to being married to your husband, than maybe divorce is the best option.  but get counseling first to determine that it's logical thinking and not emotional catastrophizing.

20140423133157,CaitCat,"Any titles in particular you would recommend? I regret not taking a Native American history course, and I would love to do more reading on the subject. ",3,t3_23rqfw
20140426153902,sassXcore,"Sorry, I forgot to respond to this! I tried to pick out books that are fairly accessible & not loaded with anthropological jargon or the like. 

* If you want a really concise overview of Native American history, I recommend [North American Indians: A Very Short Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/North-American-Indians-Short-Introduction/dp/0195307542). Theda Purdue and Michael Green are/were (Green recently passed away) very important historians in Native American history. (Plus it's adorable that they're married.)

* One of my favorites is Tiya Miles's [Ties That Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom](http://www.amazon.com/Ties-That-Bind-Afro-Cherokee-Slavery/dp/0520250028). I like how it shows how race played out in the South in much more complicated ways if we include Native Americans. It reads like a story more than a history book.

* Tiya Miles also wrote [The House on Diamond Hill: A Cherokee Plantation Story](http://www.amazon.com/The-House-Diamond-Hill-Plantation/dp/0807872679). I haven't read it, but I've heard it's good.

* Nancy Shoemaker's [A Strange Likeness: Becoming Red and White in Eighteenth-Century North America](http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Likeness-Becoming-Eighteenth-Century-America/dp/0195307100/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398543382&sr=8-1&keywords=nancy+shoemaker+a+strange+likeness+becoming+red+and+white+in+18th-century+north+america) is an undergraduate-level analysis of the ways that both Europeans and Natives constructed their identities in opposition to each other. Each chapter covers a specific topic. 

* While I haven't read it, Daniel K. Richter's [Facing East From Indian Country: A Native History of Early America](http://www.amazon.com/Facing-East-Indian-Country-History/dp/0674011171) is a commonly assigned book in undergrad classes. It places Native Americans at the center of American history, rather than focusing on Europeans.

* Another commonly assigned book for undergrads that I haven't read: [Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee](http://www.amazon.com/Bury-My-Heart-Wounded-Knee/dp/0805086846).

* Linford D. Fisher's [The Indian Great Awakening: Religion and the SHaping of Native Cultures in Early America](http://www.amazon.com/The-Indian-Great-Awakening-Religion/dp/0199376441/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398543560&sr=8-1&keywords=linford+fisher+the+indian+great+awakening) is a bit more academic due to the topic, but I think it's still pretty accessible. If you're interested in learning about how Native American religions adapted & blended with Christianity, it's a good account. 

* A really important book is Kathleen DuVal's [The Native Ground:  Indians and Colonists in the Heart of the Continent](http://www.amazon.com/The-Native-Ground-Colonists-Continent/dp/0812219392). Like Fisher's book, it's a little more academic, but it talks about how Native Americans controlled interactions with Europeans in the Mississippi/Arkansas River Valley areas. Instead of Europeans destroying Native cultures, there was a period when Europeans had to adapt to Natives' demands. 

* I find the Red Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s fascinating, but the books & articles I've read are organizational histories and wouldn't be that appealing to a non-specialist. [Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee](http://www.amazon.com/Like-Hurricane-Movement-Alcatraz-Wounded/dp/1565844025/ref=pd_cp_b_2) is the most popular book about that movement, but I've never read it. 

Sorry for so many suggestions, but I thought I would give a bunch so that you can see what might appeal to you based on your own interests. All the above books are important because they help change our understandings of Native American and American history. Natives are not passive subjects in the books but are active in shaping their own lives. ",2,t3_23rqfw

Tennessee is a state where abortion is considered a crime, and legal abortion is an exception to that crime (that's some OG shit). That means that procuring a miscarriage is an unlawful act. If it results in a pregnancy loss at any stage, that can be prosecuted as an assaultive offense.

I'm not saying that people should be down on themselves all the time if their love life isn't working out. But I'm saying that it is good to ask ""what can I do better to achieve better results.""

This woman's post didn't really explain much about what she's like as a person, aside from saying that she is obviously very independent and has her life together. 

One thing that I did pick up on though is that she gets into relationships with guys who pursue HER hard and then gets sad when that pursuit fades away. 

Maybe it is time for her to initiate some of the dating and find a guy that she can pursue. 

Also, she doesn't really say where she is meeting these guys. If she is meeting them all at the club, then of course it's going to be hook up central. If she's looking for a solid long term relationship she needs to look elsewhere. 

It sounds like many of the guys she ends up with are looking for a fuck buddy, or a ""way stop"" on the way to where they want to be. She needs to find a way to weed out the guys looking for fuck buddies from guys looking for LTR. Maybe in the beginning of the relationship she can try communicating her needs. She can flat out say, ""I'm not looking for a fuck buddy"" or whatever. 

Long story short, the advice was: You've lucked into bad relationships, don't do anything, it's not your fault.

In high school, I talked with a few guys who played video games, and they were actually pretty good about not being jerks; I never felt like I was being talked-down to. However, when I was living in a dorm in college, I mentioned that I was considering being a video game designer to a few guys.

One of them said, ""Oh... really... what kind of games do you play then?"" My standard answer to this is, ""Well, I play a lot of genres! I don't really have a favorite,"" which is true. I mean, how can you answer such a broad question? He asked, ""Do you like first-person shooters?"" I said, ""No. I like third-person shooters and shoot-em-ups, though!"" which is also true since I get heavily motion-sick when playing first-person games. He then asked, ""Do you like sports games?"" I said, ""No,"" because I find them boring. He then gave me a condescending smirk and said, ""Well, what other games are there then? Clearly you don't like any games.""

And it doesn't mean you're going to waste it.... it just means you've hit some roadblocks and you're miles away from home with a partner who isn't experiencing the same things as you are. Yeah, it sucks but you can turn this around and make it one of the best summers of your life. You just need to get some control back.

You should identify what you wanted to achieve and what's no longer possible first off. Clearly, you feel as if your career is stalling and that's pretty scary stuff. Think about what aspects of your job you were supposed to be doing while abroad and then get in touch with your boss. You want to get a situation where even if you're not exactly where you want to be you're still searching for opportunities within your job to exercise your skills and learn new ones. Without knowing the ins and outs of your job I can't be more specific, but I'm sure you can do this. 

Second, identify all the things that being in Italy enables. Naturally language skills - you're probably not going to be at the specialist professional proficiency in a few months but you can certainly improve from where you are now. How? By getting out. Sure you're working from home but honestly could you do that work in a public space? Flexitime? Get out and engage with locals and other expats. Try meetup.com and other networking sites to see if there are others around who you have the faintest thing in common with and then get out and meet them. Do things. Hire an italian housekeeper for a few hours a week and get her to teach you how to make a killer dish. 

Third, this is only temporary. The absolute worse case is that you spend until September working on your tan. You'll soon be home, so if you really feel that your job is not working for you then start searching for a new one. Might as well if you're logged on waiting for emails, right?

We moved overseas for my job last year and my husband works from home; while his work has gone better than yours has I know it's been a big adjustment for him as we went from a pedestrian-friendly, greenspace-filled North American city to a hot, dusty, traffic-filled, sidewalk-less city in the Middle East. 

I agree with other posters that your best bet is probably to do some heavy-duty ""silver lining"" action. It'll feel hokey, but just go for it. Eat gelato! Learn some Italian! Use meetup.com to plug in to other expats, check out hash house harriers if you run and/or drink, take a class in something. Living in other countries is never without challenges but it's also an amazing opportunity. Since this hasn't been a great year for your job, figure out what you can get out of your experience so that it's still a worthwhile year for you - whether that's learning a new skill, starting a blog, or just wandering around soaking up your host country's atmosphere.

It's also important to talk to your husband about this. When we were preparing to move, we took some courses through my work about adjusting to overseas life, and a common issue is that the working spouse adjusts much more quickly than a spouse who's at home, because when you're working your day is often very similar to how it was at home. You need to flag to your husband that you're struggling, because he should recognize that you've made a big sacrifice for him and he needs to support you - whether it's by just making sure you guys get some high-quality couple time in the evenings or making an effort to introduce you to people, or whatever. 

I'd also recommend checking out the [US State Department's blogroll](http://www.afsa.org/foreign_service_blogs.aspx) as there are a lot of spouses who blog and what you're feeling is definitely a common theme - it can help to see that others are in the same boat and vent to people who know what you're going through, instead of people who think you're being ungrateful (because of course, living overseas usually sounds dreamy to our friends and families at home!).

To me, it doesn't seem like a divorce/career change is necessary, but something needs to change for you to be happy.

SO many people say that they would loveeeee to work from home. I did it for 4 months and hated it. I chose to be unemployed rather than make bunches of money (for my age). My work involved many confidential documents that meant I had to work from home on my secured network. Is your job something you can do from a cafe with a laptop? Maybe even a public library? That way you can kill two birds with one stone-get out and get work done. I've also heard of groups for people that work from home and get together for lunches perhaps you could find something like that? 

Being an expat is hard, but you don't have to do it alone. Try your cities subreddit/meetup groups and try to connect with people who are going through something similar. 

I'm currently an expat SO, following my boyfriend. His company offers tons of stuff for the husbands and wives that are displaced because of their spouses. They do events for all sorts of interest groups and there are always interesting people there. Maybe your husband could talk to his boss/HR and see of there is something you can get involved in there. 

Most importantly talk to your husband! Let him know you love him, support him, and am trying to be there for him but it's very hard for you at the moment. Try to work out a game plan for how you can both make things improve for you. 

Ask him to reach out to his colleagues and see if they have any spouses that wouldn't mind meeting up with you (expat or native Italian , either work).

That's not what really happens in most cases.  In most cases, the parties still have strong feelings for each other, and the reason people stay in abusive relationships is that there is still a lot of ""good"" and the good oftentimes outweighs the bad, at least in their minds.  It seems like in your relationship there was still a lot of ""good"" that was irrationally clouding your emotions and making you ignore the bad.  That feeling of ""love"" is a powerful fucking drug. 

And your ex sounds like he's a guy going through some terrible mental problems.  He obviously has some serious issues but he also does seem to feel some remorse and care about you. 

But here's the thing: you need to just leave and not look back.  From an emotional standpoint, it makes sense for you to still long for it, but rationally you just can't have this person in your life.  It is wrecking your self esteem and inflicting physical damage on your body.  You need to cut all contact and move on.

Believe me, hes not in my life. He hasn't been since I pressed charges and I plan on keeping it that way. We have a no-contact order which is practically a court-issued PPO. The only contact we have is the couple times we make eye contact in court. I have no plans of interacting with him for the rest of my life.

Its hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember. But yes, I am moving on & forward with my life and have been taking as many steps as it takes to heal. ",2,t3_23s25l
20140423130500,emmub,"You were in love with him, and a victim of a huge mental and physical trauma. In the midst of all the pain and fear it's no wonder you didn't want him to go. It doesn't make you any worse, and you were not acting stupid in any way.

About the guy-to me, it seems like he did/does care about you. Maybe he was scared of losing control like that again, and hurting you even worse, and that's why he wanted to end it. 

Still, he's obviously in a lot of pain and very unstable. He needs professional help, and i do agree that you need to cut all ties with him for many reasons-  to stay safe, to move on, and to show him he can never treat someone that way again, no matter how bad he feels.",6,t3_23s25l
20140423152127,what_a_cat_astrophe,"Maybe I can shed some light to why you're feeling this way. 

What your ex did to you was horrible beyond words and you did not deserve it one bit.  He was supposed to love you and be on your team, but he beat you instead.  Yet you still love him to pieces and despite your bruises, you wished he would stay.  Of course, this is where a lot of people would tell you to walk away, but it isn't so easy, is it?  

The fact your ex realizes what he has done is a good thing.  He's clearly going through some issues right now due to a rough upbringing and it's good he can address his anger.  That doesn't make what he did OK though.

**Why I think a lot of us end up staying**

In the beginning of your relationship, all was well.  And over time, there was a slow drip of emotional abuse.  Such a slow drip, in fact, you hardly notice it coming on and things proceed to feel pretty normal.  You still regard and respect him as your lover because of the ""good times"" you have had, and the ones you still have.  So you find yourself holding out for the good days.  Waiting around for things to get better - the day when things will be back to normal again, because they weren't always like this.  

**Why I think we sometimes blame ourselves, and make up excuses**

Perhaps you might even blame yourself a bit too and wonder if a part of you deserved that treatment, because the man who used to treat you like a princess in the beginning now treats you like scum.  So you make up excuses as to why it's OK to stay with someone who makes us feel so bad.

**Having the last word**

I know that you feel like *you* should have had the last word.  You deserved to, after all - he was a total pig.  Sometimes having the last word feels a lot like justice.  It's one part of the closure process, and for some of us it can be a big one!  The fact he left you makes you feel cheated.  He's the asshole, not you, and he deserves to be the one who is walked away from because you want him to feel the pain he deserves.  You want him to know that he screwed up and that you were the one who was strong enough to walk away from it.  It's entirely understandable, but you need to remember that that is all it is: having the last word, and walking away feeling empowered from what made you feel powerless.  In short, he humiliated you.

-----

My emotionally abusive ex (also had an abusive childhood) left me the second he found a good reason to.  He cheated on me, but I blamed myself and made excuses as to why his behavior was OK because I figured if things were good in the beginning, there was a specific reason why they weren't anymore.  He abused me emotionally so often that it crushed my ego.  I couldn't stand up for myself because he would find a way to break my confidence whenever I did.  I refused to let him just cheat on me without a fight.  I wanted to prove that I could be an awesome girlfriend and make him feel sorry for what he did.  All I wanted him to do was realize I was a good person, so I stayed with him for five long months until he came up with some dumb reason to break up with me.

And of course he was sorry.  After some time, he realized what he'd lost and understood he fucked up.  But most men do after a while, and some of them may even try to come back to the ones they hurt.  Because when an abuser starts to miss the person they hurt, they think they can be better because RIGHT then and there, they want to be.  But fact of the matter is, if they have found a reason to go that far with you once before, they'll do it again.  It took my girl friend THREE times over four years to figure this out with her physically abusive boyfriend until she finally was able to walk away forever.

It's a long road, but eventually you will learn to get past all the humiliation he left you with and start to understand that what's important is that you're OUT.  It doesn't matter who left who - what matters is you're safe now.  And someday, you're going to find ""the one"".  He will love and respect you like crazy and you'll wonder why you ever settled for a life with someone who made you feel scared or miserable.

20140423152018,La_Fee_Verte,"Have you wondered about why you stayed with him for so long and what are your mental and emotional issues that made him so irresistible to you in the first place?  

The history of abusive relationships likes to repeat itself.  

What helped me was the book - 'women who love too much ' by Robin Norwood. Maybe you could have a read and see if it's any helpful!? ",1,t3_23s25l
20140423201347,mcrfreak78,"I do think about that too. I was scared to be alone and frankly I just fell hard for him. He made me feel important and I had never felt loved before. He was my best friend, my first boyfriend. We lived together and talked about our future. When he hurt me he would apologize, sweet-talk me, cry, comfort me, buy me stuff, tell me he was going to change so much etc. 

When things got worse I was still clinging on to the little bit of hope it  would get better. I was more in love with the memories and feelings of infatuation I had with this person more than him himself. He was the first person I fell in love with. 

By the times things got so bad I didn't want to leave because I couldn't imagine being so alone. I cut ties with a lot of friends because I thought he was all I needed. I depended on him to help pay rent and bills. When they say ""love is a hell of a drug"" they arent lieing. I was completely addicted to the feeling of being in a relationship (no matter how miserable I was) Despite everything I was scared of the thought of having no one to talk to. Coming home to nobody. Sleeping by myself. It was overwhelming to consider at the time because of how weak I was. 

The thought of going from being someones everything everyday to being alone terrified me. By that point I was too emotionally invested in the relationship. I felt him growing away and becoming distant so I tried pulling him closer, only to have him pull away harder and so on. In a way, at the end it wasn't even a relationship. We were on opposite teams. He was putting down to build himself up. It was almost a parasitic  relationship, & extremely emotionally exhausting to say the least.

But I digress, Ive had time take a long hard look at myself and why I did everything I thought I wouldn't. Anyways I will look into that book you suggested. Thank you so much.",1,t3_23s25l
20140423140953,Celarcade,"My abusive ex was never physically abusive to this level, but he abused me all the time mentally, physically, sexually... One of the ways that abusers do this is by making you believe you 100% need them and by scraping away your confidence and self-esteem. He's probably been subtly (or not so subtly) manipulating you and making you dependent on him for a while now. I used to spend hours in guilty feelings, considering all the things I had done to supposedly deserve my abuse. Our relationship was very volatile, and having said somethings I wasn't proud of either in the heat of arguments made things more confusing. He'd ""apologize"", but always blamed me for his outbursts. He always twisted things to relieve himself of ANY and ALL responsibility. Does any of this sound familiar? 

When this ex of mine split up with me, I struggled with the same thoughts: Shouldn't I, the injured party, have been the one to break it off? Why did I beg him to stay after everything? 

Truth is, being abused by someone doesn't mean there's no love in the relationship. It means that between all the good times, there's terrible times of fear and anguish. When you're ""in it"", you always see both the good and bad times. You don't just see the man who hits you, you see the man who brought you flowers and sang you songs.

I don't know if it's always like that, but I was only able to really gain perspective on my abusive relationship after it had been over for a while. From a more distant perspective than yours, I'm just glad he's away from you. This man is dangerous and I'd keep my distance, if anything, to let yourself heal emotionally and gain some perspective.

You're right, I do feel stupid and beat myself up. I still have feelings of guilt, regret & doubts even now, three months later. I need to stop constantly wondering whether it was my fault & if I could have prevented it. Or constantly asking myself if I turned him this way.

Its comforting to hear someone has been in the same situation(not that I don't feel for you, of course)- with the whole him leaving you. I was always told they will beg for your mercy and youd take them back and the abuse would continue, so I was so hurt and confused when he left me because I always thought it didn't go that way. & always wondering ""if he left because he cared, why did he hurt me so bad""

Thats so true, I was so blinded when I was in it. I would always tell myself & him ""the day you punch me will be the day its done forever"" and he'd say ""Id never do that to you."" Then when the situation arises and the heart gets involved, all logic & reasoning completely fly out the window to make room for feeling & emotion. Hindsight IS 20/20. When I reminisce I cannot believe how long I let myself be miserable. I'd always give my best friend shit for dating a guy who was rude to her, without in a million years thinking I'd let a guy doing everything he did to me.

They can be bulky. Less bulk and you'll probably need to change them more often. Soaking them in oxy-clean like cleaners helps stop staining.

Reading the questions asked in the survey I would say that I used to be the type of person that silenced myself.  I was this way since I was a child.  In fact, my siblings would call themselves the ""partners in crime"" while I was labeled the ""dream child.""  

I think that all that has changed for me because I resented having to hold so much in.  I say no more now.  I bring up difficult, uncomfortable topics with my fiance rather than just avoid confrontation.  That being said, I'm silencing myself less, but there are times when I still bite my tongue, so to speak.  

I can't tell you how to change, but in my case I learned to speak up more because I know that that's the only way my relationship is going to work (my fiance is a self silencer too).  If I don't speak up, I know he won't and then it just grows into resentment on both our parts.  Be willing to say no too.  You can't do everything.  Sometimes you do have to put yourself first, especially if you're in school.  Ask people to help if you think you need it.  For example, while in my PhD program my older sister, who is very assertive, called my parents (who were going through a divorce) and basically told them to chill out and leave me alone, especially during finals.  Or just have someone that can help remind you to take time for you.  ",3,t3_23rpna
20140423171742,missyb,"I read this, and realised that I used to be very silencing of myself, but I'm not anymore. For example, I was brought up to believe that you had to do everything for other people, and stay with people forever, etc etc. It led to me staying in a very emotionally abusive relationship for years, because I thought that you had to just stay with people, once you'd made the original choice to be with them. Well I got out of that relationship, was messed up for a few years, did some counselling, thought about things- and realised that I don't really believe it. I don't believe that bullshit I was taught. I can see why my parents cling to it, but it's not true in all cases- and I don't have to be with someone, if they're not right for me. And I realised that I would rather be on my own, than be with the wrong person. That was SO FREEING for me to realise. I just could not be arsed anymore, worrying myself over the other person, twisting myself to be what I thought they wanted. It just seemed so much more relaxing to be on my own, and be my own self.

So I feel like you wanted help, you asked about the steps people took. So, I went to counselling. I got the right meds for my depression and anxiety. I did a lot of CBT and thought about WHY I put my own needs last. And CBT teaches you to challenge those thoughts. So now when I read that list, I would read 'I need to put my own desires last to not be selfish' and I think 'no, I need to look after myself otherwise I will be miserable, looking after myself is a basic prerequisite for allowing me to have good relationships with other people.' So now I automatically have helpful, healthy thoughts about things- because I have sat down and asked myself questions like 'why do I think it's okay for people to mistreat me? What am I scared of if I say no? What am I scared of if I am myself?' So I would recommend CBT to everyone, it really helped me.",2,t3_23rpna

Have you talked to him about how difficult this will be to take on all by yourself, with time off and limited income? Ask if he is able to support or help you during this time? I mean, someone who will just sit back while you're bankrupting yourself AND managing physical/emotional recovery is probably not a good long term partner. In which case - family support maybe?

Anyway, the reason I asked about legal obligation was because I wanted to be fully educated on each of our rights before I presented the idea of him helping me.  Since we've basically been spending the past 2 months waiting to see if I could get financial aid, we hadn't really discussed what would happen if I ended up having to pay.

Anyway, we just talked about it and he agrees with me and thinks it's ridiculous that men don't have any legal obligation- provided that paternity is either proved or accepted.  But you're right, if I were with someone who was resistant to help me while bankrupting myself, I would seriously have to reconsider our relationship.

Assuming the sex that resulted in a pregnancy was a consensual act, I believe an argument would be that by choosing to have sex, you assume the responsibility of anything that results from that. This would include pregnancy and any complications.

Switching up the context a little bit: lets say a woman were performing fellatio on a man, and seriously hurt him somehow.  I would think that the two should share in financial responsibility.  I guess that's not how it works, though.  Maybe I'm just wired differently.

I think that pregnancy and your example of the foreskin ripping during intercourse are more comparable to each other.  The only reason I brought up this example is because I feel like in the situation of fellatio, the woman is a bit more responsible for the injury, and I think it's bizarre that she wouldn't have any financial responsibility to it.",-3,t3_23sam9

While this can't be proved-- that would mean it had nothing to do with my body doing the wrong thing.

Men are not legally required to pay for half of an abortion or for half of maternity care. You would also have no way to prove the pregnancy resulted from sex with your significant other from a legal stand point. 

You can ask him to contribute and it would be nice for him to do so but he is in no way obligated to. You can try to sue him if you feel it's necessary but odds are all this is going to do is end your relationship.

My advice is to go to the hospital, apply for charity care, and work out a payment plan with them.

If you had already talked and he refused to help, and you were going to break up with him and try to throw him under the bus I think I could more effectively see why you might be interested in the law.

Im not in any way saying that they SHOULD have a say.. its just complicated and theres no way to make it fair.

Tonight my SO and I are writing out a contract that states 2 things: 1) if i were to get pregnant, we would terminate it unless we BOTH agree to follow through with the pregnancy.  And 2) in the event of a termination or health complication due to the pregnancy, we would both be financially responsible for the medical expenses.

It may not be conventional- and i dont know if it would even hold up in court if either of us tried to go against it... but it makes me glad that we are together on this.  At this point in our lives, i think we trust each other not to need a contract.. but who knows what will happen in the future.

In this case, there was no decision to the abortion of the fetus... when my ovary erupted, the pregnancy was terminated.  Regardless of that, my SO and I were on the same page on what to do if the pregnancy was viable.  We had a verbal agreement before we starting having sex.

I really view everything pregnancy related to be a partnership, though- even if the law disagrees.  There's a lot of grey area, obviously.  Do I think it's fair that a woman can get an abortion if the father really wants the child? No.  But honestly there isn't really a good solution in a situation like that.

20140423161431,maria340,"You sign a contract when you get married. That's kind of the point; for the government to recognize your union, and the privileges and responsibilities you gain with it. If you haven't signed a contract with someone (not married), then as far as the law is concerned, you're just two strangers. I think having the kind of relationship where both people are on the same page is extremely important and valuable. But it gets dangerous if you try to bring the law in between two people who do not have that legally-binding contract with one another. A father can be anything from a committed partner in a LTR, to a man who only met the mother one time, at conception. If a father is required to cover an abortion, for example, then wouldn't it be reasonable to require a woman to provide a written consent form before having the procedure? But of course we do not want to live in a world like that. We do not want to require a man's legal consent for a woman to do *anything.* The necessary consequence is that men are not held to any of the responsibilities/privileges concerning parenthood. Unless, once again, there is a marriage contract, which is entered into purposefully and willingly.

For instance, a man who suspects he has fathered a child but was not married to the mother or named on the birth certificate can apply for a declarator which, if granted, gives him the same legal rights as the mother. Similarly if both mother and father agree that the father is the father and he is named on the certificate then he has the same rights as the mother. In terms of cohabiting couples, if you are to all outward appearances married (ie having a sexual relationship, paying bills together and living together) then you do in essence have all the same rights as a married couple.

Also, I could be enjoying the wine a little too much, but did your post mention your telling your SO about the pregnancy? If so, what was his reaction to it, how did he feel? Did he run screaming for the hills?

You would be surprised how many men, especially the good ones, demand to be able to pay for the bill. Don't let them, not as a controlling method but if you want to say you are equal to him, you should pay for half or whatever portion you can muster up as compared to their income. ",1,t3_23sam9
