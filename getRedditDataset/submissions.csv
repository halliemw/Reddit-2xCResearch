I would appreciate opinionated answers and sources on the topic as well.
Some questions that might be more to the point:

Where does corruption stem from?

Do checks and balances systems work? 

Is it possible to have a corrupt-free government/society or is that one of those ""only sounds good on paper"" situations?

I am very close with my friends and family but I have a feeling that I would experience disappointment and judgement from them if I told them what I was doing, even though I'm certain most of them are pro-choice.

I have no money, my boyfriend has massive amounts of debt, we're both pursuing artistic careers and having a child would shatter us.

t3_23qjfq,"My boyfriend is an idiot and as a result everyone now thinks I'm an idiot!","Last week my boyfriend suffered a concussion whilst horsing around and wrestling with a friend. He knocked himself unconscious and terrified both the friend and those around him. He claimed to be ""fine"" the day of but started experiencing severe headaches and nausea the next day, so we went to the hospital. We are still waiting for a CT scan but he's been officially diagnosed with a concussion and was advised to take it easy.

However, he hasn't. He owns and coaches at a gym which he hasn't taken any time off of but can be easily modified to keep him safe. However, he also still insists on working out although he claims to have ""modified"" the workouts to be less stressful to his head. He's still pushing himself pretty intensely to the point where he's very dizzy or throws up after workouts despite doctors orders.

I've told him about a million times that I'd like him to stop working out. Pretty much everyone in his circle of family and friends has told him this. He initially did try to stay off his feet but said he felt ""fine"" and was back at it after not even a day of rest. He's convinced himself that the positive benefits of exercise are somehow actually good for his potential brain energy and that he's modified things enough to be okay. 

I'm really worried about him, especially as his CT scan is still days away and he has worsening symptoms following exercise. On top of that, I'm also pretty mad at him as well for being so stupid and careless with his health. Part of me feels guilty for even being mad about it, since it is his body and his choice. 

Furthermore, all of our family and friends not only think he's an idiot but have now started seeing me in a negative light as well. I've heard behind my back how I'm an idiot for not ""making him stop"" and for ""putting up with his idiocy"" from his siblings and even from my own!

Anyone have any advice here? I've tried talking to him (and yelling at him!) and it doesn't seem to be getting through.

I am a 19 year old college freshman in a small town and have had my first job for about 6 months now. It is a small 5 employee print shop, with two mid 30 year old women and another college female, with me being the newest one. I have recently been noticing that I am beginning to do more of the ""physical"" work including changing air filters, repairing machines, cleaning out offices, moving boxes, etc. My official job title is Customer Service/Production (as I deal with the customers and prepare the jobs). The reason I got this job was with the help of the other college aged worked who has been here for a year and a half. 

Let me also state that I have no intention of staying in this job because I will be moving away out of town for a university by fall of 2015 at the latest to pursue a Mechanical Engineering degree, which my boss, a 50 year old male has. I have a sense that just because I want to be an engineer, he puts me to do the ""manly"" jobs and doesn't want to bother the other 3 who do design work because of their degree. Also, when the other workers are supposed to be working, I see them on their phones (especially the college girl) and when I walk into the office she pretends she's back to working. This has infuriated me to the point that I want to quit because it is not fair that I am doing the dirty jobs while she sits behind a desk ""working"". 

With that being said, there is a new opening as a secretary in town and think it is right for me to experience a new job. My question is, how do I tell my boss I want to quit. Should I go ask for information about the new job and if I get through the interview process and hopefully get hired, do I tell my boss then and put in a 2 weeks notice. This is the first time I have dealt with a situation like this. 

P.s earlier in the year, I decided not to pursue an engineering intership because I felt like the ""company"" needed me, but I now see that the only need they want is my ""physical and engineering help"" 

TL;DR I am having issues at work with how I am being assigned to do the ""physical and dirty"" work in the print shop while others are barely working in an office designing.

I've been dating him for 2 1/2 years, and was super excited about going to the dance. We didn't go to Homecoming this year because we knew we were going to prom. I mean, I feel like the dance itself is not that important. Why should it be a big deal to me?  But then I think about my dress, and how I get to look my best and dance and have fun. I had already bought my dress when he dropped the news.  See, he is on one of a couple of extracurricular teams that placed in state, and are going to nationals in Washington D.C.   Awesome, right? Well it was, until I found out that prom and that trip were on the same day.

But the thing is, is that the trip is optional. He is not required to go, in fact, some of the seniors on other teams aren't going because of prom.  I just feel so guilty, though, because don't want to be the thing that keeps him from enjoying this. When he told me about not coming to prom... I started sobbing right there. I don't know why I'm still so upset over it, that was over 2 months ago but every time i see a guy asking a girl to prom I just start tearing up. Because now I don't get to be with my best friend at prom, I don't get to experience being asked, it just hurts.  

We talked about it, and I told him how bad it made me feel.  He knows I was crying almost every night.  But in person, when I finally got him to sit down and talk about it, I told him how I wanted to feel important enough to him to pick me over going to his competition.  After that he got this weird look on his face.  I asked him why he looked so conflicted, and it was because he was about to break up with me because he was causing me so much pain, and felt like he couldn't make me happy anymore.  Which, he had tried to compromise by saying the whole ""We can have our own prom!"" line... 

My whole family is upset with him and his parents as well, because last year his parents forced him to go to another girls prom because she didn't want to be alone, even though i specifically told them that I was uncomfortable with it. If I had known her it wouldn't have bugged me so much, but I think its a huge slap in the face for them to disrespect my feelings twice now.  Once when I told them I didn't feel comfortable with that situation, and then now that my prom isn't as important as that girls.  She couldn't be alone, but its ok for me to be?

I sound so selfish when I read this back.  This is a really cool opportunity for him, going to nationals for something is awesome. And I can see how much he wants to... but cant he see how much I want to go to prom? He has an obligation to his team to compete, but I feel like he also has an obligation to me.  He has already decided, hell, he had decided even before he told me about it.  I think what really hurts the most, is that I don't think he has even said sorry about it. 

I don't know what to do about this. I just got my dress back from being altered, but I just put it in my closet and started crying.  I thought I would feel better about this by now, and I have no idea what to do.  I'm scared to tell him, because I don't want him to break up with me because he feels like he can't make me happy anymore. 

He is going to the competition, but I still feel so bitter over it.  I don't want this to ruin our relationship.  Its just prom, and that's what I keep telling myself... but apparently logic doesn't influence my emotions.

I'm interested in it because I've been on birth control pills for going on 10 years and I'm sick of taking those things daily. My life has gotten more hectic recently (grad school, full time job and multiple volunteer/leadership positions) and I'd rather not have to worry about it. I'm in a long term relationship where we don't want children any time soon (probably never) so I'd really like to not get pregnant.

Some women have said they completely lose their periods and others say that they bleed for long periods of time after the initial implantation. I'm curious to know if the women who lost their period are smaller (weigh less) and that may be why. I have a overweight BMI and I'm concerned that it will cause me to bleed for months on end at the beginning. Other thing I noticed is that women said they lost their sex drive. I already have a pretty low sex drive, I think it has to deal with self-esteem and negative body image more than actual sexual desire. 

Any comments or recommendations would help.

He took that as a yes, and that's when it all began. The next couple years were spent with him. I felt too worthless for anyone else. Too dirty. I'd always tell him I don't want to do that.

He moved away, and I ended it with him, knowing that I wouldn't have to face him and his anger problems. 
I pushed it all deep down. I did my best not to think of it. Now I am 18, and I can't stop thinking about it. Every little thing reminds me of him.

1. Reduce my chances of getting pregnant during PIV sex (the boyfriend and I always use condoms but we want a hormonal method as well just to be sage
2. End the killer periods! I'm sick of missing school and lying in bed feeling miserable. 
3. Not interfere with my other meds (lamictal 200 mg, zoloft 25 mg, and clonidine--not to be confused with klonopin--for bipolar disorder/anxiety nos/sleep)
4. Something cheap. My family is pretty poor but we're fortunate enough to get halfway decent health insurance through my dad's employer (the state). 

Obviously I'll talk to the gynecologist about this and I've been doing thorough research on Planned Parenthood's site. But the My Method app they have isn't too helpful and I want to know more about what people's personal experiences. Also, a few other things:


* I worry about going on the pill because I'm fairly bad at remembering to take the meds I'm currently on, even with reminders and alarms 

* Implanon--the PP website says it doesn't work if you're on certain psych meds--anyone know about this (and obviously I'll consult the gyno and my shrink but just wanted some more info beforehand)? Blog post on Scarleteen said otherwise but didn't specify which meds. Also the insertion method kind of scares me. 

* Mirena: has anyone had an experience with this making their periods lighter? I like the idea of it lasting for five years and being relatively low maintenance. I'm worried about the up front costs and wondering if it will be cheaper than the pill over time. At 18 I think I'm off Dad's insurance? Not sure. 

* I'm very fortunate to have parents and a loving boyfriend who are supportive. Wanted to acknowledge that just 'cuz.

t3_23s966,"Tennessee Making Pregnancy Outcomes a Crime - Why You Should Care and How You Can Help","Tennessee's General Assembly has passed a law that would make women [criminally liable for the outcomes of their pregnancies.](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/10/tennessee-legislature-passes-far-reaching-bill-make-pregnant-women-criminals/) The bill targets women who use narcotics illegally during pregnancy, but is written so broadly that any pregnancy loss thought to be connected to an 'unlawful' act can be grounds for investigation, arrest, and prosecution. This means that anyone who has a miscarriage at any time in pregnancy or gives birth to a baby with health problems can face criminal investigation. The penalties are assault charges, which can carry up to 15 years in prison. 

This is bad business for a lot of reasons. 
* It is [meanspirited and counterproductive](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/opinion/criminalizing-expectant-mothers.html): women who struggle with addiction need health care, not handcuffs. 
* [Medical experts recognize](http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Health_Care_for_Underserved_Women/Substance_Abuse_Reporting_and_Pregnancy_The_Role_of_the_Obstetrician_Gynecologist) that the threat of prosecution actually hurts babies by driving women away from prenatal care.
* The law will [disproportionately punish black women] (http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/17/tennessees-pregnancy-criminalization-law-will-hit-black-women-hardest/), who are more likely to be blamed for their pregnancy outcomes. 
* Prosecutors claim that *only* addicted women who don't seek treatment will be arrested, and they will *only* be charged with a misdemeanor. But [nothing in the law](http://www.salon.com/2014/04/21/you_cant_always_trust_people_to_do_the_right_thing_how_a_law_split_pro_life_gopers_in_tennessee/) limits it in this way. 

Prosecutors and police shouldn't have a place in pregnancy: this is the first time a state has passed a law that gives them an in. 

The bill is currently awaiting Governor Bill Haslam's signature. Groups are circulating a petition [demanding that he veto the law.](http://action.rhrealitycheck.org/page/s/gov-haslam-veto-pregnancy-criminalization-sb-1391)  I hope you will sign, and I would also appreciate your suggestions as to where else I might post.

t3_23rx22,"Expat Trailing Spouse resenting marriage. Super lonely!","Hi Ladies, 

I moved to Italy with my husband in September.  He is pursuing his postdoc.  I am an engineer, and am working remotely.  The whole thing fell apart.  We got married like 4 days before we moved out here, which was incredibly stressful and ridiculous in its own right, and I was supposed to work at the European site here.  When I got here, they gave some bla bla work visa excuses that my company was supposed to work out but didn't.  Several conversations and weeks later, they asked me to just work ""from home"".


It is so hard.  It has been 7 months and it is not going well.  I am a huge extrovert and my husband is the only person I talk to.  We have some friends yeah, but they are his office buddies.  My whole identity is warped now that I'm married. I'm essentially a stay at home wife.     I have not bothered to learn Italian, I just don't even give a shit.


My job is only letting me do this for one year so I have to go back in September.  I would have gone back by now but I was trying to make it work, and people are coming to visit and I didn't want to disapoint everyone.  We have this stupid picture perfect sounding life - moving to Italy and I get to work my breadwinning job from here - fuck me, its anything but.  My job has unravelled, I get menial tasks, most of the time I don't do anything but stay logged on until I get an email.  I used to be a heavy hitter - now I'm just a name on the org chart.  I've addressed this with my boss but not much has changed. I have been considering changing careers when I get back in Sept, have been considering divorce, I am just not happy.  To be honest, I am more important to myself than my relationship is to me.  I probably should not have gotten married and came out here.  We had been dating 8 years and rushed the wedding when we found out he got the position.


I just need to vent. Today was especially bad for me.  We went on a great trip this weekend but today is our first full day back and my despair hit me like a ton of bricks.  I am so lost. I know when I go back to the US I'll fall into another depressive episode and feel like this was a wasted opportunity that I slept through.

I just got my period and I got the damn thing in easily enough, which was a surprise. However, i'm unsure if I did it right, haha. 

I folded it in the C-shape and got it in, but I can't turn it. there's still a bit of C-shape left while it's in. so i'm not sure it's 'sealed'? i heard a 'fwomp' sound. I've done this trice now, after two-ish hours, taking it out (I'm home right now, haha) and putting it back in. 

Taking it out is proving weirdly difficult, since the cup seems to.. err.. migrate up? it's still in straight and doesn't leak (the outside looks clean and there is stuff inside) but it's very far up, so it's hard to grasp it and take it out.

am I doing it right? it'll get easier with practice I'm sure and i don't feel it in there, but I'm afraid that if i leave it in for, say, six hour, it'll migrate further and i won't be able to get it out!

t3_23s25l,"In what world does the abuser leave the victim?? I am having trouble figuring out why this happened & feel like the only one who went through this.","I keep hearing about how abusive relationships are so hard to get out of because the man sweet-talks the woman and begs her to come back. Or at least that's how I THOUGHT it went.

I was in a year long relationship with an emotionally, mentally & physically abusive boyfriend. We threatened to dump each other all the time and the other would beg not to. In the beginning it was me dumping & him begging, but at the last part of it it was the opposite. He controlled, manipulated, and played mind games. I was wrapped around his finger & blinded by, what I thought was, love.

The night we broke up, he was super black out drunk & he decided to beat me because I was crying (that's literally the reason) 
I thought in most situations the guy would hit the girl then feel really bad afterwards and apologize only to do it again in the future; but he didn't stop. He kept punching, kicking, throwing, slapping me. He took my windpipe, looked me in the eye with a look like a demon had possessed him, and suffocated me twice. The last time I fell to the floor passed out.
He tried to leave but for some reason I still cared about him (I still cant figure out why) He said ""fine but I'm leaving in the morning"" & we both pass out.


I wake up next to him. He was laying facing away from me. I was in so much pain. My eye was throbbing and disgustingly bruised. I choked out, ""babe...are we still together?"" He leans over, looks at my eye & said ""Oh God"" He then jumped out of bed and started immediately packing his stuff. I was crying so hard asking why he was leaving, begging him not to. That I needed him (so I thought). He seemed like he was sad and he kept saying ""I have to.""  He then sits down and starts crying with me. He tells me ""he loves me and always will."" and we hug for the longest time. Tells me he will still pay his part of the rent. He then gets up, tells me he loves me, gives me one more hug and leaves me there to wallow in sadness, pain & emptiness.


The next day he told me we were just ""on a break"" and can ""try again"" when he ""gets his shit together."" After that day though he changed his mind and said we could never be together again, but could still be friends and hang out. Why was I the one begging him, when he had hurt me so bad? A week after all this, he calls me up crying saying he had gotten in the car and just drove & drove. Didn't know where or for how long but ended up like four states away. Told me he was scared and thinking about killing himself. I was stupid and still cared about him. I wired him money and we were talking like we were in love again that day. Was he manipulating me or did a part of him really become scared and looked to me for help?


The next two weeks after the incident we are talking. He seemed extremely depressed too. His father was abusive to his mother for like.. 10 years, and I guess he was upset that his father came out in him, because it seemed like he didn't want to become him. But then why did he? He used to cry about his dad so much in the first few months in our relationship. He was so sensitive and remorseful for being mean to me. Grieving for his lost childhood his father robbed him of. Then the last couple months between us, something in him snapped. He was so, angry at me. All the time. No matter how good I tried to be to him. He wasn't the guy I fell in love with, he had become a monster and I'm not sure why or what happened. Im not saying I was the perfect girlfriend, I have made a few mistakes, but I didn't treat him like he treated me. I put way more energy, time, and feelings into this guy than anyone ever has, despite how he acted towards me.


No matter how much I think about it I can't figure out what happened in his head. Did he care about me and just let his demons take over or did he never care & just use me for his own personal gain? When he was beating me he told me he ""stopped loving me a long time ago."" & truth comes out when you are drunk. But if he did, why did he keep coming back when I begged him not to dump me? I mean, he did do a few things for me..He called the ambulance for me when I drank to much, projecting vomit, and spent the night waiting at the hospital for me. He bought me some gifts when I caught him doing something and took me out to eat. Just all the negatives outweighed the positives. But did he care about me or not? Why did he cry and act depressed when we broke up? Only to start treating me like less than dirt again? 


I think he was either bipolar, borderline personality or something along those lines. My therapist says that they are addicted to power and control & leaving is maybe a way they still have control on you because you are begging for them back. But when they leave they wont be able to have power over me anymore to satisfy their hunger. I can don't understand all this. 


Can anyone shed some light on the situation? I am having trouble swallowing the fact that I wasn't even strong enough to leave him. I was BEGGING for my ABUSER to come back to ME. 
WHY?????????
He took that satisfaction away. It was insult to injury, a slap in the face. (Literally) I just *can't* understand why. He was so cruel, but acted remorseful and ran away.


(P.s. I am in the process of pressing charges in case you are wondering. & I am so better off without him. Hes in jail and dead to me. I will never want to have contact with him again.)


Any knowledge on this subject is appreciated. Xoxo.


TLDR: What possible reason could possess my abusive boyfriend to leave ME after he beat & almost killed me? Why was I begging for him back and not the other way around?

EDIT: Might I add he had very large sad eyes when I glared at him in court while I gave my testimony. He looked scared and hurt. I was expecting him to look angry but it was mostly of disappointment it seemed. My mom tells me he probably is remorseful, but I have a hard time agreeing. She also mentioned that he probably knew his father was in him, but just couldn't suppress it any longer and is sad it came out and hurt me. Looking back on some old text messages she might be right. One read, ""It scares me when I yell at you like that because I don't want to lose control, I don't know what I'm capable of."" Showed it to my mom & she said, ""Yeah, he knew.""

Before when we still talked he did apologize a bunch of times and told me he left because ""he didn't want it to happen again"" But why do you suddenly care about me right after you beat & break me? With all the mind control, manipulating and lying hes fed me, its no surprise that I am seriously confused and don't know what to believe.

I am 25 years old, and I have never thought I wanted children of my own, but suddenly this year it's like the mommy hormones finally kicked in, and lots of my friends are pregnant or have had their first kid, and my stupid body is going ""babies! Let's make babies!"", and my logical brain is like ""what is this"" ‚Ä¶. And now I'm fucking knocked up and really confused about what I really want. 
I had an abortion at 16, and never thought it would happen again unplanned, yet here I am. That experience was heartbreaking and I really don‚Äôt want to go through it again. I am not in an ideal place in my life for a child - the father is my ex that I keep hooking up with because the sex is amazing and I do care about him a lot, but he is virtually homeless and jobless right now, due to really bad financial and business management coupled with severely debilitating depression and untreated OCD. In short, not someone I can count on.
I, on the other hand, have a really excellent job that pays very well and I have full benefits, I rent my own home, but I am still getting back on my feet (about $9k in debt not including my car or student loans) after being un or underemployed for two years. I am in a better place than a lot of women in my condition, but I still don‚Äôt think I could handle raising a child right now. 
I have thought a lot about adoption, but that brings up a lot of issues for me too. Could I handle that? After nine months and hours of pain in labor and birth, could I really give my amazing creation away, even if I had an open adoption? I was adopted, and I don‚Äôt see or talk to my bio mother, even though we did connect a few years ago (it was a closed adoption). Will my baby grow up to not want to see or talk to me? Will it be easier that way or to see him/her grow up with another couple? 
Also, I am so afraid of losing my pre-baby body. And (I know I shouldn‚Äôt care) but what will my coworkers and friends think, how will they react? I am atheist now, but I was raised Catholic, so those feelings of guilt are kind of hard wired into my brain. 
I also feel really lonely in this decision. I am not close to my mother so that‚Äôs not even an option of telling her until I actually make a decision (and only if it's not abortion). My father and I don‚Äôt talk about this kind of stuff lol. I'm not close to most of my blood family anyway, my family is the community of friends I have built around me, but even then, I would feel ashamed to tell most of my friends, even really close ones. The only person I feel totally comfortable talking to is my ex, the father, but he makes it really difficult because he's still completely in love with me. I know he will support whatever decision I choose, but I still wish I felt comfortable with other people to talk about this with. 
I don‚Äôt know if I'm really asking for advice or anything. I just feel really confused and conflicted and sad that this happened right now, at a really inconvenient time in my life. I don‚Äôt want to have an abortion, but I don‚Äôt like the other options any better. Sigh.

t3_23pxgq,"Rant: no one takes my anger seriously","Whenever someone's doing something that makes me outwardly frustrated, angry, or annoyed, they have a tendency to metaphorically pat me on the head and comment on how ""adorable"" it is when I'm angry. It's probably because I'm short and conventionally cute I guess, but I don't really get how petite-ness transfers into not having real emotions?? Just because my frustration is ""cute"" to you doesn't mean that I'm not actually angry... And sometimes my family thinks it's funny to get me all riled up about something (I'm usually pretty calm) and then brush it off, even though they actually genuinely changed my mood and played around with my feelings & it's hard to bounce back from that to cheerful conversation. I guess there's something about being a more emotionally reserved person so that when I do show emotion, it can be more entertainment than me actually having feelings.

I don't know. I'm angry and no one will believe me, so I'm writing about my feelings on the internet instead of talking about them IRL. Ha, take that family & friends.",2,20140422175121,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23qjfq,"My boyfriend is an idiot and as a result everyone now thinks I'm an idiot!","Last week my boyfriend suffered a concussion whilst horsing around and wrestling with a friend. He knocked himself unconscious and terrified both the friend and those around him. He claimed to be ""fine"" the day of but started experiencing severe headaches and nausea the next day, so we went to the hospital. We are still waiting for a CT scan but he's been officially diagnosed with a concussion and was advised to take it easy.

However, he hasn't. He owns and coaches at a gym which he hasn't taken any time off of but can be easily modified to keep him safe. However, he also still insists on working out although he claims to have ""modified"" the workouts to be less stressful to his head. He's still pushing himself pretty intensely to the point where he's very dizzy or throws up after workouts despite doctors orders.

I've told him about a million times that I'd like him to stop working out. Pretty much everyone in his circle of family and friends has told him this. He initially did try to stay off his feet but said he felt ""fine"" and was back at it after not even a day of rest. He's convinced himself that the positive benefits of exercise are somehow actually good for his potential brain energy and that he's modified things enough to be okay. 

I'm really worried about him, especially as his CT scan is still days away and he has worsening symptoms following exercise. On top of that, I'm also pretty mad at him as well for being so stupid and careless with his health. Part of me feels guilty for even being mad about it, since it is his body and his choice. 

Furthermore, all of our family and friends not only think he's an idiot but have now started seeing me in a negative light as well. I've heard behind my back how I'm an idiot for not ""making him stop"" and for ""putting up with his idiocy"" from his siblings and even from my own!

Anyone have any advice here? I've tried talking to him (and yelling at him!) and it doesn't seem to be getting through. Dealing with my worry and anger as well as external pressures from our friends and family has left me even more exhausted and I find myself suffering from terrible insomnia. I check on him throughout the night, especially when he comes home from the gym because I worry I'll wake up one day and he'll have died in his sleep!

t3_23qqqm,"HELP! I'm upset about my job!!","Sorry in advance if this is the wrong sub (if is it not, please redirect me) I will try to make this as short as possible. 

I am a 19 year old college freshman in a small town and have had my first job for about 6 months now. It is a small 5 employee print shop, with two mid 30 year old women and another college female, with me being the newest one. I have recently been noticing that I am beginning to do more of the ""physical"" work including changing air filters, repairing machines, cleaning out offices, moving boxes, etc. My official job title is Customer Service/Production (as I deal with the customers and prepare the jobs). The reason I got this job was with the help of the other college aged worked who has been here for a year and a half. 

Let me also state that I have no intention of staying in this job because I will be moving away out of town for a university by fall of 2015 at the latest to pursue a Mechanical Engineering degree, which my boss, a 50 year old male has. I have a sense that just because I want to be an engineer, he puts me to do the ""manly"" jobs and doesn't want to bother the other 3 who do design work because of their degree. Also, when the other workers are supposed to be working, I see them on their phones (especially the college girl) and when I walk into the office she pretends she's back to working. This has infuriated me to the point that I want to quit because it is not fair that I am doing the dirty jobs while she sits behind a desk ""working"". 

With that being said, there is a new opening as a secretary in town and think it is right for me to experience a new job. My question is, how do I tell my boss I want to quit. Should I go ask for information about the new job and if I get through the interview process and hopefully get hired, do I tell my boss then and put in a 2 weeks notice. This is the first time I have dealt with a situation like this. 

P.s earlier in the year, I decided not to pursue an engineering intership because I felt like the ""company"" needed me, but I now see that the only need they want is my ""physical and engineering help"" 

TL;DR I am having issues at work with how I am being assigned to do the ""physical and dirty"" work in the print shop while others are barely working in an office designing.

t3_23qda3,"My boyfriend isn't going to my senior prom with me, and I'm still upset about it after 2 months of knowing.","Sorry, long story:

I've been dating him for 2 1/2 years, and was super excited about going to the dance. We didn't go to Homecoming this year because we knew we were going to prom. I mean, I feel like the dance itself is not that important. Why should it be a big deal to me?  But then I think about my dress, and how I get to look my best and dance and have fun. I had already bought my dress when he dropped the news.  See, he is on one of a couple of extracurricular teams that placed in state, and are going to nationals in Washington D.C.   Awesome, right? Well it was, until I found out that prom and that trip were on the same day.

But the thing is, is that the trip is optional. He is not required to go, in fact, some of the seniors on other teams aren't going because of prom.  I just feel so guilty, though, because don't want to be the thing that keeps him from enjoying this. When he told me about not coming to prom... I started sobbing right there. I don't know why I'm still so upset over it, that was over 2 months ago but every time i see a guy asking a girl to prom I just start tearing up. Because now I don't get to be with my best friend at prom, I don't get to experience being asked, it just hurts.  

We talked about it, and I told him how bad it made me feel.  He knows I was crying almost every night.  But in person, when I finally got him to sit down and talk about it, I told him how I wanted to feel important enough to him to pick me over going to his competition.  After that he got this weird look on his face.  I asked him why he looked so conflicted, and it was because he was about to break up with me because he was causing me so much pain, and felt like he couldn't make me happy anymore.  Which, he had tried to compromise by saying the whole ""We can have our own prom!"" line... 

My whole family is upset with him and his parents as well, because last year his parents forced him to go to another girls prom because she didn't want to be alone, even though i specifically told them that I was uncomfortable with it. If I had known her it wouldn't have bugged me so much, but I think its a huge slap in the face for them to disrespect my feelings twice now.  Once when I told them I didn't feel comfortable with that situation, and then now that my prom isn't as important as that girls.  She couldn't be alone, but its ok for me to be?

I sound so selfish when I read this back.  This is a really cool opportunity for him, going to nationals for something is awesome. And I can see how much he wants to... but cant he see how much I want to go to prom? He has an obligation to his team to compete, but I feel like he also has an obligation to me.  He has already decided, hell, he had decided even before he told me about it.  I think what really hurts the most, is that I don't think he has even said sorry about it. 

I don't know what to do about this. I just got my dress back from being altered, but I just put it in my closet and started crying.  I thought I would feel better about this by now, and I have no idea what to do.  I'm scared to tell him, because I don't want him to break up with me because he feels like he can't make me happy anymore. 

He is going to the competition, but I still feel so bitter over it.  I don't want this to ruin our relationship.  Its just prom, and that's what I keep telling myself... but apparently logic doesn't influence my emotions.

t3_23qrdr,"Ladies, I got Nexplanon questions","So I've searched this sub about as much as I can so far and I've gotten mixed reviews on how people feel about it. 

I'm interested in it because I've been on birth control pills for going on 10 years and I'm sick of taking those things daily. My life has gotten more hectic recently (grad school, full time job and multiple volunteer/leadership positions) and I'd rather not have to worry about it. I'm in a long term relationship where we don't want children any time soon (probably never) so I'd really like to not get pregnant.

Some women have said they completely lose their periods and others say that they bleed for long periods of time after the initial implantation. I'm curious to know if the women who lost their period are smaller (weigh less) and that may be why. I have a overweight BMI and I'm concerned that it will cause me to bleed for months on end at the beginning. Other thing I noticed is that women said they lost their sex drive. I already have a pretty low sex drive, I think it has to deal with self-esteem and negative body image more than actual sexual desire. 

Any comments or recommendations would help.

I am having regular sex with my boyfriend but we use condoms and the diaphragm every time. I have also done quite a few pregnancy tests in the past 5 months so I'm relatively sure I'm not pregnant.

Other related health things:
- I did change my diet (paleoish - mostly wheat, dairy and soy free now) at around the same time that I went off the pill. 
- I have also noticed an increase in deep sore acne around my jaw line (I had pretty good skin on the pill).

No matter how much I told him I didn't want to, he wouldn't listen. He kept pushing me and pushing me. He got so close, my anxiety took over and I froze. He took that as a yes, and that's when it all began. The next couple years were spent with him. I felt too worthless for anyone else. Too dirty. I'd always tell him I don't want to do that. He didn't care. Even when I cried, he ignored it. His forceful touch overpowering my feeble attempts to push him away. He moved away, and I ended it with him, knowing that I wouldn't have to face him and his anger problems. 
I pushed it all deep down. I did my best not to think of it. Now I am 18, and I can't stop thinking about it. Every little thing reminds me of him. I am bisexual, but I tell people I am a lesbian, because whenever I am with a guy I think of him. Now it's getting worse though.

1. Reduce my chances of getting pregnant during PIV sex (the boyfriend and I always use condoms but we want a hormonal method as well just to be sage
2. End the killer periods! I'm sick of missing school and lying in bed feeling miserable. 
3. Not interfere with my other meds (lamictal 200 mg, zoloft 25 mg, and clonidine--not to be confused with klonopin--for bipolar disorder/anxiety nos/sleep)
4. Something cheap. My family is pretty poor but we're fortunate enough to get halfway decent health insurance through my dad's employer (the state). 

Obviously I'll talk to the gynecologist about this and I've been doing thorough research on Planned Parenthood's site. But the My Method app they have isn't too helpful and I want to know more about what people's personal experiences. Also, a few other things:


* I worry about going on the pill because I'm fairly bad at remembering to take the meds I'm currently on, even with reminders and alarms 

* Implanon--the PP website says it doesn't work if you're on certain psych meds--anyone know about this (and obviously I'll consult the gyno and my shrink but just wanted some more info beforehand)? Blog post on Scarleteen said otherwise but didn't specify which meds. Also the insertion method kind of scares me. 

* Mirena: has anyone had an experience with this making their periods lighter? I like the idea of it lasting for five years and being relatively low maintenance. I'm worried about the up front costs and wondering if it will be cheaper than the pill over time. At 18 I think I'm off Dad's insurance? Not sure. 

* I'm very fortunate to have parents and a loving boyfriend who are supportive. Wanted to acknowledge that just 'cuz.

This means that anyone who has a miscarriage at any time in pregnancy or gives birth to a baby with health problems can face criminal investigation. The penalties are assault charges, which can carry up to 15 years in prison. 

This is bad business for a lot of reasons. 
* It is [meanspirited and counterproductive](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/opinion/criminalizing-expectant-mothers.html): women who struggle with addiction need health care, not handcuffs.

* The law will [disproportionately punish black women] (http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/17/tennessees-pregnancy-criminalization-law-will-hit-black-women-hardest/), who are more likely to be blamed for their pregnancy outcomes. 
* Prosecutors claim that *only* addicted women who don't seek treatment will be arrested, and they will *only* be charged with a misdemeanor.

I moved to Italy with my husband in September.  He is pursuing his postdoc.  I am an engineer, and am working remotely.  The whole thing fell apart.  We got married like 4 days before we moved out here, which was incredibly stressful and ridiculous in its own right, and I was supposed to work at the European site here.  When I got here, they gave some bla bla work visa excuses that my company was supposed to work out but didn't.  Several conversations and weeks later, they asked me to just work ""from home"".


It is so hard.  It has been 7 months and it is not going well.  I am a huge extrovert and my husband is the only person I talk to.  We have some friends yeah, but they are his office buddies.  My whole identity is warped now that I'm married. I'm essentially a stay at home wife.     I have not bothered to learn Italian, I just don't even give a shit.


My job is only letting me do this for one year so I have to go back in September.  I would have gone back by now but I was trying to make it work, and people are coming to visit and I didn't want to disapoint everyone.  We have this stupid picture perfect sounding life - moving to Italy and I get to work my breadwinning job from here - fuck me, its anything but.  My job has unravelled, I get menial tasks, most of the time I don't do anything but stay logged on until I get an email.  I used to be a heavy hitter - now I'm just a name on the org chart.  I've addressed this with my boss but not much has changed. I have been considering changing careers when I get back in Sept, have been considering divorce, I am just not happy.  To be honest, I am more important to myself than my relationship is to me.  I probably should not have gotten married and came out here.  We had been dating 8 years and rushed the wedding when we found out he got the position.


I just need to vent. Today was especially bad for me.  We went on a great trip this weekend but today is our first full day back and my despair hit me like a ton of bricks.  I am so lost. I know when I go back to the US I'll fall into another depressive episode and feel like this was a wasted opportunity that I slept through.  I used to be so loyal and gung ho about my job - why bother to work so hard if they couldn't even back me up this year.  ",7,20140423104841,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt

t3_23sfoh,"Diva Cup... am I even doing it right? Help...","Hi! I live in Belgium and came across the Diva Cup online. A few months later I came across a little shop here that sells it and bought one. the lovely salesperson explained it all. I read the manual fifteen times.

I just got my period and I got the damn thing in easily enough, which was a surprise. However, i'm unsure if I did it right, haha. 

I folded it in the C-shape and got it in, but I can't turn it. there's still a bit of C-shape left while it's in. so i'm not sure it's 'sealed'? i heard a 'fwomp' sound. I've done this trice now, after two-ish hours, taking it out (I'm home right now, haha) and putting it back in. 

Taking it out is proving weirdly difficult, since the cup seems to.. err.. migrate up? it's still in straight and doesn't leak (the outside looks clean and there is stuff inside) but it's very far up, so it's hard to grasp it and take it out.

am I doing it right? it'll get easier with practice I'm sure and i don't feel it in there, but I'm afraid that if i leave it in for, say, six hour, it'll migrate further and i won't be able to get it out! 

advice very welcome, ty. ",3,20140423134915,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
t3_23s25l,"In what world does the abuser leave the victim?? I am having trouble figuring out why this happened & feel like the only one who went through this.","I keep hearing about how abusive relationships are so hard to get out of because the man sweet-talks the woman and begs her to come back. Or at least that's how I THOUGHT it went.

I was in a year long relationship with an emotionally, mentally & physically abusive boyfriend. We threatened to dump each other all the time and the other would beg not to. In the beginning it was me dumping & him begging, but at the last part of it it was the opposite. He controlled, manipulated, and played mind games. I was wrapped around his finger & blinded by, what I thought was, love.

The night we broke up, he was super black out drunk & he decided to beat me because I was crying (that's literally the reason) 
I thought in most situations the guy would hit the girl then feel really bad afterwards and apologize only to do it again in the future; but he didn't stop. He kept punching, kicking, throwing, slapping me. He took my windpipe, looked me in the eye with a look like a demon had possessed him, and suffocated me twice. The last time I fell to the floor passed out.
He tried to leave but for some reason I still cared about him (I still cant figure out why) He said ""fine but I'm leaving in the morning"" & we both pass out.


I wake up next to him. He was laying facing away from me. I was in so much pain. My eye was throbbing and disgustingly bruised. I choked out, ""babe...are we still together?"" He leans over, looks at my eye & said ""Oh God"" He then jumped out of bed and started immediately packing his stuff. I was crying so hard asking why he was leaving, begging him not to. That I needed him (so I thought). He seemed like he was sad and he kept saying ""I have to.""  He then sits down and starts crying with me. He tells me ""he loves me and always will."" and we hug for the longest time. Tells me he will still pay his part of the rent. He then gets up, tells me he loves me, gives me one more hug and leaves me there to wallow in sadness, pain & emptiness.


The next day he told me we were just ""on a break"" and can ""try again"" when he ""gets his shit together."" After that day though he changed his mind and said we could never be together again, but could still be friends and hang out. Why was I the one begging him, when he had hurt me so bad? A week after all this, he calls me up crying saying he had gotten in the car and just drove & drove. Didn't know where or for how long but ended up like four states away. Told me he was scared and thinking about killing himself. I was stupid and still cared about him. I wired him money and we were talking like we were in love again that day. Was he manipulating me or did a part of him really become scared and looked to me for help?


The next two weeks after the incident we are talking. He seemed extremely depressed too. His father was abusive to his mother for like.. 10 years, and I guess he was upset that his father came out in him, because it seemed like he didn't want to become him. But then why did he? He used to cry about his dad so much in the first few months in our relationship. He was so sensitive and remorseful for being mean to me. Grieving for his lost childhood his father robbed him of. Then the last couple months between us, something in him snapped. He was so, angry at me. All the time. No matter how good I tried to be to him. He wasn't the guy I fell in love with, he had become a monster and I'm not sure why or what happened. Im not saying I was the perfect girlfriend, I have made a few mistakes, but I didn't treat him like he treated me. I put way more energy, time, and feelings into this guy than anyone ever has, despite how he acted towards me.


No matter how much I think about it I can't figure out what happened in his head. Did he care about me and just let his demons take over or did he never care & just use me for his own personal gain? When he was beating me he told me he ""stopped loving me a long time ago."" & truth comes out when you are drunk. But if he did, why did he keep coming back when I begged him not to dump me? I mean, he did do a few things for me..He called the ambulance for me when I drank to much, projecting vomit, and spent the night waiting at the hospital for me. He bought me some gifts when I caught him doing something and took me out to eat. Just all the negatives outweighed the positives. But did he care about me or not? Why did he cry and act depressed when we broke up? Only to start treating me like less than dirt again? 


I think he was either bipolar, borderline personality or something along those lines. My therapist says that they are addicted to power and control & leaving is maybe a way they still have control on you because you are begging for them back. But when they leave they wont be able to have power over me anymore to satisfy their hunger. I can don't understand all this. 


Can anyone shed some light on the situation? I am having trouble swallowing the fact that I wasn't even strong enough to leave him. I was BEGGING for my ABUSER to come back to ME. 
WHY?????????
He took that satisfaction away. It was insult to injury, a slap in the face. (Literally) I just *can't* understand why. He was so cruel, but acted remorseful and ran away.


(P.s. I am in the process of pressing charges in case you are wondering. & I am so better off without him. Hes in jail and dead to me. I will never want to have contact with him again.)


Any knowledge on this subject is appreciated. Xoxo.


TLDR: What possible reason could possess my abusive boyfriend to leave ME after he beat & almost killed me? Why was I begging for him back and not the other way around?

EDIT: Might I add he had very large sad eyes when I glared at him in court while I gave my testimony. He looked scared and hurt. I was expecting him to look angry but it was mostly of disappointment it seemed. My mom tells me he probably is remorseful, but I have a hard time agreeing. She also mentioned that he probably knew his father was in him, but just couldn't suppress it any longer and is sad it came out and hurt me. Looking back on some old text messages she might be right. One read, ""It scares me when I yell at you like that because I don't want to lose control, I don't know what I'm capable of."" Showed it to my mom & she said, ""Yeah, he knew.""

Before when we still talked he did apologize a bunch of times and told me he left because ""he didn't want it to happen again"" But why do you suddenly care about me right after you beat & break me? With all the mind control, manipulating and lying hes fed me, its no surprise that I am seriously confused and don't know what to believe.

t3_23ssqq,"Unplanned pregnancy. Very conflicting emotions and thoughts.","Sorry for the long post. I am very conflicted. I am 25 years old, and I have never thought I wanted children of my own, but suddenly this year it's like the mommy hormones finally kicked in, and lots of my friends are pregnant or have had their first kid, and my stupid body is going ""babies! Let's make babies!"", and my logical brain is like ""what is this"" ‚Ä¶. And now I'm fucking knocked up and really confused about what I really want. 
I had an abortion at 16, and never thought it would happen again unplanned, yet here I am. That experience was heartbreaking and I really don‚Äôt want to go through it again. I am not in an ideal place in my life for a child - the father is my ex that I keep hooking up with because the sex is amazing and I do care about him a lot, but he is virtually homeless and jobless right now, due to really bad financial and business management coupled with severely debilitating depression and untreated OCD. In short, not someone I can count on.
I, on the other hand, have a really excellent job that pays very well and I have full benefits, I rent my own home, but I am still getting back on my feet (about $9k in debt not including my car or student loans) after being un or underemployed for two years. I am in a better place than a lot of women in my condition, but I still don‚Äôt think I could handle raising a child right now. 
I have thought a lot about adoption, but that brings up a lot of issues for me too. Could I handle that? After nine months and hours of pain in labor and birth, could I really give my amazing creation away, even if I had an open adoption? I was adopted, and I don‚Äôt see or talk to my bio mother, even though we did connect a few years ago (it was a closed adoption). Will my baby grow up to not want to see or talk to me? Will it be easier that way or to see him/her grow up with another couple? 
Also, I am so afraid of losing my pre-baby body. And (I know I shouldn‚Äôt care) but what will my coworkers and friends think, how will they react? I am atheist now, but I was raised Catholic, so those feelings of guilt are kind of hard wired into my brain. 
I also feel really lonely in this decision. I am not close to my mother so that‚Äôs not even an option of telling her until I actually make a decision (and only if it's not abortion). My father and I don‚Äôt talk about this kind of stuff lol. I'm not close to most of my blood family anyway, my family is the community of friends I have built around me, but even then, I would feel ashamed to tell most of my friends, even really close ones. The only person I feel totally comfortable talking to is my ex, the father, but he makes it really difficult because he's still completely in love with me. I know he will support whatever decision I choose, but I still wish I felt comfortable with other people to talk about this with. 
I don‚Äôt know if I'm really asking for advice or anything. I just feel really confused and conflicted and sad that this happened right now, at a really inconvenient time in my life. I don‚Äôt want to have an abortion, but I don‚Äôt like the other options any better. Sigh.

t3_23sam9,"Is my SO at all financially responsible for my ectopic pregnancy removal?","Please read the entire story before jumping to any conclusions.  Also, I currently live in California, and if someone could cite the exact law, I would appreciate it.

So I had had the Paragard IUD since December of 2012, about 7 months after I started dating my current SO.  If anyone knows anything about IUDs, they would know that they are some of the best forms of BC, since you can't really misuse them.  Anyway, on February 23th I had an excruciating pain in my right side, but since I was between health insurance policies (my next plan was to start March 1st, a week later) I tried to avoid going to the doctor.  After hours of screaming and vomiting from the pain and almost passing out, I decide to go to a clinic to see what's wrong.  This pain.. was like nothing I had ever felt in my life.  Upon arriving at the clinic and spending $100, they tell me to head to the ER right away-- they thought it was my appendix.

Fastforward a few hours, and after several tests we find out it was an ectopic pregnancy.. in my ovary.  The pregnancy was in my right ovary, and had grown so much that my ovary ruptured.  If I didn't go into the ER, there's a possibility that I could have died, so denying help wasn't really an option.  Now, I may have to pay over $10,000 (I'm still waiting to see if I qualify for help) in hospital fees, and I'm not in a place where I can afford that.  My SO isn't any more financially secure than I am (we are both recent college graduates), but I think it's a little unfair that because of something we **both** caused, I have to possibly deal with a $10,000 bill by myself IN ADDITION to all the pain I went through.  Not to mention I had to take 2 unpaid weeks off of work to recover.

When I tried looking this up online, I couldn't find a specific law.  Mostly, I found people opposing the very idea that a man would be financially responsible, and that baffles me.  I would hear arguments that it's a woman's choice to have sex, knowing that she may get pregnant.  Well... I think it's a man's choice as well, knowing that he may get the woman pregnant.  Also, it's not like we were being careless, I was on what I thought was the best form of BC for me, since my body doesn't react well to hormonal BC.

Anyway, can anyone help me understand legally where we stand?  I hate to have to put this burden on to my SO, but I'm still trying to emotionally recover from this whole thing... let alone worry about paying the bills on my own.  Thanks!

If you need any more information, please let me know and I'll try my best to provide the answers.

EDIT: Thanks for all of your input.  Guess I'm never having sex again until I'm old enough to get my tubes tied and my SO gets snipped.",0,20140423130114,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt
