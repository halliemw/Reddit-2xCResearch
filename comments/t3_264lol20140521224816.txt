I used to refer to a coworker as The Carapaced Space Alien as if she was a simulacrum just mocked up to look like an umber-hot chick and deep inside was some sort of alien hiding and controlling, remotely. I didn't know her. Avoided her like the plague. She was the centre of a group of imported high level workers that included my managers. 

She found out the nickname through some goof-ball that was after her bod, then turned that around to mock it by making eerie space noises whenever I passed by. 

People were extraordinarily curious about what was going on between the two of us. Many thought I was harassing her. I encouraged that theory. She thought I was being an ass playing at misdirection.

If you don't understand what's going on between your coworkers its not wise to invest in complaining about it.
