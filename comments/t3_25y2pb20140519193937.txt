I graduated with Business, Marketing, and Arts & Technology bachelor's degrees. The Arts & Technology program was mostly focused on video game and 3D movie creation. I chose to stick to Marketing for my career because I felt like others had more experience before starting college with coding for fun and in general having played more games. I've applied to game companies a few times but to the marketing department. I just don't have the guts to wade through that pit full of odds against me.
