I was coming home from a party on a week day (must have been monday or tuesday night) at 3 or 4AM and I took the night bus. I had a few+ drinks, but I wasn't really drunk. At first, there were some people on the bus, but before long I was alone with the driver. At my stop, which was the terminus, he refused to open the doors and he asked for my number, to see me again etc. I said a very polite but very firm no, and asked him to open the doors. He insisted for like 5 minutes, keeping the fucking doors closed. Hoping he would open the doors if I did so, I gave him a wrong number. He tried to call me on the spot, doors still closed and noticed that it was fake. He began touching my arm, and whispered something along the lines of "Oh it's fake, ok you don't want to give me your number. How about we go at the back of the bus and I show you a good time". So far I had managed to remain pretty calm, but I was really starting to lose it. The realization that I was alone in a bus with a very strange and scary man who had the power to detain me in the middle of the night was just hitting me. I could scream but it wouldn't do any good, the bus was soundproof and there was absolutely nobody outside. I thought about hitting him if things got worse.

He kept saying creepy stuff while I stood there frozen for a few more minutes before he FINALLY gave up and opened the doors ("ah ah you're scared right ?"... fucking asshole). When I reached the staircase in my apartment building I had to sit down for 5 minutes to avoid a full-blown panic attack.

So yeah, that was the creepiest and the scariest thing in my life so far.

**TL;DR Got detained in a bus by a creep at 4AM. Nice memories.**
