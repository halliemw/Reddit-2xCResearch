I am exactly the same way with my parents. I love them dearly and I visit whenever I can (though I live kind of far away now) but we never talk about anything deep. We never had "the talk" either and I definitely can't talk to them now about my relationship with my husband. I'm more likely to confide with girlfriends now or my sister if anything.
