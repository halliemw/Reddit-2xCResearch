Yes, a thousand times yes.  Precocious puberty (whether from natural hormones or due to environmental circumstances) is a thing and 8 is pretty young.  It can do many things and potentially even stunt her growth and if it is due to an endocrine tumor in the HPA axis, it can have devastating results.
My sister start around 7-8 and she had been being molested for some time (correlation/causation, idk).  Stuff like this is always worth looking into.
