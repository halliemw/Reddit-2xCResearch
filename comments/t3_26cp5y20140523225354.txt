This is a huge problem. He made the same decision you did to have unprotected sex and he knew what decision you were going to make if you were to become pregnant. He knew what the most likely consequences of his actions were going to be. If you aren't comfortable with breaking off the relationship, I think you both need to go to therapy together to work on communication. It sounds like maybe there was a disconnect in communication here, not necessarily in your words or even on your end, and if this relationship is going to continue, you need to fix it.
