So having a school full of jocks who think this is fine is totally okay? We shouldn't be outraged that these young men think it's fine to treat women as commodities? 

Because *yes* it is clearly the girls' fault for idolizing these boys. Yes, the girls are at fault here. Not the boys who actually *made* the draft, but the girls because they gave the boys power. yeah. /s

>And the girl could just say no...

REALLY? Really? So it's totally okay because they could have just said no. Seriously, it's *not* all about how the girls react; it's about the fact that there is a whole group of young men (and other people who let it happen) who totally thought it was just okay to treat the girls around them this way. We should be teaching highschoolers to respect everyone as people. The fact that this happened is a problem and means we aren't doing that. We shouldn't be saying "oh well, the girls could say no" because that's not the point. The point is that we are encouraging a generation of kids to think it's okay to treat girls as commodities and not as people, and that's not okay!
