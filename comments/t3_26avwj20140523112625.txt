I got the gardasil vaccine. So I'm covered for other ones that the shot protects against. I know I can't be alone on this. Since doing the research it seems so easily transmitted. It's still just a bit of a shock. 
I'm not sure what the pain or swelling is  but I'm going to get that addressed tomorrow.
