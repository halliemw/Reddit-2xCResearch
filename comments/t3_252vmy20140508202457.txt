hey im in a similar position and, while its easy to say, if your connection is strong enough then one of you will break. I know that its not an easy thing to go through but that's  what it really boils down to in the end. if neither of you can make the ultimate sacrifice for the other then maybe you're better off apart. (unfortunately no one can help you with the regret- that's eternal - but to fall back on lazy platitudes, there's always more fish in the sea)
