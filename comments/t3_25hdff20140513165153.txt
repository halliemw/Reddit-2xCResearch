Please go see a doctor. Emphasize the pelvic pain and irregular periods first, because the wight gain and exhaustion could be from other things and bringing up the acne would just get you a referral to a dermatologist, so start with those two symptoms first and bring up the others after. Do bring up all the symptoms though. They might recommend seeing a gynecologist, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I almost recommend you see your gyno anyway at this point, just because of those two symptoms. I hope you feel better!
