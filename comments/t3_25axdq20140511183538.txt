I love that there are more women who are introduced to this subreddit, but I feel voting on posts has been way harsher since this became a default. 

I made a post yesterday asking about my birth control and was looking for advice, but the post seemed to be in an upvote/downvote battle and I only got a few responses. That could've just been people not being able to have any input because it was a specific topic, but I felt because it received so many downvotes that it got low visibility.
