You will recover and grow calm again (I don't know what normal is any more, myself, but that's okay with me now).

Your mind is trying to protect you by denying the reality of it, when it can, causing those rollercoaster sensations inside your head (part of PTSD).  Disassociation is part of PTSD.  

Maybe go to amazon and start thumbing through some books on PTSD.  If by "okay" you mean, "feel brave and certain again," you will be okay.
