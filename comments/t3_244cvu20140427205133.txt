I was on the pill for a while a few years back, and didn't get my period for almost 2 years. It was glorious, but at the same time, I missed certain things about it. While I was stable the entire month, I find something endearing about tearing up when I see the picture of the lonely elephant holding its tail. It makes me feel more human. I don't know, that was just me.

But the point is: totally fine to not have a period on the pill.
