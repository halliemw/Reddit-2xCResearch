I'm in the works of scheduling my defense, and I can't decide if I feel like I'm glad I finished or not.  I guess I still haven't really finished - I've got about 2 months to go and these are going to be intense months - but I'm kind of indifferent right now.

Actually I feel like I know for sure that I wouldn't have regretted dropping out.  I'm hopeful that in a few months or years I'll have some pride in the fact that I finished, but I don't think that there's any shame in not finishing, and every one of my friends that has made the decision to not complete their PhD has gone on to be happy and pleased with their decision.  You can always take a masters and go back later when it is something that you actually want to do.  

I do wish I'd thought harder about what it is that I want to do with my life and whether a PhD is going to get me there.  What jobs are currently realistically attainable for someone with a PhD in my field, if if those were jobs I actually wanted.
