Wow, I'm going through nearly the same thing. I had to deal with him for 6 years now, and I'm just recently starting to be able to open up and tell my close friends what happened. He goes to my college now and we tend to hang out around the same people, so I sometimes awkwardly run into him. I wish I had gotten him reported, but I was way too scared back then, and now it's too late to get him in any real trouble. 

Thank you so much for sharing this, it makes me feel like I'm not alone.
