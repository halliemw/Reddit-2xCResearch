I have MAJOR issues when it comes to hormonal birth control- I turn into a total wacko. All the colors of the emotional rainbow- all the time. 

I was put on Nuva Ring because of the low hormone levels but after a year, and after reaching new levels of cray cray- I had to stop using it. Never found anything that worked for me. 

I'm pregnant now (of course) and am planning on getting my tubes tied!
