Those of us who still have nightmares about what happened after we were asked if we knew how beautiful we are?
Those of us who observe a measurable difference in the way we're treated vs. those considered beautiful at a glance?
Those of us who understand beauty isn't the only measure of the good?

Can we just let women in a woman's default have a moment if they want to enjoy their bodies and how other people react to them?
