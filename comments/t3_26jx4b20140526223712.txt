Okay! I hope you can find a higher source to take care of it. Be respectful, but make sure that if they blow you off they know that you'll go to the media about how the local authorities treat rape victims. 

I'm so sorry for what you're going through. I was there a couple years ago. You will get through it and you'll be 10 times stronger for it.
