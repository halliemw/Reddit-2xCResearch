I have considered this and it gives me pause. He asked me if I was the type to go stalk down his wife and tell her though and I said no of course not... That's when he told me his name. 
I don't like to meddle in other peoples lives...but like many women have said here, I would want to know. I'm gonna think about it this weekend and post an update Monday.
