That's very reasonable of you in terms of the cost of the dress and shoes, plus you let her pick her own style and offering financial help. 

Most people expect bridesmaids to buy their own dresses and shoes. I think this is acceptable as long as it's kept in a range that's comfortable for the bridesmaids. And if they can't afford it, then either financial help should be offered or the bride should be understanding if they back out (as long as it's done as soon as possible, and not just a few weeks before the wedding).
