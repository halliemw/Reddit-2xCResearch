never road tripped canada or mexico, but have extensively in the us alone. roadside assistance is great! also know what/if highway patrols will look like in each state. out of state plates can be targets for impostors. 
i had a great time driving around! great memories. still keep in touch with people i met. felt safe, just watch out for texas. pockets of weirdos and scammers.
