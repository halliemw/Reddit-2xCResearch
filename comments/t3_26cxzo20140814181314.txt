I have a microperforate hymen. Normal menstruation. Mine can barely stretch to accommodate a Qtip as guided by my gynecologist, and it hurt. Based on my reaction to the Qtip insertion, my gynecologist was pretty convinced that surgery is the way to go for me. I mean, I have been masturbating basically daily since I was young, and raised to be unashamed of exploring my body as long as I do it alone, and never was able to get a finger in as a teenager.

Hymenal opening variation isn't quantized (at the macroscopic level anyway), so two people with relatively small hymenal openings compared to the average could have any of many incrementally different sizes from each other - one may have an overly difficult or impossible time stretching it out with dilators, while the other may have success.

In addition to the size of the opening, different hymens are of different thicknesses and elasticity. So yours may be elastic enough for success in gradually stretching, or it might not. Don't push through it if it hurts, though, because if you develop an association between vaginal insertion and pain, it can lead to vaginismus.
