Yep, I'm also young (25), which really doesn't help.

I got very, very lucky with my concrete guys. Perhaps it's because we bonded in rage towards the subcontractor (between me and them), or maybe because we speak the same second language, but I now I have a crew of very devoted and reliable concrete guys who respect me.

My absolute worst experience was with an insulation estimator who refused to give me the quote I had asked for, talked over me, and gave me a quote for what HE wanted to do instead without specifying.  When the error was discovered, he badmouthed the female employees at his own company, insulted me, escalated to shouting at me that "any engineer or building science specialist will tell you that idea is dumb" (twist: not only am I a civil engineer with a building science specialization, I also had two leaders in the field working as consulting engineers on the project sign off on this particular choice).  

However, that turned into a positive learning experience.  It turns out that the company he works for is run by a very reasonable couple who took my complaint very seriously and disclosed that they'd had some prior trouble with him and other female clients and staff. I ended up getting him fired.
