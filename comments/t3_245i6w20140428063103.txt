I was exactly like your daughter growing up. I was the tallest person in my school (all girls) from the age of 14 and I had size 10 (UK) feet. I'm now 6'0 and still wear a size 10. The height thing bothers me a lot less now that I'm out in the world rather than always being the tallest person in the room. I'm taller than most women, sure, but I rarely think about it in social situations. Sometimes with guys I do feel a bit...off? My last partner was shorter than me and to start with I felt incredibly awkward until it finally sank in that he didn't care and my being awkward about it was much more awkward than my not caring. 

Here's where it's useful: I can walk fast, I can take the stairs 2 or 3 at a time, I can climb trees super well (and get over fences!), and in my time I was a first class lacrosse goalie (taller than the goal!) I get significantly less street hassle and pestering in general than my shorter lady friends get, and I can reach things on high shelves. 

The shoe thing is still a pain in the ass. I wear men's trainers and casual shoes - converse, running shoes, etc. For women's shoes I shop at tall lady stores - long tall sally (UK), I just discovered tallgirls.co.uk, and my favourite heels and boots have all been Hush Puppies who go up to a size 11. It's difficult because they're more expensive and usually only available online but they tend to be good quality and leather and because I have so few pairs of heels I tend to be happier spending more so they last a really long time. 

Good luck to you, you're taking an interest and getting advice and if that's representative of you as a parent I think she'll turn out just fine.
