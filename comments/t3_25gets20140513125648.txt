Well to actually answer your question

>Do you Care to Stand up for Women's right to Body Hair and the inherent Femininity/Womanliness that it Embodies?

No, I don't. I am fine with whatever choices people make for their body hair, but I'm not going to SJW over it. Right now, kids are going to bed hungry. Hair isn't even on my list of 'things that need to be changed' in this world.
