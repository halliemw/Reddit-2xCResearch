so this will be bittersweet. i support everyone's rights to live as they please so long as they are not trying to harm other people. 

i consider body hair on females to be disgusting. in my defense i was raised in the US, and was indoctrinated into the media's version of what is and is not attractive. funny enough, i blame my disdain of body hair on Marlyn Manson (a guy), and i find body hair on men as disgusting as well (including myself). 

the US is not the only culture that is obsessed with removing body hair. and if you think about it, a lack of body hair is a pedomorphic trait, and ALL mammals TEND to be attracted to pedomorphic traits (which inevitably leads to neotany). 

so i guess i am trying to say that it is more natural to dislike body hair than to like it. but it all ends up being personal preferences with a majority of people finding a lack of body hair as being more attractive.
