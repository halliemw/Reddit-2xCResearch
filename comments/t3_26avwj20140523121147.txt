The pain you've been describing sounds a lot like endometriosis. Do some research on endo because most gynecologists don't know the most up to date information and will shrug it off. Pain means there is a problem. I had endometriosis that went undiagnosed for years and was finally suggested by my urologist as a possible cause for my interstitial cystitis. By the time they did surgery the endo had damaged my bladder, bowels, appendix, and twisted my ovaries and tubes. It acts like a sort of connective tissue that grows between organs almost like webbing. The pain and other symptoms don't get better without treatment. If you catch it early, you might be able to suppress it with hormone therapy like birth control because your hormones are what cause it to grow. Let me know if you have any questions because I've done a lot of research and I'd be happy to help you.
