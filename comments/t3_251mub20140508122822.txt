The trouble with feminism is that it's an emotionally-charged issue advocated by a gender that's stereotypically considered to be overly-emotional.  It's hard for anyone to stand up for their rights and not be passionate about it.  It's even harder when showing a hint of emotion immediately gets you dismissed.
