I just went off the pill nearly a month ago and I'm already seeing a difference! When I was on the pill, I didn't really notice much difference to before it (other than the first few months of being extra emotional), but since being off it, I've noticed that I'm thinking more rationally, I'm starting to be able to be less emotional with my life choices (which honestly is pretty damn handy at times!) and I'm also eating much healthier - I'm not sure what the connection is, but on the pill I ended up eating a lot of crap and put on a little weight (but not enough that I thought it could be caused by the pill) and now junk food doesn't interest me as much, so I'm making wiser food decisions. I've also not experienced any negatives yet, although I'm yet to have my period, but it's a relief to have not experienced any weird spotting or the like!

So yeah, definitely an interesting idea to try going off it to see whether the hormones are messing with you or not. Obviously it's not wise to keep stopping and starting the pill, but there's nothing wrong with stopping, waiting for your hormones to rebalance and then see how you feel about being on the pill again or another hormonal contraceptive.
