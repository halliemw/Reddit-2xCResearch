I don't think so. The problem facing most advanced capitalist countries is not too many people but not enough. As the boomers age, retire, and slowly die-off, the next generation is not large enough to support the socialized costs of caring for the elderly. We are actually on the verge of crisis. Who will pay taxes when the boomers are all retired? Who will contribute to pension plans that those currently near retirement have assumed will be there to help them through the golden years of their lives?
