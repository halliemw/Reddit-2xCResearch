It's so sad. I've never stolen anything in my life, and I even bought something I didn't need to try and make up for it somehow. It's funny because I look old enough to be early twenties (I'm eighteen) and with condoms I have no problem, I'll even wink at the cashier sometimes. But pregnancy tests... I just feel so embarrassed.
