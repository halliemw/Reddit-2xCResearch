Ahh, I get what you are saying now. I think I was able to realize it sooner this time than I did last time. Last time was like a year, this time was a few months. It still hurts nonetheless.

I do think I try to hard to make excuses for people. Or empathize with them. Empathy is good, but if I am ignoring red flags then that is not good.
