Copyright is one of those issues that is a real grey area right now. Go to any convention and you'll see tons of people selling game things. Do they have the licenses? Not a chance. But the rights holders definitely know about it. They just don't care most of the time. 

Technically speaking, as the current laws are written, even drawing fanart for fun is in violation of copyright. Will anyone ever prosecute for it though? Absolutely not. Those making a substantial amount of money off of others' licenses will likely get Cease & Desist orders, but the majority of them are filling a demand that the license holders aren't paying attention to. (Ever see Nintendo make and distribute a flexible onix toy?) I live in an inexpensive city in a house that the landlord hasn't raised the rent on in 8 years, so there's that caveat as well.

These laws will likely get revamped in the next 20 years, but as it stands right now it's laws that no one generally enforces, kinda like those laws in the South that state women can't drive a car unless a someone walks with a lantern in front of it. 

As for the Minecraft thing, Notch actually attended the wedding the topper was made for (the bride was an award-winning game designer) so it was verbal permission. Did I pay a license fee? No. But it was understood that it was all in good faith and no one would be getting sued.
