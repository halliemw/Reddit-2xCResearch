I'm really pleased you're doing ok, but it's ok to ask for help - you need to be told how to do something so you can learn.

The reason "guys know how  to do these things" is that there's a male father-son culture of teaching them.

It's not a victory if you fuck up and damage the tool (or yourself). 

You should check if this is a two-stroke mower, because you'll damage or seize the engine if you run it without two-stroke oil.

Two-stroke engines use not only the usual kind of oil in the bottom of the engine (for lubricating the crank), but they also add this other kind of oil (sold separately at the automotive store) which is mixed in with the gas.

Sometimes (on small motorcycles) they have a separate tank for the two-stroke oil, and an engine component which mixes it with the gasoline. All the mowers and petrol strimmers I've seen, you need to premix the two-stroke oil with the gas - I guess it's about one cup per gallon or something, but I'm not sure. I fuckin' hate two-stroke engines.

If your mower is a premix two-stroke and you ran it without two-stroke oil today then at least you need to drain the tank and fill it with premix (EDIT: primix - that is to say gas and two-stroke oil mixed in the right proportions). You should probably check with someone more knowledgable than I first, to make sure it's safe to run.
