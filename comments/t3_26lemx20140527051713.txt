I've personally always had good luck with tampax pearl. Don't buy the cheap ones unless you REALLY have to. They pinch and hurt, in my experience.  I've never had the string break off any brand though, even the cheapest. 


It takes practice, and its always better if its a little lubricated down there. I had trouble putting them in when I first got them too. 

Don't worry, you more than likely aren't going to die unless you leave it in there for days. I give you a 99.999% Survival rate :D ! As long as you are in good health normally you should be fine.
