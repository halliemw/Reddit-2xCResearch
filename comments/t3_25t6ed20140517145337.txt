Thank you for your thoughtful comment! I am an adult, and I have gone to college and live separately from them for a few years (luckily, in a happy, healthy relationship). 

My older brother and younger sister live in the family home, and my sister is a sensitive soul who wanted this trip to be a family occasion (she's still trying to glue the fragments of our family's relationship back together, I fear). She has been going on about how excited she is that I can go (as I am often busy and don't see them much) and if I was to drop out suddenly I would need an explanation. 

That being said, your comment left me feeling more empowered after it this trip is over to take a step back and let them sort it out, hopefully without me.
