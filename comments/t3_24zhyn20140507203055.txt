I have a great dad, he's supportive, believes in me, and tells me that he is proud of me. We've gone to yoga together, multiple Hillary Duff concerts and movies (back in the day). He is my safe space. He's willing to be my spot partner when I try rockclimbing! (sometime soon).

I think, it's important to be present, patient, open, honest, and encouraging to your little girl! The best relationship will come of that!
