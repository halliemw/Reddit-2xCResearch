You are SO not alone. Don't even worry about it, just try to be respectful (try to have super loud sex when people are not likely to be trying to sleep) and it's no big deal. I have had many similar situations happen.

One time, me and my boyfriend had sex in our living room, and I was super loud as usual. Later on, we realized the balcony door had been slightly open the whole time, meaning the whole apartment complex heard.
