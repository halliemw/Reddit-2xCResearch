I was going to argue that they're a smaller subreddit too, but they're actually not. I think they're even a couple of thousand subscribers bigger..

But there's also a much more narrow focus there. It's easier to decide what kinds of questions are appropriate, and because there's a "no modern politics" policy it's easier to delete repeat posts and refer the user to previous threads (and that information would still be relevant). 

A lot of TwoX posts are about politics, current events, and opinions. It's a lot harder to police that kind of stuff, and to set clear guidelines for what's "acceptable" and what isn't.
