I don't disagree that it's backwards and controlling on that man's part. But, he did it under the guise of what he was raised to believe was "correct behavior" - which imo also signals how he was raised was not well at all. I do think a woman would have to behave a particular way to fit into this scheme. This says absolutely nothing of her personality, mind you, but I think that stereotypes also concern how a person may act in certain situations, like the one described. I was simply giving a personal anecdote in contrast to your own experience :)
