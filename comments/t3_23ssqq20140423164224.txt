Thank you. I really did need to get it out, it helps writing about my feelings and it helps knowing someone reads it. I know I'm not the first person to feel confused about being pregnant haha! 
I will definitely talk to my ex, he could surprise me , who knows. 
And I'm just going to write more in my journal to help figure some things out. I did think of a couple of friends who I might confide in too.
