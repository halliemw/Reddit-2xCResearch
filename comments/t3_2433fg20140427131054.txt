My husband is definitely more outgoing and people oriented, so he gets addressed more often. It doesn't bother me. 

Interestingly enough, when we've traveled in Asia I am the one who gets addressed since I pass as local whereas he's tall and blonde/blue-eyed. I noticed it was that way frequently in Hawai'i when we lived there too. Cultural thing, I guess.
