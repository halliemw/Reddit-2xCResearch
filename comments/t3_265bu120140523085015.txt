Thanks! I did manage some of this last night... although he kept saying "wait, what's happening?" which is some mix of funny and sad. Turns out my nerves about this also mean I am super jumpy when touched - and got a really badly timed fit of giggling, which I'm sure was totally disconcerting. But I was able to make a point of wanting to be intimate - BJ is very helpful for this, especially since the issue of me being jumpy (so annoying) doesn't come into play.

I would be very happy to go to a therapist - as I've had good experiences with them on my own (and actually seeing one with a former bf was helpful) but he has NOT had good experiences and this seems to be one point he won't concede.
