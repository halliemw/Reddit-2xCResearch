You have to take the cardboard part out after you've put the tampon in. The only thing you should be able to grab from outside is the string. The tampon is alll the way up there.

If I misread your post and you already figured the cardboard part should come off, try putting it in deeper - like, as deep as humanely possible. Most problems I've had with tampons was when I didn't put them in deep enough. 

It takes a lot of practice to use these things right, but once you know the drill, they're very convenient (esp. while swimming, sporting etc.) and hygienic.
