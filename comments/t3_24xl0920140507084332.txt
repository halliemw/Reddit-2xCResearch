This is the exact same thing that happened to me and why this throw away was made. Commented on a sperm jacking thread...
I was taking a break from bc, he knew that. We were using condoms. He slipped it off and finished inside me. I took plan b, had an appt for an abortion ( it magically didn't exist, I think I was calling to reschedule for transportation reasons, when they told me i didn't even have one ). I never did reschedule. He didn't want me to have an abortion either. So our child is now 10. He supports  financially, but he's an awful father. All kinds of wrong with our relationship. I asked him to leave me alone( before I got pregnant), it was never going to work out. He was abusive. We were together about 3 years too long before this happened. I love my child, means the world to me. But I can't help but wonder where I would be today if this never happened. The lessons we learn... 
Take care of yourself and your children. Get away from him please. It's a way to trap you, nothing more.
