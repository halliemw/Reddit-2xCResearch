> I want to have sex with him so bad, but if I sleep with him on the first date, will he get the wrong impression?

The only impression that will leave is "We wanted to have sex with each other and did so - good job". Seriously. It's 2014. We need to accept that people enjoy sex and should do it as much as they want to and can get away with. I would seriously respect more someone who knows what they want and takes it confidently (and with consent, obviously). They're just the kind of people I like.  

If any of those things happen that you perceive as negatives, well then they'll happen and you'll make a call on them. Simple as that.
