I can definitely relate to this. I have a positive relationship with both of my parents - we love each other, we visit often, and they did a great job raising me and my brother. They provided me with everything I needed, and we never experienced any major fights or abuse. 

But there has always been that sense of disconnect. When we get together, we always talk about 'business stuff' like my plans for school, finances, living arrangements, my cell phone plan... etc. Or we'll have equally shallow conversations about the latest Game of Thrones episode, or mom's zumba class, or the weird neighbour next door. 

I can't recall ever having a deep, heart-to-heart conversation with either of my parents. They just never gave me the impression that I could come to them with my fears, hopes and dreams. It's like, they've never rejected me, but they're not particularly approachable either. I never told them about the bullying in elementary school, or my first relationship with a guy... hell, we never even had The Talk. My parents were disciplinarians, first and foremost. I don't know if I could ever consider them my confidantes. 

I think part of the reason could be that I'm still young (22) and they don't yet see me as an adult and an equal. Part of me wants to suggest all of us getting drunk together and talking about LIFE.
