My post was deleted in approx 30 seconds. It read:

>Logged on to see how one of my favourite subs is doing after the most ill-advised moderation decision ever and....yup, it's literally a bloodbath. I mean come on. A week ago this was a nice place for women and any men who happened by, now the top post is about period shits and the ones below it are also mainly about things coming out of vaginas.

>Just want to thank the mods for being narcissistic idiots who are too dumb to realise that this kind of position of power only exists until everyone who made the place worth being part of flips you off as they walk out the door. In a few days you've destroyed something that took years to build up.

>I'm still subscribed to TwoX, but only to pick up names of new subreddits (which are springing up like daisies) and watch the place burn to the ground.

>So long ladies, it was an honour. See you on other subs!!

Oh and the mass migration is already happening. It's just hard to spot because new subs are coming in as the old users are leaving.
