part of the "real sized" is showing models of different sizes in all their bras. So you can see somebody shaped more like yourself in a bra you might be interested in. PLUS no photoshopping or airbrushing. I've always loved their bras and undies- they fit me amazingly well- but i like the company a lot more now. Nobody is over sexualized- its just young women wearing undies, you know, like we do.
