The lady who posted the other day about her rapist being invited to the wedding she was maid-of-honor at posted a PM she got because of that over on creepypms. It was *vile.*

I know that I can take crap like that, but not everyone can. It's fucked up that this sub becoming a default has lead to women like her and you being targeted by fuck-sticks who don't have one shred of decency.

I've been subscribed here off and on since 2XC was created. It sucks that I feel like I have to question the motives of every poster here now. Are they just a troll? Are they being total abusive asshats? Or are they just genuinely misinformed? I don't like having to do that. It has however caused me to be much more liberal with my downvoting and reporting. I've also started tagging people with RES. I feel like as someone who maybe has a higher tolerance for this bullshit that it's my responsibility to wade through the crap on here so that others don't have to.

But it sucks. I've joined some of the new communities that are popping up, and I hope they are successful with recapturing what 2XC used to be.
