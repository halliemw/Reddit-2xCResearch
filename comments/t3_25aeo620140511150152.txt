I mean, I get that you're some kind of MRM troll, but you know what part of the conversation I had an issue with and why. It could easily happen to a guy as well, and it would be just as awkward, if not more so. I'm also not sure how letting the building manager know is screaming blue murder, but I'm assuming you'd be right there with them laughing at how obviously uncomfortable I was so the point is moot.
