First of all, let me just say welcome to this sub!

I agree with this comment (this one I am replying to). It is honest and very insightful, and I am 100% in agreement: your comparison of the MRM being identical to the radfem movement is spot-on.

**HOWEVER**

This:

> As a woman, do you not feel entitled to be able to go wherever a man is allowed to go? I mean, they've dismantled all male spaces because of that entitlement.... Soooooo

is off-topic, with a dash of rudeness. Neither of those things are welcome here. If you are confused by why people do not like the comments you make (such as your original reply to /u/britishcomment), my suggestion to you would be to resist the comment and reply buttons and just do a bit of observation on how this sub would prefer to operate itself. By listening, you'll start to learn the subtleties of this community.
