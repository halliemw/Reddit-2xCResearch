If the teacher had co-workers and other students as friends who could see the post then it was totally inappropriate. If it was truly a personal facebook page with only personal friends and family then it still wasn't the greatest idea but I don't think a person should get reprimanded over stating an opinion however mean it may be. I can see why someone would be upset. Parents and teachers are concerned that depicting a high schooler with a child in a positive light is saying to other students that having children as a teen is ok. I can understand that.
