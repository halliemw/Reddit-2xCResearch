CCA is one of the largest private prison companies in America, combined with the GEO group, the two made over $2.9 billion in revenue in 2010.  The cofounder of CCA also used to be the chairman of the TN Republican Party.  CCA spent just under $1 million in lobbying because they actively seek for ways to imprison MORE people.  More inmates = more $$$.  More laws = more inmates.
