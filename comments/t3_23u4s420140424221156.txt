Thanks! I'm trying to stay optimistic, but I keep having flashbacks of stupid things that fell out of my mouth. We'll see, though! 

You're right about managing expectations, though. I have high expectations and tend to be very hard on myself. At the same time, I'm modest and have a hard time selling myself. Ugh! :) Thank you for the encouragement!
