I'm not sure where you're aiming with your business major, but perhaps you could work for a tech company of some sort? You'd handle the finances/promotion/whatever of that company?

Even so - the sexism the women in tech experience is not limited to them. Women in Business have this bullshit too. Women everywhere do! You can make a difference anywhere. :) Even if it's as simple as calling someone out.
