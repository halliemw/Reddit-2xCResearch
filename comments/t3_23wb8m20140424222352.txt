I'm hairy as fuck too. it's okay.

If you like a clean shaven look, get laser hair removal! You will not deal with ingrown hairs, regrowth etc. And economically it ends up being more cost effective as waxing in just a couple of years, and I'd be willing to guess on par or cheaper with a lifetime of shaving (cost of razors, shave gel, treatment for ingrown hairs).
