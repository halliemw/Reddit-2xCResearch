That is awesome. Does it seem like this openness is more prevalent with the younger generation vs the older / and does the older generation truly grown upon it? Seems like an obvious answer I guess, but I wanted to follow up with, does it seem like the younger generation will be a big driving force to future changes/relaxation in laws? Not to say that isn't already happening, as you have pointed out.
