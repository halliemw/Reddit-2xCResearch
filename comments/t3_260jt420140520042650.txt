That is possible. I think she hasn't got worse, just that I've noticed it more. You make a good point about being unable to switch off, I can see how that would be difficult. 

I talked to him about it a bit yesterday, hopefully it won't get worse. Might give it another go tonight though. I understand her being protective of her son but it's going a bit far.
