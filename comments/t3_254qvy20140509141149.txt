Can you and the other women all approach HR together? Or individually at the same time? Perhaps you could all write your complaint with specific examples and submit them on the same day. There's strength in numbers. Him printing out a complaint (form 4 years ago!) and confronting her about it is grounds for a complaint as well. Is there an official HR dept? If so, you and at least 1 other need to convey this stuff.  And also… look for another job. I hate to say it, but sometimes the best thing is to just get out of there – onward and upward.
