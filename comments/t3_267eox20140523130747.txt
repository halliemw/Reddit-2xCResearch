I'd say that HTML5 requires the least amount of math.  Maybe Java too since it encourages complicated parts to be hidden.  Avoid Perl and C/C++.


C# is a good overall language.  It's possible to write math-heavy stuff in it, and it's possible to do things that have little math.  Avoid algorithms and data structures and use libraries when possible.  Visual Basic might be easier to read, and it can use the same libraries that C# does.

No matter what language you use, learning loops, branches and functions is a must.  This might not be easy, but if you learn them in one language they make sense in the other languages.
