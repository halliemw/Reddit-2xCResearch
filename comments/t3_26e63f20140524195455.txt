Agree with others that these literally never work or are never stocked.

Since this was at work, if you feel comfortable speaking to your office manager or the person who is in charge of supply ordering, you could try to get these provided for free at your office. One of my co-workers asked me about this once (I do all the ordering), and it seems to be working well. It's really not that expensive and most places they'd be ordering from likely already have tampons or pads in their online catalog.
