I've played WoW for over seven years.  When you play with a group of people long enough, it's bound to come up that you're a girl.  Or at least it used to.  Now I just don't tell people, even if that means intentionally omitting things, because so often I get accused of being attention-seeking.  It's like guys go off of the stereotype of a "geek guy" being totally helpless before a "fake gamer girl," so they rush to loudly judge me as a "fake gamer girl" as a way of proving they won't be caught in my succubus web as I try to steal all their gold.

Rape jokes are pretty common too.  Or just throwaway uses of the word, like right before a battleground someone will say in chat, "let's rape them."

I'll think about saying something, but then I won't, because this is how it's played out in the past:

* Player: let's rape them
* Me: do you have to use that word? 
* Player: free speech bitch

or

* Player: let's rape them
* Me: there has to be a better way to phrase that
* Player: let's rape them really hard with our huge cocks

or

* Player: let's rape them
* Me: would you mind not using that word? 
* Player: why? is it any worse than saying "let's murder them"?
* Me: yeah, because there's not much of a chance the people you're talking to could have been murdered in the past
* Player: ...
* Me: ...it's possible that some of the people you're playing with could've been raped, and it would suck to be reminded of that
* Player: yeah right. girls don't play WoW. and besides the majority of rapes are just made up by girls who change their mind after the fact
* Another Player: yeah
* Yet Another Player: seriously
* One More Player: attention whore

And that's why I've given up on speaking up in WoW, when they talk about rape like it's fun.  Sometimes people side with me, but that's not why I said anything in the first place.  I just don't like being reminded of rape when I'm having fun in my free time.  It sucks.  It's loaded with memories and there's no way to make them understand that so I don't try anymore.
