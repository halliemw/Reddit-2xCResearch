I, quite luckily, don't get a lot of grief despite being a gamer. I think I'm just lucky enough to hang out in the right communities, but knowing what a lot of other women go through, I thank my lucky stars. 

Where I do have some trouble is with baseball. My husband and I are both huge baseball fans-- we listen to nearly every Cardinals game on the radio, attend as many games as we can, and collect some memorabilia. However, every time we go into any sort of sports store, he gets every question, even when I'm the one looking for something specific and we clarify that.

"Oh, you should talk to Katiroth here, she's the one looking for something," and he'll point to me.  Sales associate? Ignores me, even when I say "Yeah, I'm looking for a Yadi jersey in small."
