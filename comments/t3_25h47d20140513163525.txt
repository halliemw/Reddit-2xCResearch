I just don't understand where the idea came from that just because I don't want you, it must mean that I want some piece of shit or that is somehow all I deserve. 

It all goes back to that quote "you can be the juiciest, sweetest peach in the world, and there will still be people that don't like peaches." 

Just because I don't like peaches, doesn't mean I only like garbage. The anger and bitterness is such a put off. And it really makes me wonder if I ever really knew this person at all. Do I really want to be friends with or in a relationship with someone who is only fine and nice when things are going his way?

Hell fucking no.
