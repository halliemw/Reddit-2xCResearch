In a few weeks, I will finally be graduating with my bachelor's degree in Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences. Since I had a lot of trouble finding a job that started mid-June, I decided that I would rather do something adventurous that was also beneficial to a wildlife species.

So this summer I will be walking 382 miles (the entire Oregon coast) in order to raise awareness and funding for Animals Asia's newest project: Peace by Piece. Just recently, a bear bile farm operator decided that it was time to end a tradition and called to Animals Asia for help. Now, 130 moon bears will finally get to live a life outside of their cages. So I will be raising funds to help them create a sanctuary that is suitable for so many moon bears! 

I was pretty excited when Animals Asia e-mailed me to thank me for supporting their organization, which I'm assuming that they found out through my JustGiving account. A few days later, my partner and I received some shirts from them. I have shirts from many organizations that I have been involved with such as Save Elephant Foundation, Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, and Free the Bears, so I'm happy to add this one to my collection!
