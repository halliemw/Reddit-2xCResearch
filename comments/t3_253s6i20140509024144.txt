Everyone has heard of the baby kicking your bladder, right? Any old baby can do that. But *my* baby was talented! 

The normal anatomy of a pregnant lady abdomen is familiar. Stomach at the top, curled up fetus in the middle, bladder below. Baby kicks bladder, lady pees. 

Now imagine, if you will, that the baby decides to really, really stretch. It gets crowded in that uterus, after all. So she puts her feet square on your bladder and stands up, ramming her skull north, right into your stomach.

Ever have the overwhelming urge to both pee and puke simultaneously?

Pregancy sucks a dick...
