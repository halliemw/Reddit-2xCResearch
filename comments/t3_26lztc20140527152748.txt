> I mean do you really expect that if a guy is attracted to you and wants to bone you, that if you simply explain/assert a friendship boundary that you will instantly kill any lustful feelings towards you? Humans don't work like that.

> It's as simple as that and there's no real way of declaring yourself "off-limits" as far as attraction goes.

Of course it doesn't kill any feelings - but it does give the opportunity to readjust expectations and decide if the relationship is worth continuing. Some people are able to acknowledge their feelings, acknowledge that those feelings are not requited, and decide that the friendship is more important than a crush. While the attraction will remain, the person may change his or her behavior to respect the other person's boundaries and the feelings may very well fade over time as the interested party finds a partner. Others are not able to do that, and for those people, a discussion about lack of interest and boundaries is important so that they can decide to stop investing in the friendship. 

I'm happily married and am friends with men I'm quite attracted to, both mentally and physically, and my husband knows this. It's not about killing feelings but instead making the clear decision not to act on them in any way and not to let them affect the friendship negatively.
