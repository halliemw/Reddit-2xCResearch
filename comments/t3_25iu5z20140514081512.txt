Honestly girl you are not alone! A few months ago I hooked up with a sleazy guy 12 years older than me on a whim. I've never felt more used or disgusting in my life.

But it's like, I made the choice to hook up with him. Yes, I regret it, but I think part of being mature about the choices you make is accepting them and learning from them. 

Sometimes I still feel shitty about it but everyone goes through crap like this. At least we know we'll never do it again, right? And YOU know you are not alone. 

Don't feel bad- now that you see there is a void in your life, you can work towards filling it :)
