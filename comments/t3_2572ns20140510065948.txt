While I appreciate you saying that, this is Reddit after all. Its where people will argue for hours and days about every single subject ever. Its the place where even the most innocuous comment can lead to 300 children and all caps screaming. 

I'm not saying that is what this sub is like necessarily, just that if too many new coming male subscribers like myself come in and start posting their comments in every discussion happening here, that it might trigger an onslaught of negativity. Yes I am aware that your default status means that this will likely come to pass regardless of what I choose to do. While I do value my own opinion, I am not so delusional as to think that everyone would or even that they should. I think there will be enough male voices in the near future coming in to tell the women of this sub what's wrong with their comments and ideas. Some of those voices may be right and some may be wrong but none of them will be helping foster a safe and friendly place on Reddit for women and thats what I found this place to be yesterday. I can choose not to lend my voice to those voices. Not because I think this community can't handle my opinion but because it just doesn't need to be stated here. There are a million places I could go to argue gender politics on Reddit. I don't need to come into this friendly place and make comments that in all likelihood will lead to unfriendly discussion. I think too much of this community to do that. 

Honestly I felt guilty just making this post. It didn't need to be said and it could have so easily been jumped on by MRA's wanting to call me a white knight or some other stupid shit and turned into noise cluttering up the new section. Like I said though, I had a really bad day yesterday and this place made it more bearable so I wanted to say thank you.
