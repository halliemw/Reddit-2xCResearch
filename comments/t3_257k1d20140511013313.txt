I dont think that doctors mistake synthetic progesterone from natural progesterone on purpose, when doctors talk about progesterone in birth control they are contrasting it to combination pills that have both estrogen (or synthetic estrogen or estrodial?) and synthetic progesterone with pills/shots that only have synthetic progesterone.  Though I think more doctors (and people in general) should be aware of the differences between synthetic and natural progesterone, I never realized they had such different effects, thanks for sharing :)
