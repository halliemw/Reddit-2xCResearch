>A man at my office has been sexually harassing people. I don't know exactly what he's been doing to other people, but in my case he has given me an uninvited and unwanted kiss and spanked me with a stick(!).

Perhaps the problem with explaining why sexual harassment like this is so humiliating is because this isn't sexual harassment.  It is sexual assault.
