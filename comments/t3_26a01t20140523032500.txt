I was extensively bullied when I was that age. a lot of it was kids, mostly boys, who would pretend to be friendly and then make it obvious that they were being sarcastic and only an idiot such as myself would think that they liked me. also being spat on, but that was this one kid who would go out of his way, not a general trend.

I chose to confront it more often than not with physical violence, snarky comebacks, combined with actively avoiding extra contact with my peers, (I would sit outside or in the detention room to eat lunch) and being a narc. there being nothing too lose by narcing when you have noone but the authorities on your side.

I started getting tall in about 9th grade, which helped, and a couple of other weird kids took pity on me and I made some friends. it's been all uphill ever since. 

but being 13 sucked. the only thing that made it marginally better was my three book a day habit and that was partly because it meant I always had a weapon at hand. the best thing about how awful it was, is that as an adult my life will never be that uniquely bad ever again. 

what I would say to mini-me is to put your head down and endure. don't talk to these people unless they are going to be nice. just give them the cut direct (which includes blocking them all on social media) and pretend they don't even exist, because you're better than that. being 13 will pass and you will rise above it.
