I'm guessing the people who downvoted you aren't engineers.

I'm an engineer in a field (aerospace) where a lot of the very most senior people are white men. Why is that? Because in the 1960s when a lot of these guys were getting started in their careers, gender and racial discrimination were still very prevalent and legal for white collar jobs in the U.S. But when you look at sought-after jobs that are filled by people born around, say, 1970 or later, you see quite a lot of diversity. At my company, I'd say the ethnic makeup of the employees corresponds pretty much exactly with the census-derived ethnic makeup of the area where we live. The percentage of female engineers is actually substantially higher than the percentage of female aerospace grads from U.S. universities in recent years.

I still think it's problematic that there's such a low percentage of women studying tech and science topics. If it was a 60/40 split between genders, that would be one thing, but the current low percentage of women in most tech/science academic program indicates that there's something societal that is deterring girls from studying those disciplines. But the point is, *hiring* discrimination isn't the problem. You can't reasonably expect companies to have a 50/50 split in gender of their engineers if <10% of people graduating from programs in that discipline are women, and I have never seen any data to support the idea that there's an immense amount of gender discrimination in hiring for engineering jobs.
