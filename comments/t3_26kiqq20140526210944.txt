Sitting on the toilet is the worst angle for me to get a tampon in. I like to stand and put one foot up on the toilet seat. Make sure you are aiming the tampon at a slight angle, too, and don't "shove" it in. Glide it in slowly. 

You might have been a little dry inside when you were trying to insert one in the past. eve-'s suggestion of Tampax Pearl is a great one, as those plastic applicators are very smooth and much easier to insert.  I just found this video online that talks you through the procedure and addresses some common concerns. It's pretty good: http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/tampon.html
