It's generally expected that the majority of people who are "supposed" to participate are women. Let's switch to race, maybe that'll make it easier. 

Do you think it would be appropriate for a white person to be up in a sub for black people telling them "I'm white so I can't understand but here's my input." Like, this person literally just said they don't understand, so instead of asking for help understanding or I dunno, maybe trying to understand it themselves, will say something along the lines of how the black person perceived their own experience wrongly, or will try to play devil's advocate just for the sake of it, or just other things that generally *are not relevant to the OP*.

TwoX was not terrified of *all men* invading, they are terrified of a specific subset of men who act like they have superior knowledge on topics they in reality know nothing about (mansplaining), or at the very least have not had a similar experience. I'm not even going to *start* on the people who think it's okay to try to play "devil's advocate" in a thread from a rape victim reaching out to the people here.

The downvote button is to denote that something isn't relevant to the topic at hand, you can call it hostile all you want, but that's what it's for. Plenty of men comment on here all the time, and no one really even knows about it because they don't feel like they need to shout from the rooftops their gender, and they contribute in a way that is relevant to the topic at hand, or they say nothing at all knowing that there is nothing relevant for them to say.

In those "men should sit back and listen" posts on here, some of the top comments were from men saying that they *agreed* with this; it's not hard to understand that in a place such as this you just don't say certain things because they're not considered appropriate.
