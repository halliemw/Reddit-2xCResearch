It's a great guide, but it's really jarring to see about 10 lbs between M/L/XL and then 70 between XL and 2XL. I know it's not in your control, but in general I'm always amazed by the exponential sizing once you get above XL.

It's awesome that this info is available, though - the pictures are super cute and very informative!
