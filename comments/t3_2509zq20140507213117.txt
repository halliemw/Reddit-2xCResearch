I've seen these kind of shenanigans before, and it really is a waiting game that's impossible to lose. Because the fact is, who really cares enough about the topics they don't care about to actually search for and downvote all of them for hours on end? That might be fun for a couple days, but eventually the trolls justo lose interest and find new things to distract themselves with.
