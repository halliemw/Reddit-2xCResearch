For many illnesses and especially cancer, catching them early is key. In Canada it's 100% covered to see your GP whenever you want to and they have a schedule for recommended physicals (about every other year for women and every five years for men). I don't think she's *bad* for not going by any means, but now that she can for no additional cost, it's a very good idea. A lot of breast cancers, cervical cancers and melanomas can be very treatable if caught early for example.
