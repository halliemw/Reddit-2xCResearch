I started my period when I was 11. I knew what it was because my mom was pretty open with me about puberty and sex. I remember feeling embarrassed about it during school but what could you do to change what your body does? I remember feeling like I was too young. My sister started hers at 14 so I felt so weird. The best you could do is just talk with her after your mom does. Let her come to you. Don't push it, just be there for her. Let her know she can be honest with you and you won't go running to your parents about everything.  That's what bothered me the most about my sister. I felt like I couldn't be honest with her because she would constantly tattle on me.
