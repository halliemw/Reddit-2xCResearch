I suggested the knot most because I've had friends - pretty nontraditional ones - find the calendars for like when to get stuff done helpful. Also because OP is coming at this with no direct experience of weddings, and they do cover everything. That being said - I love offbeat bride... and there are all sort of forums for every kind of wedding you could want.
