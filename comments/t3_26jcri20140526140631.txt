My online shopping is largely influenced by /r/FrugalFemaleFashion...

Echoing other comments here, I get a lot of things on Amazon, although for clothing I mostly only get basics from amazon (socks, for example).

I've also had a good experience with eShakti. My dress fits perfectly and the materials and stitching seem to be good quality. They add in nice things like bra strap clips and pockets. :) Due to first-time buyer promotions and such, I got a custom-sized dress for $25 including shipping. Insane. It seems like if you get a referral from someone you might be able to get a bigger discount - it's $25 if you just go to the site as a first-time buyer, but $35 if you get a referral.
