I was in a very similar situation a few years ago but umm... I'm still dating her soo, perhaps the next piece of advice won't be very helpful for you. Do your best to figure out how you feel about her too, then, if you're sure you're not interested, have a talk and do your best to state gently but firmly your feelings, then talk it out (set a side a few hours or so in a private location). If it feels appropriate do ask her if she needs some distance between you two for a time in order to get over you, she might be the type of person that does (or not, so be considerate). Basically its not your fault and do your best by your friend, I'm sorry its a little messy and complicated but thus is life. Goodluck
