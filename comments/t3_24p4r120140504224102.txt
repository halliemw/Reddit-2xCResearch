Give yourself time to lose whatever weight is your goal. I would not be healthy if it came off too fast. 

I lost a bunch of weight mostly by learning how to count calories and severly limiting refined carbs and sweets. I used an online calorie counter which was a great tool. For snacks, have a cache of fruit at your desk to allow for nibbling. You can get to wherever it is you want to get to. 

You mention some health concerns - it's great to also check in with your doctor!
