I used to use regular om my "heavy" days the "light" the rest of the week, no I'm on "super" pretty much most of the week maybe a "regular" the last two days...it's climbing that mountain of "holy shit I only have one level up to go then I'll be the girl that uses 2 tampoons at once" sounds like a slippery slope to me
