Goddess above has seen fit to bless me with a set of 32Fs-- which I am by no means complaining about-- but it does mean that anything without big straps and underwire is 100% out. 

The wisps of string that bikini manufacturers dare to call "straps?" They're artistic adornments, more than anything. Fortunately I have a great one-piece which manages to be supportive and not matronly, so I wash it diligently to keep it alive.
