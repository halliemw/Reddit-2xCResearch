Have you ever thought of taking the pill continuously? Just skipping the placebos? You might spot for a while, but it is actually awesome to *never* worry about having periods, PMS, or the mood swings that accompany them. Though if your mood is fluctuating even in the middle of  your cycle when you're on the pills... I'd honestly say it's your move/graduate school that is causing you stress. See a psychiatrist and/or psychologist to help with your depression, it really does work for a large majority of people.

You could always go off them for ~3 months to see what it's like without them.
