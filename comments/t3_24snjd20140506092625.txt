It sounds like they didn't have his drug cocktail really adjusted right for him then. It's always a bad idea to go off your meds without consulting with your psychiatrist if you have a mental illness. I can understand not wanting to go back on the same drugs again because from what I've seen, poorly medicated is often worse than unmedicated, but he sounds like he needs to be on something to stabilize him a little.
