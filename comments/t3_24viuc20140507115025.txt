I don't know enough about contact allergies to comment on your situtation specifically, but generally exfoliation only strips away protective layers if you overdo it. Just the right amount encourages skin growth and prevents build up. And there are other forms of exfoliation besides scrubbing. Scrubbing and manual exfoliation is always a bit harsh, whereas chemical exfoliation covers the entire harshness scale.

There are also other options besides soap. I oil cleanse for example.
