First, are you sure it's the birth control? If it is, perhaps you can try something like an IUD. Many of the IUDs (like Mirena) have hormones as well, but I believe they are in lower concentrations and more localized. You should talk to your doctor to see if that would be better for you. There are a lot of pros to IUDs--you get to pretty much forget about them after insertion and don't need another method for years. 

I'm not entirely convinced it's your birth control causing that problem, though. I think what you're thinking & feeling is very normal. Most women need to be, well, built up in order to enjoy sex & have great sex.
