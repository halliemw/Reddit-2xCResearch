Most of the ones I have are xs/s, and maybe a few mediums. Most of them are thongs of all sorts that I have just bought and never worn. There's a few 'regular undies' as I call them, and some kick around girl-boxers I think. I'm pretty sure a lot of them are from Wet Seal, Tart, and 

I was just trying to get a feel of how many people would be up for trading/buying underwear, and if there was already a sub for this kind of thing that wasn't skeezy like having to model them. If you're interested at all, PM me and I can send you a bunch of pics. If you pay for shipping, you can have them!
