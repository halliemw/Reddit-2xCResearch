I had a very similar experience after I cut my butt length hair to chin length for charity. My dad even said something similar(as did my mom, everyone I saw at school, my bully at the time, etc). I also got surprised comments at the hair dresser because after cutting off 21 inches,  I didn't cry. Apparently a lot of women cry after cutting it off??

I just dont understand why the hair is seen as such an important part of our looks as women. And of course, body hair is seen and judged in the complete opposite light...
