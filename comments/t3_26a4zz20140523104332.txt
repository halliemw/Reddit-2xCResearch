My suggestion is to not retort with a not very funny line that is guaranteed to make you look like the asshole in front of a bunch of dudes. I understand that sexism sucks and I'm no outsider to being marginalized, but getting angry about it and lashing out in an effort to revalidate yourself by invalidating someone else just makes you no better than him in the eyes of everyone else, at least it does if you go about it like that. Obviously the asshole in question doesn't know a damn thing about vaginas. This is the point I would stress. Get creative and turn him into the butt of a joke about that. A quick "I guess you'll understand one day when you actually see one," said with a smile, would be more than effective. The problem with just getting angry at a dude, with a group of dudes, is that if you react poorly you will be seen as a bitch. I'll be the first to admit this is a fucked up line of thought, but in practice this is what happens. Guys (myself included) don't like being around bitchy girls and we tend to ostracize them so we don't have to deal with their stupid shit. I'm not saying getting angry like this and saying something that will make everyone feel awkward is bitchy behavior, but it is certainly a red flag. Combat this by veiling your disgust with real humor. Sure that dude might feel a little lame when you let into him, but he won't feel too lame when he uses it as a reason to try to not include you in further meetups or is in general just more of a dick to you out of spite. Rather, he's going to feel like a huge tool if you make a joke about his being shitty to women and not getting laid when all the other guys laugh at it. Then when you're smiling and he gets super shitty about it, who do you think the group will keep? Prove that you're an awesome girl that dudes should want to hang with, don't do the opposite.
