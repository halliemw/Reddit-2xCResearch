Not sure if I'm qualified to give advice here, as I'm still pretty young too. But one thing I wish every girl knew was to work hard in school, and know when a relationship is just not working out. I've spent many years working my hardest at school, so don't let peer pressure or anything else detract from your work ethic and dedication to a successful education. 

Relationships. You do *not* have to take anyone's shit. Most likely your first relationships will fail, and that's alright. If you know it's just not going to work out, then move on! I definitely think you will know the right person when you find them. When you meet that person who you can share everything (even the gross and embarrassing things), you'll know that's the one for you. Don't settle for anything less. You might not find this person in high school, but you also might not. I had a serious lack of attachment to my past boyfriends, so I've never experienced the heart crushing break ups than many have. It's all a part of life, and you will move on. Keep that in mind, and good luck. :)
