It sounds like you are a stronger woman than you realize. It takes strength to take the steps you have, and to realize what you have about the relationships you have been in. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for 5 years. It's hard to see the signs when you are that deep in.

I feel your pain about the lack of female friends, too. I've always hung out with "the guys", and while I really like my male friends, it's always nice to have a variety :).

If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to shoot me a message. No one should go through this kind of stuff alone.
