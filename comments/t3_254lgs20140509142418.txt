The laser works best on dark hair, so you would probably be a good candidate. I'm quite pale and have blond leg hair so it's pretty much a no-go for me (naturally the area I would most like to stop shaving... haha)

I did have my bikini line lasered as the hair there is darker, it's worked ok, there's definitely less hair but I'll probably always have to shave a bit. meh. Also, it can get quite pricey for multiple treatments.
