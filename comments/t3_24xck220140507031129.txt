I dont think many (if any) women have sex unprotected with the casual thought "oh I can just get an abortion." 

getting pregnant is fucking traumatic as is the choice a woman has to make in a relatively short amount of time. It is never a casual choice to have an abortion. Even if some women act that way, if they actually got pregnant, that simple thinking goes out the window. 

No one here is arguing that abortion isn't a shitty choice. We all wish that abortions werent necessary but shit happens. Sometimes people are simply stupid and they have to learn a very very hard lesson the hard way. A child should never be a form of punishment. 

Exactly what "support" are you referring to anyways? welfare?
