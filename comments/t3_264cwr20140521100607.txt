Ugh. My first boyfriend did this and I just accepted it as okay because I was "in love" at the time (silly teenage hormones). It definitely isn't though! Either he is so socially inept that he just doesn't realize that telling that to your girlfriend isn't okay or he just doesn't respect you. It honestly made me feel disposable, like as soon as another girl became available I would be dumped for him to chase after her (and I was!).

When I found my new bf though it was like night and day. He is SO respectful about that. And he may talk about how he finds other girls attractive with his male friends or whatever (which is fine, I'm constantly telling my single friends about the cute guys I know) but he doesn't around me because he knows that would hurt me. I've gotten him to admit one celebrity crush to me. And because he keeps his crushes for others on the down low, I feel ridiculously secure and happy.

 Every time my ex texted another girl I was so worried that he'd leave me for them or if he didn't text me for a long time I'd assume he'd be chatting up another girl. 

I became a "jealous b-word" and got blamed for killing our relationship, when really the whole environment of our relationship was ridiculously unhealthy and would make anyone jealous. It would be weirder, I think, if you didn't feel insecure.
