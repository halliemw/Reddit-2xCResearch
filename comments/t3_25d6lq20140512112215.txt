Well for one thing, getting engaged isn't just a matter of, "whenever he feels like popping the question" despite what pop culture implies. If you haven't yet, now would be a great time to have a serious discussion about what you both want out of the relationship long term. Also ask if he can give you a general idea of what he's waiting for, assuming it's something that's on his radar as well as yours. Maybe in his mind couples don't get engaged until the 3-4 year mark and he just hasn't thought about it yet.
