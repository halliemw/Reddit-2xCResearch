Man are allowed to be sexy it's just in a more understated way, women many times have to be blatantly sexual. The two celebrities I'd say are considered the most sexy right now are Ryan Gosling and Kate Upton. He's very sexy in a low key way and she's, well, a bikini model. The point of the videos was to highlight the ridiculousness of the overt sexiness of the ads. The first video doesn't seem as odd to me, the situations seem more natural I guess. I mean, I've never eaten a burger on my hands and knees in the sand but I have been more dominant in bed.
