Is your advocate the same as a lawyer in the sense that they are licensed to practice law in any court? Or are they just some person the university assigned? Because I think many universities are incentivized to brush sexual assault under the rug. It's a big headache and unwanted publicity for them. Is it possible for you to talk to somebody independent of the university about this? If this man has assaulted two women there should be criminal charges, not just university disciplinary action.
