I'm a dude, so no experience with yeast infections, however when i was in the army, i got bad, and i mean really bad foot fungi. Oh it was horrible, about 20 minutes after a shower, my feet would be rank. Any way, I used a combo of "fast acting" tanactin cream on my feet, twice a day. When i got up, and when I went to bed. Then through out the day I would use Gold bond medicated powder (both these are cheap over the counter non prescription). I took a little while (about 2 months for it to fully leave) but it starts working right away. Keep in mind, the dryer the affected area is, the easier it is to get rid of it. As for your hands, I would use the same tanactin cream, but myabe put some latex, or non latex sterile gloves on let it soak in, then sprinkle with the gold bond powder (as it will dry up moister on top of effective healing) 

Good luck, and sorry its so bad
