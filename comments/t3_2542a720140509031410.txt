Thank you for sharing a story that's "far from traumatic".  

It seems to me that because there is so much stigma associated with abortion in the States, American women tend to experience a lot more emotional trauma, when they have one, than women in other countries. It's great to hear about experiences that are relatively easy, because it goes a long way to reassuring women who might be contemplating their options that it doesn't *have* to be a huge deal, or something that you'll regret for the rest of your life.
