Yeah, she is saying she needs to report it "if I dont" which is confusing because how would she know if I reported it? They said to the PD in my state. 

I don't want to report it, at all, I just think my wording was a red flag? I was just curious if anyone had experience with PP reporting assaults and what they did.
