Oh wow I'm so happy that there are women who do this! Sometimes when I'm in loose PJs I'll (in a non sexual way) play with my penis and balls, just bop them around a little, partly so they aren't uncomfortable against my leg I guess, partly just because I have anxious hands and I'm always fidgeting with something, sometimes it's just going to be my penis because it's right there. The thing is my wife chastises me for doing it if she catches me, she'll actually grab my hand and tell me to stop because it weirds her out, it makes me feel guilty about it but I'm not usually really thinking about it, it's not like I do it around company or anything.

I'm really sorry if the male interjection  is unwelcome here (I know it involves junk and everything, so I'm double sorry) but this actually made me feel better about myself and I've been having a bit of a shitty time for other reasons, I wanted to thank you for sharing.
