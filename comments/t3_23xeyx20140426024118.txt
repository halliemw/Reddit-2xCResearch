I meant long term in the sense of people spending many, many years on them. Of course they take time to have an effect and then you need to be learning how to address the cause and that takes energy they can help give you. But long term reliance on their effects when there is little by way of evidence for chronic depression (according to those in pharma even) actually being treatable, is just throwing away money and, in my opinion, people's lives.
