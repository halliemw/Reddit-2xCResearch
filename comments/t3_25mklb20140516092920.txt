The stock price increase is due to risk premiums shrinking because everybody shat their pants during the financial crisis and sold everything. Even the consumer staple companies like Coca Cola, Proctor and Gamble, and Colgate have doubled in stock prices, but people didn't stop brushing their teeth during the recession. The stock price doesn't tell the whole story.

What is more important is to look at the NY Times income statement. Their earnings have gone down to about zero, meaning they are just operating at break-even. Their revenue is less than half of what it is 10 years ago, meaning they are selling half as much as they used to. The NY Times, as well as every other newspaper that isn't bankrupt yet, is scratching and clawing for survival. They can't pay what they used to pay if they are selling half as many newspapers and the trend is still downward.
