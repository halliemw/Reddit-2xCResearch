You begin by saying you assumed that a man alone in a parking lot was a threat, we try to not be sexist here, but if the story were the same except a woman the same age with the same questions, would you still think it creepy. You already admitted your are shy and part of letting go of that is picking who to be afraid of. You've said nothing to suggest he was creepy or dangerous at all, maybe he wanted to mentor you, maybe date you, maybe he was just lonely and wanted someone to talk to. You probably saw this whole interaction through the lens that this guy was the threat, which it appears he was not. Trust a little, or at least be more selective who you assume is dangerous.

>I feel really stupid for just talking to a stranger who could have overpowered me if he wanted to, especially since I was alone and vulnerable.

We are all alone in parking lots, and unless you're [Hafþór Björnsson](http://i.imgur.com/1tGrQiZ.jpg) there will be people that can overpower you in the world. There are bad people out there, but they are a minority and if you live your life like all men are potential rapists, you'll be very unhappy.
