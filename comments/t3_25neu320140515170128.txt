I don't share your desire to have children nor do I share the experience you are going though, but I hope that you one day realize that what you're feeling and the decision you make regarding it shouldn't alter the perception you have of yourself into "awful" and "selfish". Last time I checked the decision of having a kid, adoption or otherwise, *is* about what's best for you and your partner.

Hope you start to feel better soon.
