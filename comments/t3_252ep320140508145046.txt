I got mine on Christmas Day when I was 11 on the long drive from our house in Georgia to my Grandma's house in Anniston, AL. I had a "really bad stomach ache" (which I later learned was what cramps felt like) during the entire drive, but didn't need to go to the rest room. By the time we got there and I went to the restroom there was so much blood it looked black. I thought I had been shitting myself, which was pretty upsetting. 

Eventually I had to tell my mom about it, luckily she had some pads on her, as the only other choice would have been my Grandma's gigantic Depends pads :-/
