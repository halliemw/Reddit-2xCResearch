The odd thing about Dunham is she clearly works much harder to be attractive off the screen -- through clothes, makeup, hair. I wonder which one is the real Dunham. Does her publicist insist she look better in public? Or does Dunham intentionally dress/prepare her character on Girls to look even worse? It's intriguing.
