Omg I love my alesse - zero periods, no cramps, no PMS if I use it continuously. I never had skin problems so I dunno if it helped. Also no babies! heh. I've been on it for at least 7 years. In the last 2 years I've sorta lost my libido (unsure of the cause) so I will be trying a new BC, but I wish I didn't have to. My sister really liked the tri-cyclen. Good luck!
