I think given the title of the thread and the fact that not long ago the Irish constitution:

 " recognise[d] the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Religious Society of Friends in Ireland, as well as the Jewish Congregations and the other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution."

a recognition preceded by these words:

The State recognises the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.

Given just those facts alone, yes, I think it is understandable that one would, however momentarily, fear that Ireland was giving in to pressure from radical religious groups.

Tl;DR:  The only thing difficult to understand is a refusal to understand another.
