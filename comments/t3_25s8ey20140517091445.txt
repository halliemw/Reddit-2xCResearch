I work at a hospital,and just to share some advice refrain from using the 0~10 scale. Don't say a number and if pressed for one reiterate you've never had to describe pain this way and you don't know.

Its used for billing and mostly billing alone. You won't get morphine by saying 10, you just get charged 45 dollars for the extra Tylenol with codeine.
