Not the most messy but I like to call this "Why I finally started shaving my pubes"

I was 17 and worked for a movie theater. My boyfriend at the time also worked for said movie theater. As employees we were acutely aware of which theaters were empty at what times, so before work one day we snuck off to a movie no one was watching and sat in the back and fooled around. Eventually he goes down on me. I'm enjoying it but I see a shadow near the door and tell him "ooh, get up someone is coming".

I feel a tug and hear him say "I'm schtuck". Now, this was the late 90s, maybe 2000, tongue rings were the IT thing. Somehow his tongue ring got tangled in my pubes. I guess the top ball wasn't tight enough or something.

He had to rip the hair in half to get loose. As he's getting up someone actually did walk in. I was so paranoid I slid on to the ground of the back row to pull my pants up. He was laughing so hard and going "wtf why are you on the ground?" I was mortified.

My razor and I became besties that night.
