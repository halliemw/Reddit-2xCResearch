Why can't you get over it? Because it hurts like goddamn cactus in the eye. Except that it's in your heart.

Let me say that I'm really, truly, sorry that you're feeling this way. It will take more than three days to feel better. It might even take more than 3 months to feel like yourself again, but you will get there. 

Take "you" time; have a hot bath with lots of bubbles and candles, eat that Ben and Jerry's, binge-watch gory horror films if that's your thing. Do whatever you want to make yourself comfortable. And don't be ashamed to have a good cry if you feel you need to. Holding that inside won't make you feel better.

I have to echo what the other ladies here are saying: cut communication completely. It doesn't sound like he had the respect to even let you know your relationship was over before referring to it in the past tense, so he deserves to be permanent past tense for you.

Chin up, fellow TwoX warrior! Stay strong!

Edit: I don't think "ashemed" is a word.
