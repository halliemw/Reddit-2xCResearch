Way to go! I hope you get it!

Actually how I got my current position was going for it even though I wasn't "technically" qualified. I'm in PR and I have never taken a PR class. I'm a history major for goodness sake! But I love the company and I wanted it, so I applied. I beat out over a hundred applicants!

So you go out there and squash 'em!
