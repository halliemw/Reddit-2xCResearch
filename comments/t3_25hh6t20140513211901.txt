Yeah, I've noticed this attitude from supposedly sex positive people. I think being sex positive isn't just being open to casual sex/kink/what have you, but not condemning the (safe, sane, and consensual) sexual choices of others, whether it's abstaining from sex or engaging in nightly orgies. It's crazy to me that anyone would have problems with your personal choices, which will affect them in no way.
