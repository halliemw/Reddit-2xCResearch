See a GI doctor. Twice a week is not enough. I get bloating too and I've noticed it's far worse when my bowels are irregular. 

The infrequent pooping and bloating may be due to a food intolerance or allergy like many people here are suggesting, so you should experiment with different diets or talk to a doctor about allergy testing. Or it could be something as simple as not getting enough fiber in your diet or certain vitamins.

Things to try (they have helped me):  
1. Cutting down on carbs, especially refined ones. Look for complex and unprocessed carbs that are high in fiber or start taking a daily fiber supplement like Metamucil or Benefiber. Fiber should give you more solid and regular poops!
2. Drink lots of water, get a good night's sleep, and exercise regularly-- health 101   
3. Take a daily multivitamin and a probiotic with your largest meal once a day   
4. Cut down on sugar intake, especially in large quantities. You can also experiment with salt intake although I don't know as much about this   
5. Low to no dairy if there's a chance you're lactose intolerant (extremely common at your age) or allergic to dairy
6. Eat small and balanced meals throughout the day. And instead of eating one type of food all at once, like all carbs for breakfast, veggies for dinner, and protein for dinner, try to get a little of each in every meal   
7. Eat more cooked vegetables than raw since they are easier to digest
