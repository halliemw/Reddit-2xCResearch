Thanks for the well thought out answer.

So what should we do? One individual cannot change society, society cannot change rapidly. Recognize the risks and what they correlate to, live your life hoping that someday the privileges are evened out, or everyone is brought to the same level. 

I think it's asinine to ignore a glaring issue in society just because race has something to do with it.
