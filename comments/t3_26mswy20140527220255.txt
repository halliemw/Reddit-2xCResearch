I agree with a lot of things the author mentioned, the first being that misogyny *did* have something to do with te recent shooting and the second being the entitlement that some men have when it comes to women. You could be smart, have all of your shit together in life, and a woman can still not be attracted to you. You can't earn people like he said, we just feel the way we do. We're not a game, you don't press specific buttons and expect the same result as the other guy. It might also have to do with the apethetic aspect of "nerd culture". The nerdy guys I know tend to see emotions as not rational, and therefore not 'smart'. It probably leads to a lack of understanding and acknowlegement of human emotions, regarding both themselves and others.
