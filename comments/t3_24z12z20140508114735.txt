No I'm not grossed out by periods or pregnancy or any of that. I just think there's more that defines the female experience than just sex related things. I'm worried that this subreddit will become one of those shitty yogurt commercials. Don't get me wrong, I think posting resources about everyday girl stuff is fine. For example r/abrathatfits is a very important resource that many women may have missed. But 2X has the opportunity to bring women into the light of a traditionally male oriented website now that it is a default. To show that there's more to being a woman than what's in Cosmo magazine. 

That all said, the top posts to this subreddit today are a little bit more diverse than yesterday so that's good and I hope that continues.
