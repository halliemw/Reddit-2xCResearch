Oops sorry, spelling mistake. It's actually dysplasia, that's just the term they use for the abnormal cells on a microscopic level. Low grade means there are usually less abnormal cells and may often resolve themselves on their own. High grade means that these cells may eventually become cancerous if left alone, this process can take years, probably not something that would change over night.
