I totally feel you.  I am short and a little chubby ATM so it is hard to find good fitting clothes that don't look like something my mom would wear.  I am 23 years old and still shop in the large to XL juniors section. 

I was cashing in some lotto tickets the other day and the cashier asked for my id.  (You have to be 18 in my state). Come on!  To be rid of the people thinking I'm 12 syndrome, I make sure to put some kind of makeup.  Also, I never wear sweatshirts.  They put off a high school vibe.  I always wear long sweaters or cardigans.
