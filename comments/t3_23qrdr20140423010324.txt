Ah, yes. I gained weight as well! I had no real side effects for the first six months or so and then it all kicked in and happened at once. I hate taking a pill every day but I'm looking forward to going back to that at this point! Have you tried the Depo shot? According to my gyn, it is exactly the same as the implant as far as mechanism and side effects. She made me try the shot before I decided to get the implant. Unfortunately I didn't get the bad side effects until I had had the implant for a while, so I didn't know right away, but for some people I guess getting the shot first may deter them.
