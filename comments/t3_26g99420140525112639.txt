I'm sorry your trust was broken and you had to endure this from a supervisor.

A person in a position of power should always be aware that those lower on the ladder are obligated to be polite. Sounds like he conveniently forgot this fact. I think he was just barely skirting the line of workplace decency with this stuff. Like holding you hostage waiting out in the parking lot while your coworkers watched. Especially since he's an older male and probably cultivated an advisory role, I think that ignoring the boundaries between you two (age boundaries; life stage boundaries; workplace boundaries) was really inappropriate. Sorry again.
