I quit my job for one using my degree just yesterday!

Don't be too nervous! Everything will work out. 

I was very nervous to tell my boss too, but it went over really well. They were happy to see me move on into something I had studied to do, but they were also sad to see me go. With a minimum wage job, it's likely (though not ALWAYS the case) that they're getting applications in all the time, and the turnover rate is very high, so they will be fine.

If you can call him, that may be a better option. I too wanted to write an email/letter, but on the advice of my other boss (I have 2 jobs), I decided a call was better.
