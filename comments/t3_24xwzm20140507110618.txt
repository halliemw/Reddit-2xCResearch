Good God.  Keep in mind that your sister has built up an iron clad emotional shell by now. She's going to be hard to reach out to, but you should keep trying.  Try to schedule a weekly or bi-weekly phone call with her, establish trust, and work on a plan for getting her out of that toxic environment. She will soooooo benefit from counseling. Her self esteem is probably in the gutter after years of being told she was complete shit. Hopefully she'll move out and start coming out of her shell, but I really wouldn't be surprised if she has issues expressing her anger in an acceptable manner... she hasn't really had a good example to model herself on, so counseling will be VITAL for her to learn to express herself and form healthy relationships.
