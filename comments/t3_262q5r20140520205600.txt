I'm saying this a person who keeps most things out in the open, but a human being has a right to their secrets. 

legally, there is no entity as there is no third person. the cluster of cells, it belongs to OP in it's entirety, she is in full possession of it, it belongs to this guy not at all. 

he has no rights in this situation. if OP wants to tell him, that's cool, but it is up to OP if she wants to or not. this secret belongs to her and her alone.
