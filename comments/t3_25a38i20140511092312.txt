Okay think about it a little more from his perspective. You might be a little selfish, here. There shouldn't be a double standard of "I can use a toy on my own but you can't." A lot of guys are conditioned to "need" masturbation and porn, and now that he thinks you're comfortable with toys, he thinks that's an option to spice up his life, if you will. My boyfriend specifically likes to masturbate because it's an orgasm with no pressure, and sex is pressure. 

I think you should take a little time and explore what about it makes you so uncomfortable. If it's because you think you should be enough, talk to him. You are probably more than enough for *sex* but alone time is probably different for him. 

Figure out why and talk it out. If it's too hard to say out loud, start with a letter to him. Hand written, not typed. 

Good luck.
