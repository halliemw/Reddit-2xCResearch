Is your boyfriend simply "commenting/joking" about your "unlady-like" quirks, or is he being outright condescending/making fun of you/putting you down? If it's all in jest, but it still bothers you, I would suggest telling him so--that those "quirks" are a part of who you are, and that you cannot/will not change.

However, if it's not all in good fun, I would also suggest talking to him about it. Nobody deserves to feel like the person they are is somehow lesser or wrong for some/all of the quirks and characteristics about themselves. BUT I would give him some sort of time limit to change his tune (whatever time you think is appropriate, but I would say a month max). If he continues to make those comments to you after your assigned time limit, I would cut the cord on your relationship, because then it just sounds like he is trying to manipulate/change you into someone that fits his mold of what a female/girlfriend/wife material/etc. is supposed to be.

As for him being jealous, I don't have any advice on that, but your situation sounds almost exactly like my husband and my before we got married. I kept the guy friends that were truly my friends, and weeded out the ones that were not (easier said than done). Eventually, my husband realized that I could be trusted to have both male and female friends (that's not to say he was sitting there saying, "You can't have male friends. Harumph," but I'm sure you get the point).

If you want to make more female friends though, I would suggest maybe looking into activities that typically have a higher female demographic that you'll enjoy. I promise you'll meet people that you'll get along with! 

I hope that any of what I'm saying helps!
