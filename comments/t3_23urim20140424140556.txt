This has all the information the OP is looking for, specifically:

>Q: Is abortion legal?
>A: Yes. Abortion is legal in Canada and in the United States. However, access to abortion services in Canada varies from region to region. See section on Provision of Care below for a regional breakdown.

>Q: Do I need permission from my parents, husband or partner to have an abortion? Will the clinic contact anyone else?
>A: No. You may decide to discuss your decision with others, but the clinic will not contact anyone without your permission.

>Q: How do I find an abortion clinic?
>A: There are several ways to find a clinic. **You can call the National Abortion Federation Hotline at 1-800-772-9100, search your local phone book, search online or ask a sympathetic physician for a referral.** Please note that in Canada, there are no abortion facilities on Prince Edward Island. Some provinces have only hospital access and no independent clinics and access in rural and northern areas is limited.

>Q: Is there a point at which I can no longer have an abortion?
>A: Yes, this will depend on where you live and your individual medical circumstances. In Ontario, providers are available to provide service up to 24 weeks from your last menstrual period, after which, referrals can be made to the United States, where service can sometimes be provided at later gestational ages. Also, abortions with medications only (no surgery) are available for women less than 49 days, or 7 weeks, pregnant.
