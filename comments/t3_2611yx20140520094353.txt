I don't know.  I am a guy and I have seen this petty stuff a lot in offices and especially in servers at restaurants.  It's a woman thing I suppose.  Kinda like high school crap.

My advice is to do your job and do it well.  Ask them for help and make it about them when you talk to them.  That way they will think you "know your place", but in reality you are changing their behaviour toward you.  That is just my observations as a guy over the years.  Others may have a better answer.  Guys don't really have this problem as much.
