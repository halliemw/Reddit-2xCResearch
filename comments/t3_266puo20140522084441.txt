To echo everyone else, tell her bluntly that you can't afford it. But tell her now, before she devotes more time into bridesmaid stuff. She might want to pick someone else to fill that slot. It could go a few ways; she could offer to pay for you, say "tough breaks, kiddo," and take you out of the wedding party, or whine that you must not care about her happiness, but whatever happens don't let her shame you into forking over money you don't have.
