As long as its placed right it won't leak at all (except if its over filling). I've heard stories that you can squat one out like a tampon but I think much much less likly.  there is a learning curve and it takes a while to get the hang of it. It should be comfortable if placed right, though there are variety of brands with various sizes shapes and squishyness' if one you get isn't the most comfertable.
