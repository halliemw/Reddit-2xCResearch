What a scary situation!  Sorry that you are shaken but really glad you are unharmed. I've been there & know how it feels like a major violation. Please don't assume that any community is "really safe," there is no such thing. Look into getting some window locks, there are some that can slide along the metal track of the window & be adjusted depending how open you want the window. A wooden dowel is also another inexpensive alternative. I have them in the tracks of all my windows so that they can't be opened without removing them. If someone pops the screen off from the outside, they can't slide the window open because the dowel blocks it from moving. This works for sliding glass doors too. Perhaps consider keeping the window openings smaller than the size a person could fit through & locked so they can't open further, even when you're home & especially when sleeping.
