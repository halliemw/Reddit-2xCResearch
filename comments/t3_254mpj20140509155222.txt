I have also been following the poofusion news with horrified fascination! Happily, I'm a couple of years out from chemotherapy (this was a recurrence), so I've had time to build up healthy gut flora again, but I would absolutely consider a fecal transplant if I had C. diff again. Medicine is neat and super gross!
