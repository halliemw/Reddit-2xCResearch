He should support her decision while acknowledging his discomfort with the situation. He doesn't have to stay with her, but it shouldn't be "If you have the abortion, I'll leave." It should be "I understand that you need to get this abortion, and I will help you through this process, but I don't know if I will be able to deal with the ramifications that it will have for our relationship." At this point it seems like an ultimatum instead of just a statement that this is the end for them. She says she needs to get this abortion, and he is being manipulative by trying to influence her decision and using their relationship as a bargaining chip.
