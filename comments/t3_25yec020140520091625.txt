I was trying to explain this to my brother the other day. Put very simply people are unaware to the knowledge that gender is stereotyped and more so projection of what we want out of that gender rather than a truly set free person. This may be seen in not only gender, but also race, age, and any other "ism" as one might say. Watch anything from the early 2000's and before, media is definitely making some strides towards equality in some of these, however we're not there yet as one may read the bottom comments to this post. Keep posting, because this isn't a rant, or drama, it's probably rather justifying in many ways and cathartic.
