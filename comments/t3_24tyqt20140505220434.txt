You are a lovely person.
I agree with your reasoning 100%.
I actually feel like prostituton and the sex trade should be legalized and regulated to protect sex workers. They are people, offering a service. They are not monsters and they are not to blame for who their customers are.
That being said, many women would have walked in on that situation and flipped out on the sex worker, called her names and degraded her out of anger - you did not do this.
Best of luck to you. I left an asshat bf when I was younger and found + married the love of my life a year later.
