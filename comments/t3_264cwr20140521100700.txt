Even the most secure woman in the world would not want to hear from their SO that he wants to sleep with other woman, more importantly your friends/co-workers, etc.  As a guy I have had those thoughts while I was dating someone, but would never act on them (cheating is deplorable) and I would never vocalize them because it is extremely disrespectful to my SO.  I would have a serious sit down with him and detail these issues (as everyone else has said) if his responses are not up to par with what you need/want/expect or if he treats it as a joke, then he doesn't respect you and doesn't deserve to be with you.
