I think there was tremendous miscommunication going on. If you read any of the following (or anything similar) from my words:

* (She is a woman), she doesn't know how (steel toed) boots work

* (She is a woman), she doesn't know how to shop online

* (She is a woman), she doesn't know how to choose equipment or judge how safe or fit for her it is

or anything like that, then either I miscommunicated, or you misread my words. I did not say, mean or imply, any of the above, or anything similar, and I think you thought that I did.

The purpose of everything I was saying was simply to:

* Suggest another avenue for acquiring clothes and equipment: no matter how you put it, even now, in 2014, people buy clothes online a lot less than I think is warranted, and settle for worse choices that are in store. And I do not know why this is; part of the issue, though, I think is that people think that it's a huge pain to return something, or replace it, etc. - and I thought this as well before trying this - but this was simply not the case. So I guess I was trying to raise awareness.

* (Prior to your qualification that with thicker sox they fit snugly): Pointing out the fact that a loosely-fitting shoe can be very dangerous in an industrial setting. And it's not nearly a simple a concept as the notion of a steel toe protecting the toe: it's actually the *twist* of the loosely fitting shoe about the crus of the leg that can be really damaging. I was peripherally involved in the finite element analysis of exactly that thing happening, for a court case - and there is a reason that the court case went to a jury trial. And it's not a question of understanding or not understanding something you work with every day - hell, I've worn steel toes for over a decade in the shops - prior to encountering this court case and recognizing the vectors of force application on the leg that I did not ever think about when choosing boots (or other equipment).

That's all. Please don't read any kind of aggression or dismissal or attack or implication of incompetence in my words, it's simply not there, and I am sorry if at any point came across that it was.
