Okay, thanks for being an asshole troll. I wasnt seeking "medical advice" I was hoping someone had been through something similar and could give me some help on what to look forward to. Obviously, I will ultimately get help from a doctor.. its not like I said "hey guys, diagnose me so I can go take these vitamins and be better!"what the fuck?
