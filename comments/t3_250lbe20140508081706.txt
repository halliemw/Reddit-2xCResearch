I have similar hair to you.  Currently I wear it straight/short but you might want to try a body wave.  If the stylist uses very large rollers it will give the hair a little texture without being really curly.

Another thing I like to do is spray  a bunch of hairspray in, then comb through and lightly (very lightly so you don't look like an 80s music video!) tease the hair in places where I want volume.
