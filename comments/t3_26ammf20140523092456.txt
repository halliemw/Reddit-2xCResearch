I'm so sorry this happened to you. Additional needs or not, depending on how he is affected it may not directly link with that behaviour - or it does. You have the right to feel upset and angry - you shouldn't see it as acceptable behaviour. Depending on his circumstances someone will explain to him why the way he behaved was not appropriate. As for those girls who laughed - charming :/
