I love your Sari. It's beautiful,

Mine isn't a mother-daughter clothing experience- but a father daughter clothing experience. I'm much taller than my mom and her old clothes haven't fit me since I was about 12. I wear my dad's old suit from the 70s sometimes. Sounds weird, but the thing looks good on me. Mostly, I just wear the jacket - but the pants fit too and I've worn them before. It's a gray hounds tooth pattern. He used to wear it to church when I was a little kid.
