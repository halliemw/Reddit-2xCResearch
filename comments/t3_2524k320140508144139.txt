I believe trolls in this case would be the people downvoting everything to hell and making very negative, snide remarks. I already came across comments calling other users as sluts or feminazis. None of that will be tolerated here but that is what a lot of subscribers were worried about. Positive users are ones who add to the discussion. They do not have to "agree" to anything.
