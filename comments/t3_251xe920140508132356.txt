I think you're reading too much in to his initial dismissal of the idea. Most guys don't want to go to counseling and resist the idea at first because it makes them feel like the relationship is out of control and broken and that's a scary idea. 

OP has only just brought up the idea. If he adamantly refuses to go, of course she can continue on her own, as you have suggested. That's obvious.

But he isn't saying "I won't go". He's just questioning whether it's necessary. And she's saying yes. My money is on that he'll go with her once the appointment is scheduled and it's all said and done. This is the typical relationship pattern. 

But thanks for the downvotes. They were very helpful.
