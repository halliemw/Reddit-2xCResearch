I've had it for 2 years and I have some issues with my period, but more on the side of I won't get one for 2-3 months, then a heavy one that lasts about 2 weeks. It seemed to settle into that routine after about a year.

Compared to what I had before (the injection that I forget the name of), it's absolute heaven. The injection left me stressed, depressed and very ill. The implant has potentially caused a bit of weight gain, but that could be more with the recovery of the depression.

I'd maybe give it some more time considering how long you've already managed to stay with it, but if you're not happy with it, then don't force yourself to stick with it.
