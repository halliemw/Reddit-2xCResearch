You're not bad, the comments you made are actually to be expected since this sub became a default and default is male.  I'm just frustrated r/twox will never be the same and I didn't mean to be unwelcoming.  

I'm guessing the mods are hoping to impact reddit and help shift the default perspective to less misogyny.  It's selfish to want the girls only tree house back.  The cause is noble or something.  Thank you for reading.  This is probably what they were hoping for.
