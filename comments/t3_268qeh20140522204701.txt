I was going to copy the part about rubbing your belly and write an amazed "WTF??" Comment, but there were too many WTF situations described. Seriously.

I know it sucks now, but in a few months you're going to look back and realize that you're better off. Sounds like you grew a lot, added a bunch of valuable skills, and gained some good contacts. You sound like an ass kicker, so go kick ass for someone who will treat you better!
