NI isn't financially independent, it is supported by the rest of the UK to the tune of Â£9 billion a year. It receives more spending per person and collects less tax than any other part of the UK (mainly because of the security situation). 

Everything else in NI is already subsidised by UK taxpayers. Why should abortion be different?
