> This trap huh? The class struggle is a trap. The 85 richest people have as much wealth as the 3.5 BILLION poorest. So thats how serious the class struggle is. Are you saying thats how serious the gender struggle is? What backwater shithole would I have to travel to in order to find women without all the legal rights of a man?

This right here.  This is where I decided I can't talk to you anymore.  Let's go over the steps so that perhaps one day you'll be able to come back to this issue with some rational thought:

* I present evidence of a millenia-long system of oppression by men over women.
* You respond with "it's a class struggle"
* I remind you (again) that pointing to a separate class struggle does not mean that the struggle for equality doesn't exist.
* You ignore that point and demand that I point you to a "backwater shithole" where rights are not equal
* I now offer you two:
    * [In The United States of America, a woman can be forced to undergo a medical procedure before she is even granted the right to have an abortion](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/02/virginia_ultrasound_law_women_who_want_an_abortion_will_be_forcibly_penetrated_for_no_medical_reason.html).
    * [In Ireland, a woman was denied a life-saving abortion because the hospital refused on religious grounds](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/14/savita-halappanavar-death-irish-woman-denied-abortion-dies_n_2128696.html).  Her death was painful and slow, both she and the unviable fetus died.

It's clear that you came here with opinions that you wanted validated, rather than questions and ideas you wanted to explore.  **This is not how one acquires knowledge**, but rather how a fundamentalist persists in his ignorance.

But that's really ok.  There are lots of people who are [wrong on the internet](http://xkcd.com/386/) and the time of women's equality is almost here.  Maybe before that happens you should do some research of your own into terms like [patriarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy), [rape culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture) and [bodily autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity) -- because it's clear that whomever has been teaching you about these words has been lying to you.

You have privilege.  It's my hope that in time you'll finally acknowledge that, and once you do, you'll realise that you have a responsibility to help abolish it.
