I think this comes from the pervasive idea that if a woman flaunts her sexuality, she drowns in all the sex/attention/whatever she could want. Whereas a man HAS to flaunt his sexuality in order to MAYBE sleep with ONE girl...MAYBE. That's sorta where I think this and a lot of slut shaming in general comes from.

I'm not saying I agree with it, or that it's right(it's not)...but there's the logic anyway.
