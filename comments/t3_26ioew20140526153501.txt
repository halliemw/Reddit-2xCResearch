No one test score will ruin your life but if you consistently do badly it likely will, especially if whatever you choose to do for post secondary requires grades above a certain level. So if you overall do well don't sweat it if you do poorly once. But the whole purpose of school is to learn and get you further later in life so try to see it that way, rather than as something to get out of the way while you socialize and make friends
