It's hard to give you a very detailed answer, but personally, I couldn't stay with someone that doesn't respect me. If he doesn't respect you now, how could you possibly "earn" it from him? You deserve respect as a woman and a human being, of course, but you definitely deserve respect _from the person you are dating_! This is baseline, basic relationship stuff. it'd be a total dealbreaker for me. 

Having your own space/time is one thing, but if he can't compromise even a little bit, it's only going to get worse. I don't know how long you've been together, but it's probably worth talking to him about it. But don't come at it as something you have to earn. If anything, he should have to prove to you that he does respect you, and that you're not wasting your time with someone who thinks of you as an accessory more than as a person
