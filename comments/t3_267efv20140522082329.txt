Oh no! I think I know what you're talking about, where OP took a picture of his girlfriend? Regardless of whether it was the same, I saw something like you're describing last night and was also really discouraged. People putting down a girl because of her size when there were so much better things to talk about in the picture, and then some lunatic giving gold to the worst comments, which I absolutely believe lead to more shitty comments trying to get gilded.

People are miserable. Other people being happy or, in the picture I saw, TRYING TO WORK OUT AND BE HEALTHIER, DAMN- offends others, and I don't get it. I guess some people think they're owed that every person they look at check all their shitty little boxes of what makes someone attractive and some people think that saying hateful shit is fine as long as, "I'm just telling the truth, man!"

I absolutely agree with you that reddit and the internet is real life and people hide behind anonymity or at least a physical seperation from their victims. Your time on this earth is real life. If you spent it bullying in high school, it's not better or worse than spending it bullying online. I believe you have a duty to help and be kind to others, and to try to make things easier for those in the world with you. No one is asking for perfection, we all lose our tempers and we are all weak, but that's just it. Your teasing some girl isn't being brave or funny. It's weakness. You should feel bad and try to do better. Kids shit on me in middle and high school, and they shit on a lot of crummy nerds who turned around and 10 years down the line shit on others online. Why would we ever want to systematically do it to others? Why would we ever be proud of that?
