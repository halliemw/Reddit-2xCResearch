>Different religions doesn't have to be a dealbreaker 

People are allowed to choose their own deal breakers. Religion is a deal breaker for me. For others, maybe political views are a deal breaker. Maybe life goals, number of kids wanted (if any), general disposition, can all be deal breakers. It is unfortunate for OP, but her former SO is allowed to set his standards however he wants.
