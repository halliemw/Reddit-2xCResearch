For me, TwoXChromosomes throws me off, I know the sub is not transphobic (except on the rare occasions when casual transphobia slips, gets upvoted, got called by a trans person and a cis person replies with "that's not transphobic") but reading the sub name on the days I'm feeling disphoric is not a happy experience ("gee, thanks for reming me what I'll never have in common with you girls").

Not trying to be confrontation or something, I just wanted to say why I dislike the name of this sub, and the pletora of all other "2x" subs out there.
