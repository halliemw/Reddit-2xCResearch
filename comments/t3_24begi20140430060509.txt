It took me a long time (and a really respectful guy) to realize how I can be respected, and how important respect is in making me comfortable safe-feeling. Now I can spot the difference in a first or second date and ditch selfish disrespectful people quickly. Something as simple as turning down a first kiss should not be something I'm made to feel guilty about, asked multiple times for, or get multiple pushy attempts for. One "no" and you back off or wait it out and let me take the lead? That's a winner in my eyes.
