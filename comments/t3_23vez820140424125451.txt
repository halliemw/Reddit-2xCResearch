I agree, OP or anyone else shouldn't let some anonymous ass on the internet ruin their day. These kinda of people go for the easiest point to attack (In the case for women are threats of rape and other misogynistic insults). If you don't cave in they just look like idiots that they are. So OP don't fall for the bait and hook, be above that kind of garbage.
