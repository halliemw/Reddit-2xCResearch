>It's confirmation bias, plain and simple. Redditor posts link to radical feminist doing/saying something stupid, other redditors mass-upvote it to increase visibility

On an (I think) related note - has anyone else been getting concerned about the number of front page posts about women who have falsely accused men of rape, and feminists yelling about supposedly held-open doors, etc?

 false rape accusations are terrible and wrong and their discussion is important. I'm just concerned about *how many* posts there are about it and none about, well, those people who get actually raped.

And as for this feminist door fiasco, I have never even once witnessed this happen in real life, or heard a feminist express this sentiment in real life. I'm sure it has happened, but is it really a wide spread enough occurrence to warrant a post every 2 days?

To me, its kinda seeming like a scary anti-feminist trend is picking up momentum on reddit, possibly (probably) due to this confounding of radical feminism with plain ol feminism. Maybe I'm just beginning to notice it more, and I know that reddits never had the most balanced gender representation, but I swear to god it didn't used to be like this. Right? 

Anyone else noticing this? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills
