I think this is great advice. 

From a male perspective, I doubt he's trying to control you, or that he's unsatisfied with the way you look, but instead he's hoping that you will take his opinion into account. I don't often make clothing suggestions to my SO, but when I do, I always hope that my opinion is taken into account (although she rarely does).

Particularly since you mentioned that he takes your advice into account when he makes clothing choices, he may be hoping you'll show him that you both trust his judgement, and that you care about what he likes. 

I'm not suggesting that he should make all your clothing decisions for you, and he certainly has no right to try to dictate what you wear, but indulging him every now and then wouldn't hurt you, and shows him that you care.
