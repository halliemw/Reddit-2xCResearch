While I agree with you (I myself had a kid at 17 and went to school up until one day before giving birth) it's not something easy to do. I was tired all the time, my body ached 24/7, I couldn't sleep and walking the 8 blocks to school was almost impossible (had to take a cab or have my mom take me for the last three months of my pregnancy). I also fainted a lot the first few months, and morning sickness was hell (had to take a break to go to the bathroom every hour or so, and puked in class a few times).

That's just what I went through, some people have it better and some have it worse. There are a lot of possible complications that can arise during pregnancy. There's also the social part of it: I was shunned and made fun of by many kids at school. The ones that didn't make fun of me were happy that I was having a baby and touched my belly all the time... strangers touching my belly made me very uncomfortable. Also teachers sucked, some didn't let me go to the bathroom when I needed to because even though I was pregnant "I brought it upon myself" (because both my bc methods failed?) and other "fun stuff" like that.

Also, she might not even be able to carry the pregnancy to term depending on her body and how developed it is.
