Why *should* they? No reason other than that they are a celebrity and all celebrities, both men and women, are judged base on their looks. Mostly because those trashy celebrity gossip mags/tv shows/ websites make a lot of money. Men *are* judged by what they wear, but they have it easy because there's only so much you can comment on a suit or tux. Just because she's a comedian and not an actress or a music artist doesn't mean she's any less of a celebrity. And you can bet your buttons that if Louis CK went to an award show wearing nothing but boxers, it would be ALL over the media. 

And yet, it is probably mostly women making a huge deal over what she's wearing. I guarantee most guys aren't going to have a comment about her dress. Guys don't care. I don't think this is a case of *people* judging women by how they look and not by what they do, I think it's a case of *women* judging other women by how they look
