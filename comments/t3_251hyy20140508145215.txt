Which is all very well in principle but the UK doesn't have the legal authority to mandate what health care Northern Ireland provides. Anyway would you take the same stance on an English woman wanting a free prescription in Scotland? 

Health care is a devolved matter so England has no right to tell Northern Ireland what it will fund. We can object personally, and I do, but it isn't right for England to overrule the wishes of Northern Ireland whenever Northern Ireland has a different policy. Yes I know technically Westminster isn't the English parliament but the UK one but that only muddies the waters without any benefit.
