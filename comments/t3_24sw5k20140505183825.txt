I was the same way - I hadn't been single since high school (two LTRs back to back). It's totally a weird adjustment, and that's ok. There's a lot of value to developing a good life as your own person. I figure, even if I meet the love of my life they could be hit by a bus or something. 

I'm not sure of your age, but one issue I have had is that all of my close friends are married or partnered (I'm 30). For some people, making some new single friends would be the solution to that. I'm pretty happy with the number and quality of my friendships, so I just got really used to reaching out to existing friends on weekends, which is when I struggled with loneliness the most. 

A very good friend gave me the best advice, which was to be intentional about filling the time that had previously been filled by my relationship, so I also picked up some new hobbies and volunteer activities.
