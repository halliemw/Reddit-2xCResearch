> I made no such claim, nor would 

 ... but therein lies part of the problem.  Such is the position of some femenists, what you said was similar to what I have heard before, and perhaps I read too much into what you said.  I apologise for that.  Feminism is not about highlighting the differences between men and women, it is about ensuring that women have equal rights and treatment.  Too many people behave as if it is the former, and then attempt to exploit those differences (the "man haters"), and your comments felt like they were at least heading that way.

> We cannot come to a conversation on equality in a diverse environment if we are not willing to acknowledge that certain issues affect others more than ourselves.

  Can we not agree that diversity is not simply about male/female.  That everybody whilst having some things in common with others, is unique .... and that what rights we may have are common, regardless of *any* differences.

  My ~~probllem~~ disagreement with feminism, or at least some manifestations thereof, is that it focuses on women's rights to the unspoken exclusion of men's rights.  Whilst I've no doubt that there are many many more cases of women being treated in various detrimental ways, historically and presently, I am not trying to dismiss that .... I am saying let's not take sides.  Talking about "women's" rights is taking sides.  Let's talk about "human" rights.  That way, nobody is going to misunderstand your observations of the distinctions between any two or more distinctive "traits", and nobody is going to deliberately make those distinctions, and in doing so poison the cause.

> do you want society to treat you, as a man

  I want society as a whole to treat me as a human with the same rights and freedoms as every other human, and I want those other humans to be treated to the same rights I enjoy.  I want individual members of the society to treat me as an individual, whilst still respecting my humanity.
