I don't feel personally attacked, just my arguments.
    

Isn't GW a mixture of girls that do it for the excitement (Exhibitionists), and/or to receive material things(gifts)? I'v just heard there are some camgirls there that do it in addition to being a camgirl. I see no problem with either of those reasons. As long as all parties consent i couldn't care less what people do. Nor do i think it's immoral to do such a thing. Personal freedom without getting judged is very important.   

  
You're right that being lonely is no excuse and that pitying them is just a way of excusing their actions. I would never feel pity for displaying that kind of behavior, but i understand now that just thinking that you are entitled without acting on it is also wrong.  
  
Edit: I understand about the checking for GW posts thing. It definitely belittles you as a person with opinions and ideas.
