I sometimes wonder if I have actually experienced catcalling and just not noticed. Am I oblivious? Do I just assume everyone is nice when maybe they aren't? Probably. I'm really glad I've never experienced overt sexism or sexual assault. The sexism I've experienced has been more general (e.g., growing up in a very religious setting, or getting small remarks, not really aimed at me). That said, stories of people going through this kind of thing on a regular basis are part of the reason I don't ever want to live in a "big" city (I've always lived in cities around 100k, and that is fine). 

OH, there was one time when I lived in China for study abroad that a man kissed me on the cheek after we were talking for a few minutes. It was the middle of the day, I had a friend with me, and the friendly woman who owned the restaurant we were standing in front of immediately took me inside and asked if I was alright. I thought it was funny even then, but it could have gone badly. 

The fact that I haven't experienced anything worse than that makes me really believe that sexual assault/harrassment/sexism in general is something that can be fixed. There are tons of good people.
