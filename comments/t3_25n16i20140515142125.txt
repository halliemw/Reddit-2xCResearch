I agree with your message of compassion towards people with mental illness, and the stigma against them and receiving help, and the difficulties they face in getting to that help. I'm about to get into grad school for clinical psychology so I am completely with you there. I deal with anxiety myself which I am trying to find a manageable level of before I go onto helping others. So I am completely, totally with you.

However, depression and anxiety are no excuses for his treatment of her. He does terrible things when he's angry just to "show her right", then refuses to even acknowledge he might be wrong or consider getting help. You are absolutely right, he does need help-- he ran blindly out of the car onto the highway at night just because he was upset she complained about work. He could have been struck by a car and killed. That *is* dangerous. I cannot trust someone who would do that and refuse to accept that is harmful behavior, dismiss his fiancee's utter terror, and refuse to go to therapy to help himself. And I am definitely concerned about what goes on inside the relationship that I don't hear-- I have watched him talk to her like she's a stupid child for years, what does he say to her when they're *not* in public and he's more comfortable? It doesn't matter how high the highs are in their relationship if the lows are this low. 

He still refuses therapy, even after this. He doesn't want to get "better." She can't save him. The only person she can save is herself. I don't want to feel hate and part of writing this post was me trying to release it. But he's destroying the life of someone I really care about, so it's hard. 

I'm really glad you've gotten the support you needed to get better, I know it's a very difficult process. I'm glad it's gotten easier for you and I wish you all the best.
