> It's not about "respecting their ownership", it's because they think they are much, much more likely to get their asses beat by a guy than a girl over that sort of harassment.

Thats it right there.  Its the same reason that guys just don't randomly insult other guys.  You never know when the guy you offended is a psycho, so the kinds of cowards who harass wont take that risk.  I mean thats why so much harassment comes from people in cars, because the threat of retaliatory violence is lessened by the mobility and protection of a vehicle.  Its not something silly like respect for someone else's ownership, I mean come on.
