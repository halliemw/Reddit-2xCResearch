Yup, nuclear is the way to go. My most current ex said he wanted to stay friends... It was basically his way of saying, "Hey, I know I hurt you by breaking off our engagement and all... But can you still hang around for me while I unload all of my emotional baggage onto you? You know, be there for me just like when we were dating except I can do whatever I want with whoever I want..."

Uh, fuck that.
