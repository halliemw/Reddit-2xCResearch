Yes, guys can post here..like me. But you are still anonymous. As far as I know you are making up this story. In case you're not, here's some information to help you.

1. You are fine. It doesn't take decades to grow them. You get a surge of hormones and it happens. 

2. Teens/adults are far more interested in their own bodies than yours. Just like you. You're not deformed! Maybe you are interesting to look at, but not car accident inducing. And as interesting as you think you are to everyone, no one finds you are interesting as you do. Remember, it will be a bad hair day for some of those people, and they will be too pre-occupied to deal with you. "Hope that girl doesn't see my ugly hair!"

3. Yes, you may/may not get more romantic interest towards you. Learn karate*.
4. Only you know how to talk to your mom. But you went to school. Your school taught you how to write a persuasive essay. You know what persuades your mom. Think of talking to her like a homework assignment. I can't offer you advise about this but this is what I would do. Put her in your shoes: Mom, what would you do if you kept growing, but don't particularly want bigger bras, but it hurts? WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

*Karate is how to act towards people, with romantic interest in you, in a way that is polite, concise, and to the point. Basically give them an answer - yes or no. Just be honest. It's a mental thing you're going to have to learn, as well as how to love yourself and deal with love/hate of other humans. I know it's hard to change. You're going to deal with a lot more changes in life. Try to enjoy it and stay cool.
