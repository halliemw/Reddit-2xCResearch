I don't really know what you're trying to prove by that article, but from what I see, it directly contradicts you.  The word "feminism" has a variety of meanings.  Her definition of feminism isn't any more or less valid than yours.  What you're doing is akin to saying that anyone who has a penis and testicles is a man, whether they identify that way or not.
