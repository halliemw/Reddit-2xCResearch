The problem with some of the studies is that the questions can be rather vague, and the researchers apply their own interpretations of what happened to decide that something is sexual violence.  

For example, the largest and most oft quoted study in this area asked respondents if they had ever: "Had sex with a man because he offered to give you alcohol," and if the respondents answered yes that was recorded as a rape.  Most damningly, about 3/4 of the women who were counted as rape victims in the study did not personally consider themselves rape victims.
