I was a very early-bloomer. I was the same age as your sister when I had to start wearing a training-bra! The best advice I can give you (and your mom, who's doing the talk) is just to NOT make anything about puberty sound mysterious or scary. Just lay it out in an open, comfortable conversation. I remember being terrified of starting my period because no one explained it well to me, and what I pictured it being like was horrifying. I didn't understand what was going on with me, and I was a nervous wreck during that time. I remember even thinking that I could get pregnant from sleeping near my friends brother at a sleepover! Just make sure that she has a good understanding of this stuff, and don't hold anything back or make it sound scary. The fact that you're her big sister and you've been through it should also help.
