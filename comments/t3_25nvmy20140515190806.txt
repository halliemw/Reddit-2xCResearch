You're not crazy. That happens.  

I have not been in this situation but generally speaking from dealing with cops, I think there are ones who are really decent people, and others who are just bad people, like you'll find with any people. There may be more bad people drawn to being police officers because of the power it gives them.

But if I were you, could she or you try to find different police officers to talk to?

There are really bad people in the police force. That's not made up. Just because they have a uniform and badge doesn't mean they're good people. It could just mean they worked the system to get in a position of power.

But in my experience there are also really decent honest cops who really want to help too, and you just hope they're not being coerced by a corrupt superior to go against what they think is right.

So, again, you're not crazy.
