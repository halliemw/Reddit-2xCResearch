>But we are. We are different because of sex and we are different because we are individuals

Psychological studies have indicated that most males and most females are much more similar than different in almost every measurable category (besides obvious things like what kinds of genitals they have). 

Whoever has told you that most members of the other sex are significantly different due to biological differences of sex was either lying or completely ignorant.

>So I understood why he was a bit overprotective or why he didn't let me stay out at all hours of night or why he didn't want me hanging around certain guys. I don't think it's sexist or misogynist at all. 

It's not sexist if he treated any brothers you have the same way or if he would have (if you don't have brothers). If they got very different treatment than you, it's sexist by definition.
