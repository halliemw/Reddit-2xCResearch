this! when i went dress shopping, most if not all the shops told me to keep in mind that dresses are nonrefundable, but i could exchange it as long as the tags were still on, it was in original condition, etc. i ended up getting one of the first ten dress at the first shop i went to so i didn't need to do all that research before i even put on a single dress, but i felt much better just knowing that i could change my mind if i wanted to. i was pretty rushed too - five month engagement.

also hell, as long as you like the dress it's okay. people - including you and your soon-to-be-married-partner - aren't going to be remembering the wedding for the dress as much as how happy the couple looked and how great the booze was ;) for everything else, including grass/dirt/wine stains galore and fuckups like my corset showing above my dress in a whole bunch of pictures because i lost too much weight after my last fitting TWO WEEKS EARLIER, there's photoshop. and for friends that won't shut up because 99% of it is jealousy getting the better of them, it's not their wedding and don't you forget it!

well i kind of lie. some people remembered my dress. but they're remembering the fact that it has two big pockets that i pulled all kinds of stuff out of (phone, a pack of tissues, inhaler, shout wipes, hair pins, a bandaid, a granola bar) more than anything else.

seriously though, i was having a mini I'm-fat-and-this-is-all-going-wrong-crisis right before the wedding, and i had to go back and look at pictures on offbeat bride and actually focus on anything but the big smiles and crinkled eyes and happy tears before i saw that everyone had scars and stretch marks, all kinds of bodies, all kinds of dresses/accessories, all kinds of styles of receptions, all kinds of EVERYTHING and more and I totally didn't see that until I was looking for it.

seriously, i remember more about spending time with friends/family than the dress that you don't even see much of in photos. don't sweat it. do what you want to do. you rock your dress.
