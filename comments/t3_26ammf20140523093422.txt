This is a big deal. 

Let me repeat that: This is a big deal.

I'm a special education teacher with experience working with students on the Autism Spectrum and with developmentally delayed students. I am currently working with some students on the spectrum. 

This sexual assault (it was sexual assault) needs to be taken seriously for both your well being and the man who assaulted you. What would have happened if you had (as you were well within your rights to do) used a self defense technique against the man? What would have happened if he had triggered you? You acted as a mature, compassionate, adult, but everybody this man interacts with will not do the same. Next time he might either go further or be seriously injured by someone defending themselves. 

When people who are not mentally culpable for their actions commit crimes those crimes still exist, it's just that punishment is deferred. Your institution is responsible for your your safety on campus and failing that someone is responsible for this man. I hope that your institution takes this with the seriousness it deserves; either limiting his exposure to other students by assigning him an (what we would call) Educational Assistant or removing him from campus completely. *His presence makes the campus unsafe for other students.* This is not acceptable. 

I think that if the school doesn't take action you would be well within your rights to file charges against the man or seek a restraining order. Your (as well as other students) safety comes before his right to an education. 

Edit: Something I forgot to mention. The staff at your institution need better training. That the supervisor even thought to try and brush this off is a sign that things are not in a good state.
