I think (and have seen that) someone can be anti-abortion and not judge a person who has one. That is what I was trying to say here, not refer to a term which hasn't been invented.


I am not saying that people are "just fine" with abortion being birth control. I am saying that with the predominant current attitude both to this sub and outside this sub, **the idea of abortion being used as birth control is become more acceptable, and that is dangerous from a health care perspective.** 

I have not once said that abortion is the only risky process involved in pregnancy or the field of fertility. I have already stated that contraceptives have side effects too. As does birth. 

But can we relly say that abortion is safer than birth? Not for the average, healthy woman. Another legitimate reason for abortion is the case of a medical condition that endangers the mother and/or child. For example, ectopic pregnancy is a case where abortion is safer than trying to continue the pregnancy (though in ectopic pregnancy the pregnancy usually does not continue and naturally aborts, but not always before causing the mother harm).


I hope most people WOULD agree that prevention is best. I just wish that we could promote this view as often and as effectively as the positive light of abortion is portrayed both in this sub and out.
