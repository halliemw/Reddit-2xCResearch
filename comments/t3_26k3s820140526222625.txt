>people who spout hate like this should not be ignored. 

My fiancé used to be way more the "avoider" type when it came to I guess I'd call "casual misogyny."  Awesome guy himself, but not the sort to insert politics or any other sensitive topic into every day conversation. Then recently I was sexually assaulted, in a hospital (I have uncontrolled epilepsy, I'm in ERs a lot), &amp;amp; the way I was treated by a a one ER nurse, one ER doctor &amp;amp; one cop pretty much changed his entire worldview. Not that he didn't get that in some aspects of life/society, women* have a quantifiable more difficult time if things, but he didn't *get it*.  After a few days, when we'd both calmed some he told me all of this. He told me he couldn't believe a)that any man felt I was his to do with whatever he pleased &amp;amp; b) that in 2014, a cop would ask me *what I was wearing*. (Answer: hospital gown). 

And  have say, seeing him able to encounter something new to his experience. not dismiss it or try to cram it to fit in your preconceived notions, then really examine some long held beliefs was...frankly it was kind of hot (I like 'em smart &amp;amp; introspective I guess). 

And now he speaks up at work when the guys are "just kiddin' man, it's just a joke" rapes comment. He's dressed down ER docs &amp;amp; just.  He was always amazing, but he's kind of my feminist hero now. Other than Kathleen Hannah. 

My fiancé stands up for all women &amp;amp; girls, loudly &amp;amp; proudly. We need more of these Patrick Stewart type guys *to speak to other men/boys.*  they sure as fuck aren't listening to us. 

Edit: I want to make clear that I think male victims of rape are very real & (totally based on personal guess) even less reported than women reporting their own assaults. No one asked me to add this, I just re-read it & I felt like especially considering the abhorrent crime of rape most definitely crosses genders, it was needless exclusionary.  Related: I'm high.
