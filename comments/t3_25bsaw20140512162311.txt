I did some counselling years ago, (Rogerian, person centred. everything else sucks hairy balls) and came around the the understanding that for me, depression was the pain. I used it to match the pain and anxiety that the world around me caused. and it is a coping "strategy". Assuming that you are not catatonic, you may be surviving better as a depressive than as an hysteric, for example. It may be evolutionary, a way to keep your head down when some situations are dangerous for the confident or happy. But I believe mostly the triggers these days are irrational. I am not sure it still helps. So understanding the source of the pain that you are trying to match or subsume with self harm, is likely going to help. I guess religion is a trigger too, it was probably for me. basically, you are not good enough. essentially bad. what a mind fuck.

tl:dr  Depression is pain.
