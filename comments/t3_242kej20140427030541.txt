Woah, So you and I are in very similar situations actually. In August, my boyfriend and I broke up upon which I moved solo into my own little studio. This is my first time living without roommates/ a mate... ever! 

So, I searched for similar threads and finally came across this great video: [http://youtu.be/k7X7sZzSXYs]
Which inspired me to re-explore what I like to do. It helped to reflect on what I enjoyed doing as a teenager, before college and before a string of boyfriends. I went back to painting (which I always felt embaressed to do in front of my "artist" ex) I listen to all sorts of music and dance around a lot. I'm putting effort into creating a beautiful space to live in. Other than that, I'm super busy at the moment with school and my internship but I make time to exercise because it's my personal anti-depressant. I also created a night routine of stretching, lighting incense and journaling. I have plans to buy a sewing machine and start working on projects in the summer... 

One last thing worth noting that I discovered. During my relationship, I would really only get "dressed up" for exciting dates and events with my boyfriend. One night, I realized that I hadn't really gotten dressed up for anything in a while... Why should I when I had no one in particular to impress right? (No boyfriend) Anyways, I decided to take myself on a "date" which was awesome! It was the first time in a while that I tried on different outfits/did my hair/ did my make-up. (my normal routine is very minimalist so when I do, it's sort of an occasion) Then I went out to an art gallery, met a bunch of people, went home alone. What am I saying? Don't wait for someone to take you out/ invite you out. Create your own occasions that are simply just about looking good *because it makes you feel good* and fill your free time with things that stimulate you!
