a jerk? no. a little selfish? maybe, but who isn't sometimes?  
i can't say that i understand the situation, but i do understand how dumb the dating scene can be, and how important it is to find someone you care about, even if you can't say that you love them just yet. you need to know, though, are you in this relationship to build something together or are you in it for the endless cuddles?  
if you are in it for the cuddles, then you can find that just about anywhere and you'd be better off dating.  
if you're in it because you truly want to invest (at least some of) your life with him, then you need to pick it up a bit. ask yourself what *you* can do to fix the problems you're having.  
if you're somewhere in between and not really sure, then i'd say the best rule is kindness. it results in a lot of thankless work and added stress to you, but if it helps him be less stressed, he will be more available for you.
