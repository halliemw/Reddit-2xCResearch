> hatred seems to outweigh support by a large margin

I will not debate that, after all, as I mentioned we may presume the portion of haters is large. I just hope we don't overgeneralize towards *everyone* who's new here since it's defaulted, because that would be unfair to whatever portion of newbies here wants to do good, learn, and be positive about this subreddit.
