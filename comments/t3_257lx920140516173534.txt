I have a Sckoon cup that I love due to it's softness. Highly recommended. 

I also have a rainbow cup. It seems to cause my vulva to become irritated for several days after. Not recommended.

The L.J. community others mention is awesome.

Both my cups came from amazon.

I use a little water-based lube when needed, and often wear a cloth panty-liner for added peace of mind.

And that was way more than I originally planned on writing.  :)
