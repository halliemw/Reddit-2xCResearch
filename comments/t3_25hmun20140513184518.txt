Mansplaining - A sexist term used by bigoted people to dismiss a person's opinions/arguments on the basis of the speaker's gender or sex. 

&nbsp;

Imagine if a political philosophy were to adopt the term "woman-splaining" as part of its core. That philosophy would be deemed sexist and bigoted for harboring such an ideology as to judge a person's argument based on the speakers sex or gender. Any political philosophy that adopts such terminology as mansplaining is equally a bigoted and sexist philosophy. Extremists use bigoted words like mansplaining as a strategy to shut down all opinions that are in opposition to theirs which comes from the opposite gender or sex.
