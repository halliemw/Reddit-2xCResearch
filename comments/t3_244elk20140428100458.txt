I was born with some funny looking labia, so they had a look inside to make sure it all looked ok. My dad opted for me to have cosmetic surgery when I was young, so they also had a speculum in there as part of the surgical procedure. When I was a teenager I found out that I did actually have internal deformities too, but when I was a baby they were too small to be noticed, so before I had more surgery down there before I even had sex. Then I had sex and had a bad reaction to the lube, so I had to get more surgery. Then all that mucking about caused my nerves to scar so I had yet more surgery to remove half my clitoris. All I can say is, Thank god I live in a society that is more women-positive than others.
