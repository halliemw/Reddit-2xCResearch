I left my PhD after 10 months because I knew it wasn't the right decision for me (this was about a year ago now). I spent a lot of time very anxiously considering it, but in the end I knew that if I hadn't enjoyed the first year I wouldn't have made it to the end without some severe mental health side effects, and I just felt it wasn't worth it. Mine was in Computer Science and once I came to the realisation that I didn't want to work in academia for the rest of my life, it simple wasn't worth going through all of that.

I'll happily answer any questions about my decision if anyone is wondering, I used to struggle a lot and feel like a quitter but I know for sure now that I have made the right decision for myself :) Not that I want to put other people off though, a lot of my friends completed their PhDs and are rightfully proud of that.
