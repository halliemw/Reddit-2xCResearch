I've been in 3 serious relationships.  Two asshole exes tried to push me into having threesomes, the latter  talked about "what if you caught me cheating" in a light and peppy manner, constantly. "Would you rather be the mistress who didn't have love and security, or my woman who had all of that but none of the sex and passoin?"  Weekly. I managed to catch him cheating multiple times. 

I thought it was just a "guy thing" until I met my current boyfriend. He would never in a million years even joke about sleeping with another woman. Ever. It's one of the most disrespectful things one can do in a serious relationship.
