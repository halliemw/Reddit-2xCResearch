I've had the Mirena for 2 years, and haven't suffered any ill side effects. My skin is clear and zero PMS, which was the complete opposite pre-Mirena. I had devastatingly heavy cycles for 15 years, so my doctor recommended a hormonal IUD to lighten things up. After 6 months of progressively lighter cycles, I stopped getting my period altogether. To go from changing a super plus every 45 minutes to nothing in a span of 6 months was completely life changing. Not to mention, no more PMDD controlling my shit and turning me into a fiery ball of sadness, rage, and exhaustion for 2-3 weeks out of every month. The levonorgestrel in the Mirena is in an extremely low dose absorbed directly into the uterus (only very small amounts are in your actual bloodstream), so I wouldn't let the hormonal aspect of it scare you away. Overall, I have been absolutely thrilled with mine. I feel like a complete person now that I'm not being burdened and controlled by a fucked up cycle.
