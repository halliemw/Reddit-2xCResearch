I have a bleeding disorder and have literally almost bled to death on my period before (like, in the ER with no pulse from blood loss).  The thing that works best for me is hormonal birth control, but I had to try several kinds before finding one that decreased bleeding without awful side effects.  My sister has the Mirena and that has helped her periods a lot.

If you have any other bleeding symptoms (bruising easily, bleeding at the dentist even if your gums are healthy, etc) you should consider getting referred to a hematologist and checked for Von Willebrand's Disease.  It's treatable and not a big deal for most people and worth knowing about in case you need surgery or have a bleeding emergency (car accident, etc).  Many women only find out they have it because they have really heavy periods.
