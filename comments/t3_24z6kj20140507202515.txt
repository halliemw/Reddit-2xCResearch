I saw the first article (and to be fair I didnt see what the fuss was about), this is the first time Ive seen the response article (the one thats dated yesterday).

I spend alot of time places and that bothers you?  The fact that some noted feminists have taken a hard stance against male victims of rape and my critique of that fact in spaces devoted to men and mens' rights does not diminish my discussion of this article and the ramifications of "required reading lists" for whole groups of people based on nothing but their skin color or gender.  In fact, believing those things does not even make me less of a feminist.

Im also wearing dirty socks if you want any additional laundry to air but I didnt really intend to discuss my dirty laundry so much as the article and its submission.
