Gay man here to tell you: of COURSE you have the right to be mad. You don't need anyone to validate your anger, have at it!!! Also, gender/orientation doesn't matter here: Friend A (of any gender/orientation) kisses the partner (of any gender/orientation) of Friend B (of any gender/orientation). Friend A gets to be pissed, because Friend A has been BETRAYED.
