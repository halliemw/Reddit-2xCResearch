Honestly, if you get a cat, his nose clogs up so he snores, and you can't sleep, it seems the best solution is to get rid of the cat in a responsible way, try to find someone who really wants it. It seems silly you have a cat when he's allergic. You know the solution you just don't want to face it. 
And he's offering you the solution as well, getting rid of the cat, he can't be on allergy medicine 24/7.
BUT, as a test maybe you can let someone have the cat for a month or so to see if he gets better? 

edit: And for other issues i think you need to write them down if you want advice....
