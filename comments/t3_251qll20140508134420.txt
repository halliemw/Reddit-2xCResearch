Hahaha. I was referencing the book [Who Moved My Cheese?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese), which contains a lot of words that mean "be aware of change, don't ignore or be in denial about change, learn new things and either adapt to change or find a new way of going about things if you cannot."

Edit: I accidentally deleted half a sentence before posting.
