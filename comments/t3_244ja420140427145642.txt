I finally (at age 26 after shaving for 10+ years) feel like I've got a routine down that works for me: 

I do my entire routine in the shower. Venus Embrace razors are great. They are expensive, but worth it. To extend it's life I dry it off completely after I shower and then store it in the medicine cabinet (don't just leave it in the shower wet, it will reduce the life of the blade - something to do with oxidation). I change mine once a week - I shave everywhere almost every day, but I have trichotillomania/dermatillomania/OCD so if I don't shave I go crazy with the tweezers and it ends poorly - you may be able to get 10+ days out of one razor head depending on how frequently you shave.

Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel is the best shaving cream/gel/whatever I've found so far. I apply copious amounts of mineral oil to the area I'm about to shave before the shave gel, shave, and then follow up with mineral oil after shaving. This has made my eczema-prone, very dry skin a lot happier than it usually is. I also apply a small amount of mineral oil to my armpits and bikini area after I shave, and it significantly reduces any razor burn or ingrown hair issues. 

After getting out of the shower, pat yourself dry with a towel and then moisturize copiously. I love the Body Shop's Olive Body Butter.
