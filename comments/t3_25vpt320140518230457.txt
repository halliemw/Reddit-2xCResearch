I just wanted to add that a bedtime routine of any kind can help you get to sleep faster because of your brain remembering what comes after! 

A sleep mask may also fall into your definition of "glamorous" and I just adore mine.

I save the whole "robe and vanity" thing for my mornings, but I really recommend it. It turns getting ready from a stressful thing you have to do, into a self pampering ritual that you get to enjoy and I find it a lot more relaxing than trying to put on eyeliner while leaning over a bathroom sink to get closer to the foggy mirror.
