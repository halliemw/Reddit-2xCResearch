Haha I was in precisely the same situation. I now take low ogestrel, it apparently has the same formulation as seasonique, but seasonique is higher because it's 3 month design is newer and all that. I take 3 packs of low ogestrel and skip the placebo week, then on the fourth pack I don't skip the placebo week. Has kept my endometriosis at bay for a few years now!
