I'm sorry you're hurting.  It is a hard, awful decision to make, and it's not made lightly, no matter what some people think.

I had an abortion at 19.  I loved my boyfriend very, very much, and I would have loved to have been able to continue the pregnancy then.  But at 19, we were both in university... our dreams would be shattered, our families devastated (his parents didn't like me).  I never once thought that it would be a good idea for us both to have a baby.  I'm sure we would not have lasted as a couple.  We were too young.

But more than 25 years later, I still think of him fondly, and wonder what could have been. 

 I had a child much later and that's when it really hit home to me how woefully unprepared I would have been, WE would have been, to have had a child at that time.
