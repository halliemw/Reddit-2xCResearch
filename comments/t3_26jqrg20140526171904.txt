Your experience is going to depend on whether or not it's a large high school or not.

If it's a larger school, speaking from experience here, don't be too overly worried about being well liked or being popular. There's usually going to be someone who is willing to be your friend. 

The idea that "no one does drugs" in high school is a blatant lie, but you still don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. The same goes for sex.

For the love of god, do your homework. Ask for help. Go after extra credit opportunities, because they will become scarce. Especially if you decide to take AP courses.

No matter how many hard classes I've taken each year, I've made it a point to get at least one class in my schedule I could completely blow off. It helps.

Do not worry about your clothes. Wear what's comfortable and what makes you feel good. The trope of a bitchy clique of girls who spend all day making fun of other girls for their clothes is pure fiction. 

If you end up failing at romantic endeavors in high school, don't freak out about it. I'm going into my senior year, and I know plenty of people who haven't had any kind of serious relationship. It's not an uncommon thing, don't let anyone make you think it is.
