I detest poop -shame! My wonderful (and also terrible) immigrant mother would always poop with the door wide open, and expect anyone within earshot to engage in conversation with her, whether or not we felt like bearing the oppressive olfactory barrage she would unleash. My American father learned to deal, if only because he loved her so very much. I think my loss of poo-shame came when some guy acted super weird about the one time I took a shit in his apartment (in the commode, not just..on the floor) and I realized he was a jerk and that I had to poop so if he couldn't deal then that was his problem, not mine.
