I had the EXACT situation for 7 months!!!!!!!!!!! We were best friends before moving in, but literally she made my life hell with constant negativity every. single. day. I tried so hard to invite her to positive things, I would offer her dinner, try to be the light in her darkness kind of thing, but it was all wrong, and nothing was ever good enough. It was emotional abuse for sure. I waited out my lease, moved out, and now I'm back to being happy again. Please, do whatever you can to get out. Look online to move in with new roommates, ask your landlord for an early release, or see what you can do about it. Emotional abuse is a pretty serious thing. 

It's not as easy as just talking to her, I know. And it's not as easy as just ignoring her, I know. Believe me. It's impossible. It's like living in a dark cloud/a very hostile environment you just can't ignore. What I did was I stayed out of the house as much as I could, picked up more jobs, stayed with friends and family...etc. Do what you can to keep yourself away from her until you can get out.
