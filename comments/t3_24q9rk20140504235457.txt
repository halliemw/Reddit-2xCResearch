Yeah, the person who wrote that article is definitely looking more into something that needs to be. Plenty of guys respond to being hit on the same way, and no one thinks twice about a deeper meaning in that. Besides, if someone hitting on me puts more value in rejecting him by saying I have a boyfriend rather than outright saying I'm not interested, then that's a problem with him. I don't feel like it's my or anyone else's job to teach that guy how to respect a woman and not treat her like property.
