There is nothing wrong with LDR if both people love each other.  I hate hearing that LDRs never work.  You need four things to have a successful LDR; love, honesty, communication, and trust.  Any relationship can be successful with those things.  Just because your SO is going on a long trip doesn’t mean you have it can’t work.  It will work if both of you want it to work.  Is it tough?  Yes.  But it can be wonderful too.  It can give you the opportunity to get to know yourself.  You can get to know them better.  And don’t under estimate the power of a hand written letter.
