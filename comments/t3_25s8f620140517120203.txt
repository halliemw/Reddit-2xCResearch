Am I the only one who thinks the dress actually is quite ugly? It's an odd fit for her shape and accentuated all the wrong parts. 

Also, black shoes with a floral dress? I mean, I'm all for dressing anyway you want but if you're a celebrity and going to am event where there will definitely be a discussion over who's wearing what... I mean come on, it looks odd, ill fitting and mismatched.
