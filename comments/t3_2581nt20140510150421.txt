I could have written this. I know exactly how you feel. I've wanted to be sterile since I was 10 and have always felt somewhat maligned with my female-ness. If you're looking into sterilization, the best advice I can give you is to be persistent. If your doctor would rather give you pitying looks and patronizing lectures than help you get the healthcare you need, **ask for a referral.** I can't stress this enough. S/he is obligated to refer you to someone who will help you. I asked for a referral from my former doctor and that's how I found a gynecologist who was willing to sterilize me at 21. (I couldn't/can't afford it, but it's good to know that there's at least a possibility)
