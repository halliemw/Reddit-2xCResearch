This happened to be a couple years ago. I was working through my grad program and was on student insurance, which meant that I had to go to the campus's medical center for everything, then be referred to a specialist if necessary. I went in to get a mole checked. It was weirdly shaped, growing, and two distinct colors. The doctor I saw at the campus medical center was completely dismissive ("I don't think it's anything" complete with some eye-rolling and heavy sighing). Still, he gave me the option of taking a tissue sample for a biopsy or having it removed completely. I told him I wanted it removed. He got in a huff about how he really wasn't expecting to have to do something like this today and he would have to see if any nurses were available to assist. He left the room for about 10 seconds, then came back in to add that I had a secret option #3: get a referral to a proper dermatologist. I took the referral. The dermatologist took one look at the mole and immediately told me we were removing it stat. When I went back to her to get the results from the biopsy, she basically told me that had I not had it removed, I would've had skin cancer within a year. All the more troublesome, the mole was on my breast, so if I had ignored it like the campus doctor thought I should, there a possibility I could be facing skin cancer that spreads into my breast. 

My uncle has a similar story with doctors ignoring his chest pain because the basic cardiac tests they performed came back okay. He wouldn't let it go, sought a second opinion and more advanced tests and it turns out he needed an emergency bypass. 

Lesson is: if you know in your gut that something is wrong, don't let a dismissive doctor cajole you into ignoring it.
