I did it. One day, after a bad breakup I came to this realization that I didn't want to be the person I was. I simply wanted to prove everyone wrong about me- that I was worth something. It's about taking that first step, know the person you are and take a step. For me, I have an addictive personality so I did it all at once. I quit smoking [started the patch] (3 pack a day smoker), stopped eating fast foot, soda, sugar, started at the gym, began weight waters [I've lost 70lbs), and started school all within a week. A year later I ran my first 1/2 marathon and 5 years later (this may), I will be graduating with a BFA with cum laude after barely graduating high school.

Simply, even without full blown motivation, the fact that you are thinking this way *is* a step. Go with it, make small changes. Try a schedule, try penalizing your actions if you don't complete what you want to. Laziness is something you can push through. Just gotta give yourself reason to. :-)
