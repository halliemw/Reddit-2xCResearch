Yeah everyone is so curious which made me worried because I was hoping someone here might have had a similar experience! Apparently not :S I took another 400mg of ibuprofen and I've been using the ice pack. The icepack feels absolutely wonderful but doesn't give any sustained relief. I will absolutely update after I see a doctor tomorrow. They open in 7 hours and I'm going to call immediately. Hopefully if someone's having a similar problem they might see this thread.

I'm so sorry about your yeast infection symptoms and I hope you're feeling better or feel better soon! :( damn vaginas. I love mine but not right now.
