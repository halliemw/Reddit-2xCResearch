And even when there's more serious issues than gendered toys, like... dude, I only heard about that issue because a *teenager* fought for like six years to bring it to light! Starting when she was 11! That's pretty darn cool of her to work so hard for something more important than, I don't know, who she goes to prom with. When I was 11, I barely had the attention span to watch TV. Hell, when I was 17 I barely had that.

Should we disparage what she did because she wasn't campaigning for some other, more globally important issue?
