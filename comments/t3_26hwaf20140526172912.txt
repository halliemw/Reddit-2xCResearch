I had a similar experience about two or three years ago. It had me very nervous, and I had a regular ultrasound, a 3D ultrasound done and a mammogram. All came back saying that it was just dense breast tissue. 

In talking with my mom, I found out that it's something that both she and my grandmother had as well. Dense breasts run in our family I guess. It's more common than we realize, for sure. The one thing the mammogram tech told me was that a tumor will usually lead to puckering on the skin or discolouration. 

Good luck! Don't panic. :)
