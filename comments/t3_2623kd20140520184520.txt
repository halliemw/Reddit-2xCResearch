Cheer up , it is not you. 

From the other side of the equation it might be you are one of the first interns they had and like the by-stander effect, they think some one *else* will take you on, so until then  no body wants to interact with the intern because then they become "keeper of the intern".  If I befriend the intern , then they will start to come to me with their problems . If the intern is a problem them people will complain to me about them. If the intern is a real problem then I could be blamed for their fuck ups. So ignore the intern because they will be gone in two months anyway. 

The previous 17 interns they had may have been bad they just roll their eyes and think , another one. 

Third , there might be stuff that you are not privy to , office politics, derailed projects, problems with upper management that turns and office toxic. So it becomes a job that they just show up too 5 days a week , and being nice to the intern is not apart of that job.
