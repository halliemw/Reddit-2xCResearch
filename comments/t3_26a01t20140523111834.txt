There are two groups that need to know this is happening, the school administration, and the parents of the bullies.   They both need to be informed, with evidence, and told in no uncertain terms that if it continues, or worse, if it escalates, that they will now be held responsible...criminally and civilly, for any and all damages.


Tell the school that they need to monitor the situation, that they need to catch the bullying and aggression in the act, and they need to emphatically end it.   A 13 year old with a permanent record of bullying in their school record will have extra challenges, but will also hopefully overcome the sociopathic behavior with that incentive.


The parents of the bullies need to know that they will not be able to hide behind ignorance.   They need to monitor and restrict their children, and get them the help they need to be useful members of their peer group, or else they (the parents) will suffer the consequences.


This can be handled with tact, and hopefully will eradicate the problem.   However, in all likelihood (as I put on my pessimist cap) this will only speed up the inevitable ugly confrontation with school officials, parents, and police.


I do wish your sister the best.  This is a rough part of adolescence, and can cause so much damage to how both parties grow and interact with other humans.
