In short: I am involved in programming, gaming, hacking, etc. communities. Some members of these communities have become redpillers, or redpillers have joined the community. They start spewing typical redpill hate. The community in general responds to this hate either by showing them why they're wrong or just telling them to get out. This is becoming more common. Is there anything I can do?
