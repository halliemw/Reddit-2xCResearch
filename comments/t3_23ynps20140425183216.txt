That's adorable! He seems to be such a thoughtful individual (the two colors of ink me me think that he wrote the initial message, then worried that he hadn't written an adjective that properly described you, and gone back to fix it). When I was his age, I only had a vague understanding of what being trans* meant and entailed, and I certainly wouldn't have known how to be considerate of someone who was going through the process. High five him for me. :)

Did you know him before this? Or was he a stranger?
