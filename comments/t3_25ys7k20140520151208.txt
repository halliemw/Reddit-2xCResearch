Been through both. All things being equal, I'd go surgical: its more controlled, over quickly, and the pain is momentary. But the waiting. 2 weeks is so long under those circumstances! So if you go medical, know that the pain is pretty intense and can last a few hours, and it can be a little scary to see that much bloody tissue come out of you at once. Its true that medical fails at a slightly higher rate, but that usually just means that you go back the next day and re-dose (at least thats what I did), without more charges or exams or anything. You will probably want an extra day for the pill effects to wear off (cramping, etc) whereas the surgical procedure leaves you free to resume your life the next day. All the beset to you either way.
