I'm sorry... But real talk:

You REALLY want prom. He REALLY wants nationals. The only way this is good for anyone is for you to go to prom alone, with friends, or with another date, and for him to go to nationals. It is not fair to expect him to give up something that he has worked all year towards for a dance. I'm sorry, but that's the reality of it. 

If he stayed home for prom, he'd resent you for it anyway. So, try to find a way to still go and enjoy yourself.
