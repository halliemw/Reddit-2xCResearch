That was my exact experience too. I know it is a great show, I love how most scenes just cut right through all of the social BS and get to the point, but I just can't watch it for more than an episode or two in a row. Maybe because the show closely mirrors my nightmares and makes me extremely uncomfortable.

This morning I had a nightmare that I completely forgot an old friend and even though I saw photos of us hanging out together as adults, I could not remember him. The uneasiness that sprung from my old friend trying to be nostalgic about the fun times we had together while I could not even remember his name, is exactly how I feel when watching Louie.
