Thank you! I will not rely on a phone app anymore. And I plan on getting an IUD in the near future. I do feel relaxed now. And I understand my plan of action, which helps. I will not think about it, and retest in a few days. I do have some breast soreness, which is a good PMS symptom of mine, so perhaps it will start in a day or two.
