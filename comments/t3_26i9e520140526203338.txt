Wow, this sounds VERY similar to what I experienced. Props to you for getting your story out there as well! Doesn't it feel great? I am terribly sorry that your family wasn't more supportive:( If it weren't for my parents,  I don't know how I would have survived it. I also went through a very rough patch of low self-esteem and self destruction. I hope you continue to heal and learn to love yourself as much as you deserve to be loved.
