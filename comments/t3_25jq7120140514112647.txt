I wanted to post a bit more of the experience reference and disclaimer from the original essay since I felt it was important, if anyone's interested: 
 "First, basic background and points of reference. I'm a guy in his thirties in the USA. Obviously our situations and experiences in western cultures and developed countries differ greatly from other places, and as such the question isn't relevant to some societies. The issue has more to do with the theory of and usage of language itself than real world realities of gender bias. Perhaps this has been addressed several times before, if so my apologies. I'm relatively new to Reddit in general, and definitely new to XX, so I'm possibly just (fashionably?) late to the party! I hold no pretenses that these are original thoughts."
