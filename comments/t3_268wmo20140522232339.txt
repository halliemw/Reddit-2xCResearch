Hi. I've successfully and unsuccessfully performed in that department and I think I can help! 

There are a number of ways you can enjoy oral with your partner.

1. Communication: You should tell him what you like and don't like. Let him know how you climax on your own. 
2. The build up: Make sure he takes it slow. Even for women who are sure-fire-jizzers - it's more pleasurable to slowly build up to direct clit play. Have him kiss your chest and move slowly down to your thighs for a few minutes. Tell him to move slowly towards the goal. This intensifies sensation, puts your mind to rest, and feels fucking awesome. I think a few minutes on the labia is a good way to tease a girl. 

Also! A little penetration and pressure from a stable and still finger on the opening of your vagina, well under your clit but not inside the canal - can go a LONG way to intensifying the sensation you feel. He doesn't need to move it around, but a little movement in tandem with his tongue is super-effective. 
 
3. Relax. In my experience, I've come to the conclusion that a woman's orgasm is often about relaxation, and not excitement. If you're stuck in your head trying to pull the trigger - you won't. Just sit back and relax. Rub your pelvis into his jaw a little when he does something you like but let it ride apart from that. 

I hope I helped! 

p.s - Practice lots :)
