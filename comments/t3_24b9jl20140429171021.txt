If you're dealing with side effects like that, you should check to see if you're taking combo pills - meaning pills that have both synthetic progesterone *and* estrogen in them.  I am estrogen intolerant, as are many other women.  That's why combo pills/methods were so awful for me.  

Progesterone-only is the only thing that works for me, and it's great.  No issues, no side effects.  I can't do an IUD or the arm implant for a couple of reasons, but I can do the depo shot and multiple kinds of mini pills.  I was at wit's end, though, and ready to just say fuck it and not take any birth control. 

So if the side effects are getting worse, check into that.  There are *tons* of progesterone-only methods and hormone free methods that are available.  

You should not have to suffer in order to have effective contraception!  =)
