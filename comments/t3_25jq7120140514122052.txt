Bloke here:  Can confirm, aggressive feminism actually puts me off the idea, and I've no interest in conversation with such people.  The problem is that the less aggressive feminists go unnoticed because they don't shout as loudly (which itself is a good thing).

Generally speaking, I find the concept of feminism, as I encounter it through whatever media comes across as being about female superiority (not often extremely so, but whether or not that's what it is *supposed* to be, that's often how it *actually* comes across).  Even the term **fem**inist is one sided.  Again, right or wrong, that is how it comes across.  Talk, instead, about equality .... that's what I'm interested in.
