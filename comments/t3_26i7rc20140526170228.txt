Wrong wrong wrong.

I have only seen 2 notably rude women on this entire site.  I meet new trolls that I cannot believe can be other than male (and often if they are not banned they make that explicit in great detail).

"They"  - meaning the one person noted as the OP, or the trolls that were IP banned, or the trolls that are still here masquerading.  A guy who stalked me still comments on this sub.
