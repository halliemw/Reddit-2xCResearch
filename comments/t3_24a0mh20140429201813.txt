There is a very big difference between someone who takes regular doses of long-acting opioids and someone who is receiving acute opioid treatment.  Chronic pain patients develop a tolerance to side effects, which include sedation and respiratory depression.  Assuming she wasn't on opioids before this incident, she wouldn't have had time to build a tolerance to these symptoms.  All this depends on dosage, though, and any other medications she may have been taking.
