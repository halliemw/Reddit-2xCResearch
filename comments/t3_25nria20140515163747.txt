Given all the shit that happens to oppress women in the world, I find it hard to sympathize with the plight of *any* model. To me, it's just such a first world problem that you may not be able to be a model because the fashion industry doesn't like your body type. I get why people make an issue out of it - because they want girls seeing their body type represented in media so they don't think they're ugly - but I think our society puts too much emphasis on "everyone can be pretty" and not enough on "who gives a fuck if you're pretty because that's not where your value lies."
