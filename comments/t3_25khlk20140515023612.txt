yeah i'm curious about that as well. i've always regarded myself as a very strong girl, and while i'm aware of my physical strength limitations, i have rarely encountered something that only a man could do (this doesn't include items that need two people, like lifting a dresser for example).

what i **have** come to realize, though, is that cis-males are a lot stronger than i previously thought. i was once play-fighting with my ex, and at one point he had me pinned down and no matter how hard i tried, *i just couldn't get him off me*, or move, for that matter.

that was kinda mindblowing.
