You look beautiful! I think that dress in very pretty, interesting and surprising (with the diagonal lines and the sweet ruffles emerging at the bottom), and very romantic. 
If you decide to keep it, and I hope you will - wow! - maybe it can be okay that your friend has a different opinion of it. I hope she will be supportive of you, and appreciate your radiant joy on the day, and appreciate how beautiful you ARE, regardless of what dress you wear, or what she personally thinks of it.
Also I agree with u/AnnaCovey, finding 'The One' dress need not be a big worry. A) It's about your love for your husband/wife, and sharing that love with friends and family, and B) frankly, girl, with that figure you would look gorgeous in a burlap sack cinched with a rope.
