Agreed that it isn't necessarily a gendered issue in a general context, but in this specific context of the university sexual assualt it's something that is more a women's issue.  Having said that  I am sure that there are men who are sexually assaulted on university campuses, and that they have the exact same issue, but the sheer numbers I would imagine are probably far lower.

The thing is that the judge and the court are (supposed to be) objective and without bias.  The administration of a university is not, and that seems to be one of the larger points of the article.
