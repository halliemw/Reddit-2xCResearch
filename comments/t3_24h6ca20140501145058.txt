I have Mirena. I'm a very forgetful person, so I wanted a method with no room for human error. I was initially worried about the hormones since I've never been on any type of hormonal birth control, but the copper IUD often makes your periods worse and mine is bad enough already. I've been very happy with my choice so far, and I'm baby-free for several more years (when I'm done with pharmacy school, incidentally).

You could also cross-post this to /r/birthcontrol if you haven't already.
