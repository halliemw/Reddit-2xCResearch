> For the fear that you don't have a normal vagina, you should have see a therapist years ago, but you didn't so here you are.

Hmm.

>They're definitely going to want to do a swab, but it doesn't necessarily have to be inside you vagina. If it's a severe yeast infection, they can typically find yeast on your vulva, between the lips. 

That all sounds rather unpleasant. I'm still kind of hoping I can somehow get it to go away before I see the doctor and not have to bring it up. Do GPs do the whole swabby thing? Or would that only be if I went to a gynaecologist?

> And then get some therapy to deal with this phobia of yours, because it's clearly preventing you from living your life and that's no good.

I dunno, I think without the whole thrush thing I could have lived my life pretty okay without having to really deal with it.
