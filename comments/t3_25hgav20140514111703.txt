If you read the follow-up to the original post (written by the girl who was forced to leave prom), they address this.  The boyfriend requests that people not make it about race.  They believe that no one was even aware they were together, since they arrived in a group and hadn't really started dancing before the issue was brought up.

It is possible that race played a role, but given a lack of evidence and the admission that the dads requested she leave because she was "dance provocatively" and her dress was too short, this seems to be more of a problem with women's (girls') sexuality).
