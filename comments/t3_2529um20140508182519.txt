I can't control the voting on this sub, but I'm happy to have a discussion with you. 

I feel the guy was cruel not by immediately recognizing that he wasn't attracted to her or admitting it, but having sex with her (multiple times) in the interim. I could sort of understand having sex once in hopes that sexual chemistry would overcome this, but he didn't. For someone who purported to "love her", I find snapping at her and cringing when she touched him and not even saying this was an issue into she asked him to be a pretty mean way of dealing with *his* feelings. If he really felt that deceived (and the OP said he wasn't entirely honest with his photos either), why have sex with her repeated? Isn't that leading someone on? If he hoped that he would find more chemistry than was immediately apparent, why didn't he just spend some more time with her before jumping into sex? If she had showed up and he immediately said he wasn't attracted, do you think she would have had a two year complex about the whole event? I doubt it. 

I don't think his feelings were invalid, but I think the way he handled them was very poor.
