If you shut down and flatlined ( aka froze/become non-responsive) he should have noticed something was wrong. A tense, uncomfortable body literally *feels* different. There is a degree of feedback that you give with sounds, hand touches, muscle tone and face expression that would change seriously during a scary flashback. 

IMO being aware and vigilant of the person you have sex with is a responsibility integral to the act.
