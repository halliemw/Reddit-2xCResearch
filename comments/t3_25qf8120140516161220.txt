Gender-queer defines your.. "situation" ? or your "Orientation" Both with two different definitions.

Do you really think including the fact that your "purity" and "virginity" had been taken away from you is the right... hmm, wording? Both words are not physical possessions. I don't know why people choose to describe it in that manner. I am most definitely not downgrading your "approach to purity, saving yourself for marriage etc etc" But... it isn't realistic to think that saving your ahem.. "purity" for someone or until marriage is going to give you much benefit in the future. Honestly, because I enjoy sex and it's something to be explored, I like my 'developed tastes.' Yes, you have trauma from your childhood, but until when does that become a valid explanation for your lack of self-awareness? Is it worth starting off every story as a victim and ending it without any resolution for your own health and happiness? You were violated, forced to have sex with roomates and abused as a kid.. Maybe it's time to become strong, fill yourself with worth and validation. Putting your "loss of innocence/purity" on a pedestal may also keep you from forgiving the ones who did you wrong. Pride yourself in being a survivor and not someone who dwells on the "what ifs, and I wished.." Do onto others, as you had hoped those would have done onto you.
