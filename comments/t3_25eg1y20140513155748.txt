It could also be related to the birth control, I've heard of a girl who was on birth control who had abnormal non-period related bleedings every now and then, pain in the abdomen and vaginal region (which peaked during sex), and other related smaller symptoms. When she went of birth control and had a spiral (or intra utrine device) implanted, the problems faded in the following weeks. Maybe if you suggest that to the gynaecologist they'll find a few new ideas to solve this? Good luck!!
