back pocket! I can't do the boob thing, mine get reaaally sweaty and will likely destroy the phone.

If i don't have pockets, then I just carry it. I don't really like purses. Actually recently I got one of those "clutch" wallets in a straight black, and it has RF-blocking features so people can't scan your card (as an EE, I feel really bad saying that because it's probably not true, but I like to pretend it makes a difference)
