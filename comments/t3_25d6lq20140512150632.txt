To be blunt, marriage at its core is one party, and a contract. Sometimes there's not even a party, but parties are something you can have regardless and at any time. While contracts are rarely romantic, mostly practical or something to have just in case.

You can make your marriage be whatever you want it to be, but so can you make the relationship without the marriage. It's up to you what difference it makes, outside of legalities.
