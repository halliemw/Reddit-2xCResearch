I work in a bridal shop and have a little advice on how to save on your dress/other attire.

1) shop now. You want it to happen in two months? Buy something off the rack! Ask them if they have any discontinued or old stock and tell them a number. Don't just say "cheap." Cheap means different things to different people.

2) If you're planning on having bridesmaids, you will save a ton of money by choosing a colour or colour palette and letting them choose their own dresses. Again, ask for discontinued styles and old stock. Ask if there's a discount for buying your bridal gown and your bridesmaid's dresses at the same store.

3) Go small. Find a shop where you'll be able to speak with or work with the owner. The more pomp a store has, the more likely you will pay more. 

4) Try to find a dress that fits. Don't buy anything too small, and if it needs to be taken in, consider the amount of work that will go into it. Will beading or lace need to be removed and restitched? What is the fabric like? Chiffon, silk, lace, and charmeuse is more difficult to work with than taffeta or satin. Do they have a seamstress in store or one that they would recommend? Get a quote on alterations before buying a dress that needs them. It's more expensive than you may think.

5) Considering the time of year, have a look at prom gowns. Many stores will be having blow out sales to make room for next season's stock. If you're not picky, you can find some beautiful prom gowns that will pass as a wedding gown for less than half the price. 

6)Don't bother ordering online with the amount of time you have. You have a 50/50 chance that it will be perfect and beautiful, but on the flip side it could be made like garbage. Alterations on online dresses can be astronomical even if it is fixable. You may be stuck with lost money and end up needing to buy a second dress. 

Good luck! And congratulations. I love seeing people who are madly in love wanting to get married.
