I just came off them this year after 7 years of combination pills.  I feel much better - I lost weight, my boobs shrunk, and I feel like I have more interest in sex.  I had very rough periods as a teenager so I was worried about that but it's gone pretty well.  I do have a bit more PMS now but not too bad.

I tried the paraguard IUD and is went very badly, rejected quickly and it was horribly painful from the moment they inserted it.  However, I do know people who have it and like it.  I'm planning on getting Mirena soon - it's supposed to be easier to tolerate and a much lower dose of hormones.
