Ah, so if I sell a T-shirt that says "girls can't be real programmers," and I have it on my website & displayed prominently, but I claim that I can also make a shirt (and I even have one copy somewhere) that says "boys can't be real programmers," then it's not sexist?  I don't think it works that way.
