Oh gosh, reading this is pretty much looking at my relationship right now. I stopped taking my birth control a few weeks ago and my sex drive bounced back up! It was crazy, I started wanting to have sex and being able to with out any assistance. 

My doctor is sending me a new type of BC to see if that will help with anything. Try talking to yours to see what they say.
