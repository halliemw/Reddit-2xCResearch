I like the word "equity" better than "equality" or "egalitarian." Equity is providing everyone with what they need to succeed; equality is giving everyone the same regardless of their needs. It would be equal to give both men and women no work breaks to express milk when they have a baby at home. It's equitable to give women the time they need to meet this need for their child (and [their own body too](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17297388)).

There are times for equality... yes, all fire fighters need to meet the same physical requirements in terms of lifting and endurance; that's just part of the job, and a smaller segment of the female population will be able to achieve it than their male peers. But overall, what we want is *equity*; that is, to not be punished for being female.
