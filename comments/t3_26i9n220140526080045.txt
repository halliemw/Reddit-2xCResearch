Well, if she didn't pay you for all the hours you were there, or even if you get a flat rate of pay, but were led believe you were only supposed to work a few hours and was basically forced to work overtime, then you're probably legally entitled to get that money (but I'm certainly no lawyer). But yeah, it's up to you to decide if that'd be worth it. At the very least, a lawsuit might teach her a lesson, but CPS will probably be a big enough lesson in itself.
