I'm the complete opposite in that I've always known I wanted children, I'm pretty sure that I'm fertile, especially considering the way women in my family seem to be able to have healthy children pretty late in life, and I've never been pregnant. But based on what I've heard from friends who are or have been pregnant, pregnancy brain and new mommy brain can be pretty powerful. I'll never understand people who throw pitchforks because other people's ideas are different from their own. I would be lighting the torches and sharpening my pitchfork if you were out there harassing scared pregnant women, but for changing your stance on abortion even if that takes it farther from my own? Not at all. It's an opinion, and you're entitled to have your very own opinion that is nothing like mine.
