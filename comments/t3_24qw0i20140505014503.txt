If you have a New York and Co near by, that might also be a place to check. I love them forever for having 12, 14 and 16 pants in the same place (I tend to bounce between these sizes depending on cut, and many stores I'm too big for the largest size or two small for the smallest) and they're fairly affordable. I'd make that a third stop after thrift store and JCP.
