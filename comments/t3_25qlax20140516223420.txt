I could not stand the stem. It would not stop jabbing my lady bits, so I cut it off completely and it made it a lot more comfortable. I also found it was easier to break the seal because I was grabbing the cup itself right away instead of plunging myself trying to tug on the stem. 

I love it, I regret not trying it when I first heard about it a few years ago.
