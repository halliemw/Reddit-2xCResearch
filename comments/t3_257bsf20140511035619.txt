I hate that you're getting downvoted. I've got a plan b pill in my junk drawer because I'm forgetful and have often forgotten to take my pill. It's a backup so I don't have to stop by the store on my way to work, or worry about taking it on time, it's right there in my kitchen. It's a good idea to have at least one on hand, just in case.
