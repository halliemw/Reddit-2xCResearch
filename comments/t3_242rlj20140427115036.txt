Congratulations! During the job search process, do you get to see your letters of rec? I'm currently a PhD student and all of the letters of rec I've needed have always been submitted directly to the insitution (grad school admissions, fellowships, etc.), so I'm not sure how I would even find out if one of the letters was not as strong as it could be.
