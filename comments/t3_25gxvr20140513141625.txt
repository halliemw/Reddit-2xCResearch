Check out movies (anime) by Miyazaki.  Nausicaa, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Laputa Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle and Kiki's Delivery Service all deal with "strong female characters".  What makes this more interesting is that Japanese culture is notoriously patriarchic, so I guess you could consider Miyazaki as a bit of a cultural visionary as well.
