You are literally trying to muddy the waters by making an already absurd example even more absurd. 

So not only do we now have a woman who is going home with a guy she flirted with, initiated sex and then changes her mind and says no, but now she is a Hollywood actress level faker of pretending to want it, the other guy is a decent bloke who even asks her if anything is wrong, and she convincingly gives a Richard the III level speech to the guy to convince him everything is fine, all while being afraid and in pain and terrified. Yeah, sure, this is the issue with grey areas of consent. This contrived example. 

I'm sorry but what is your point? That because someone can in absurdis fake non verbal consent, the lack of verbal consent or dissent it is automatically consent? So basically if we go to bed, and I don't say no verbally, then no matter what happens afterwards it is not rape? So that unless I say no, the default is yes? 

Let's make it clear here. Rape is not an accident done by people who are merely careless. It's not the semen equivalent of dropping a slice of buttered bread on the floor. It is your responsibility as a party to sex to check for enthusiastic, and positive consent. If you do not, it is your **choice** to do so. You don't rape by mistake the same way you do not cheat by mistake. There is always a choice on what you willingly do to the other person and. Series of choices narrowing down the options available further. And with that choice of actually doing something to someone's body comes the responsibility to check for how that is received. 

If you are an intimidating bloke, you should be aware you are intimidating and how that can affect people. If I am a 6'4 300 pound guy, I will damn sure not hold a stranger chick in the corner of a room alone and start undressing her. Unless she has been begging me to do so and we had an ongoing and mutual thing. I would approach her in a way that she cannot feel pressured whatsoever. Fuck it, I'd allow her to make a step. Even if by doing so I might miss out on some willing but shy sex, that is a small price to pay then to risk having even one chick feel forced to play along because I physically dominate her. Again, with power comes responsibility. And if it is in your power to dominate someone so they submit from coersion it ks your duty to manage that power. 

Just look at dogs who instinctively do this. An older or bigger dog will not play threateningly with a smaller dog/puppy. If the tiny dog gets actually scared and not play scared they back off. If a dog can do it so can a human. 


But let's be serious here. I can't say I have met accidental bullies, nor accidental rapists. Rapists who coerce know exactly what they are doing. If you are a guy who wants sex at all costs, you **will** make consent blurry by trying to make your date drink. You **will** hit o. A person you know, with whom you are intangled in a common friends group. Because everyone hates standing out or embarassing themselves by having their friends know every dirty intimate detail. You **will** manipulate verbally or ask repeatedly after several noes until the person submits (common psychological effect when badgered with the same question). You will physically prevent someone from moving but avoid actual harm. You will prey on people who are shy, unassertive and likely to fold under pressure.

Why? Because this gets you sex. Coherced sex but in the eyes of the people around you both went in the room, and she didn't fight back. Or said yes eventually. Or was too drunk to handle a psychological manipulation. Because there won't be physical trauma, just psychological. And because people will immediately focus on the victim's responsibilities and not the accused. Did she say no? Did she say no clearly enough? Did she fight back? Did she ask for a condom? Did she report right away? Was she crying when reporting? Why was she pretending to be happy at the party afterwards of ot wasn't just regret sex. 


So no, let's not muddy the waters and put all weight on the potential victims' shoulders. It is everybody's responsibility to make sure consent is there. If they are weird, if they are shy, if you are socially awkward or too drunk to tell - **err on the side of the fucking caution and either make sure or stop.**
