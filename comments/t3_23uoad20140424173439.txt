No, your race example would not be ok, even if there was a white version. Because that shirt is saying I don't like people of category [x] and race [y]. They are two separate concepts, making one of those concepts race makes it racist.

There is no such term as "fanperson", fanboy/girl is a singular concept and you cannot remove gender from it while keeping the main point intact.
