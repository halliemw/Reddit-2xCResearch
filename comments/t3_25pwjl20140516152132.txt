Is it particularly the "men" in the word that bothers you? Because the meaning of the word is "men who try to explain women's perspectives for them", which is a pretty specific subset of men, not just a broad anti-male sentiment. I guess in a way, it's similar to "feminazi" which has "fem" in the name and refers to a subset of women.
