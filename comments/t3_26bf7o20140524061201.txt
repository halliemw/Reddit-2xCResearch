While /u/HouseReddit makes good points, simply doing bicep and tricep exercises would be a waste of your time. If you don't want to get heavy into fitness, which is understandable, doing the big compound lifts/workouts will be the best way to get the look you want.

You can workout every single muscle in your body with only 6 lifts.

* Bench Press
* Row/Bent-Over Row
* Pull Up
* Shoulder Press
* Squat
* Deadlift
