That's none of their fucking business! If you're married, just met a guy/girl, 1 week pregnant, whatever else, it's none of their business! Hope the new prospect works out better and just ignore the other one (which is easy for me to say)!

About children, I'm sooo with you on that part! I don't want children, ever. It's easier for me though, as a guy, I think, as society don't seem to judge me that hard.
