Jealousy isn't quite the right concept, but absolutely correct that it is a power thing. I got bullied in grade 1 because my singing made the bully cry. He perceived that as "weakening" him and as challenging his power over the school. I got bullied in high school by a girl who was very talented but who didn't have nearly the amount of fame I had by just breathing. She couldn't accept her own value so had to try to tear me down. (Big fish in small pond in high school.) I got bullied after high school by a man who refused to believe I had a right to decide I didn't want him when nobody else had ever refused. My body my life my decision = threat to his self-image.

In all those cases, the other person, the bully, decided that me existing, going after my own goals that had NOTHING to do with them, somehow took away their power. All of them were incredibly insecure people who tried to use intimidation and harassment to try to make themselves feel as if they had power over me which they will never have. It was to restore their personal sense of power, or to have power over other people by bullying me and encouraging others to bully me.
