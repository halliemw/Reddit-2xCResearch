As much as we'd all like that (researchers too), its just not realistic. The alternative technologies available just arent good enough yet. Sure, we have cell culture, but those cells in dishes dont often resemble anything like natural tissues, let alone whole systems. Its difficult enough to make something that behaves even slightly like skin, let alone anything vastly more complex. 

The technology will get there eventually,  and when it does, animal research will drop in favour of this. Animals are incredibly expensive, exceptionally highly regualted in every single aspect and not great models - but its the best option we have right now in research and drug development.
