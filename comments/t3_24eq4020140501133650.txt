I have also never been pregnant, but my empathy is with you! My advice, to be taken with a grain of salt, is to do what *you* think is best for the health of you and your baby, and to not worry about judgment. You'll likely face judgment about your parenting after the birth of your child, so now is a good time to practice not giving a crap! Good luck and good health to you and your family!
