I know you didn't come here looking for relationship advice, but if he's going to argue with you about using condoms when you're BC isn't in effect, or really, ever, he doesn't really sound mature enough to be having sex. It's your health and body and he should respect it.

I know I don't know your relationship and I'm just a person on the internet, but it's something to think about. Good luck with everything!
