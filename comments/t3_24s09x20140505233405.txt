I think the questions Lisak asked to identify his rapists present a problem for the study.  They seem to be defining rape pretty narrowly.  Physical force, threats of violence, or taking advantage of someone who is completely paralyzed with alcohol.

What about psychological coercion that stops short of threats?  What about someone who's drunk, but not in a complete stupor?  What about someone who freezes up and never tries to resist?  No force or threats would be necessary in that situation, so it wouldn't be considered rape under the study.

The study seems to have shown that the most violent and clear-cut rapes were the result of deliberate and serial predators, which is hardly surprising.  The issue is that less forcible forms of rape were not accounted for at all, and we have no idea who's perpetrating those forms of rape or why.  So it's a bit premature to say "It's all just predators."

EDIT: To be fair to Lisak, he seems to have tailored his questions to identify rapes that would be clearly in violation of the law.  Many US States do require force or threat of force in order for sex to be considered rape.  "Coercion" is a good deal more slippery and generally isn't illegal unless it contains unlawful threats of some kind.  Nagging and guilt-tripping isn't legally considered rape, but it is considered sexual assault on most college campuses as they use a much broader definition.  So this study is a good start, but there are many more questions to be answered.
