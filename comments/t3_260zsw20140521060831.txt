I will use [this](http://skywalker.cochise.edu/wellerr/mingem/gemtl/turquoise/6turquoise-rincon85.jpg) as an analogy.

**Question: What is the color of those beads?**

Imagine if the word "turquoise" had never been invented. Imagine that you see it as green, and that he sees it as blue. When it comes time for both of you to explain this color to someone else, what do you say?

This is what I hold as the core issue here: it's not about the color, or in this case, your beliefs per se. It's about the *how*, the *why*, the *when* -- basically, the history and thought processes that enable each of you to hold the beliefs that you hold. 

What type of person do you want your child to be? What qualities? How will the child think about the world in a way that is fair to both the child and others? Etc. etc.

THAT is what you teach your children.

P.S. Like all other relationship and parenting issues, this is an ongoing conversation that will continue developing over the years.
