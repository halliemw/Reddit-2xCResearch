That's hardly fair.  They do more than acknowledge my existence. One is extremely needy and wants constant attention.  He's always in my lap or on my back or draped across my shoulders.  The other prefers to make me acknowledge *her* existence, mostly by deliberately annoying the crap out of me.  

But they both greet me at the door when I come home from work.  Existence acknowledged and appreciated!  (Immediately followed by food demanded.)
