The gift-giving thing sounds like it could just be low self-esteem or uncertainty on her behalf. I know it's hard to understand, but for people with low self-esteem and things like that, you can be told something a million times, but if you don't actually believe it, those doubts will stay there. It just sucks really. Maybe it's more that she is waiting until she is ready? I don't know. Maybe a little bit of patience is needed with her. 

Yeah, that's hard. I mean the most you can do is just really clearly explain your feelings, and to have her explain hers back, and both of you to just try to understand. Like, because of how different you both are, one of you is going to have to compromise. Either you will have to accept what she's like and not expect her to initiate things like that, or she will have to except that that's what you want from her, and for her to do that every time. I agree that it would be better if she did it, because it clearly affects you quite a lot more. I just think you should try to communicate with her as much as possible, because the more you both present your points of view and that you both need to make small compromises and efforts to understand things for your friendship, the better things will be.
