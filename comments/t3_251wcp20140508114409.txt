> Or people who disagree with these views of women anyway.

Firstly, women are not a monolithic block. People in this subreddit pretend like center left, moderate, and conservative women don't exist. The women of Reddit are especially guilty of marginalizing center left, moderate, and conservative opinions of women. Secondly, I disagree with making this subreddit a default because it is a cop-out. This whole attempt to appeal to women is condescending, as if we are little children. Reddit is about getting "down and dirty" and not taking everything personally. This is another cop-out like making pink pens because it says that we women are incapable of keeping up with the boys and thus we need special treatment. I don't need special treatment, I am not a child or a delicate flower. I can get down and dirty with the best of them. I hate the message that this subreddit is sending because it is saying that we women are weak and will always need to have our hands held, that we need special treatment to get by.
