Wow, really great information, thanks. My gyno only wanted me to use the steroid cream for two weeks straight and just spot check after because she was worried about skin thinning. 

But as a PSA to everyone: don't use coconut oil as a lubricant. It **will** give you bv. According to OhMegan (really awesome sexologist), the oil overwhelms your bodies ability to flush it out and upsets the balance of bacteria. And I did manage to get bv from it.
