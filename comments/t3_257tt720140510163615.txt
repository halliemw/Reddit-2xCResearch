agree with bebeschtroumph.  somebody close had clear paps, hpv test negative... thought it was a fibroid... cancer.  pap was clear several weeks before surgery found it right in the cervix.  if you have any abnormal bleeding or pain don't let them ignore you.  most, but not all cervical cancers are hpv related.  stage 2 ~ 65% survival, stage 3 less than 40% survival.
