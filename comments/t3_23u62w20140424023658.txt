In the UK that would be totally normal. We don't tend to get routine visits, we only go to the doctor if we have a reason. At 25 we start getting smear tests, so you would be due one of those now. It is really important and I think you should read up about them, but obviously it is your choice and no one can force you to go. If you search this subreddit you'll find loads of posts about people being terrified, but also plenty about how it was no big deal at all, even if they were absolutely dreading it beforehand. Of course, you have other reasons to be scared, but maybe at least try and find a doctor you're comfortable with and see what they can do to reassure you. Also, if you've had any kind of unprotected sex you should get an STI test, for the safety of both yourself and your partner.
