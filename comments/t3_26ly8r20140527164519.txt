> To those now planning to get/carry a knife: PRACTICE WITH IT. Open and close it a hundred times with each hand, and you won't fumble when you need it most.

The same goes for pepper spray as well, depending on the system you have. A lot of systems have a few safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge (much like a gun), so if you want it to be useful when you need it, you should practice until it's muscle memory. Also make sure to keep it somewhere accessible - pepper spray is useless if you have to spend 3 minutes searching the bottom of your giant purse looking for it. The pepper spray I have has a clip you can use to attach it to your belt or purse.
