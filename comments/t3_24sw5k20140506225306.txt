I know that feel. Trust me. The very best piece of advice/wisdom is what my sister always tells me after a break up. It hurts. It really fucking hurts but tomorrow you will wake up and it will hurt a little less and the day after that it will hurt a little less again. One day you will wake up and it's not going to hurt any more. Just keep breathing and living through it.
