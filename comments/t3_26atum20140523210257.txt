Yikes. That's scary. I always want to think I'd stand up for myself, and I know I should because I have the same rights and deserve respect like everyone else, but it's hard! I'm reading The Gift of Fear by Gavin deBecker (I like it, but I have some critiques) and he talks about how some violent men (it's very heterocentric) will target women who are hesitant and won't say no. I think it's problematic to state it in a way that puts the onus to avoid violence on the potential victim, but I always think about that now when I feel like I may need to stand up for myself.
