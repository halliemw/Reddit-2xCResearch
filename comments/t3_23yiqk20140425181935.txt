This isn't "playing games," it's basic human psychology that every individual should be aware of. People can't chase or desire what is readily available, and this has nothing to do with compatibility. OP said she feels comfortable and can be herself around him, so I don't see incompatibility issues mentioned. You don't miss someone that is next to you every day, and this is the same reason you fall in love with the crush that doesn't see you. I need time away from my SO, and they need time away from me. After a short (or long) separation we are much more loving toward one another. Don't smother the guy and he will enjoy your company. 

Also, just tell the guy everything you put in this post. Maybe he is just being a guy and isn't interpreting your signals well. Communication is a cornerstone in a healthy relationship, and talking to him will help much more than asking the internet for advice.
