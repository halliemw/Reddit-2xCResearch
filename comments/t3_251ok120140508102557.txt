I was never a user here, but I've become interested in what has been happening to the sub since it's been defaulted. I really feel for you 2XC crowd, this seemed like a really nice sub for women to come and help eachother/just have a laugh. Now? It's like it's just been tossed to the wolves. I really hope, for your sake, that it gets taken off the default list.
