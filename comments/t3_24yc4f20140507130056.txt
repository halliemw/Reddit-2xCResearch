Although this video shows a very intimate situation that I wouldn't post on the internet myself, I think that the fact that so many people are scandalized by her "lack of guilt" is exactly the point she is trying to make. Abortions have been demonized and portrayed as extremely painful and degrading, and they are not. She doesn't feel guilty because she's not doing anything wrong----and the fact that people can't seem to wrap their heads around it is what has made this video go viral. I personally am way more scandalized by shows like "Teen Mom" airing episodes of girls who decided not to get an abortion giving birth.
