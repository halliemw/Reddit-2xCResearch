The co-worker stated: "I don't like girls with short hair". I'm not sure what else you can take from this encounter? He is either saying, he no longer likes her personality due to short hair or, and the most likely, he does not find short attractive and therefore will no longer view OP as attractive. 

Op's message clearly shows that she took the message of short hair = unattractive. It seems very clear cut to me. Op's co worker could of said a number of things, but instead decided to focus on a negative physical aspect. Even without the 'you will no longer be attractive', it's pretty rude thing to say to someone.
