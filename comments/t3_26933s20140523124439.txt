Software developer here with 6 years professional experience.  I work in a company where there are 2 female developers among 40 (and 1 female DBA among about 5).  I mostly get the positive kind of sexism (oh how cool, a female dev!  like i'm in a zoo or something), which is just as bad but hard to complain about.  

The worst part for me is how I don't really fit in anywhere at my office.  I don't fit in with the devs because I'm not 'one of the guys' and I don't fit in with the women at my office because I'm 'one of the nerds'.  

The women on my business team were talking about makeup the other day and I tried to chime in by asking for recommendations on a contouring and highlighting product because I was looking for a replacement.  They kind of blew me off, but restarted the convo as soon as I went back to my desk.  They ask me for recipes all the time, but then started a supper club at work and didn't include me.  *shrug*
