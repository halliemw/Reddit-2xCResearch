>When I said, "Haha, really?" he was rude and told me to take it as a compliment. I'm about to turn 26! That isn't a compliment.

I'm short too and when I'm not wearing make-up I look a lot younger than I am, so I understand the annoyance... but you were being just as rude as he was (and honestly it doesn't sound like he was that rude). Cashiers are required by law to ask for IDs for anyone that they may remotely think is underage-- some stores require them to ask for IDs for everyone that looks below the age of 30! I'm sure he doesn't want to ask for your ID any more than you want to give it, but he could be fired if he doesn't. So just let him do his job without making him feel bad for doing something that he has to do and probably gets shit for all the time.
