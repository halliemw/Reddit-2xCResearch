Sadly I have had a somewhat similar experience with a redditor and unwanted touches. 
Whether he was drunk or not doesn't detract from the slimyness of both out experiences. 

In my case I continued to go to the reddit meet-ups regardless of him coming or not but I'm not one to be shy about showing my disapproval of him in my attitude and how I talked about him to others.

Confront it, letting one slightly slimy bloke ruin your fledgling social life isn't the best idea IMHO. If you feel comfortable still going out with the new group do, just if you're going to talk to him about it pick your time & place tactfully.

If you have any other lady friends in that group maybe give them a friendly heads up as to what he may or may not get up to.

Sorry you had to go through that :( <3
