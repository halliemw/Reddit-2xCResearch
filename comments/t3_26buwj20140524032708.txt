I have. Like I said, I'm not looking for anyone and there's no one I already know that I have any interest in. And it's not like I have the confidence to approach guys or they ever approach me either.


The problem with getting help this summer is that I'm only here for another 5 weeks, then I'm with my parents for about 8 weeks, then back here. So there isn't much time. People said that counselling can make you feel worse to begin with. But here we only get 6 sessions. I'm feeling worse in a different way to begin with. Too begin with I was feeling crappy because of all the memories we brought back up without tackling them. Now I'm feeling crappy because nothing she has said has helped and can't give me any advice. And infact, what she's said has made me more scared of the things I was already worried about.

I do get enough sleep these days, except when my neighbours have parties.
