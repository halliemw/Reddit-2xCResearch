I'm happening to reply to you but I've seen this all over this thread:

Because sometimes, that's what you do when you care about someone. Because sometimes, you disagree with their decision or choice, but you acknowledge that this person - who clearly matters to you - needs support more than they need your judgment. And you shut up and you hold their hand and you bite your tongue and you be a better person than you want to be. 

I would expect that from a good friend or a long-term partner or a close family member. Friends who have kids before they are ready: I shut up, get them something off the registry, and try to be happy for them. Friends who keep going back to an asshole: I shut up, am supportive during every break up, and ready to be there when they finally are done and need help.

That doesn't mean you are silent every time. It just means sometimes, you decide the other person's happiness or at least calmness is worth more than you spouting an opinion.
