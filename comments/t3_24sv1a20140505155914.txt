Geez, it's breaking my heart to read this, because I know what it's like.

For different reasons I've had to stray away from some friends over the past few years and like you, I'm in my mid/late 20's. It gets more difficult as you get older because people become set in their social circles. My way of combating this is stepping outside of my comfort zone. I joined a community garden in my neighborhood, looked into a bicycling group, and have done some fashion shows for an acquaintance that is turning into a friend. I've met a lot of new people because of it. Basically, I threw myself into activities that **I** enjoy, and found like minded people through those activities. 

I think perhaps you may be able to salvage some of the relationships from this group. If you've got one or two people that you feel a real connection with, ask them to hang out one on one. Explain that you aren't judging them for their actions, but it's just not your scene any more and that you want to maintain a friendship with them. If they really care for you, they will make time for you away from the group.
