I don't understand your logic here. A woman who wears the hijab will be wearing it when she needs to be identified. If hair is as important as you say it is when identifying someone, wouldn't you want the hair (or head covering) to resemble what she will be wearing when she must be identified? If a change in hairstyle makes  someone so difficult to recognize, wouldn't a change from hair to a covered head make it difficult as well?
