Actually, I practised that very move with some large and physically more powerful people than me. It *does* work. 

The thing is, you have to go against instinct and step closer to your attacker to get the leverage needed. 

Now, I should also mention, the main purpose of breaking those grips is so that you can run the hell away towards help/safety. If you find yourself unable to do that, be it in an abusive relationship or with someone who *is* that much stronger than you.... 

Your best chance for survival *then* becomes going along with everything and trying to establish some rapport with your attacker unless/until you have a chance to call out for help when you know there are people present.
