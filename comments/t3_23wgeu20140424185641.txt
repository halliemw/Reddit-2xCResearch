Alcohol consumption does not absolve you of responsibility. It's not an excuse for fetishizing or objectifying someone. It's probably understandable if a tipsy person isn't as eloquent as Obama giving a well-rehearsed speech. It's easy to say things without thinking them all the way through when you're sleepy and drunk.

I also googled broken wing, and everything that came up was related to [this song by martina mcbride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgjTO5eAbZY), which seems very sympathetic to women suffering from abuse, even hopeful, etc:

>And with a broken wing  
She still sings  
She keeps an eye on the sky  
With a broken wing  
She carries her dreams  
Man you ought to see her fly  

You say yourself "I also feel like my past has made me a pretty cool person to be around" - cool people to be around and confident people are often attractive people. I feel like there's a very real possibility that he found that sexy, and not the fact that you've suffered abuse etc.

Obviously, you're completely in your right to feel uncomfortable and want to break up with him. But, to me at least, it seems worth a discussion about what he really meant by that.
