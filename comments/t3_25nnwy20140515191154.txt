It's actually way less painful than the area near the labia and clitoris in my personal experience! The pain is only the moment your hair is being ripped out of the follicles, I have never had pain or soreness after. You'll be good to sit/drive/poop in no time! I said this previously, but taking a couple of painkillers before helps tremendously!
