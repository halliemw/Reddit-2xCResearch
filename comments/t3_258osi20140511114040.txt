i lost my mum in march this year, i'm 22 and because of her illness that had been going on for years, i didn't get to do with her all the things we planned but the worst part is not having her to come home to, i even miss when she'd fall asleep on the sofa at 11am because she'd been up so early to take her tablets, and i'd just watch tv with her next to me, its the worse thing anyone ever has to go to, and life really doesnt seem worth living now the person i was trying so hard for isn't here
