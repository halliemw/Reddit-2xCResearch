Seconded. I have a special needs child, and while she's only 6, she's fully aware when she's doing something that she's not supposed to. The problem I run into is that she doesn't have a clue as to why she's not supposed to do something, and "because we say so" is a piss poor reason that most everyone has difficulty with. Consequences are a decent stand in for complex moral reasoning.
