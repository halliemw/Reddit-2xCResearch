My two cents regarding book choice: I think it would be a bad idea to put hard limits on what kinds of books are eligible, be it based on author or genre or content. I think what would make this a 2x book club, first and foremost, is that it is filled with people of similar mindsets. If those people agree on a book to read, simply because they are interested in it, then that should be enough. The nature of it being a 2x group of people means that the book will most likely and typically be read from a feminist stance, which is a valid and interesting reading of any book, no matter the content.

Personally, I think feminist or gendered readings of "non-feminist" media is often more interesting than that of "femisist" media. One of my favorite scholarly articles that I read in college was a feminist reading of the Aliens movies. Nurturing mother vs devouring mother and all that. I'm reading Gulliver's Travels now, and in the most recent chapter the author started dropping bombs about how this other society is "different but totally not better because I'm totally not judging totally guys" than his European upbringing because the chamber maids and nannies in this culture are forbidden from gossip and whatnot, under penalty of death if I remember correctly, and this makes the women of their culture as cautious of what they say as the men are. These things pop up in the strangest of places, and if you put an artificial limit on what books are allowed then you can miss out on some noteworthy things. 

I think having a certain percentage of women authors might be appropriate, but having a hard and fast rule across the board will probably be more stifling than anything. Everyone will want or not want to read a book for their own reasons, and will voice their opinions accordingly.
