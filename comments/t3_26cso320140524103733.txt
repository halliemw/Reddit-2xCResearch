i both agree and disagree. they are experiencing budding sexuality, but its not like it is completely foreign to them. both girls and boys often start masturbating at very young ages (not all, but many) they just don't call it masturbation. go ask any daycare worker or just look for early childhood masturbation on the internet. 
i wouldn't expect a 13 year old to understand the nuances of the differences in pre puberty masturbation and post puberty masturbation. i wouldn't expect them to know the difference of post puberty sexual actions and pre puberty playing doctor. 
you and i can understand the difference, but we are much older and have a lot more life experience. to expect a 13 year old to have an adult perspective is kind of dumb in my book. especially when so many parents shame their children for early childhood masturbation and tell them that it is wrong. it may be hard for a 13 year old to know the difference between this being wrong, and sexual playing with a younger person being wrong, and sex being wrong. all they really know is that sexual things have to be hidden from their parents, because their parents say that touching yourself is wrong. 

i would blame the parents more than the children in a case like this. these things happen because adults can't be mature enough to teach their children the differences of these things before they occur. and the way many adults approach childhood sexuality doesn't help children understand, instead it teaches them that sexuality is something to hide from adults.
