If you read this,I believe it solve's your problem? Have everyone walkout when he comes-in,you have the right to a mentally safe work environment,now if for some reason your making excuse's too "have your cake, & eat it to. As if this is a "politically correct" environment were theres topic's are freely discussed,then you'll "metaphorically" be the one too fall on the sword,otherwise I believe your bright enough to stand-up for your civil rights,too not be exposed to another's violent humor,take a stand,or deal with it. Because this seems to be something you've grown accustomed too,& want others too fight this fight for you,you didn't get this far in life by being passive aggressive I'ma imagining otherwise you wouldn't be appealing for advice now,only you,& your co-workers know the depth of this problem,so assert your voice in "whats best for business", & be the leader,take ownership for your disgust,or deal with it,& trust me I'm being as polite as I can,this wouldn't be acceptable too you outside of work it sounds,why aren't you more assertive about have a decent work environment,is only something you know?... Hope this helps motivate you?
