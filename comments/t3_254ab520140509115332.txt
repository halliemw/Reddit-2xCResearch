Like other commenters have said, there are plenty of other forms of birth control besides the pill. 

However, I'll just relay my experience with the pill. I've been on it for nearly ten years now and I love it. When I was a young teenager, and before I got on the pill, I had horrible periods and pms like nobody's business. All that stopped when I got on the pill. My periods were shorter and less heavy, and my pms-induced mood swings became nonexistent. 

I never experienced any weight gain and it cleared up my teenage acne. Nowadays, my periods last about three days and even the Lite tampons are too high absorbency. It's awesome. Obviously, this is just my experience and YMMV. 

That said, I think it's the responsibility of every sexually active woman that doesn't want kids to protect herself from unwanted pregnancy. Birth control fails and condoms can break, but by using both of those methods you are much safer from unwanted pregnancies. 

If you're worried about your family finding your pills, I hope they know (and if not, you can inform them) that women take birth control for other reasons than to just prevent pregnancy. Not to mention the fact that you are an adult fully capable of making decisions about your body. 

Anyway, good luck! I know lots of other ladies here have provided you with some good information to consider. I hope you'll do some research and are able to come to a solution that works for you. 

Edited to add: if you come to conclusion that birth control isn't for you, don't feel pressured by your boyfriend to do something you feel is wrong for you. However, also understand that your boyfriend is trying to be responsible and if he doesn't feel comfortable having sex without you being on some form of birth control in addition to condom use, that is his choice as well. If you two can't reach a compromise on this, you're likely incompatible in the long term.
