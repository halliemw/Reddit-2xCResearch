Her mom and dad are not the best parents in the world. Luckily, she has a good head on her shoulders, but she had a 16-year-old boyfriend before she turned 14. He takes her out to places with his other 16-year-old friends-- concerts and such. He seems like a good kid, but he is thoroughly 16, which is alarming when she turned 14 only in March and he'll be 17 later this year.  She is exposed to a lot, but she doesn't do drugs and doesn't cut and I think she's still a virgin, at least a PIV one.  Anyway, it's something that she appreciates about being tall, and your daughter may, too, quickly.
