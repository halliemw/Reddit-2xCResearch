Ok here's the thing. She may not want to involve the police but it is the ONLY real proof you can bring to court or request a restraining order with. Everything must be documented , or it's often considered made-up if there is no proof. Who needs that when she is finally desperately reaching out for help while her life is in danger?  There has to be some sort of progression or something on record before she gets to that point. 

I strongly advise that she follow the things that a woman can do, as warning to men on [THE LIST](http://forum.dadsdivorce.com/viewtopic.php?t=13374) and follow the rest of the advice with resolve.

Edit PS:  Saying that you are not intelligent is the only dumb thing you said! Don't do that!
