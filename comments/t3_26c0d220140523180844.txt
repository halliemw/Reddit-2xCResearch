I think this is normal. Its unfortunate that you've felt horribly about it for so long, but I think knowing that it is normal should help you get passed it. I'm no expert on the laws, but you were both very young children. I would say it is not molestation. This happened to me as well, with a cousin and a friend. I never felt ashamed for it. It was just a memory that popped into my head later in life and I kind of just laughed about it. 
I saw it as only young children being curious.
