One of the guys my husband used to work with was imprisoned for molesting his 8 year old granddaughter. One of his other coworkers said, (I shit you not) "I can sympathize with [coworker 1], men get urges."   
Earlier this year Coworker 2 was imprisoned on 3 felony rape charges.   

It's absolutely ridiculous what some people can justify given enough moral flexibility.
