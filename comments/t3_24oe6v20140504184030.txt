We're very lucky -- our housekeeper does the grocery shopping and cooking (except for Sunday). She cooks very well; we eat a lot of fresh foods, generally healthy; she bakes amazing cookies (although we try to keep that limited, since they're too tasty not to eat!). 

I have to confess, though, that we really miss the States, and we're planning on moving back in a few years. Part of it is the climate (tropics), but most is the culture; we live in Singapore, and it's really sterile.
