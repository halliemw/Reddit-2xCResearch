Is she blowing you off on hanging out or important wedding things?  Has she been supportive and helpful otherwise?  Does she have many responsibilities between now and the wedding?  If she's generally a good bridesmaid, I wouldn't kick her out.  Taking too much time off work is a legitimate concern, and you should be able to forgive her for that.  Her world can't revolve around your wedding.  If she's flaking on important bridesmaid duties, you should talk to her about that, and not mention the bridal shower.
