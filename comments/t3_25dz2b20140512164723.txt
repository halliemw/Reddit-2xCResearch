Staring so heavily for three months or so to the point I wanted to scrub my skin if I even saw him. Then he found out I was legal (I look way younger than my age) and asked to marry me. I was too inexperienced to know how much of a red flag all that was but wanted to say no immediately. It didn't end well, he's a creep and will always be a creep.
