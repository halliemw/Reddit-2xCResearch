It's like that for me too. The sadness I felt was so all encompassing, I felt like it made up every fiber of my body and soul. There were times when I was so tired from crying that I would feel numb, but I would say that sadness was the characteristic feature of my depression. I say "was" because it's currently under control with medication. I can't believe I lived for 25 years afraid to take medication for my depression. I finally decided to take meds because I was seriously considering suicide, and that terrified me more than meds did.
