There really isn't a "risk" associated with formula (at least in first world countries where we have access to clean water). Rather there are more "advantages" to only feeding breast milk. Studies say breast feeding can help the baby avoid certain allergies and boost their immune systems; for moms, it can help with weight loss and some studies say breast feeding can help prevent developing breast cancer later in life.

But really, formula fed babies are no less healthy than breast fed babies.
