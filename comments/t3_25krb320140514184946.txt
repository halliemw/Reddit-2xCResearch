This story could be my own. I had a B cup by the 5th grade and felt horribly uncomfortable with my body. I remember grown men hitting on me when I was in Junior High, which was horribly inappropriate, especially as I had the body of a woman but the face of a child. I never looked my age. People assumed I was several years younger than I was, but men always looked at my body as if it consented. Innocent interactions were always perceived as me "asking for it". I didn't even know what "it" was.
