My boyfriend and I are in a similar situation, we're just still waiting on being able to afford the larger wedding we both want. We've agreed on a four month gap in which he'll to propose. I know he's already planned how he's going to do it. I'm not in a huge rush, but life is short, older family members die, and I want as many people to be involved in the big day as possible.
