Is she in treatment for the disorder?  Is she remorseful about these behaviors and seeing a therapist regularly to work on it?  I don't mean to be flip, but I would strongly suggest that no one marry anyone who has a mental illness *that they are not taking seriously.*  You'll need to define for yourself whether she is taking it seriously or not. 

A proposal brings up all sorts of stressful emotions which can cause people to backslide into poor behaviors -- i.e. she may be acting out a bit because of this -- but life is full of events that provoke stressful emotions.  You do NOT want to feel responsible for her emotions or be afraid of provoking her for the rest of your lives.  *She* needs to be on top of this.  (Same goes for anything you might need to work on -- we all have something.)
