Hi! I have also been living in Japan and I've been on lunabell for eight months. I made sure to ask my doctor and he assured me that it was a contraceptive, and I would not have to use any other forms of birth control while on it. I haven't had any pregnancy scares, and I've been on the dot regular since I started taking them, although I'm aware that's anecdotal evidence.
