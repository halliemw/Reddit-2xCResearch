There was a running joke that they couldn't figure out a good title for me because "Mom" wasn't a business title...  not so funny now!

It's an at-will state, so my contract is pretty cut and dried.  I kept a list of dates and incidents in which racist or sexist, or otherwise inappropriate, comments were made by management about staff or in general.  I witnessed and received a lot, but haven't thought about it much.
