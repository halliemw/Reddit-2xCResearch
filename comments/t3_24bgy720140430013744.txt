Looking into it too much. From what I gather you said "I want to go". The say "You're not going. It's a strip club, Joe is going.". I'm not really getting the vibe that you aren't going because you're a woman, but rather you just aren't going. It might be implied but it isn't concrete based on your OP.

Even if this was sexism(it isn't) this isn't worth fighting. It isn't a grand stand with a high stakes morale principle. It's a nudie bar. Everyone in this subreddit just always assumes the worst based on the tiniest little bit of information the OP gives.

This is not sexism.
