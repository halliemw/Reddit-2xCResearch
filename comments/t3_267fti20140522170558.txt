Are you trying to suggest that I'm arguing that all women should wear hijabs? I'm not. I'm arguing that some women like to. 

Social standards are unfair (sometimes) when they don't apply the same way to different people. But I'm not talking about social rules. I'm talking about individual choices made by individual people-- choices that don't affect anyone but themselves.

You're acting like I argued that women should wear hijabs. What I'm arguing is that there is nothing wrong with an individual woman choosing to wear one because she likes it.
