I got mine put in on Valentines Day (...I know) and experienced about a week of decent bleeding (assumed it was my period). After that, I had the muddy brown spotting you mentioned for about a month- kind of on and off but mostly on. 

During my second month it was mostly gone and I began being sexually active again and found I had some watery red spotting after sex. This lasted for the next few weeks whenever I had sex.

During the initial week of bleeding I had fairly bad cramps (but not as bad as before the IUD, which is why I made the switch in the first place- hoping to end my periods and horrid cramping). No cramping or other symptoms during the spotting or ever since. 

Now on month 3 I have had no bleeding or spotting and can hopefully safely say my periods are gone!
