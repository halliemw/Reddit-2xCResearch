> The idea that all drunken sex is rape is a straw man.

To an extent you are correct.  Drunk sex is not rape if neither participant says it is rape.  If you go out drinking with your husband, come home, and have sex like any other Friday night, it is highly unlikely that either party will feel that they have been raped.

But the part that isn't a straw man is that any drunk sex *could be* rape.  That's where the problem lies.  Any drunk person who has sex can make a claim that they were raped when they were drunk and unaware of what was happening.  The default position - especially amongst subscribers to this subreddit - is to simply take that statement at face value and provide comfort for the alleged victim.

In fact, even *questioning* whether the event was actually a rape or not is taboo and gets labeled as "victim blaming"  Nevermind that there is no blaming going on, but rather just an attempt to gather information.  Nevermind that the accuser may have been a participant and not a victim.  No victim?  No blaming?  Doesn't matter:  STOP BLAMING THE VICTIM!
