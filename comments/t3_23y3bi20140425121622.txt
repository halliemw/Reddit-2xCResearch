A photographer I've learned a lot of portraiture technique from, Peter Hurley, makes a comment about this in one of his training videos, while going over headshots with a client: Have you ever seen the arrow in the Fedex logo?

If your answer is 'what arrow?' go take a look.

The point he makes is that we look at ourselves, every day. We have a catalog of our flaws, and whether we want to or not, society tells us in a variety of ways whats 'good' or 'bad' and we compare ourselves to it, consciously or unconsciously. Many of the things we're self conscious about or dislike, most people don't notice, or don't even care about. Confidence is more attractice than anything else, poise and grace will get my attention faster than a 'thigh gap' or a boob job.  It's like people getting depressed when they see someone's awesome 'Facebook life' and don't realize they're looking at a high light reel. Once you get past that, you're suddenly way ahead of the game, and you'd be amazed how much those little insecurities add up to control your life.

I love your comment that it's about finding peace with ourselves, since a lot of people spend way too much time trying to be.. everyone else.
