From a *female* perspective, this is not always a great option. Guys that don't take the hint like this also tend to escalate physically. Not necessarily violence, but threatening - leaning in so they tower over you, touching or grabbing, blocking escape routes.  

I am a short person, and this kind of stuff is **terrifying**. Even with guys that I trust, being cornered or having my movements restricted in any way gets me panicky (even if they're doing it unintentionally!).
