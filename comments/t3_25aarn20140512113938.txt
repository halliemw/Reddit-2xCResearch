If she wants me to go down on her but has a giant bush, then it's both of our problem. It's not complicated. I wouldn't expect a woman to really enjoy pushing her face against mine if I had a giant, sweaty bushy beard. 

It's really simple. If you cloak the subject in a manufactured context of indignant female rejection of oppressive gender dynamics, you can get bent. If you view it in a simpler context of gender-neutral "What would be the most pleasant to have my face pressed against?", it gets much easier to assess. I want my wife to enjoy going down on me, so I keep myself trimmed to optimize her experience. I keep my private parts closely trimmed and my face clean shaven. It isn't because I have to, it's because I want her to enjoy her experience as much as possible.
