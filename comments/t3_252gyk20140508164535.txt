The info that came with the subpoena said the defense would be allowed to ask me questions, but I've clarified with the DA and she says that won't be the case here. I also got a better idea of what questions she'll be asking and it all sounds pretty straightfoward - and just to be sure, I'm practicing my answers with my cat (dubious legal background but great moral support).
