Well, I don't think you're perverts. It's not something that I'm into, but lots of people are - and it's not even particularly out there, in terms of sexual things that people enjoy outside of the norm. 

It's sad that your friend said something to you that clearly upset you, and I don't know if she was joking or not, but if my friend told me that both her and her boyfriend enjoyed doing that then I wouldn't really care either way. You're not hurting anyone, you're both consenting adults (I assume) and so I really don't see why it would be a problem.
