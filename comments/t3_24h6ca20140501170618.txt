I picked the pill because the generic I get is $9 a month. I'd love to get an IUD because it lasts longer and is more effective, but I definitely can't afford it. No patches/Nuva ring because cost. Also, it's really easy for me to get into routine (I know this isn't the case for a lot of people), so I've never missed a pill. 

For the first 3 months I was on the pill, I cried. A lot. I started shit for no reason with my BF and he put up with it. Everything's great now though!
