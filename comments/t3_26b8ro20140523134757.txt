That poll is at [65% 'no'](http://www.poll-maker.com/results93952xc07440Ca-4#tab-2) with a [sharp drop off of votes](http://www.poll-maker.com/results93952xc07440Ca-4#tab-5) on the second day. Hardly an overwhelming majority, and since you can vote as many times as you want it's likely that people with strong feelings either way did.
