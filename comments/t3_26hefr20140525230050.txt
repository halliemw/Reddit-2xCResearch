I really don't think you are asexual. It could be fear. I have been once in a situation with a guy I was very attracted to and obsessively in love with but when it came to it I just got scared and froze (was a virgin trying to be a seductress, that failed predictably). I have for a long while been able to get more aroused when not in a situation where sex could happen. So, yes, it is fear. Somehow, little by little you will be able to dismantle it. Is it possible that you are not that attracted to your bf?
