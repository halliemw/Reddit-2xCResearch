Based on what you've written, it does indeed seem to an issue unrelated from [fat](http://i.imgur.com/B3HrsoX.gif).

It's probably bloating, but if you really want to give yourself peace of mind as far as whether it's a definition issue or a bloating issue: take some pictures throughout the day for a week. If you find the protrusion that disturbs you waxes and wanes throughout the day and week, it's an issue with bloating and not definition (although abdominal exercises are a good idea for almost everyone looking to improve their midriff appearance.

What I would do is very meticulously calculate my nutrition throughout the week. Bloating comes from all sorts of places: sodium, badly digested carbohydrates, and excess calcium -- just to name a few! With the picture and totals in hand, you might be able to find a reasonable correlation between something you eat and the distension.

If in the end, you can't really find a cause for it: it may very well be worth going to a doctor, and don't feel that it's a waste of time! If something's disturbing enough that it bothers you, it's well worth getting a professional opinion. And who knows? They might very well refer you to a nutritionist for better advice or even an allergist (if they believe you might have picked up a very mild food allergy).
