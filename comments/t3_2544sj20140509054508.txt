Australia is going the way of the States with *everything* (except gun laws, for now at least), because of successful brainwashing by the media, who are owned and controlled by incredibly rich and powerful people who will do anything they think they can get away with to become even more so.

*"We have modest debt which means we have to dismantle welfare programs or no one will have jobs even though we are literally the healthiest economy in the world! FEAR EVERYTHING!"*

And while they're at it, may as well try to drag us back to the dark ages in gender equality and social justice issues, because they're all old rich white bitter fuckstain idealogues who don't understand anything outside of their own reality.

It's a very depressing time to be a progressive Austrlian right now.
