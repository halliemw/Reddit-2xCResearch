> You know what's equal? Rapists and instances of rape.

While I definitely agree with your overall point, I'm not completely sure what you mean by this. If some rapists are repeat offenders, wouldn't there be more instances of rape than rapists, since each rapist commits at least one instance of rape but some will commit more?
