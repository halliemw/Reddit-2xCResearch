First, your paper was on the media, and your friends are just telling anecdotes about their personal lives.  Nothing really in conflict here.  Everyone has had different experiences in their lives, so you can understand when people feel differently.  

Personal anecdote: I'm a male, and a twin.  My twin is female.  I believe that because of this, I get along with females much better than I get along with males.  How does this fit into your paper?  It doesn't, as there has yet to be a movie made about me yet. :-)
