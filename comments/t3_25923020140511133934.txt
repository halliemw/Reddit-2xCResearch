You should definitely not feel like you have to wax your arms. They are really [not that bad]( http://i.imgur.com/aEB7FR1.jpg), don't worry.

If you want, you could definitely try it out, though! Wax your arms and see what you think. The hair will grow back, and it wouldn't be the end of the world :)
