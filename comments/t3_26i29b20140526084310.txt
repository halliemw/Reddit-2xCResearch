My boyfriend said it first. He said it about a week, maybe a week and a half into the relationship. We had known each other for a few years prior, but certain situations kept us from dating. I was shocked. I think it was said prior to us having sex, but I don't remember for sure. We've been together (almost) eight years now :)
