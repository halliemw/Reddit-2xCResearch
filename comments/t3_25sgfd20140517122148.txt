I really like this. I had this conversation with my boyfriend the last time we were at the movies and saw a preview for Maleficent. Why is it that we can't just allow her to be evil? When was the last time you saw a piece that recast a previously irredeemable male villain as just doing what they thought was necessary? I hadn't even thought of some of the examples that were raised in this article.
