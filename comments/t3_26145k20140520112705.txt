Could someone make clearer the line between someone calling out a compliment on the street and someone harassing you? There are such extreme opinions in this thread I'm having a hard time discerning what exactly we're talking about. If a stranger walks by and says "you're beautiful" - even if it's a homeless person - I smile and say thank you while continuing on my way. I don't think something like that deserves a negative response, nor does it make me feel unsafe.  

Now if I large man had been following me a while and repeatedly made inappropriate remarks like "them titties, girl" or some such comment - I would feel a whole hell of a lot different. So what exactly are we referring to here?  

I'd also like to point out that men do get harassed by women. A lot of time in a bar situation. I've heard men feel violated getting their genitals grabbed or having a girl "grind" on them when it was clearly unwanted.  

But I guess we are in twoX so....I'll shut up now
