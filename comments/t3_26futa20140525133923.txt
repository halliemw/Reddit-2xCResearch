I worked with a woman who felt rejected by the rest of our work group. It was totally in her head, but the pain she felt over it was real. She began to engage in some really bizarre, irrational, and aggressive behaviors as a result. 

I only know how she felt, because she thought I was an "outcast" too. She would cry (literally tears) to me about how we are never invited out to lunch with the others. Except... she WAS invited. She was so hurt by these imaginary rejections. Every day I was afraid that this would be the day she decided to get revenge.

Very, very scary.
