I relate girl, I am a fairly pale girl with dark hair. My family is very hairy and I have dark hair nearly everywhere. My boyfriend actually "waxed" my back once with duct tape and was surprised by the amount of hair actually there..

Honestly, i have never had a guy complain about it. I have a hairy back and hairy stomach/chest, and thought my boyfriend has pointed this out, he DOESN'T CARE and still finds me attractive. 

Honestly, I would rather a guy like me for my personality, and if he is the type of guy I want to be with then he wont care about some hair...

Now, I have to admit, I do shave my legs, arms and armpits... But I let the rest of my body grow wild and free, I simply like how my arms legs and pits look without hair, but I have definitely gone with all three hairy and still been intimate with my partner without being embarrassed about how I looked.Remember, females have the sexy form regardless of hair/size/whatever..
