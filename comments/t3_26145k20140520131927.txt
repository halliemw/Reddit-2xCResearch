I've never had this happen to me on the street.  I'm not entirely sure why, but back in high school I would hear all sorts of rumors about boys who had crushes on me but were too intimidated to confront me. (And NO ONE EVER DID....  щ（ﾟДﾟщ）)  I think the way you walk and present yourself might have something to do with it...  I'm pretty tomboyish.  I very often wear my motorcycle gear, which does seem to draw a lot of attention/staring, but they never say anything except the occasional "nice jacket" or, "do you ride?"


While I'm riding however, I get quite a few guys who'll pull up next to me and make some sort of comment.  The comments range from your typical, "Nice bike!" to the over-emphasized, "Dayum gurrrl!"  It's sometimes polite where the dude is expressing how awesome it is to see a girl riding, and sometimes they're just obviously ogling/cat calling.

How I deal with it?  If they seem polite and well-intentioned, I'll give them a thumbs up or even strike up a conversation at a stoplight if they say they ride as well.  If I can't tell what their intention is, I'll ignore them.  If they're cat-calling, I'll either ignore them (if I'm in a good mood), give them the finger, or turn my head and stare straight into their souls until they look uncomfortable (they can't see my eyes through the tinted visor :P).
