> It's easy to take a glance at the data and conclude that women who want to close the wage gap want the same pay as men without actually "going the extra mile" that men do.

OK, but let's not forget that many of those men going the extra mile are doing so with the support of their wives who are putting in the hours to look after their home, looking after sick kids, moving across country to support their husband's career advances, etc.

For many families this is in fact a good distribution of labour. It makes sense for one parent to sacrifice career advancement in order to support their partner's. But we have a problem when it's assumed that women will take that role, because employers see women as less reliable, unlikely to put in the hours, etc. It's harder to make it as a stay-at-home-dad/career-woman combo because of the prejudices employers have against female employees.
