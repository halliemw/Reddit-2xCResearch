Awesome, thank you! I'll definitely be needing all the help I can get! I've got a long document that a mess of ideas from this thread and a to-do list. Once I've made sense of it I'll be contacting everyone who offered to help! 

For right now, if you wanted to start by researching what resources are available already in your region, that would be fantastic!
