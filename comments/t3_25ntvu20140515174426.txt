I clearly said everything I could have possibly said to let you know that I'm not dismissing your experiences.  Sexism happens, but it's like my Aunt said to me once: when we make statements like "the world is like this" and "men are like that" then this is the world we are going to see.  It is literally a mantra that you are repeating to yourself.  As someone who has been in the tech field for a long time, I am only trying to help you  -- you can take my perspective or leave it.  Good luck.  You'll be fine. I like u/iatemysocks advice: try spending less time on the internet or reading the news, and make an effort to hang out more with good, non-sexist friends.  There are good people in the world, but sometimes the bad ones are just louder which makes it seem like there are more of them.
