Is it inaccurate? Alternately, is there a better, more accurate term (pro life is very misleading and not a great description of the position).

Pro-birth, perhaps?

edit: Also, when you're at the level of KILLING people, "anti choice" seems like the least problematic thing in the whole story. They killed someone. They are not pro life.
