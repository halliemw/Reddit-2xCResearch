I couldn't agree more. I went into hospital due to some abnormal vaginal bleeding. After waiting over an hour the nurse told me I shouldn't have even come into the hospital and that I was just wasting time. After that I refused to let her touch me and another nurse came and spoke to me about it being a public hospital and said I couldn't pick and choose nurses. The entire time I was laying in that bed, feeling scared, I heard the nurse talking shit about how I 'didn't like her' loudly from the next bed. I've refused to go to hospital again because of that woman. It's disgusting that people like this are trusted with our health and.wellbeing.
