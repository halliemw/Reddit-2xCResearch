Hahaha "wanna choke him until his face turns purple". I can relate to this. I'm not married but am in a relationship that's had it's ups and downs. We have started broaching the subject of marriage. Good to know I'm not the only one capable of being so very in love and yet occasionally so infuriated by the one I love.
