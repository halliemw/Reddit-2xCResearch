That's not what they are talking about. When u/snippyblurberries said for the study was done by men and associated that with how serious it was being taken, and then said awesome after being told some of the research was done by women, it sounds as though she was saying that it was awesome and credible only after female scientists were put into the equation. It still looks like that Imo, it may not be but it's hard to tell. That's the bias they are talking about, if it's an men only group it's baseless, if females are introduced its cool.
