My kid will attempt to sit up and pull the cover off while staying teeth-clamped on my nipple. So me, frantically trying to pull the cover out of hands while stopping it from strangling me, save her from falling off my lap because she thinks this tug-of-war is awesome and is putting some if that baby strength in it, AND adjust my top cuz now my boob is just all kinds of out there AND spraying fluid. Oh, and trying not to yell because of the aforementioned teeth. If you're keeping track, that requires at least three hands and I'm, sadly, equipped with only two, so that equals one big ol' useless clusterfuck that would attract the attention of even the most doddering. 

Past the newborn stage, babies typically hate the cape. It's got and stuffy and stops them from being able to see mom, their hands, the ceiling, that bird, a cloud, and all the interesting things that a kid would want to look at whilst nursing.
