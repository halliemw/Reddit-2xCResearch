About "not being tied down"...last week, a next-door neighbor told me that I could cheat on my husband with him and he wouldn't tell anybody. He spent an awful lot of time talking about how good he is with women, especially in bed...

I didn't want to piss him off since it's not a super safe area so I treated it as a big joke and laughed and laughed. I don't think there's a good way of dealing with this sort of persistence.
