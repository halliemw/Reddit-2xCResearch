I'm really good about staying hydrated normally, water is my drink of choice but I've been sipping on a Gatorade and sprite all morning. I actually hadn't thought of the instant breakfast, my husband made me a milkshake with it so I can get some extra calories and that made me feel a decent bit better :)
