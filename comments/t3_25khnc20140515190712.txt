I believe I've read this before, and I like the analogy.  One thing that kind of rubs me the wrong way is that my field has a shortage of good people period, there are always openings everywhere.  There is also a demonstrable and significant gender disparity in CS graduates.

Thus I suppose it irks me that we're told we're not hiring enough women or that there is this gender bias when we can't even find enough men!  Perhaps I'm just bitter from having too much interesting work and not being able to find enough people to help do it...
