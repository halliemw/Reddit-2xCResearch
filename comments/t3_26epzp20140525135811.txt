Sigh. Ok. Do you agree that men, and especially white men, are generally treated as the top of society? They're the star in every movie, on the board of every company, and are generally very well-represented in society.

Ok.

That's great! We're not saying it's bad. But we want *everyone* to be well-represented. We don't want *anyone* being portrayed as weak or stupid or unimportant. In general, men do not need as much help in this, since you are further along on that path than women, gay people, trans people, etc. Since we are a group of women dedicated to raising up our fellow women, it makes sense to have "fem" in our title. I'm sure gay, trans, and other under-represented groups have their own names. But overall, it's the same goal: we want everyone to be raised up. 

Does that make more sense?
