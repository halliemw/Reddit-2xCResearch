Oh I see. Yes that makes sense, I agree. 

Btw, tangential question but if there is something that is wrong [not inherently wrong] in the overall post, pointing this out in a calm, sensible manner with an explanation of which you think its wrong would be ok, right? As in if someone lashes out to a friend/SO and talks about it here, while her original experience that led to lashing out was of course not wrong or 'un-valid', the lashing out itself would be wrong.
