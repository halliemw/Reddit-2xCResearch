What about comics depicting sexual violence as that'll mean ruling out watchmen.  The issue here more seems to be this guy D is fucking creepy but they don't want to ban sexual content as it could have artistic merit.  

So the problem seems to be that D's stuff doesn't have artistic merit and is just perverse.   I don't really know how you go out explaining to an "artist" that he's just a weirdo and no one likes his shit comics.
