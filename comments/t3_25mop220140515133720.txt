Guy here. Similar position.

I'm depressed, but I deal with it. People tell me that I am smart, capable, cute, a "catch" etc. but I never believe it myself. Your boyfriend even sounds better than me.

Things that I do to make it better: **self help books, get enough sleep, diet, & exercise**. The best things that got me feeling OK with myself were the following books: [Dale Carnegie](http://www.amazon.com/How-Stop-Worrying-Start-Living/dp/0671733354/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400178620&sr=8-1&keywords=stop+worrying), [Feeling Good](http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-The-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400178662&sr=8-1&keywords=feeling+good), [Power of Now](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Now-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400178677&sr=8-1&keywords=power+of+now)

Living in the past and/or worrying about the future is rough. Constantly thinking or experiencing racing thoughts is rough (The books help a ton).

The only salvation for me is **helping other people, trying to be the best person I can, and hope that people accept me for what I am**. You shouldn't feel that need to fix him. Being there for him is all that he needs from you. Honestly talking to him on what you're worried about / what he's worried about seems to be the way to go. If talking is making it worse, then you need to talk about why it is making it worse.
