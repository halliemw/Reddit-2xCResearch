OP was traumatized yes. can you honestly say you don't have similar memories? doesn't it make you feel better knowing that you are not alone? just to put other readers at ease, if any of you masturbated as a child that was completely normal too. the fact that society does not acknowledge that these things are normal is part of the trauma. people get it in their heads that they are weird or different, or that they are special victims and can't relate to other people because of it. that is patently false in a situation like this. most people have these experiences they are extremely common, and if our society wasn't so uncomfortable with the truth, it wouldn't be so traumatizing.
