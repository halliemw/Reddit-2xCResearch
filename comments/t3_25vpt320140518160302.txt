I use a cleansing oil/balm/cream on my face and do a nice massage to melt off my makeup, then wipe it off with a nice hot flannel, brush my teeth and then go upstairs. I then use a toner, use a treatment like an oil or serum and then maybe moisturise depending how I feel. Afterwards I pop my pj's on, brush my hair, crawl into bed and put something on my TV or read a book. Or you know, just end up on back on reddit :)
