 > a person should be able to post about their pro-life stance without facing backlash

Why? Other people are going to express their opinions as well. If someone advocates against abortions or shames women who get abortions, there will obviously be a lot of disagreement. No one's opinions are immune to criticism even on this subreddit. 

> I think that this video sends the message that, "If you get pregnant by accident, having an abortion really isn't a big deal."

How is that a "dangerous message"? It seems like a perfectly reasonable message to me. Obviously, unplanned pregnancy should be avoided as much as possible but abortions are very common and very safe. 

So many women are afraid of myths about abortion. I'm glad her video helped clear them up. 

> And as much as it's YOUR body, it's HIS child too.

At the end of the day, it's the woman's body and it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.
