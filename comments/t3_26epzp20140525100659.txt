I would say the entire concept of gender equality grew out of feminist thought. Insofar as a gender equality movement exists, it is mostly within the feminist movement.

I self-identify as a feminist even though my beliefs are pretty much gender egalitarianism because we would not even be having a conversation about "gender equality" if not for some very smart, brave women who insisted on being treated as human beings.
