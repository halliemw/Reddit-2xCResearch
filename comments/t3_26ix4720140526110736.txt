Your SO's apathy/anger reminds me of my husband. I spent years thinking it was just stress from school or lack of sleep, walking on eggshells in case I triggered something. 

That went on for probably 10 years, until a couple of months ago. That was when he went to his doctor and got a prescription for Wellbutrin. Now, I have my pre-depression husband back, and I only wish we'd realized something was wrong sooner.
