There are some questions to answer for yourself to begin to come to grips with what happened.  They are not easy, don't need to be shared with anyone, but will help you understand why you feel how you do better.  I very much do not want to make someone feel worse, so if you don't feel up to it, ignore everything after this paragraph.  Above all else, see a professional therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist or trained counselor.  Personally, I think everyone should have a therapist they see every month or so just for mental health well being, I strongly suggest finding one you can talk to.  I also think a  discussion with your boyfriend would go a long ways, men are socialized to be stalwart, the unwavering support and is likely masking his feelings.  He may feel the same way as you, or radically different but understand.  It could be an unpleasant conversation, so don't have it until you're prepared, but don't just suffer alone.

These questions are in no way judgemental or supposed to make you feel guilt in a particular way.  I've had several experiences surrounding death in my lifetime and to move forward and deal with it, I had to first understand why I felt how I did and answered similar questions to myself to do that. do you regret it because you don't feel like it was your decision?  Do you regret it because you won't have the baby?  Do you regret the action, or the result?  Do you regret it because you took a life (note that I believe that life begins at conception, even though we don't weigh the rights of that life as overriding the mother's until the life is viable independent of the mother)?  Do you regret it because you wanted him to tell you to stop, don't do it at any point, but he never did?

Please don't answer the questions in a reply, I don't care what the answers are, I just want you to understand why you feel the way you do and begin the path to healing.
