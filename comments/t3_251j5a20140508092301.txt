I've always heard the phrase, " If he/she cheats on someone else with you, it's only a matter of time before they cheat on you." Because they're long distance and I assume have never met it seems a bit iffy to me. The other girlfriend might exist or there might be 10 of them!  How bad has she fallen for this guy?
