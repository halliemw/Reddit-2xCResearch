Hahah I actually love knitting! I think what's making it super rough is that we were long distance, so it's more that I have to change my mindset as well as fill that time I would normally spend calling/skyping/texting him. Like every morning waking up and looking at my phone expectantly, but as I reach for it remembering and just...ugh. It's almost infuriating because I *want* to be over it.
