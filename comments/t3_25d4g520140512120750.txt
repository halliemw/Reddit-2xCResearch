This is terrifying. 

What would you do to protect your sister or your daughter? I'd like to think I would do whatever it takes. The problem of course is doing it in a smart way. 

Could you ask the police for advise (before actually asking them to step in)? Or maybe a woman's shelter in your area? They might be better informed and have an idea of the best steps to take. 

The good news is that there's a picture and his status is illegal, so there are many options. I just hope she doesn't delete the picture.
