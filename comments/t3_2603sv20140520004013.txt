It's nice to know there is someone else out there who has the same issue. My hair isn't very dark, but I notice it probably more than anyone. It drives me nuts. I tend to dress more conservatively because of it and FORGET a bikini. I have waxed it from time to time and found that isn't too bad. There are products to help with razor bumps such as Tend Skin (you can get it at sephora). Hopefully even just knowing you aren't alone will help some.
