This honestly got me to start crying. Thank you for your honesty and your empathy -- I'll take your words to heart and I appreciate the time you took to relay your story to me. I wasn't at home for college, and he seemed to have chilled out half a year before I left so I don't think it was the act of leaving that led to him calming down a little. It was something more psychological on the inside because it was a pretty clear cut change that happened very suddenly when the new year came in 2009.

And best of luck to you also with you and your family. Sounds like not all the wrinkles have been smoothed out, but you have a good head and sense to where you're at and what you have to do for yourself as an individual.
