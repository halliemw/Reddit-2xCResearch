I'm sorry to hear you're going through such a tough decision.

If it helps, your reasons for getting an abortion are really common. [Between 32-38%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States#Reasons_for_abortions) of abortions are because women are either not ready for a child or have already had all the children they want to have. You're not alone in this.

Consider talking to your doctor about longer-term birth control options, like male or female sterilizations, regardless of the choice you make.
