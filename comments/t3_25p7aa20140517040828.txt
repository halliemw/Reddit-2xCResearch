I don't think you quite got the gist of my point here.  Although, it's amusingly clear you spent a decent amount of time proving you do in fact care a bunch.  

Sorry, your subjective opinion on validity and levels of bluntness is just that.  No different than mine and any fantasy you have about being more valid is just another opinion.  You know what they say about opinions I'm sure.

Do go on and have a good weekend anyway.
