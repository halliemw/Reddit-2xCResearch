This sounds like an exceedingly unhealthy relationship. I'm sorry you had to deal with all this crap. That being said, you should probably see a therapist about all of this and talk it out with them. I don't know if you'd be able to do anything legal about this, but it sounds like you did the right thing and ended it so that's pretty smart of you.

I had an ex who would do very similar things, like grabbing me while I'm asleep, but my husband does these things too and for some reason it feels completely different. Ending it with this guy means you can find someone you feel more comfortable with who will help you figure out what you do/don't want.
