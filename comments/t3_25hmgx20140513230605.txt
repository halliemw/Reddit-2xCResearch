Thank you for this reply. It's validating to hear that you think this is a serious case, because I found myself questioning whether the things he said really constituted reporting. I am considering talking to one of the other students in the class and seeing if she agrees about reporting the issue, and maybe we can both make complaints to strengthen our case.
