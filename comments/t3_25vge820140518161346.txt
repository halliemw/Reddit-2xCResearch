The "frog in hot water" is a great analogy. Drop a frog in boiling water and it will leap out in shock. Put a frog in cold water and heat it slowly, and it will sit there until it cooks.

It means you're a good person - you saw the good in him and you chose to see that even when he was hurting you. Don't ever feel bad for staying so long, everyone in an abusive relationship is manipulated and it is impossible to see the situation clearly when you're at the centre of it.
