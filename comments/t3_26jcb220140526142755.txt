I know I'm being pessimistic, but I'm a bit worried about what pro-life extremists might do when word about this network spreads. I've read about harassing women who visit Planned Parenthood and these fake abortion clinics where women are kept against their will and I see a lot of potential for further abuse like this :/ Although the idea in itself is very good.
