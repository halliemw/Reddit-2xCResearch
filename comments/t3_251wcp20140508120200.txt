What kind of backlash do you get when you say you're a woman and in what context? Would it be in relation to genders topics or topics not relating to gender at all? 

It's seriously fucked up that that happens. Your gender makes up half the world's population for christsake. It's not like in the comments section of news websites, men are giving female journalists backlash for writing an article as a woman and contributing their opinion. It only seems a problem when posters are commenting anonymously, then there's all this ruckus when the poster states their female. 

This reminds me of the time I found out this seemingly normal, friendly guy, with a sister, female friends, the lot, would shout 'bitch, cunt, whore' at any girls on xbox live - just what is that?!!
