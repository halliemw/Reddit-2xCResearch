I had the exact same issue with HBC and NuvaRing was the worst. I tried several forms of HBC and finally just switched to condoms as my primary form of BC. I keep Plan B around just in case, but I've never needed to use it. There may be a better form of HBC for you, but don't be afraid to use condoms! Just go over with your gyno (visit with your boyfriend?) and review how to properly put on & remove a condom. My sex life is waaaay better since I gave up on HBC :P You can even get a pack of 36 condoms from Amazon for $15. That's less than $.45 per condom.
