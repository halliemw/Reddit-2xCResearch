I definitely don't think it is necessarily a bad thing, I think it is more of the phrase that they are saying it, since 'good girl' is much, much more common than 'good woman/good lady' (neither of which I have ever heard. Perhaps you are overreacting a little. 

That said, I think they are just acknowledging your work and they are grateful to have you help them... I think you should realize this before getting upset about it.
