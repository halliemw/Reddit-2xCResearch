I'm trying to type a well-written reply to you, but I'm still before-coffee.  

We have been very regularly (roughly, every several days) discussing the state of the sub.  We talk about the modqueue, bans, threads and modmails and PMs discussing opinions... and these conditions have been steadily improving.  We will be continuing to monitor and discuss.

We do recognize that there continue to be members who wish we had not opted to make the sub a default -- though I personally wish those same members wouldn't insist that there aren't members who are pleased with the decision.  Granted, people who are upset do tend to talk about it more than people who are happy.  Many of the complaints we have gotten are from the same handful of users -- whose opinions do matter, but don't count *more* than other users just because they are stating them more often.
