1. Make a list of the cab companies in your city.

2. Call each one and say you're looking for [cab driver's name]. If they ask why, lie (you left something in his cab last night, you wanted to let him know about that restaurant you talked about, anything) and give a fake name. The point is to identify him and his company without arousing suspicion.

3. Once you've confirmed that a man named [cab driver's name] works for a certain company and was working the night you were assaulted, go IN PERSON to a police station (with your neighbor, if possible) and ask to speak to a detective. Give your account of the incident.
