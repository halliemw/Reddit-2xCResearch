Hey, you can have friends or just a dog even if you don't live in that place forever - it'll be fine! (Not trying to poke fun in a mean way, just hoping you'll laugh.) This is actually a great opportunity to rediscover you hobbies. You may actually find out to your surprise that you can be a pretty good friend to yourself. Anyway, now with the jackass gone, all you've got is time, right?

Just don't beat yourself up if you don't adjust right away. I think what you are going through is very human. You're grieving for your relationship even if it was a shitty one. You won't heal in a day. I find exercise to be therapeutic for my anxiety. (And joining a gym can help you meet people.)
