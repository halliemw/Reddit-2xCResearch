I wouldn't say enjoy. I defiantly notice the fluctuations more now than I used to, maybe they are more pronounced now that I'm in my late 20's. But I find it really annoying to be like "why am I so crazy emotional right now? Oh yeah, I'm about to have my period." I wish I didn't feel so bipolar across the course of the month.
