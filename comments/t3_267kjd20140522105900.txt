I had been on hormonal BC on and off since I was about 16, until a couple months ago (I'm 20 now). I believe it was responsible for greatly exacerbating my mental health problems; I had INSANE mood swings where I would lash out at people for no reason and become really angry really quickly. Now I've been off it for a few months I still have mood swings but they're not psychotic and aggressive like they used to be. I had a copper (non hormonal) IUD for a while when I was 19 so I'm probably going to go for that again; I had it taken out because I suffer from pretty painful and heavy periods anyway and it made them a little bit worse. However, taking hormonal contraception and being able to skip periods etc isn't worth ruining all of my relationships with my insane outbursts; plus I have a family history of strokes, I'm overweight and I smoke so I don't want to add to that risk (those are definitely factors worth bearing in mind if any of them apply to you!)

Edit: I've seen some posts below about difficulties getting an IUD; I'm in the UK and I had no difficulty getting one on the NHS despite being young/not having had children. I'm guessing this varies a little bit in some other countries
