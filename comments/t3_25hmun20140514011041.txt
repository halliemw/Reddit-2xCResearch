men and women consider things from different angles. women tend to be more concerned with the relationships between people and things. men tend to be more concerned with end results. 

mansplaining is taking a female statement and turning into a male statement. a good example of mansplaining is done on the youtube channel by sparkyfister. he plays feminist videos and then explains what the feminist is trying to say in very blunt male language (which would probably be considered offensive by the original speaker). 

before you go check his videos i am just going to toss out a trigger warning to all of you. this guy doesn't sugar coat anything. he is civilized and not very vulgar, but at the same time he will address any topic with zero tact or kindness.
