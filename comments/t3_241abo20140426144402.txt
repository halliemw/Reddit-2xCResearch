Getting out of an abusive relationship can be extremely disorienting.  When you're in the middle of one there's a focal point for all the all the negative feelings and the highs and lows, and even the positive things.  Even abusive relationships have moments of good times and positive emotions.  That's how an abuser keeps someone around; they isolate and utilize both carrot and stick to keep you unbalanced and focused on them.  They become both the storm and shelter from the storm.  When they're not there anymore you lose that focal point and there's nothing concrete and definitive to point to anymore when you're feeling down or lonely or angry and know that that's the problem.  You're being forced to find a new center and sense of self and you're doing it while grieving over the loss of a relationship and the recognition that it wasn't even a healthy one.

Be patient with yourself.  It takes a while to come to terms with this and sometimes it's overwhelming.  Being alone and being comfortable with it takes time but it will happen with practice.  And you sort of have to practice because right now you're very isolated.  Volunteering somewhere is a great idea.  Check out meet-ups in your area, become a regular at a coffee shop or other local hang out.  Take a walk around your neighborhood and smile and wave at people you pass.  Stop by a dog park and strike up a conversation with someone who has a dog.  You may not be able to keep your own but other people generally love talking about their pets and you can get in a little doggy loving.  

Also allow yourself to be sad and mourn.  Sometimes it's good to have a bit of a wallow in those feelings and acknowledge their existence.  Ignoring it won't make them go away.  Just try not to stay there too long.  It's also good to pick yourself up and force yourself to go out and get some fresh air and find something to smile about.  It gets easier the more you practice.  Best wishes to you. :)
