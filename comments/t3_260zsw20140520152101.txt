Well, I took the whole Satan comment from him as a backhanded slap of your unworthiness. Aside from that; do you feel that your comprimise would make you unhappy?

I'm not one to think that relationships require a 'Quid Pro Quo', but compromise takes two and I don't see any from the other side. In fact it looks to me like unconditional surrender is what is wanted from you.

This is going to be very difficult for you as it may be impossible for you to be objective about what you can envision your future to be. Sometimes we get so invested in something that we can't see our way to cutting our losses, giving up our immediate desires and seeing what the future on the same track holds for us. As you said "I'm happy to go to church, but don't believe. I don't think that's enough. :(". When, if ever will you know that's not enough?
