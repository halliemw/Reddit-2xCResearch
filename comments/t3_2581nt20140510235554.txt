I'm not saying she should stick with crappy/judgmental doctors, but at some point, you have to find one that works for you. 

I say this from experience. I had the same PCP group my entire life growing up (from birth until roughly 20). The past 5 years, I've doctor hopped a lot for various reasons (moving, insurance, etc) and the quality of care I've gotten has declined significantly from the lack of continuity/follow up/relationships with providers.
