I'm a committed atheist and one of my biggest beefs with some fundamentalist Christians is the disconnect between what they purport to believe in and their actual actions.  I've read the bible, studied it and deeply understand its stories, philosophies and contradictions - the teachings of Jesus Christ is diametrically opposed to the harm and hurt that some people feel justified on inflicting on those who don't share their beliefs. 

Just from what you've posted in this thread - you are going to be very welcome here
