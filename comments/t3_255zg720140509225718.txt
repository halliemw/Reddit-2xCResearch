Have you [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7zzQpvoYcQ) [1 hr 44 min] or [read](http://www.amazon.com/Last-Lecture-Randy-Pausch-ebook/dp/B00139VU7E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1399693960&sr=8-1&keywords=last+lecture) [217 pages] Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture? He was a professor at Carnegie-Melon and they started a Last Lecture lecture series in which professors gave a lecture with the premise of "this is the last lecture you will ever give."

Except, it was for Randy. Randy was perfectly healthy until he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He took this opportunity and basically made a video and wrote a short book for his young sons that imparted all of his dreams, hopes, wishes, accomplishments, and advice for when they are older and in need of guidance. 

Take some time to do something similar for your wife and kids. Write letters to be opened during important holidays or birthdays. Impart wisdom for your kids that are appropriate for different age groups or situations. Stay a part of your kid's life.

I highly recommend you watch the lecture or read the book. I did both, and both are wonderful.
