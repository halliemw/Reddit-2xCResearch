Haha, made me think of my S.O. We're still quite young but could see ourselves in for the long haul. Funny enough, he would more than happily be a stay-at-home dad, and frequently jokes that I'm going to be the breadwinner so he can stay at home and look after the kids (I'm studying neuroscience to be a researcher and very passionate about it). Unfortunately, he is extremely intelligent, just finished a masters in mechanical engineering, and has a gift for money management. Soooooo looks like we'll both be working forever! xD
