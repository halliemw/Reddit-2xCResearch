>I think in the context of being asked to surrender your weapons, "come and take it" has a very clear meaning. 

Does it? Because I can think of at least 2 meanings of the phrase in that situation that are diametrically opposed, and you really wouldn't want to mix those up.

> I have no idea what it means in this case, even after I read through the comments and realized it was an abortion thing.

Slightly ironic username, in that case. I don't suppose searching the hashtag came to mind? Complaining that you don't understand something that you've made no effort to comprehend is an act whose end I cannot fathom. You seem to be upset that you haven't had the whole issue laid out for you in bite-sized chunks, which is a little much to ask of a graduation cap. Show some initiative.
