it's absolutely true that pro-life attitudes in the us make it harder for women. i felt burdened by a terrible secret and i knew if it got out i would be harassed and condemned by coworkers, acquaintances, and relatives. no one but a couple of my very best friends knew what i was going through. mine would have sucked anyway (bc i was married, and i felt very hurt and rejected by my husband) but having to be ashamed certainly didn't help and was the trigger for most of my post-ptsd related panic attacks.
