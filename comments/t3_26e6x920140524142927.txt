Wish I had some advice to offer.  If nothing else, try not to feel guilty for getting angry.  That was a completely acceptable/appropriate response (and was probably really good for him to hear, so that there's as little confusion as possible about your feelings).  Hope you're able to get home and cuddle with your boyfriend soon. :)

(Props for the Killers reference.)
