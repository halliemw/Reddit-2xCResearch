Thanks so much for your reply and well wishes :) 

You're right, it probably will be a very simple conversation. And you're right, it is sad, but it's also a change that needs to happen. I definitely don't anticipate this being the end of our friendship. Just like you said, it will likely even be better for us. There's just this tiny uncomfortableness that I need to deal with first.

Thanks again!
