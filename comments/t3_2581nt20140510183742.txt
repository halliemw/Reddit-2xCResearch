>Edit: And you know what? This implies my doctors all think my ovaries will override my brain one day, which is just extra fucked up.

If a doctor believed that a non-brain part of your body were going to override your brain, the sane response would be for the doctor to give your brain what it wants and then try to find a treatment for "ovary-induced brain damage," because *that* sounds like a genuine medical problem.

Alas, the human race's inability to get over itself is partially genetic and massively reinforced by extant social structures. If it happens at all, it'll happen too slowly, and with its fair share of self-defeating steps backward during the journey.

For now, know that you're not alone. Some of us out there realize that there is nothing *objectively* special and wonderful about the spawning process.
