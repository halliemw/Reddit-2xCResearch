One thing that helped me was a post somewhere that said to think about all the parts of your body that you are happy with - not just the ones that are sexualized by society, but the parts that are kind of taken for granted. I used to always obsess about my small boobs and how much I hated them, so it was helpful for me to start thinking about my eyes, my ears, my knees, my fingers, and how all those things are okay with me. 

Of course, finding confidence that stems from other things than self-image is important too, but I understand it's hard to not value your own appearance because a lot of the times it feels that all society values women for is their physical appearance. In that regard, perhaps you can look for starting new hobbies, or remind yourself of other accomplishments you've already made in life. 

On an aside, somehow watching drag queens performed helped me because those queens are fierce and beautiful and confident and a lot of them are definitely unconventionally attractive. Rupaul's Drag Race can be misogynistic at times unfortunately, but that show somehow helped me love how I look and have more confidence in myself. ("If you can't love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else?")
