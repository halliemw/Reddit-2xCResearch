Gender's a struggle if you're the slightest bit out of the mold. Remember too, that everyone, regardless of gender, works on their appearance and its not a one-time, black-white deal. How much you are read as female may change over time. Even if you're not being read the way you want now, that can change in the future. 


I know its hard to be patient on something like this - it's your gender, for chrissakes! It's a big part of who we are and how we project ourselves in the world! It should match now! It's upsetting when it doesn't work like that.


But you're moving forward. You'll get there, you'll get to a place where you're happy and comfortable in your own skin. In the meantime, treat yourself to something nice.
