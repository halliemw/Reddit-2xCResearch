This sort of behavior is very typical of abusers. My abusive ex husband pulled the same gaslighting bullshit too. Calling me crazy or imagining things anytime I called him on treating me poorly. 

Abusers never start the relationship as abusive. They always start as the sweetest, kindest, most amazing partners you could ever ask for. It's only when they know they have their claws in deep do they start to act like you're their property and can treat you however they like. 

Block this guy out of your life and move on to someone else who will treat you like a human being throughout your relationship.
