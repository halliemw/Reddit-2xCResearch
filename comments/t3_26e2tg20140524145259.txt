What's really scary is according to the family's attorney [the family warned police weeks ago](http://news.google.com/news/url?sr=1&ct2=us%2F0_0_s_0_1_a&sa=t&usg=AFQjCNHhcGheVLe31vOLJ_C5gxi4er9O7Q&cid=52778513300080&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2014%2F05%2F24%2Fshooting-california-santa-barbara%2F9532405%2F&ei=iPiAU5C1MomSgQe9mYDwDA&sig2=NQnUZIRid3N4HbptHPC5cQ&rt=HOMEPAGE&vm=STANDARD&bvm=section&did=-2021064237364174891&ssid=h) about Elliot's behavior.

**EDIT:** From an [NPR article](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/05/24/315624700/alleged-shooter-in-california-left-vast-digital-trail): "Shifman said that his parents were concerned a few weeks ago after watching a few YouTube videos "regarding suicide and the killing of people." Shifman said Rodger had "multiple therapists" and a social worker was concerned enough last week that she called police.

Authorities, however, interviewed him and concluded he was a "perfectly polite, kind and wonderful human."'

I'm sorry, but in the past where things like this have happened, and we're all "Oh why didn't this person or that person do something/say something" and here everyone involved knows something is up, why was nothing done?!?!?

**EDIT 2:** Thanks for your responses guys. I guess it's just frustrating after a big event like this. You feel so helpless. And the fact that so many men have this mentality on Reddit and the internet in general scares me.
