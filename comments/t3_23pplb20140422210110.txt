The great thing about Hannah, for me, is that she's an incredibly vain person in so many ways. The show never focuses on her body as a negative trait, but it also doesn't portray her as being completely self-aware or possessing much in the way of humility. She's not a ray of happy-go-lucky 'I'm ok with this' body-positivity: she just is who she is.
