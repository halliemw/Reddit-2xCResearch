I've never been to a comic club meeting, so I'm not entirely sure about the setup.  Is it structured like a "let's go around the room and everyone show your art" kind of thing, or are you all just working on stuff and people chat?  What I'm wondering is if there's some way he can talk about his project (maybe with less detail), then if someone wants to see it they can.  From what you described it sounds like it's a show-and-tell situation where he's parading this stuff in everyone's face, which isn't really fair to you all.
