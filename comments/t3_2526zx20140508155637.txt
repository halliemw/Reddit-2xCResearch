Yep. :/ People are being deliberately obtuse, I've already had a few accusations of misandry and being a sexist thrown my way and have reported a couple of comments for slurs and all that fun stuff. I know people want to ride out the default-ness of this sub and see how it goes, but I feel that we really will be losing this wonderful community even more each day it remains a default.
