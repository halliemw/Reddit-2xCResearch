I absolutely feel this way with my mom. She is a good mother, but all we can be is mother and daughter. We've never even had a conversation that wasn't completely... parental. I live on the other side of the globe which has taken off some pressure, but even when I do see her it's so strained. We'll go shopping together and that's fine, but is we sit down for a meal, it's completely awkward. It's the same with my Dad. We'll talk about things like my job, my grandma, the weather and that's it. I'd love to hear stories from their past but they aren't comfortable sharing. 

I've just learned to deal with it. It really depresses me at times when I see other people's relationship with their parents. When I moved away, I thought the time we have together (a couple weeks every couple of years) would be more meaningful and we'd have loads to talk about. It's not the case.
