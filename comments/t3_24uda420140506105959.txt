Abuse and divorce really twist people up inside. Even with really "healthy" breakups, it can take a while to see the extent of the damage and even longer to fully heal. A year isn't that long to grieve 7 years of your life. It's totally within the range of normal to not feel right yet. 

That said, talking to someone more professional and less friends-with-your-scumbag-ex might help you make more sense of the situation and get to a place where you can move on to better, healthier things.
