I'm pretty bad about the water intake as well. It's also apparently a big cause of my dry eyes (in conjunction with the copious amounts of coffee I drink >.> ). I've had a whole host of annoying medical stuff come up in the past year and I kind of feel like I'm falling apart. I'm not sure if everything just all of a sudden got shitty, or if I just had shitty doctors before moving to my new state.

Have you tried working out in a pool? It's *a lot* easier on your joints. I'm not sure if there's anything like that where you are though. It might provide you with a way to gain strength so that your body isn't working so hard and takes pressure off your joints.

Shit sucks. I'm sorry you're having such a crappy time with your health, and I hope it all works out!
