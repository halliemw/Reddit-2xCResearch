Man, I agree that the two flight attendants were totally out of line. And I think that public breastfeeding is no big deal and should even be encouraged - it's good for babies and really it's good for the rest of the plane if the baby is quiet and content. But the thing is that Delta itself was pretty darn responsive and, well, that's the thing about flying. You're at the mercy of whatever assholes are working that day. Flight attendants, gate agents, even TSOs are all imperfect human beings with their own biases interpreting the rules. Here is a silly example. I fly a lot and I wear pretty much the same thing every time: jeans, t shirt, cardigan. Will I be asked to remove the cardigan to go through the body scanner? 50/50 shot in my experience. I'm sure there's an actual rule somewhere but I couldn't tell you what it is based on the behavior of the TSOs. This woman was not forced to stop breastfeeding or cover up, and Delta responded in a timely fashion, and even compensated her for her troubles. That's more than most of us get and I say good for Delta.
