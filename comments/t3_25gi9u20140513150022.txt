So your child should go hungry, just to make sure as to not arouse him... Sounds like a nice guy.  Next time you're out with him, and he has some food in his hand, as he raises it to his mouth, SMACK it out of his hand, and tell him you don't want to see him eat that here, take it to the bathroom, or somewhere private.
