Oh, I agree completely. What I meant is that early education and training is critical when establishing appropriate behaviors. As the young man in the post had obviously been through such a program, he has no excuse. The point of my comment was to indicate that some kids don't know their own strength, and can be dangerous because they don't realize that they'll hurt someone. They certainly should know right from wrong, and if they are unable to, should be supervised and undergo therapy/education if possible.
