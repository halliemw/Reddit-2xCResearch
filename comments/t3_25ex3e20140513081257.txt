Am i the only one inhere that actually would believe it can just be joking? For a healthy guy to say id LOVE a lapdance from girl X, can be a perfectly meaningless statement ( as in it doesnt mean hes going to cheat on you ).

If you want something to be worried / mad about. Then you should worry more about the rest of the history being deleted, in my experience the only facebook conversation i would ever delete would be the ones that can be considered evidence.
