Here is a very simple example.  Studies regularly show that white youths are more likely than black youths to experimental with drugs in middle school or highschool.  Studies also show that black youths are much more likely to be arrested for drug use than their white peers.

The most common explanation is that white youths are more likely to get warnings instead of jail time, either from the witness or the responding officer.
