I agree with you, to some extent. 

I can see how there will be a lot of shit happening in the next couple of days, but I think it will die down, and it's worth sticking around. There are a whole bunch of subs I'm default subscribed to that I've never looked at. Once the trolls leave I don't think anything will be too terrible. 

Having said that, I've subscribed to a couple of other woman-oriented subs for when I feel like I need a safe zone. But I'm not just taking off based on one day's worth of posts. I can already see better quality posts surfacing now than half a day ago.
