The thing is, 2XC *has* been invaded more than Poland over the years - we've been brigaded to hell and back by MRAs, redpillers, meta subreddits, trolls, concern trolls - you name it... and somehow the subreddit keeps on about its business, featuring good content and an unusually thoughtful and reasonable community.

I normally *hate* when a subreddit I'm subscribed to gets default status, because (as plenty of people in this community are pointing out) it usually quickly triggers either draconian moderation by the mod-team or the entire subreddit turning to shit.

*However*, for once I'm actually cautiously in favour of 2XC becoming a default sub (ok! Ok!  Put your pitchforks away! ;-p ):

* It's got a good mod-team that's already highly-trained and highly efficient at resisting trolls and idiots without being unreasonable about it
* It's got a good number of users already (nearly 200k) which gives us a pretty good base to preserve its current culture in the face of the firehose of new users who will be flooding in
* The commenting/voting community is unusually engaged and protective of its existing culture and worldview (which translates into more effective and more active resistance to dilution by newcomers)
* It will *hugely* raise the profile of women on reddit - women will find it more easily, it'll be a standing testimony to the idea that "there are no women on the internet" is stupid bullshit, and it'll be a tacit admission that women are a valid and desired part of the reddit community, rather than the second-class citizens they've traditionally been.
* 2XC is a great community for winning hearts and minds and helping people gain a greater understanding of women's perspectives and worldview.  *Unlike* SRS (or even /r/feminisms) it's a welcoming, understanding community that actually engages with honest and non-offensive opposing viewpoints, and while it still has its hot-button topics and downvote frenzies it's generally a fantastic community for raising awareness and slowly converting people away from the "tits or GTFO, lol amirite guyz?" mindset towards a more reasonable one that recognised women are people too.

I'm a guy, and although I've always been in favour of gender-equality I've frequently disagreed with the consensus on 2XC on a whole raft of issues.  However I've almost always found a receptive audience who will engage with my arguments and debate back effectively, and the couple of years I've been subscribed to 2XC have done more for my appreciation of women's issues and experience than anything else I've ever done.

So... yeah - I'm quietly hopeful that 2XC's greater visibility can do the same for reddit as a whole, and I'll be happy to do my part as-and-when the ~~tide of idiots~~ naive new user-accounts come flooding in.
