No, there is no reason a good person would reply with "bitch" period. 

She is not required to turn them down in a nice way, apologize for it "sorry I am not interested" or soften it "you're a nice guy but sorry I am not interested". She literally owes them nothing. And while a curt turning down may not be the most polite thing you can say it is entirely acceptable and does NOT condone responding with a disgusting slur. 

There is a LOT of socialization of women to be these over the top submissive when refusing something. A man can say a disinterested "sorry, no" but a woman who disinterestedly says the same is somehow viewed as more rude. Women on average are expected to smile more, give longer answers, soften the blow and generally act like they are oh so sorry for refusing such male attention.  

Speaking as someone who refused several people on the past (now in a LTR) people who feel entitled to a yes answer to flirting will call you a bitch regardless of what you say.
