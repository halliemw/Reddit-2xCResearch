Did your insurance cover anything? I'm glad you're happy and can breathe again!

I don't have problems with breathing but I've noticed that I never get a runny nose - if I catch a cold my nose is always very stuffy. Especially in the mornings, ugh. But I don't think that's enough to get my surgery covered, haha... I'm doing this for cosmetic reasons and I know that a lot of people will judge me for it. I used to judge plastic surgery too but it's not all black and white.
