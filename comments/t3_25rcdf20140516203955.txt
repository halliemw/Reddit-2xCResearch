Thank you! 

I'm sorry for you loss, cancer sucks. I've thought about it for awhile and found an awesome tattoo artist to draw my idea since I have no artistic skills. But I just wanted something that I could see daily to always remember her. My other tattoo is my cats paw print on my foot. Easier hidden for jobs and what not. So is the back shoulder, which I thought about. But then I can't see it! 

My advice for tattoos though, think about it for a few months and if you still want it, go for it! Just find a good artist and you'll be happy :). 

Oh forgot to say it hurts but totally doable, and then itchy for a couple weeks. That's probably the worst part!
