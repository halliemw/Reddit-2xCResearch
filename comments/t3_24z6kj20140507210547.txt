I appreciate your candid response and I dont completely disagree with you (I really dont know bc like you Im not the OP).

But its not just forcing "anyone" to read or "everyone" to read...its forcing some people to read based on their skin color or their gender (or some combination)...see thats the sticky part.

How would you separate people into groups (again not based on anything they've done, the criteria must be arbitrarily assigned at birth through no choice an individual can make)?  

And then just as importantly force some of those groups to read something based on some assumption youve made about their collective life experience?  Because keep in mind theres no way you could possibly know all of their individual life experiences, you just have to assume you have an idea of what it is.
