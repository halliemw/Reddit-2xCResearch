I think the worst I got was while I was at work. Some guy started telling me he was just out of prison a few months back. He showed me his prison ID and he asked what I thought about how he looked now compared to then and I was being customer service polite about it.

For the record, "I just got out of prison, can I get your number?" is not cool.

At work I've also gotten this one twice, by men who looked in their 30s and I looked 17 at the time, "I'm sure we can work out some *other* form of payment for that Big Mac." EW, NO.

EDIT: For the record all of these happened on the graveyard shift.
