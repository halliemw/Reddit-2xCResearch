If you like being independent than maybe you should keep with your child free life. My fiance and I would never be able to travel and do the things we do if we went through with our pregnancy. It's a choice that will make you very anxious and will be especially be hard without strong support. Just know that you as a women should not feel guilty for your decisions.

P.s. We are both adopted and adoption isn't always as rosy as some people make it out to be.
