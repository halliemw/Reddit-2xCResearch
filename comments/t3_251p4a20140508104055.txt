I disagree. If I come to the site and see a section specifically dedicated to women that is nonetheless overrun with sexist comments and misogyny, my immediate reaction would not be that it's great that there's a place for women. It would be that this is a site that has not the faintest idea what women actually want in a forum and that it's no different from anywhere else on the internet.

While I agree with your reasoning in theory, in practice, it just doesn't work this way. The fact that TwoX is now flooded with trolls means that what could have been pointed to as a space for women now looks like the complete opposite of what's intended.
