You know, if I didn't have my husband through this whole experience I don't know what I would have done. Sometimes he was amazing and sometimes he was a real prick. We watched my dad go from the man I remembered (a more interesting, active, intelligent man than most people I've ever met) to someone who couldn't eat, walk, shower or poop without help. 

My husband was amazing through this whole thing. Every time we visited he was so helpful and charming and positive and my dad loved him so much. My husband was never taken aback at how my dad's appearance had changed and was so accepting of the whole thing. 

I guess this is why I don't understand why your ex- SO needs space during this time. I guess everyone is different! I would suggest lots of gifts of snacks and I would offer to help out with his dad whenever possible (my dad's husband was taking out piles of trash, doing laundry and cleaning wounds every day. He was always grateful for our help). 

I hope this helps you in some way.
