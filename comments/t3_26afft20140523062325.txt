At the age of 18 i decided to have a rhinoplasty (nose job) i was always self concious when it came to my nose but after going "under the knife" i have to say its the best thing i have ever done (apart from become a mother obviously) i would say that the decision to have surgery should be taken seriously and be considered on an individual basis. but for me... i have never looked back!!
