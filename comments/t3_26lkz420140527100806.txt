I wish I knew these existed before! I went on a trip to China a few years ago, and 80% the toilets I went to were a hole in the ground. Sometimes a dirty, stinking, fly-surrounded hole, and sometimes a nice porcelain toilet-looking hole. But a hole nonetheless.

To anyone who is traveling, look up the toilet culture at wherever you're going :P and consider getting this.
