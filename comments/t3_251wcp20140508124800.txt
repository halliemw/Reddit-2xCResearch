I think there are a lot of women on reddit, we just hide our gender for the same reason we hide it when we play multiplayer and things like that. We see the sexism, we see memes like good guy greg getting upvoted with sayings that are very gender neutral, and we see memes with good girl gina get upvoted that primarily say stuff like "comes home late from work, still gives me a blowjob." We see it, and we don't wanna deal with it.
