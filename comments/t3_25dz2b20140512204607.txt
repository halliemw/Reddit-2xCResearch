Not me but a friend of mine and I were on a bus going to the beach in Uruguay and she had the window seat. Her arm was leaning on the window in a comfortable position, and it wasn't in anyone else's space or anything like that. The man sitting behind her kind of leaned forward and put his hand against the window so that he could reach forward in the gap between the window and the seat. He started touching her elbow and she would move it away every time. Eventually he decided that wasn't enough so he started rubbing her arm and softly stroking her elbow. I saw him do it and we both speak fairly good Spanish but we didn't call him out on it.
