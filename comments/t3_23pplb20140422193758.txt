Let's point out that changing your body deliberately to be more sexually attractive makes you a rather difficult example of body positivity.

* Edit:  Wow, people really hate this idea.  The definition of body positive is loving your body, as it is, whether it's fat, skinny, disabled, or flat chested.  It generally doesn't include "and surgically altering it."  Can you be a wonderful role model after plastic surgery?  Absolutely.  Can you represent "body positivity"?  Not so much.
