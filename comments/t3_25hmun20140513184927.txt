My favorite discription of manslpaining of all time is in this [article](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/08/problem-men-explaining-things-rebecca-solnit). 

It's an article written by a woman who wrote a book, only to have a man try to explain her own book to her, badly, because it doesn't occur to him, that she may understand the subject matter, much less have written the book herself. 

My favorite quote: Women "are told that they are not reliable witnesses to their own lives".
