For the record, if I was required to pay for anything, I'd expect a role in making decisions about it. In this case, that would mean a man's consent to the abortion of his fetus. It would mean a man's consent to pregnancy, to how you approach prenatal care, prenatal diagnosis, maternity care, and birthing. If you want 100% control, you assume 100% of the cost. Or, you can be married and financially responsible for one another. I think requiring a man to pay for your own care is a slippery slope.
