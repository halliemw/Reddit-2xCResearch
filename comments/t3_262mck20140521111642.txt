I don't know if this will be helpful, but I have social anxiety and just got married.  I was terrified about having to be around so many people for SO LONG, but after a little breakdown the night before I managed to get through the wedding okay.  My conversations were basically "Hey, how have you been?" "Did you like the food/decor/music?" "I love your dress" and other generic things - whatever will get the OTHER person talking so that I could just sit back and let them carry the conversation.  

One small piece of advice I can give is that it may be a good idea not to drink alcohol (if you do drink normally).  It's tempting as a "social lubricant" and especially at weddings, but it can exacerbate social anxiety and I usually end up worse off for it.
