I was in elementary school and my mom was helping me with my geography homework.  Well more like she was yelling at me for my bad grade on it. I got up went to the bathroom, saw I was bleeding, then went back and sat down for another 45 minutes of my mom angry. Then I quietly told her and she exploded with happiness and gave me a bunch of pads. With wings!
