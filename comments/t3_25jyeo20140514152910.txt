I live in the northeast. I want to file a restringing order. The big issue right now is having no idea where he is. He could be living a street away or he could be back in his home country. There were issues with his not so legal status during the trial. Do they need his address for me to file a restraining order? A friend of mine is lending me their pepper spray for right now until I get my own. After all this advice I signed up for a self defense class on Saturday. Getting a gun where I am is one hell of a process, but I think I'll start it. A family member of mine that I live with has a gun and keeps it locked in our house. Although that doesn't help me if he comes after me when she isn't here :/ Thank you for this advice.
