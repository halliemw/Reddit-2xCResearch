There are other alternatives to the pill form of birth control. A copper IUD has no hormones. It can, in some cases, cause heavier bleeding or cramping, but not always. An IUD like the Mirena has a very low dose of hormones concentrated to your reproductive area, unlike the pill. They're internal so there's no pill packages to worry about. Nuvaring is hormonal, but another internal option. Implanon is a hormonal implant for your arm that no one can see. The Nuvaring needs to be changed every three weeks, but IUDS and Implants are good for a few years depending on the type you choose. 

The effects of HBC vary wildly from person to person, there's no telling how it will effect you until you actually try it, sadly. They do make lower dose oral BC pills if you're concerned about the hormones.

I think the bottom line is though, no one can FORCE you to take birth control if you don't really want to, and don't let someone pressure you into taking it. It is your body. It's also within your SO's rights to cut off sexual activity if birth control is his condition for safe sex. If you cannot come to an agreement of the BC issue, it may be a dealbreaker.
