Well, it could be a mere observation.

And not related to losing weight (if you gain muscle and lose fat, you'll look smaller).

Anyway, people do notice - whether it's fortunate or unfortunate, it's just one of the things our species does.  If people don't want anyone to ever comment on appearance, I suppose that viewpoint will take hold.  But over many years, I've noticed that women continually bring up weight/food/appearance issues (even in settings where one wouldn't expect it).  If people want that to stop, there's a lot of work to do.
