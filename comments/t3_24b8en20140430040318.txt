That handbook is horrifying.

This reminds me of what I've heard about models and their work.  I'm not entirely sure how I feel about unions (I don't really have enough information to have an informed opinion on them), but I know that models want a union and I think that perhaps if they did it might protect them from the long hours and working conditions that they endure.
