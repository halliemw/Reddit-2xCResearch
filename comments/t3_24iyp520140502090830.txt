I can't comment on what the dress code is in China.  Though I don't understand why it would matter to a high school not in China.  

What your teacher is doing seems to be part of a power struggle.  Like others have said be calm and rational and keep documenting what your teacher is doing.  

If you make a complaint reiterate the part where your teacher is not following the guidelines put forth by the school in terms of dress codes.  If your Chinese teacher is offended by the dress code why is she not addressing that through approved channels?  I'm sure she can make a complaint to the principal or through the teacher's union?  Rules should be applied fairly throughout the school this reduces confusion for staff and students.  Teachers can't just up and decide to discard rules they don't particularly like and adhere to ones they do.  Just like students can't decide which rules they can or cannot follow.  

Please don't let her kill your scholarly interest in learning Chinese.  I have known so many people who have changed their majors or quit a subject based on a bad experience with a teacher.
