I have a daughter, for whom I had a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Then I had 3 pregnancy losses. I started seeing a therapist after the second loss. I got pregnant again, and had a lot of anxiety and fear, which I talked to my therapist about. I really wanted to relax and enjoy my pregnancy, like I had with my daughter, but it was really hard. At every milestone, I hoped I could just stop being so afraid, but it was hard. 
The story does have a happy ending, though, since I am sitting here, typing with one hand, holding a wiggly almost one year old boy with the other. You will be able to do this, but it will take some help. It sounds like you have the resources, so congratulations! Here's wishing you a healthy pregnancy and an easy birth!
