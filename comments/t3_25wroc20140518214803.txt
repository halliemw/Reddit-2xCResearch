I've never been to burlesque shows but I had a time when I went to strip clubs about 10 times in a year or so. It was a lot of fun! I'm not into women, either, but I went with a dudefriend who was. I got some lap dances but I preferred the stage shows.

Asses were always covered (well, by a G-string) but boobs often weren't. Many of the customers were a little gross or shitty, but the dancers were all really beautiful and impressive. 

I don't understand how burlesque differs from run of the mill stripping in any way besides a weird proclivity to shoehorn weird shit (Star Wars! Video Games! Steam punk!) into it.
