Fellow desk-jobber trying to eat better and exercise, here are a few things I do that might help you. I pack my lunches the night before, and plan them to include a variety of fruits and veggies, as well as some good protein so I won't be hungry. Pack a few snacks if you think you'll want them too. I find it's easier to pick healthy choices when you aren't hungry/about to eat. An example lunch might be half a cut up apple with peanut butter, a handful of baby carrots, some broccoli, some mushrooms, some radishes, and some snap peas with a little bit of ranch for dipping, a cup of greek yogurt, and a hard boiled egg or some tuna salad with whole grain crackers. I'll switch up what fruits and veggies I put in there so I don't get bored, and I keep dried fruit and nuts at my desk as snacks.

I also put 30 minutes on my calendar every day to take a walk. Some days I end up being too busy or I just miss it, but at least every day there are 30 minutes when people aren't trying to grab meetings with me that I can take to walk around the building. Some of my coworkers also do it, and we help remind each other. Someone else recommended a pedometer like a fitbit. You might not even need something so hi-tech though--remember when those ones you clip on your belt were the hot item in athletic equipment? They're like ten bucks, and they'll do a good job of keeping you mindful of how much you're moving around during the day. It can be a good reminder to get out of your chair sometimes at work.
