I have naturally greasy skin, too, and it just sucks. I typically don't wear much if any makeup, but I really like this stuff from Bare Minerals called Mineral Veil or something. Basically, it's clear powder and you're supposed to put it on after your foundation, but because I usually am fine with my skin besides the shine, I like to just put it on my bare face to control shine. It doesn't hide anything like most makeup, it just sort of diffuses the shiny part. Also you can buy rice paper or oil absorbing sheets, which are good for when you look in a mirror in the middle of the day and go, "Oops, I'm super shiny!" You just pat your face with it to absorb the oily bits. You could also consider something like a tinted Chapstick or lip gloss if you want something very subtle to give your face some definition. I don't know whether that falls outside your no makeup rule for yourself or not, but I find that it's a confidence booster when I'm in certain situations but still don't want a full face of makeup.

And a last tip: stay hydrated! About 2 liters of water a day is good for most people, or more if you feel like you need it. When I'm hydrated, my skin and my hair are much better behaved. It's one of those things where your health affects your appearance, and chronic dehydration tends to make everything more oily and dryer all at the same time.
