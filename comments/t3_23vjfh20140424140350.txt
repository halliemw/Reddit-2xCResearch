There's another generic for seasonique called daysee. I'm currently on it with no issues. Also, I used to take camrese (my pharmacy never has it now) and it is an authorized generic, made by the same company that makes seasonique (teva) so it shouldn't have been any different than the brand name. Authorized generics have the same active and inactive ingredients as their brand counterparts. But I know everyone reacts differently to medications. Maybe try Daysee? It's not an authorized generic though.
