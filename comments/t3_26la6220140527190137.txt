The fact that you actually believe he hasn't done meth since January shows that you still haven't come to the realization that EVERYTHING he has said to you is lies. Stop believing anything he says. He has lie to you hundreds of times!! Why do you keep believing him. Go no contact, and get a restraining order immediately.

I'd also suggest counseling as your sense of self is crushed if you somehow keep believing a single word he says.
