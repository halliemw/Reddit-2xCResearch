First of all, you did not fuck up. Sounds like you were blissfully (and I DO mean blissfully!) unaware that you were causing anyone any discomfort. 

You apologized. At this point all of the onus is on your neighbors to either get the fuck over it, or get fucked. Jealousy is a mighty powerful thing and hearing you, and your very lucky friend, enjoying yourselves so freely may have triggered some of that in those folks who would just love to experience that kind of thing in their own lives, but for whatever reasons find themselves lacking. 

Being a little embarrassed is natural. But, so is sex, so don't beat yourself up.
