>So due to this amount of stress and no time for exercise, I have been gaining weight.

Your eating habits are more important than exercise for your weight, but I'd like to note that exercise can go a long way into decreasing your stress and increasing your energy and sense of well-being. 

It might be wise to try to work in some physical activity, no matter how small or short, into your routine just so you don't burn out. Things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking or biking somewhere if the time difference is insubstantial, and doing a quick routine of crunches, sit-ups, squats, jumping jacks, or what have you when you take a short break from your work. [Walking helps us think better](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/do-the-right-thing/201202/does-walking-make-you-smart-yes-and-in-more-ways-you-think), and even if you only have time to walk when you're also talking on the phone or pace while you're reading course material, it's better than nothing. Getting a pedometer can help you increase your amount of physical activity, even if it's a few minutes at a time.

I'm not questioning that you don't have a minute to spare, nor accusing you of currently taking the lazy route. I'm not even arguing that trying to get in some physical activity will help you with your weight loss goals. Getting in regular physical activity is extremely beneficial in managing your stress levels and that's just as important for your health as managing your weight. I know this goes counter to your post, but as someone who learned the hard way that eschewing all physical activity when my schedule was packed lead to worse things than weight gain, I encourage you to make sure you're managing other aspects of your health as well. Feel free to disregard if you feel like you have a handle on your stress or you literally don't have time to take 5 minute breaks. I understand.
