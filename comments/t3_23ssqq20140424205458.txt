I don't mean to sugar coat because there have been some dark days, and plans a younger me made didn't happen.  I do believe that happens anyway, child or no child though.  That said, I changed, my dreams changed, Through it all I'm glad my son is here and there is still time for travel and unfulfilled dreams.
