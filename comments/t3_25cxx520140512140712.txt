>I think people with long faces just make certain personalities uncomfortable, and they don't know how to deal with it.

But that's just it. Like, you shouldn't tell people how to behave just because you don't know how to deal with it. Following your line of thinking, they are literally telling you to look a certain way for their own comfort. That's super rude, and I've never heard of it happening to a man. (not from a stranger, anyway)
