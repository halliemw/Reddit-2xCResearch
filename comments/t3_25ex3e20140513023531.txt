The question is "Do you trust him?"

You can talk more about the "lap dance". Honestly I think if it was clothed it would not that big of a deal to me. Soccer mums go to pole dancing classes, some people aren't as inhibited and doesn't place as much stock in borderline risqu√© things. Or maybe they were just joking between friends and each knew that. Talk to him about it. If you trust him there's no more to it, you know he wouldn't really cheat on you, he knows that's crossing a line for you.

If you don't trust him (which since you're snooping in his private conversations it seems like you have no trust whatsoever) then the relationship is already over.
