Why is every legitimate response in this thread systematically downvoted?  dafaq reddit?  Grow the pants up.

I mean, yeah I get the whole default thing, but that doesn't explain the reasoning one employs to conclude that, "hey, I'm gonna downvote all the posts in this one thread on TwoX today" is a cool idea.  It makes no fricken sense!
