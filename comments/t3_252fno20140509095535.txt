I do understand how to talk to people, I was just commenting on how it was phrased by the original commenter. I realise they probably didn't mean it that way and just pointed out it's probably not good to throw that word around as if that is all guys do when they give an opinion, apparently a lot of people seem to disagree with me about that though(judging from the downvotes anyway)
