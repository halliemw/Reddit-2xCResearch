I haven't had one in maybe 4 months or so but I used to get them often. Usually it was like a burst of extreme happiness and energy that would make me want to run around and shout and I couldn't keep still. I would often do something stupid during it, like spend too much money internet shopping or one time I painted my living room at 2am. 

Sometimes it would be a really dark turn, where I could only think about everything bad and my paranoia would be out of control. Like I would think that the time left on the microwave was how long I had left to live or that my cat meowing at the door to be let in was a demon.
