I know a lot of people have this idea in their head that the aggressors aren't really aggressors at all; they're simply socially awkward or somewhere low on the autism scale (whole separate bag of dbaggery, but tl:dr; is stop co-opting disorders to excuse your entitled, grotesque ways), and when it's coupled with this concept of femininity (good girls don't raise their voices, good girls don't make scenes, good girls don't swear, good girls are nurturing, good girls are empathetic) we get hit with this idiotic double whammy.

First, we endure the harassment, then we endure undue judgement for daring to enforce our boundaries, for not patiently explaining to the entitled creep why it is inappropriate for him to cup a hand on my bottom while I wait for the traffic light to change so I can cross the street. Claiming I owe someone who would do this a polite and non-threatening explanation of why this behaviour is not acceptable is just more entitlement.

*And* it's treated always in a vacuum; this *one guy* this *one time* did this *one thing* omg why are you making such a big deal out of it. Except we don't live in a vacuum, and when they see or hear about this *one guy* this *one time* doing this *one thing* they fail to see that it's a part of a bigger pattern. And the bigger pattern is exhausting, so exhausting.

I don't know if you would find this useful or not, but the [Everyday Sexism](http://everydaysexism.com) project is a strange sort of reassuring. I haven't contributed, and I feel awful this sort of thing is so widespread a project like this is successful, but there's a weird bit of *it's not just me*.
