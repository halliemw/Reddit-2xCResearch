As someone who's ex has also gone through something similar, it's a little disheartening to hear people still use verbage like "She let it drag on" or "she took a long time". I think this is -clearly- an issue that is something anyone can experience, so I don't mean to say that your kind of talk puts down women, but it certainly puts down victims.
I don't know about your ex, but mine was never "at fault" for her emotional scars, or for whatever steps she took to either seek help or even -not- seek help, or even for the time it took her to heal and not see abuse everywhere she went.  
Bottom line to OP, though, never ever feel that whatever you have to do to feel strong enough to go to the authorities is not good enough. 


TL:DR, Don't blame the victim.
