Same here. I was embarrassed about it and hid my underwear. My mom was annoyed when she found them, which just made me feel worse. If I ever have a daughter, this is one of those things I'm going to plan for because I remember just how awkward and uncomfortable it was to not really know what was going on. Sex ed made it seem like it was going to be an obvious liquid blood flow and it just wasn't.
