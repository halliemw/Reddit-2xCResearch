"The parties being husband and wife, the sexual intercourse between the two does not come within the ambit of the offence of rape, even if the same was against the will and consent of the victim." 

Puke. 

And I'm sorry, but isn't the entire last half of that statement pretty much a direct logical contradiction? Does this guy even know how the definition of rape works? 

Evidently not, since apparently marital rape is still not illegal in India.
