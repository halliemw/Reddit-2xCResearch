If you got those, be sure to hold it where instructed and put it in all the way until your fingers hit yourself, then use the applicator wand part. That should help get it up to a comfortable place, but you'll have to see what works for you - admittedly I haven't used a tampon in a verrrry long time, but that brand is lovely. Tried cardboard once, very awkward, hard to insert..
