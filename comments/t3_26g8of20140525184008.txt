The guy felt completely disconnected and rejected by everyone around him. <sarcasm>Unlike your average 22-year old male, his thoughts were particularly focused on women</sarcasm>. Honestly, that's not really the part of his story that spoke of misogyny.

A lot of the importance he placed on relationships with women was he saw female affections as determining status of males. I'm not even sure if that makes him a misogynist (probably), but it sure seems like he was reacting to perceived (and I don't mean that like it wasn't really there) _misogyny all around him_.
