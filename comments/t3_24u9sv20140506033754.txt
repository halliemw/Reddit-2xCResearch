I don't know if it will be any consolation to you, but you're not alone. I had problems with incontinence when I was 15-16, and it was similar to what you've described, always caused by laughing.

One time I peed myself when I was at an amusement park with a guy I had a crush on. It was the worst time because I couldn't hide it without tying my hoodie around my waist, so I had to tell him. I was really lucky because he was my older brother's friend and a really nice guy, so he didn't make a big deal of it or tell anyone else, but of course I still felt utterly humiliated. Another memorable time I peed myself was once right before my choir was going to go on stage for a big performance at a choral festival. Nobody noticed (or at least no one said anything), but it was really stressful.

In my case it eventually just stopped happening. I never had any specific treatment for it, but I'm pretty sure it was related to my mental health issues. I still deal with chronic depression and anxiety, but they're much less severe than they were when I was in my mid-teens, which was unquestionably the lowest point in my life. I'm in my thirties now and the incontinence hasn't recurred.

Incontinence is really not that uncommon, especially in women. I know a woman who ended up getting stress incontinence after giving birth. She had to get surgery for it. I bet a lot of people have struggled with incontinence at some point in their lives.

Anyway, I sympathize, because I've been there. I hope there's some sort of simple treatment to solve the issue for you and that in the meantime you don't have any especially embarrassing episodes.
