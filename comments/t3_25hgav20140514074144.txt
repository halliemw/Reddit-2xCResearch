I was so pissed listening to this on the radio today.  The entire time I was thinking of a good title to post on TwoX.  I came up with "Chaperones 'can't' stop oogling teen student at her prom.  She gets kicked out despite the fact her dress met the school's dress code.  

Ugh, if these grown men "can't" stop oogling an underage girl, then they shouldn't be having kids, working outside the home, or being around women at all.
