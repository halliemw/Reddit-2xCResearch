I am happy this is being discussed.

And I wish people would stop saying and thinking things like rape being worse than death and that its better to fight to death than allow someone to rape you. 

I chose otherwise. When I realized they were much stronger than me, that I was not able to escape and that they were using more force if I fought I just stopped. I decided that it was better for me to get raped but remain otherwise unharmed. They would either rape me or beat me and rape me. I thought, that the rape would last some time but I would be able to walk away, no one would have to know and I could keep wearing my t-shirt and some day have kids. Damage control. 

So I stopped fighting back and just lied there, staring at the brick-wall. Thinking to myself it would not be forever. They would stop eventually.

I suppose in the eyes of law and reddit that's consent and not real rape. However, after a while, when my rapists didn't get a reaction from me even if they slapped me or janked my hair, one of them called me boring and the other one figured there was something wrong with me. They stopped and left. They probably wouldn't have, would I have kept fighting.
