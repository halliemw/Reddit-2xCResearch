it all depends on why the person is on antidepressants, what their diagnosis is, and if there seems to be a family history of mental illness.   The article picks antidepressants but the author seems to overlook uses for the drugs that are not Depression.    I know a few people with fibro myalgia who have better sleep and less symptoms when put on a particular class of antidepressants. 

Here is my dilemma:  I'm looking for a father for my future kids, not just a romantic mate.   While I realize it's not always the case, there does seem to be some genetic link for many types of abnormal brain chemisty.  Yes I know i am not perfect myself and I recognize nobody has zero genetic flaws.  It's just that I've met kids who were born from one or both parents having serious brain chemistry issues.  I have seen firsthand an early age the child is having unusual behavioral issues, being put on psych meds, struggling to interact with peers, and dare I say often unhappy.  I want to do everything I can to bring the healthiest happiest kids into the world.    

Along the same lines, I would prefer not to date someone with sickle cell at this point in my life, as it is also inheritable and can be serious.

I have no problem with befriending someone with mental illness.  Or even dating them, before i wanted kids.   I don't think any less of them as people.  They have my sympathy and compassion.
