I'm almost at the end of 3 years of having the nexplanon (so I'll need to get it replaced soon) and I've found some similar issues to you at the start. In the first 6 months I'd have veryyyy long periods - like 3 weeks on, 2 weeks off then on again etc. However after ~6 months this settled out and now I have really light periods and occasional spotting. For me personally it's been great and I'm definitely gunna get it replaced. 

A year does seem like a long time though for this to be settling out, but as you've stuck it out this long maybe give it a little more time and see?
