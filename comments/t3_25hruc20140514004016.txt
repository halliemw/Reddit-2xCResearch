You're letting the internet get to you. It paints the world a shittier shade of brown than it is. It exaggerates every trend . If the world is an ocean, than reddit is a sieve that collects interesting floating things so you end up with much more turds than expected. 

By far, most couples I know are relatively the same age (+\- 3 years). By far, most people socialize among their age group because of logistics (if you work you work and meet people at work, if you are a student you meet people at uni) and because of interests. I remember being 23-24 and to me a 30+ man **could** in principle be attractive but he would have to add something extra to the table to make me choose him over someone my own age. By far what I valued as a young adult was being able to share new experiences together. Have my own apartment, go to a music festival, go camping etc. someone who has been there, done that can still enjoy them but cannot really match me. The older they were, the less stuff we had in common and the older they looked (i noticed that my attraction matches the age I am. So at 12 I liked 12 year olds. At 24 I liked 24 year olds. And now I think 24 year olds look like babies and I like people my own age). And I was weary of people who chose me **for** my age. I could sniff that like a bad odour and it turned me off instantly. 

Seriously, go out and just make friends and share hobbies. Meet people as much as possible. 


And for goodness sake do 't call it husband hunting *gag*. Meet people, see if you share values, see if it works out, if not break up. Then think of long term potential. Dating in your 20s would not have guaranteed you a husband. Regardless of age you go through several relationships all seemingly ok at first, to find someone compatible for life. It's not shopping, it's poker (a bit of luck and a bit of skill).
