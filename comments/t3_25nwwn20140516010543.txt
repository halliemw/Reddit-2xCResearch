I've always been very slender my whole life, but also fairly tall. Any time anybody has told me I lost weight, it's usually followed by "are you okay?" or a related question that insinuates I'm not taking care of myself. Sometimes they straight up ask if I'm eating properly. It hurts me, because I have a genetic condition that, among other things, makes me have a lot of food sensitivities. I have to be very careful with what I eat, but I make sure to get all proper exercise and nutrition to keep me healthy. I'm so on top of it, that it insults me that people think they know how I should be taking care of myself better than I do. I just think, in general, talking about weight is not appropriate. I've learned that I have to draw the line with people when they mention it, and instead of shrugging it off I say, "I would prefer if my weight wasn't a topic of discussion. I don't find it appropriate.".
