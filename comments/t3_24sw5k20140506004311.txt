Ah, sorry - I thought that you were talking about OP, not yourself! 

In any case, it's all water under the bridge now. We all move on, and learn from our mistakes. A close friend of mine was in a similar situation around three months ago. She'd known that she had feelings for someone else, but took a couple of months to break it off with her boyfriend, so she could start clean with the other person. She's so much happier now, but admits she could have handled it so much better. She'll know for next time, if there ever is a next time.
