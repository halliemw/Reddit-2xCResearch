My good adult advice is that lying is bad. On the other hand, were I in your position, I would have lied. I'm not officially *telling* you to lie, because lying is bad, but... yes. Just saying. They're not being reasonable in the slightest, and this is coming from an adult perspective. 

Still, there's other options. If you ask your dad, like I said, he could just give you what you need so that he doesn't have to face the fact that his baby girl has boobs now. Or maybe just tell your mother you want to buy some new clothes for school, and don't specify you mean to buy bras?

>OK, tell me straight up - if you do a bra "fitting" do the store women, like, grab your boobs and measure them? That seems SO freaky - I could never let some strange woman do that, I think. Or do they measure you, like, through your clothes?? I might could handle that. Maybe.

Yeah, if you don't want them to grope you directly, wear a thin shirt. If you're wearing something thick like a sweater, they pretty much do need you to take off your shirt to get a good measurement, but if you wear a thin one they can just work around it. And if you're uncomfortable with even that, you can always try the old fashioned method of just trying on like four sizes of each style of bra until you find one that fits okay. 

The measurement really isn't freaky, though. Generally, they just measure around your ribcage under your boobs, and then around the fullest part of your bust. They might need to kind of put their arms around you for this, but yeah, they shouldn't need to really grab a boob or anything.
