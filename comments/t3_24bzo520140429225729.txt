Hasn't this been happening for awhile? It's super nice to have studies proving it though.  

The r/science comments bring up some interesting things to think about when thinking about these studies, but I'm feeling a lot of them are really trying to find something that fits their confirmation bias.   

Maybe not and I'm just overthinking it.
