>plus he has taken out two loans against his 401k.

Cars are a great hobby for men. But this is where I believe he's stepped over the line of hobby versus obsession. 

I'm not into cars in the least but lots of people around me are. My boyfriend bought a money pit of a vehicle last November and has spent considerable time and money on the silly thing to get it just how he wants it. He has not *once* spent money he did not have on it. He only buys what's financially reasonable for him at the time and he tries to not bite off more than he can chew. It's self-control and restraint. He can look from afar at the flashy new body kit or drool over luxury cars from afar. It seems that many of his friends don't know what the word restraint is and it looks like their lives suffer because of it. They have decked out rides but don't eat, or don't do this or that because they just dropped a grand on a new paint job. These people have little financial responsibility. Do you want to be with someone so financially irresponsible? Perhaps a wake up call is in order because it doesn't sound like he can *afford* all that he's doing right now.
