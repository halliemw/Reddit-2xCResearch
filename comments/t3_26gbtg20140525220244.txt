> Is he a great guy outside of this, or are you just in a bad rut emotionally where he is familiar?

Some of both. We were friends for 4 years before we dated for 1.5 years, and then we were trying to be friends again. He's also the first guy I was ever actually in love with. There are parts of his personality I gravitate to even still, but a lot of it is definitely the familiar/self-esteem thing where I think no one else would be interested. Urgh.
