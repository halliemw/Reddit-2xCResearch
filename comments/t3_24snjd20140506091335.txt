you're very right. i guess i was always curious about the actual severity of his BPD because after he stopped taking meds, he seemed more even-keeled than when he was on his antidepressants. Then again, by 19 he was being heavily medicated with lithium and a whole other cocktail of drugs that knocked him out. 

regardless, it's not my place to make any sort of judgement call about how severe his BPD is at this point; I told him that I wanted him to seek out a professional opinion to rule out any other causes or confirm the fact that his BPD is rearing its head again.
