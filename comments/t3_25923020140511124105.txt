I'm not sure what you're trying to say, exactly.

Yes, some people (men, women, other, doesn't matter) find body hair attractive.  Others don't.  That can be said of any physical attribute.

That's not what we were worried about at all.  We weren't worried about an adult finding sexual partners - we correctly assumed that once she got to that point, she'd find partners who were attracted to whatever level of hair she left on her body.  We were worried about a kid growing up getting picked on, or having self-confidence issues, or feeling like she had to go through painful hair-removal procedures to even be accepted as "normal", because she didn't fit into the cultural narrative of what little girls should look like.

You can argue that the cultural narrative is probably shaped by perception of "what men want", and that's probably at least partially correct (though there are plenty of feminine beauty ideals, such as being rail-thin with a flat butt, that have very little to do with male preferences).  

But this is irrelevant.  It doesn't matter what caused the cultural narrative, only what the cultural narrative is.  And the cultural narrative in this case is "women have hairless backs, bellies, shoulders, etc.  If you have hair there, you're a manly freak"
