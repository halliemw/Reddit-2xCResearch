I signed into my account (which I haven't touched in over a year) just to tell you this. As a 23 year-old man, DO NOT listen to anything you read at the red pill. It is utter bullshit concocted by a bunch of bitter, delusional, lonely, and socially inept men.

Thirty is not old. There is nothing about being 30 that conveys any less value to you as a person. You describe yourself as attractive, in shape, and have a graduate degree. Based on that alone, I think most nice, well-adjusted men, including myself, would jump on the chance to date you. Don't give up, OP.
