I took Wellbutrin along with Cymbalta, and it didn't do the trick for me. As an interesting side-effect, I lost quite a bit of weight (not to the point of being unhealthy). My doctor was hoping to help me with depression, anxiety, and oversleeping. Despite some results, we decided to go with Prozac which has ultimately been better for me personally. Having a good support team (Psychiatrist and therapist) really made a big difference -- I know it can be hard to find a good doctor that is covered by your insurance, but it's worth the effort!
