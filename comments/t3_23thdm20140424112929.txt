Hmmmm... Not that this is a bad thing at all, but the way you're describing your feelings kind of sounds like this is part of your grieving. Which is, again, totally fine. You've just lost two people who were very close to you, very close together, and anger is a natural feeling to have during this time. The way you're describing your anger sounds a little bit like you might be getting angrier than you normally would at his actions. (Even though I would totally have the same reaction.) I'm not going to suggest feeling any other way, because dang it, you feel how you feel. Just try to remind yourself for a while that you are grieving, and we aren't always ourselves during that time. You might also want to remind your partner of the same if you decide to talk to him about how upset he made you.
