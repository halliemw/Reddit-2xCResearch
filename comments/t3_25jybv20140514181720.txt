This pretty much was a CMV post, I just didn't know there was a super special name that it should be called. As I have said in some of my other replies I think I largely agree with everything you are saying now that I have a bit more info. With that said, I was never claiming to have control over someone else's body, just that I was unsure of the rights an unborn fetus may have. The way I was seeing before this was that these people were being murdered against their will, I see now that it is a little different than that. Thank you.
