As a former graphic designer, I agree. I've worked places where I was marketing staff, and I've worked places where I was considered administrative staffâ€”where my boss was the head of Administration, making her the boss of reception and the HR assistant as well.

It's hard in non-agency environments, because they want you do go so far beyond your original role. It takes a special type of person to work in-house positions and you sort of have to just roll with the punches. The only time I'd say no is if I had a male co-worker in the same position who did not get invited. But if it seems like they're just inviting her for inclusion and to appreciate her for her work in a non-sexist way, I would definitely go. It'd be a great time to explain to others what my work actually entailed.
