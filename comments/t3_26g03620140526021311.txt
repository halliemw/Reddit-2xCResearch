Generally when people talk about "the system", they're not compartmentalising the way you're doing here. 

Yes, the mental health treatment system is much more successful at rehabilitation (especially since prisons have tended to abandon any pretence of trying for rehabilitation in the last few decades). But that's only a component of "the system".

And I think we're going to have to disagree about whether "creepy" is the right word to describe youtube videos threatening to slaughter a bunch of college girls.
