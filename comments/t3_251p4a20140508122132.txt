The comments you're talking about were completely out of place and were not designed to help the discussion. The comments referred to were designed to insult and belittle someone who had come here for support. It's so frustrating to see comments which do not offer any useful advice, and if anyone points that out and down-votes them, someone steps in to say, "no! we should be patting this person on the back! rape victims *need* to be patronised!". 

The problem with these "prevent rape happening advice" is that it is usually in the form of someone making sweeping generalisations and making themselves feel superior to someone who needs support. Saying, after the fact, "*obviously* you shouldn't drink that much!" isn't helpful in any way, and ignores the fact that millions of people live their lives, taking small risks every day - we all deserve that freedom, and it's no use treating someone like an imaginary character, where they can live a full life inside a protective bubble they've created. People choose to take calculated risks, and that's ok. They still deserve sympathy if they get hurt.

If someone made a thread asking, "how can I look out for myself and my friends and stay safe?", that would be the right time to give advice. But any advice should acknowledge two things; 1. People naturally will want to live their lives to their fullest, and shouldn't be belittled for that and 2. Men can be victims of rape and other violence too.
