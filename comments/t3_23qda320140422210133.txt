That's a relief to hear.  I'm normally not this emotional about anything like this, so its a surprise to me that I'm still wounded over it. I feel like my family is also building me up about it as well.  My sisters in general are saying that I should break up with him about it, so I've been conflicted about it as well.  I'm so glad that you guys aren't coddling me.  I feel like everyone I've talked to have been coddling me, and telling me that he should go to prom with me.  They are just setting me up with failure.  

Thanks, I guess its just the stupid teen hormones kicking in. :)
