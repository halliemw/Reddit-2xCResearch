Some of the books that really changed how I felt about myself as a woman are part of the Discworld series, I.e *Wyrd Sisters*, *Witches abroad*, *Lords and Ladies*, *Maskerade* and *Carpe Jugulum*, which are written by a man: A fact that I view as a testament to the power of human imagination and empathy.
