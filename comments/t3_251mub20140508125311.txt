I think your female friend was overreacting, it IS about gender equality. I, as a woman, should be able to walk into any place of employment and obtain the same pay and position as a man, if we had the same skill sets. Feminism was originally set up because most men already had these rights, which is why we called each movement by a name (ie civil rights, feminism, ect) Everyone should just be able to do what ever they like as long as it doesn't harm anyone else.
