Thanks, that must've been a bitch!!

I am gonna start being more careful now, have ordered a load of supplements and will be trying a change in diet.

I will have to find out what the equivalent of 'abreeva' is in the uk, the only thing we seem to have is blistex...

I've also seen an electronic thing in boots which seems to have rave reviews all over the internet
