>but you're still kinda acting like a jerk

How so?

>There's lots of girls that have problems in relationships too

I don't see how criticizing the article's dating advice implies that women don't have relationship problems.

>and you're posting this in a women's sub.

I don't see how I've said anything which is hostile to women. At least, no more so than this article is hostile to men. 

>And, you know, six people just got murdered.

Four of which were men. People seem to be neglecting that fact.

>It would have been better to make one post about the guy that murders people, and a completely different post about the issues of dating.

Huh? I separated the topics into two totally different paragraphs. The two paragraphs were in response to an article which is BOTH about the murders AND dating. I didn't conflate the two. The article did. And I see no reason why the two issues shouldn't be conflated since they're directly related to one another in this situation.
