Skipping placebos works best if you're on a monophasic pill, where the level of hormones stays the same throughout the entire pill pack - this is something to be aware of. If you're on a triphasic pill, with three different levels of the progesterone hormone throughout the pack (like Tri Cyclen), skipping the placebos can lead to a lot of unwanted spotting and mood swings given that you'd be going from the highest dose straight back to the lowest dose.
