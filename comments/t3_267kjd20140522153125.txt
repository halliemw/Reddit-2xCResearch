I was only on BC for two years before I stopped. I never really felt like I had too many side effects while I was on it, but the week after I stopped taking it I immediately felt less bloated, my skin was less dry, my libido came back, and I was more clear headed. 

That being said, I'm highly irregular now and when it comes, it COMES. But I know that every emotion I feel is how my body TRULY feels, instead of just my hormones spiraling out of control every time an SPCA commercial is on TV.

I recommend going off, but that being said, every month I'm seized with terror that I'm pregnant. Stay safe!
