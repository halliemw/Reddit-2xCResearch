It sounds like your friend is being a bit selfish here.  If he likes you, I think you should go for it.  She's already got a boyfriend.  It would be one thing if he was her ex, but she doesn't really have a claim to a crush at this point.  She might be mad for a bit, but she can decide if she wants to end the friendship over this.  If she does, she wasn't a friend worth having.
