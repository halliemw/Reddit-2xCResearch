I just asked my wife that question, and her reply was, word for word:  

"What? No. Are you crazy? I'm not a paranoid schizophrenic."  

I really don't get the constant fear, and that fact that my wife doesn't either tells me it isn't a gender thing. She grew up out here in the country though, maybe it has something to do with the fact that she was raised in a safe place?  

I don't like not understanding things, and I am having a really hard time understanding your point of view. I want to, I really do, but the closest I can come to the mindset of always being afraid was when I was in prison, but that is eliminated by your qualifier of "regardless of how safe your environment is".
