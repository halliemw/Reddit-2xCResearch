I feel that in the workplace you shouldn't talk about people's bodies/appearance.  Whether it's a compliment, or gossiping behind their back, it just feels inappropriate to me.  

I think it's ok to say, "I like your outfit.  My wife has a sweater just like that."  

I think it's incredibly rude to say, "I like your small boobs.  My wife has small boobs like that."
