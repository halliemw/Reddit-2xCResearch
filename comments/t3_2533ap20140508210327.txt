Eh. I don't think he meant to come off like that. Was what he said inappropriate? Yeah. Was he trying to say that his personal preference is more important than helping sick kids? I have my doubts. I think it was just off-hand comment that came out wrong in every way possible.

I think we've all at one time or another said something really bad that had just come out wrong, or had the filters for our minds just let something slip by.

I second the props to OP for donating her hair.
