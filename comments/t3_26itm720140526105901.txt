It's pretty common. I didn't have my period for 3 years (I am going on year 11 of using contraceptive).

My period only came back after I became pregnant due to a birth control fail (which was very shocking considering I was not getting any periods and never missed a birth control pill). 

My doctor wasn't surprised by my missing periods either. Even though it was nice not to have to deal with getting a period, it does serve as a nice "you're not pregnant!" message.
