This is awesome advice. As an added note for safety, I know it's really uncomfortable, but be sure you do tell at least one trusted friend whats going on and that you're going to have this conversation. If you're really uncomfortable talking to him alone, maybe they could come with and sit outside while you talk or something. I don't know this guy and I don't want to make assumptions, but if things get out of hand and it becomes a big argument it's so so so good to have someone to help you leave the situation and be there to help you process whatever the outcome is. I'm so so sorry you're dealing with this, but you're being proactive and taking action which is an AMAZING first step
