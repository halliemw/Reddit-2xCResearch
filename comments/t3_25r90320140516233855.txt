It's starting to get really bad here.  I got a "show me your pussy" message from a throwaway  within seconds of posting this. Being default is sending a lot of  odious traffic here, and a notable portion of that traffic has branched out and hit related communities. I know r/girlgamers is dealing with a lot more trolls than normal right now.
