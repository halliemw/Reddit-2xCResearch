Similar thing happened to me... Cousin was getting married and hosting reception in a small-ish restaurant. I was invited for the shower, church ceremony and after dinner drinks, but not the actual reception. At first it made sense and I understood, but the closer the date got the more it annoyed me and upset me. Why invite people who will be excluded from part of the festivities? Why expect a gift at the shower if the guest isnt really considered a guest by the couple? 

The most annoying part was that the ceremony was in the afternoon, and the 'after-dinner cocktails' were not until 9PM+. By the time the cocktail hour came around, I had been all dressed up for half the day, killing time, and the celebration was clearly underway. It definitely was an easy way to feel like the bride shafted me.

Never invite someone unless they are invited to everything!!!
