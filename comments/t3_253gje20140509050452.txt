> You can control your dang boners, you are a self aware human being

We can't control that part of our bodies. It's especially a problem for many younger men and sexual assault survivors...

PTSD...

> I wish I could forget.

People really need to realize it's like a time machine. 

But when it's at work? You're handling this better than I would have. 

> suggestive skirts 

The entire history of the human race reveals that if it wasn't "suggestive" skirts, it would be "suggestive" pants, or even "suggestive" eyes.

Which means that in the spirit of good faith, men will also need to start wearing sweats and sunglasses, so we don't accidentally turn on any gay/bi/pan men. We wouldn't want them thinking we were the kind of men who tease all damn day just for attention and free drinks. 

Also, men with sexy voices? Need to shut up. Tall men need to hunch over. Men who sweat? Fines should cover it.
