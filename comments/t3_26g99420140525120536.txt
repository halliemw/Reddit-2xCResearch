Fuck those comments saying you're overreacting or dismissing your concerns by suggesting your 65 year old boss is entitled to make unwanted advances towards you. That is such bullshit and it's the prevalence of these opinions that build the foundation for a hostile workplace culture towards women especially, as you noted, in male dominated industries.


Firstly, you have every right to feel disgusted that this 65 year old man abused his workplace professionalism to make sexual advances towards you. In what other scenario would you have endured sitting through this unwanted profession of love *by a 65 year old man*. He ignored your disinterest and took advantage of your politeness to press his point by insisting on driving you home. Of course you feel violated. He completely took advantage of his position, your niceness and the power difference between you two. He corralled you into an extremely vulnerable position by getting into his car and in different circumstances that could have had potentially frightening consequences. 


Secondly, it taints your professional experiences with this man. You just wanted to do your job and hoped his interest reflected mentorship instead of sexual interest. He complimented your dress and nails? Fuck that. You don't need that those compliments in a workplace. And moreover, he's setting a terrible example to other men in his workplace by behaving this way.


My advice, OP? Complain about him. Loudly. To your university. To his boss. To other students. This was not acceptable behaviour.
