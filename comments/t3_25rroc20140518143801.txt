>It is not just about you.

Precisely. It's about *everyone*. So why should your desire to not be confronted with possibly-uncomfortable ideas trump the right of everyone else to self-expression?

You're playing an old game, here. The trick of "label my moral preferences as objective "etiquette" and thereby impose them collectively without having my motivations examined" doesn't really fly these days.

>It is a ceremony, not a political forum.

Ceremonies aren't political now? Good luck defending *that* position.

Ceremonies are *entirely* political. If they weren't, there'd be no point in having them. Diplomas could be emailed out at a rather cheaper rate than distribution via assembly. Doesn't assuming that cost suggest a separate motive to you?
