First of all, it is okay to cry. Sometimes you need a good cry. Your bike ride is a good sign its just hormonal. But, if the crying persists for many days, go see a doctor.
That being said, don't expect your bf to understand. Guys just don't. Don't try to read into the one word text, or not answering if he is busy as anything except what it is.
If you are feeling emotional, go for a walk or a bike ride. It boosts endorphins and you get much needed vitamin D and it will keep you from  worrying about what your bf is thinking (he's not) and by not diving head first into a ben and jerry's and feeling worse.
