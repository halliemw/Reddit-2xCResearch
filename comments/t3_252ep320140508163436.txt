I was a late bloomer, didn't get mine until late 14. By then I had heard all the stories from my friends. I handled it pretty well. The only thing that sucked was that my parents were going through a separation at the time and I forgot to bring pads to my dads house and had to tell him. He's cool though, and always got me what I needed :)
