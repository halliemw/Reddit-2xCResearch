I think everyone mis-read the question.  You did start it off with "about a year ago," but beginning in the 3rd paragraph it sounds as though you're saying this happened today.  

And in that case, I wouldn't.  If he and you haven't spoken in a year, I doubt his wife would just suddenly come to your house and murder you or something without provocation.  Calling the cops probably isn't worth it.
