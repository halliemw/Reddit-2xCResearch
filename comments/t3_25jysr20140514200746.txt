The website does NOT go into detail about what each figure will be able to do, it shows a larger image and a brief set of flavor text. Nothing is said about how the toy will function. Function is a very important part of the toy, and the part of the toy that I'm suggesting may not be properly geared toward the toy-line's stated objectives. 

>Besides, even if they are, so what? Are you afraid they won't be effective action figures because they also have changeable accessories?
If the goal is to change toys so girls can tell a different story, to encourage them to change the way they think about themselves, value doing things instead of looking pretty, then changing the themeing of 'dress-up' toys from Barbie to superheros isn't going to change anything.  It's still going to encourage *how you look* is more important than *what you do* when the primary feature of the toy is change how the toy looks. Granted, the toys looks to still be in the prototyping/development stage, so the modularity look could simply be coming from the toys not being finished products yet.

And on a side note, could you please stop down-voting my comments for having a different opinion than you? I've respected your opinions thus far I would like it if you would do the same for mine.
