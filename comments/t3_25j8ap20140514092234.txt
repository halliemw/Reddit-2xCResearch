Yep, that argument makes no sense to me. It's my body and my choice. My choice to have sex, my choice to have an abortion (or a child!) if I so choose. That's like saying "well, that chlamydia is a result of your choice to have sex, so we're not going to treat you. You'll just have to deal with it."
