> don't see how shaming a women for exceeding gendered standards of sexual experience isn't a form of misogyny.

The key here is the singular versus the plural.  It does not follow that if a person scolds *a* woman or holds her in contempt, that the same person attributes any particular objectionable trait as a characteristic of women in general.

For example, there are myriad reasons to despise Hillary Clinton or Janet Reno (and I do) but I do *not* believe that their despicable personalities are typical of women in general.
