I realize that. :) Obviously it depends on the field (childless women engineers make significantly more than male counterparts), but yes, the trend is as you say.  

I stated the assumptions for my argument outright in an attempt to state that I was interested in discussing a different aspect of the problem than the unequal wages-for-same-work.

The argument "women choose lower paying jobs, of course they're paid less" is a very common way of stating that the wage-gap is not as bad as it appears. My contention is that "well maybe those jobs should be paid more", and thus indirectly helping to close that gap.
