So what happens when these "university student conduct officers" deal with these issues? If the "student conduct hearing" concludes a man raped a woman, then what happens to the man? Is he kicked out of the university, does he face any permanent criminal records? 

To me, it seems many colleges and universities tend to try and keep sexual assaults on campus a secret and THAT is why they want to personally deal with the issue. They try to keep it out of the public eye, in fear of getting a bad reputation.
