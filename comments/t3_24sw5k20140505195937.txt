I've always found that post-breakup anger so liberating. I was in a very similar situation once. It sucked, but looking back, I'm glad it happened. It gave me a really good sense of what I wanted out of a relationship. I spent a lot of time working on myself and figuring out how to be happy so I could ensure it wouldn't happen again. I've been with my current boyfriend for over four years and it's been great. 

Good luck to you, lady! The future has much to offer!
