You're not a freak unless you choose to think/act like you're one. Your boobs are here to stay. Because they arrived so quickly, you have some catching up to do. Don't wait until your mom is comfortable talking about it with you. While you work on that relationship, read up by yourself about various breast-related topics -- self-image, logistics problems caused by large breasts (like boob sweats) etc. etc. Your first task is to accept this new version of yourself. Then you can start figuring out how to respond to people's responses to your new boobs. 

My friend came out with 32dd breasts when she was 11. Freakin' 11 year old, 5' 8" skinny girl with serious boobage. Boys around us either ignored her, harbored huge awkward crushes, or hit on her (awkwardly). But that's their problem, and she dealt with it with the whole raise-one-incredulous-eyebrow trick, or reprimanded them when she thought they were out of line. The thing is though, she treated it the same way she treated any other school issue. She didn't give it any more attention than the situation needed, and she didn't try to repress anything. And with time, her boobs stopped becoming the center of attention because it was clear that she was perfectly comfortable with them.
