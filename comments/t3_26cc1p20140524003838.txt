Agreed. The problem is, they don't even realize they're doing it. Which is EXACTLY the problem. Treating this sub EXACTLY like the the rest of reddit IS the problem. 

If the mods decide to undo the defaulting, which I don't believe they will, even then we'll sort of have the good with the bad; picking up good people who actually want to be here, and getting rid of that whole "normal" reddit tone where everyone is just out to pick apart the OP.
