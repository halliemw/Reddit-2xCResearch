I have similar hair.  The best cut for me is shoulder length with lots of layers - I go to a Chinese woman who cuts it almost like an anime character.  She actually thins it out a bit more (which freaked me out at first), but tailors the layers to the shape of my head and makes it frame my face quite nicely.

If I let it grow in, it does thicken, but in the wrong areas and my thin face / neck just look emaciated.

I don't use any product or colour my hair - I use a children's detangler for frizz, which is very light.
