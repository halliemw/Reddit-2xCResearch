It's so true. I can be a little sour on religion largely because I was raised in an uber-religious household rife with physical and emotional abuse. 

When I left my religion, my mother disowned me and did not speak to me for eight years. Yet she proclaimed that she was striving to be Christ-like. I could never make sense of that. 

It is always a joy when I find people that do strive to live Christ's message of love. I think he had some great things to say. :)
