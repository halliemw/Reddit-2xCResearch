It's probably just stress- you are very unlikely to get pregnant from the activities you described. For peace of mind, you should consider using a back-up method like hormonal bc. That way if the condom breaks, you know you are still protected. Either that, or don't let your goodies touch without a condom on. 


Also, it is my completely unscientific opinion that starting an intimate relationship with a man messes with your cycle. Whenever I am with a new guy, I am a week early. Not sure if it's pheromones or the increased activity in the lady garden, but I and most of my girlfriends have experienced it. 

So, don't worry about it for now. Go do something relaxing and take a test if you are a week late.
