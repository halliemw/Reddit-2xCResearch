This was a great article.

I thank doctors who do these procedures. Without them, I would never be where I am today. I underwent an abortion two years ago. 

I became pregnant due to a birth control failure. I was high risk, the fetus was not developing as it should, and I was truly not even close to being ready (nor my SO) to take care of a child, financially, or emotionally. If abortion was illegal today, I would have never graduated university, landed a decent job, be getting married this year. I would not be financially stable. My relationship with my SO would not be where it is today.
On top of that, because I didn't find out until three months along (I had no symptoms whatsoever, and only figured it out in a sort of 'Bella Swan, Twilight' scenerio), and was taking birth control and prescription medication to control severe allergies and chronic sinitus, there was no guarantee the child would be born healthy due to the medications I was on, nor was there a guarantee that I would be able to handle the pregnancy and delivery due to my (other) health issues.

An 'abortion' doctor saved my life. It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make, and the doctor, nurse and the rest of the staff were supportive, and never made me feel like I was doing something wrong or made me a bad person which is more than I can say for how I was treated by people I actually knew, and the pro-life strangers who shamed me while picketing near the clinic.
