I've got 2 bikes. One with a step through frame, which I use to commute.  Almost all commuter bikes where I live (Amsterdam) have step through frames. And I have a cyclocross bike without a step through frame, which I take out on my adventures.

They're a different design because they have different purposes, not because I have a vagina.
