Who cares what these "studies" say? They're such a waste of money. It doesn't matter what they say. First of all, women don't all put makeup on to hide anything or to make themselves prettier. They just like it. Second, it could say that most like women without makeup or less makeup, okay that's great. If you put on makeup, how relevant is this to your life? Not one bit, because you'll most likely end up with someone who doesn't give a crap whether you put on makeup or not.
