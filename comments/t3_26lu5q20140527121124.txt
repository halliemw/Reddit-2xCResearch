This sounds similar to what my friend is going through, I'm a little worried in all honesty. She is obsessed with food and whenever she eats something remotely fatty or sugary she feels like a failure and breaks down. She works in fashion so the pressures are even harsher, I wish I could help but she has her heart set on it and is convinced she needs to do this. I want her happy and she believes that that's what being skinny will make her, but right now she's being ridiculously harsh on herself.

Oh fucking hell and that guilt free shit always gets me too. There's an advert on TV at the moment, a woman sits on the sofa debating whether to have a cookie or whatever and all these subconscious versions of her pop up. The angels telling her not to, the devils telling her to have the cookie. I'm sat on the sofa screaming "If you want a fucking cookie, have the fucking cookie!"

Drives me mad.
