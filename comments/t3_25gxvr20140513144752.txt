Well, what makes a strong female?  A woman who knows what she believes, why she believes it and will stand up for it.  She doesn't need someone to tell her she is doing well in order to feel validated but a compliment is always nice to hear.  She loves herself and doesn't need a love interest to validate her, but she could have a love interest/boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife because she met someone she loves having in her life, whom she treats with respect and expects the same from them.  She is not afraid to admit her life is a work in progress and is willing to put in the hard work necessary to get where she wants to be, that could mean in her career, as a person, physically, etc.

Portray that in a book or movie and, in my opinion, you have a strong female character.
