I'm not familiar with administrating or moderating subreddits so maybe someone who is could point out why I'm wrong, but on first glance that actually sounds like a really good idea.

It'd make way more sense to default the subs that exist to accomodate people who are new to [insert topic] and genuinely want to learn.
