Yeah, that's always been my issue with dieting. I end up "failing" because I ate some chocolate and then I feel like I should just give up and go back to less than great eating habits. I've been really working on reminding myself that eating an occasional chocolate bar or some pizza or whatever is not failing or bad, it's just some food to enjoy in limited amounts and I can continue to eat healthily the next day. 

If you enjoy walking then do it :) I used to try and do exercises that I didn't enjoy, like boring aerobic classes, but then I start walking on the beach and the country lanes where I live and found that it made me really happy seeing the views and exploring! The improved fitness was just a lovely bonus.
