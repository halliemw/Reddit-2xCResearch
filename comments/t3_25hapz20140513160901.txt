Haha I'm in the exact same boat and trust me, it only gets worse. I've had to put serious things in my personal health on hold just so he could buy something new for his car. It's never going to change. So either accept it (with gritted teeth) or not. I however, am forced into spending my own money on the car itself, or his pay goes to it and I'm then forced to take care of rent and bills.
