I'm disgusted by you. What makes a woman turn neutral, Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?

EDIT: To those downvoting, this is a qoute from the same episode of Futurama as the link ArcticVangaurd posted. Just continuing the joke, not actually disgusted or trying to insult ArcticVangaurd in any way.
