It is also possible to consider a fetus to transition to a person some time before birth, such as at 30 or 32 weeks, and thus oppose abortions only after that point.  You don't have to use birth as the cut off point of your moral values nor as the cut off point that you wish for legally.

Also possible, you can go the other way and consider the transition to personhood to be some time after birth.  This is a far more foreign concept to most individuals, but it is a valid position to hold.
