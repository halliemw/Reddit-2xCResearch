Thank you so much. It's crazy how much this situation has consumed me, and although it's exhausted me and used a lot of my spare time, I still can't tell anyone because she and I share a lot of mutual friends and she just doesn't want it out there at all. I've shared it with my own family, but it's not the same. Thank you so much for the understanding.
