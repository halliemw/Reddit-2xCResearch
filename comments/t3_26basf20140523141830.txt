I bought a house last year and everything got settled too late in the year for gardening. So now things are starting to come together really well and I've got lots of vegetables and flowers starting to peek out of the ground. I've got a few projects in the works like making a driveway from paver stones and building a garden fence. I really enjoy working in the yard and going around before and after work and checking up on all my plants. 

I also recently ended a toxic friendship. Well, really more like I stopped putting in the effort to hang out with them and they stopped coming around. This will be probably the 4th time over the last 15 years I've done that with this person, and unfortunately I think it's the last. But either way, I feel better. I don't feel panicked worrying about having to deal with their negativity and emotional drain. 

I also introduced two of my friends and they hit it off okay, so we've decided to try and all hang out more often. That is a big deal for me because I am super antisocial. I have barely gone out at all in the past almost two years. We went out twice last week and I actually had a blast. We're going out tonight and I'm really looking forward to it. I have an issue with crowds when I am alone, so it's nice to have people to go out with so I can relax and enjoy myself. :)
