Whole-heartedly agree with everything you've said, except I *do* love storylines! I kinda want to get into the mood of what's happening. For example (off the top of my head) first time lesbian experience porns are fun, but I've never really seen one that wasn't filtered through male gaze and all about close-ups of finger-banging and pussy shots. I like the build up as much as the sex, so I kinda need the story line. Even my fantasies have fully fledged storylines and character arcs in them, but then I'm a writer so maybe that's why...  
 
as a sidenote to op: I've always wanted to write for female-driven porn. Do pornos shoot from scripts even?
