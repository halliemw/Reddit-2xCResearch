Don't emotionally police or try and make it about her feelings about her husband. If her other two children aren't out of diapers and she isn't able to handle having a third, that's definitely a good reason. 

The husband doesn't believe in birth control. That includes condoms. This isn't a matter of her having some strange womanly ire against her husband and taking it out on a fetus. This is a matter of her believing that it is best for her body and her OTHER CHILDREN if she does not have more at this time.
