It's not 'unhealthy' to not have a period because the lining hasn't built up inside you in the first place. Many women experience loss of their period on many pills, this brand and a few others in particular. For some it gets lighter and lighter until it's gone, others like you never get one from the get-go. I say enjoy the freedom it gives you and take a monthly pregnancy test that takes 5 minutes instead of 4 days! That's what I do at least. If in the end you do decide you need your period, you will have to switch brands.
