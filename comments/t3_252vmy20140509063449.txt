I'm giving up a chance to do a PhD in a years time in favour of being with my long distance boyfriend. I would be doing a PhD  if we weren't together but at the same time I do not want to do a PhD right now. I want to take a year or two off and start working to earn some money and actually feel like an adult. I might end up doing one in the future but right now it's the last thing I want to do. But I guess since I'd technically be doing one next year if I was not dating him, I am putting him before my career. I'm going to apply for some funded PhDs were he lives at the end of this year bit if I don't get one, I don't actually care. He is putting me before his career too though because he's working some secretary job to male money for us instead of heading back for his Masters.
