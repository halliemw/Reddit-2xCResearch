You were very clear about your intentions with your friend.  It doesn't matter if you didn't stop him while you were pretending to be asleep--you shouldn't need to in the first place!  He absolutely sexually assaulted you and he likely raped a drunk girl.  He needs to learn *now* that this kind of behavior is not acceptable because he's obviously going to continue levying it on other girls.

Warn other women.  The best way to prevent assault is by, you know, not assaulting someone, but it certainly helps if the potential victims know specifically who to look out for.
