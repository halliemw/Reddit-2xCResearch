It might not be a bad idea to get your LVN (its a fairly short certification compared to RN) and you should have a decent job from it with benefits and can easily work your way from LVN to ADN to BSN mostly online, which will be helpful since the time you take off for having your little one may not line up well with nursing school (which is highly competetive.) I suggest you look into the time-outs on your pre reqs. My school, for example, will not accept anatomy that has not been taken w/in 2 years of application to the program. Find that out and take what you can to lighten your load.

Talk to your family, they sound like they are supportive and would help. My co-worker managed to get through an accelerated BSN program as a single mom, but not without the support of her family.

You should get plenty of financial aid if you file taxes separately from your parents that will help pay for school. Many places, especially community colleges, churches, community centers have programs that would help with childcare for nominal to no cost. Check out the resources of your town, talk to your parents, talk to your financial advisers. Information is your friend, you can't have too much. File for WIC, and get your healthcare asap, you and your baby need good healthcare, especially as a young first time mommy. Good luck! Try not to let fear overcome you, you can do it and everything will be okay.
