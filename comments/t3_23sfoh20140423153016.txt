Don't worry. You will be able to get it out. I find that after a few hours it has actually migrated a bit downwards and makes it easier to get out, but if it hasn't then you can either do a "kegel" (or even just acting as if you're trying to release a big bowel movement can move the right muscles to push it down). I agree with bluntbangs on the ["punch down fold"](http://vagmonologues.blogspot.com/2011/03/divacup-review.html) working better for me.
