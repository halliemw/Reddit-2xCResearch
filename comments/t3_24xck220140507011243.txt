How, using any medical non-biased reports, is abortion significantly more dangerous than both giving birth and using birth control? I am pretty savvy on fact checking sources, I'd be interested if you could prove this theory. Most people who espouse this idea are getting their ideas from anti-abortion websites, not scientific journals.

I will set one caveat- legal abortion- things that can be tracked. If you're going to count illegal medical procedures, you're introducing a criminal aspect that cannot be reliably tracked.
