My daughter is now 10. She started getting BO and hair under her arm (one side) at the age of 7/8 and got one breast bud (same side) at 8. She has been doing the same as your sister for the last two years but with no more development than that.

I got my first breast bud at 9 and started my period at 11.  

Agree with the other posters that you should check with her pediatrician but it's not unusual. As long as she knows what is going on and everything is explained, I don't think it will be too much of a problem. 

I talk to my daughter all the time. Just make sure she knows she can talk to you or your mom any time. There is a great book called 'The Care and Keeping of You' which can help.

My mom refused to let me use tampons but I remember I had a swim meet and I had my period, luckily one of my friends lent me a tampon so I could go and swim.
