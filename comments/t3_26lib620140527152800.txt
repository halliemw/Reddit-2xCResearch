I am sorry. She used you. It is not your fault. We are all born trusting. 

About your friend that was also Tina's victim. I do not know to which level you abused her, but I want to share a story where me and my friend used to masturbate in the same room, we were about 8-9 years old. But we did not do anything to each other. We would both just be at it somehow. It happened once or twice We did not teach each other anything. And I did not feel dirty or bad for it, in the sense that I was hurting her or vice versa. I felt like there was something forbidden about it as I was not allowed to do it in front of other people (my parents caught me sometimes). My point being, it is not bad per se to explore your body no matter how young you are, it is wrong to use others, like those girls used you.
