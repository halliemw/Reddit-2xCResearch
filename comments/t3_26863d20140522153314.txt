I can relate OP.  My fiance's family is a very loving family but they have a totally different dynamic than my family and how I was raised.  There are a million things about her family that drive me nuts. If you can separate his family's antics from your fiance, the battle is won.  Don't project your disgust to him and the rest is easy.  Yes you will have to put up with the occasional get-together but as long as you are allowed to be you then who cares.  

I had a brief verbal altercation with her dad where I had to not so gently remind him that I am not his kid, I am a man, and he needs to recognize he is dealing with one.  We get along fine now. We can hangout and laugh with no awkwardness.  The only difference is that when I tell him no, he doesn't try to put on the daddy pants and force it.

Be yourself, and if they try to pull the whole, "you are in this family now and this is how we do things," you can reply, "fuck that.  We are adults and you will not  be dictating our lives."  If they don't like it, oh well.  If your fiance sides with them, at least you can cut bait before you go through a nightmare years down the road.
