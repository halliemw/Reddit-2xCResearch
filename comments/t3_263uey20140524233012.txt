What bullshit. You can decide if it was rape or not... not legally (it was no rape, legally) but for urself. I was once in a similar situation but i decided it was just fun. Noone really hold me down and just took advantage of me - if i had run away, they wouldnt have followed, thus it was my decision to stay. U must keep in mind that there is a huge societal scare about how bad rape is etc. And for men (and consequently, women), this is good in some way. This way, men get no wrong ideas and hopefully, less men commit acts like rape, as they are to inhibited to go over that scary, bad line. This is a huge advantage. However, for women who experience rape, the rape scare is bad. They are told by society how they are victims, how they should feel bad about it and due to traditional values that they should even feel ashamed (they shouldnt!) etc... this is the bad side of it. For some of the women it was just a few dreadful minutes, but it gets really bad when they research about it and are told how miserable they should feel about it, that they need years of therapy to get over it etc... there are some women that just get on with life. "It was a few dreadful minutes, but it (rape) wasnt even my worst experience with men" is what i heard one woman say. And that was a real rape victim, raped by a stranger in a bush at night.
