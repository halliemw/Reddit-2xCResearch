I've always had a light but lingering period... and annoying amounts of discharge. So for years I basically just had pantiliners ALL THE TIME. So annoying.

Then in college I shopped around and got a Ladycup (partly because I had to buy liners myself instead of using the giant Costco stash from my mom's bathroom and realized how expensive that was getting). Seriously, one of the best investments I've ever made. One cup, can use it pretty much all the time with no problems, and I don't feel slimy or rashy from discharge or constant pad use. Side benefit: no longer afraid to mess with the ladybits! Seriously, it's a great way to acquaint yourself with yourself.

It does have a little bit of a learning curve, but seriously it's not that bad. SO WORTH IT. Do some research and get a brand you like; Diva isn't the best shape for everyone (IIRC it's one of the tallest, narrowest brands). I have a small LadyCup and a small Lunette (which I use for heavier days) and love them both.
