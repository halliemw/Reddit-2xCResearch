Never thought of that, but seems totally obvious now. Most people aren't going to use a condom/dental dam while performing oral. During my appointment, they made me watch an STI/STD powerpoint and it said that condoms aren't as effective at preventing diseases when used during anal sex as opposed to vaginal sex.
