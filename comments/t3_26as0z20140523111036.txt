This is how I see it as well. We both have things that we are *supposed* to be responsible for and we each know our parts very well. However, when we need to step in and help, we may not always have a full working knowledge of whatever it is our partner usually takes care of. Some partners will see this as a lack of effort or just not wanting to do it and they step in and do it themselves or tell them they did it wrong, instead of helping them learn to do it right. It takes communication to work these things out and really not much else. If you feel you're doing more work, you need to say something because chances are you're both doing a lot of work and are too caught up in that to see the effort your partner is putting in. It should be a partnership, or team to work successfully, which is why we use this terminology to describe SOs in the first place.
