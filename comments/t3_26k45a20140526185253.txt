You should really change your tampon every 6-8 hours! Going longer increases your risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome and nobody wants that. 

Bring a little ziploc with you and an extra one - sneak off to the facilities (or just behind a tree) and change it there. Put the used one in the wrapper of the new one, drop it in the ziploc, stash the ziploc in your purse, and voila - no more problem. 

Also, its really unlikely anyone would notice even if it DID leak :)
