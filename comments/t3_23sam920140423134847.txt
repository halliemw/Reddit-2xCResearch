A slightly better comparison maybe: If a man and a woman have sex and maybe they both get a bit wild and he ends up ripping his foreskin, he is responsible for medical bills. He also has to deal with all the pain and, I imagine, no small amount of embarrasment. This actually happened to one of my friends, and he had to have a circumcision. I'm a bit concerned about your relationship if you're willing to take him to court over what was an unlikely misfortune which was nobodies fault.
