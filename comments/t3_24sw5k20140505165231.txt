I dated a guy similar to this; I called it serial monogamy. He had dated some girl for 1.5 years, then 2 months off, dated someone else for 2+ years, 2-3 months off, then me, and I broke up with him after about 6 weeks when he called me an ex's name and I noticed photos of her on his computer (no snooping, he had asked me to look at something and the folder was front and center).

He never had actually gotten over the *first* girl. He just bounced around from girl to girl just so he was with *someone*. He didn't know how to be alone or who he was, really.

I'm sorry you're dealing with this. He'll never be happy because he doesn't know what he needs to be happy. You're stronger than that.
