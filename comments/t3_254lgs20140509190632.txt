Oh man. Story of my life right there. I used to be so self-conscious about my boob-bangs and cleavage fuzz that I wouldn't wear a bikini. I have sensitive skin, so shaving is a nightmare. I eventually started plucking my nipple hair when I started dating more - especially if I thought clothes were gonna come off. But I'm also kinda lazy, so I can usually gauge how long it's been since I last had sex by eyeballing the length of my nipple hair.
