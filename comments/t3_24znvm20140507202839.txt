Yup, this is a real bad move and I don't understand it at all. Of all subreddits, why put *this* one on the list of defaults? Doesn't it make more sense to put /r/askmen and /r/askwomen on the list instead? Or even just /r/relationships. And if they're gonna keep this sub on there, might as well throw /r/oney in there as well.

The quality of this sub is going to go down the drain with the inevitable influx of trolls. What annoys me is that the mods didn't even ask us if we wanted the sub to be default. WTF.
