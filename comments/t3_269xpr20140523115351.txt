My boyfriend (now husband) have lived as close as 2,700 miles and as far apart as 5,500. 

We would have our "skype dates" usually once every other week. On a Friday or a Sunday. We would call each other once a week for a "run down" of each other's weeks (more if we were planning to visit each other.). And we would text all the time. 

We were long distance for three years and yeah it totally sucked, but it really made every time we saw each other more meaningful. 

There was one time we were going through a rough patch and I decided "fuck it" he doesn't have any plans for the next couple weeks (besides work) and I have a six week break between classes so I bought a one way plane ticket and had his roommate pick me up at the airport and when he came home the next day. There I was. I spent 5 out of the six weeks I had off there. It was awesome and really strengthened our relationship. 

When he moved further away was when things got really stressful. I was trying to plan our wedding with a 17 hour time difference and him being busy with a brand new job. We skyped every other week. When things would get extremely difficult I would re read our texts and look at our pictures. There were a lot of tears. Knowing the next time he had leave would be 12 months away. And I wasn't making enough money to fly to him. 
Communication. That's really the only thing. We didn't get jealous when the other went out and had a fun night (ok I got a little jealous but when he calls at 3am his time drunk and missing me it's kinda cute). We didn't pick stupid fights because we knew the time we had to talk was limited. We talked through text a lot. I think what really helped him was planning things we would do when I got to him.

TL;DR: communication
