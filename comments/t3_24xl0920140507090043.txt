I do- it was almost two years ago now and I have gotten therapy and have a lot of great people in my life. But at the time I was very stressed over it and ended up losing my job because I was so distracted. I'm still a teensy bitter about that, but onto bigger things! It really did open my eyes to the effects and terrible reality of rape and sexual assault. I have recently become a crisis line advocate because I want to support others who are going through similar or worse.
