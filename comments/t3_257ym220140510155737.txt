That's awesome! I'm so happy for you :)  
Maybe in a couple of years one of you might reconsider, but I'm sure you can make it work regardless.  
I'm in grad school right now, and I would love to be a prof one day, but I also want kids with a stay-at-home parent like I had, so in a few years I'll have to be making some tough calls.
