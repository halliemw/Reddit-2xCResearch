Well, first of all, EVERYONE knows someone who is or has been mentally ill. Without exception. If anyone claims differently, it's because mental illness is already stigmatized to the point where nobody wants to talk about it (kind of like rape and sexual assault). Statistically, at least one in four people will experience a mental illness in their lifetime. I've been through depression and was medicated, and because I have grown up with a mentally ill parent, I wasn't afraid to talk about my experience openly; as a result, so many of my friends and relatives "came out" to me as having their own experiences with psychiatric medication, even I was surprised.

The fact is that mentally ill people are more *at risk*. That's not a judgment of them, it's a fact. And there are certain behaviors which can be extra triggering or dangerous. It's not a great idea for someone with suicidal ideation to own a lot of firearms. It's not a great idea for a recovering alcoholic to work in a liquor store. It's not a great idea for someone with an eating disorder to go into modeling, or to join pro-ana communities. And it's likewise not a great idea for someone with paranoid delusions to hang around forums where extremist ideology is discussed.
