Try changing your detergent, body wash, body lotion, deodorant, and maybe even your diet. Your body can start reacting to things it never had before over night. (One day my SO found out he was allergic to eggs and he never had an issue before that day.) Make sure whatever you are using doesn't have mineral oil and petroleum in it. Try to switch Deft because no one is allergic to that detergent that I've ever heard of. Stay away from anything that has fragrances. When pimple form it is sign that dirt and skin are covering your pores but could also be from a reaction or dietary cause. In general I would log your life and see if there were any changes with diet, products you've used, or even environmental. The heat could be a factor too. Also see a medical esthetician or dermatologist.
