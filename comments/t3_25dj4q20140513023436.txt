It's a little fucked up that many people don't see a gay relationship as a 'real' relationship. A lot of people see a same-sex affair not as serious as a male/female affair. Ask a lot of guys which would bother him more: seeing his girlfriend make out with another girl, or with a guy. 

It's utterly ridiculous. Just because he's gay doesn't give him a pass for this totally inappropriate behavior. It's not an excuse. Being gay doesn't make him easily confused or make it okay to hit on someone else's boyfriend. 

Talk to your friend (the gay guy in question, not the chick with some stupid opinions) and tell him how you feel. Get it out in the open. If he's pissed about it, then you know what kind of person he is. If he understands the gravity of his actions, then you'll sleep better for it. Either way, might as well do it.
