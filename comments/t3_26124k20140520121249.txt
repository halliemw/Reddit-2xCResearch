Obviously pregnancy is always possible in these situations, but I've definitely been where you are--every twinge, ache, and bloat becomes an omen. Diaper coupons leap out of the Sunday circulars, where you've never noticed them before. 

As someone above mentioned, the more you stress about this, the more you can either trick your body into displaying symptoms or trick your mind into seeing symptoms where there are none. The tricky part is that lots of symptoms of pre-menstruation (cramps, etc) are also symptoms that you'll see when you look up signs of pregnancy. 

I know you're going to worry about this, so there's no point in telling you not to. But you're worrying prematurely about something you cannot control or predict. 

I hope this works out! Please post an update when you know something. I think we've all been in a similar position and can relate to the anxiety.
