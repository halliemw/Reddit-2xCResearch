Hi!  As a soon to be mother who is a full time student in graduate school, I think it would be best for you to sit down and really think your decision through.  Now that you know you are six weeks pregnant, you have to realize that there is a living baby with a heartbeat inside of you. I understand that your situation is tough, but it might be tougher to look back at this a few years down the line and regret a decision you would no longer be able to change.  Please think things through very carefully, as you are talking about a living human being.  Wishing you lots of luck!
