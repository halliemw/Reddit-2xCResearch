So, my freshman year of college I was FWB with a total jerk (who hasn't had this experience?). Against my better judgment we got it on a LOT because he was ridiculously good-looking and pretty fucking dope in bed. :::shakes head and fist::: Anyway, one morning we were doing our thing and after we finished he settled back into my bed and, in a very measured tone, looking straight ahead, said, "I...don't know...where...the condom is." I, an idiot freshman, start to get up and *look around* for it (facepalm) for a few minutes before realizing that there's really only one logical place it could be. So I go to the communal dorm bathroom, get in a stall, lock the door, and start fishing around in my vag for this lost condom. I don't find it. I go back to my room and he has vanished too, along with this condom. Typical. 


A couple of days later, I'm in the bathroom minding my own business when the the condom, a bit worse for wear (stiff and covered in little crumbly bits of unknown provenance), just calmly slips out of my poon while I'm wiping up. At first I was cracking up laughing but then things suddenly darkened as I realized, "Oh shit, I could be having this asshole's baby." Waited on tenterhooks for two more weeks till I got my period. I could have DRANK my period blood that day, I was so happy to see it. 


I wish I could say I stopped hooking up with that dude after the scare but nope; we did it for the rest of the school year. I wised up a bit over the summer though.
