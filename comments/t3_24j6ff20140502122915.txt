Your comment was full of generalizations. "The man will resent his wife who makes more money than him" "the wife will start to treat her husband like a child". Just because you may have seen this happen before doesn't mean it is a pattern. Every person and every relationship is different and it's unfair to tell someone what will happen to them when you know nothing about them.
