the short does seem to  violate the dress code BUT like she said, the boys violate the dress code also with their tank tops.  Clearly the dress code is only being enforced on the girls which is completely stupid and reinforces the idea that it's WOMEN who's bodies are distracting and that it is their fault that they are distracting. 


 If they're going to have a dress code, it's pointless unless they enforce it across the board.
