My OB/Gyn told me to take cheap Vitamin C to prevent my insane amount of UTIs. I've also found it provides some small relief during a UTI. She told me it's better and cheaper than cranberry, and as someone who used to take cranberry tablets I agree. It's worth a try in any case. They're insanely cheap.
