25, never had them pierced. 

I'm pretty damn girly. I love makeup and pretty things, but I've honestly never felt the urge to pierce my ears. My boyfriend wishes they were pierced so he wouldn't have to think about what to get me as a gift (in his brain, earrings are just what you get for ladies), but beyond that, I've never felt any pressure to get them done. My mom doesn't have hers pierced either, but she wears clip-ons all the time, which is even weirder to me. My aunt and several cousins also don't have them pierced.

I rarely meet other women without piercings, but in college 2 of my close friends also didn't have pierced ears! Pretty weird. We didn't realize it until well after we had become friends. Maybe it says something larger about you? A free wheeling lady? A pain averse person? Who knows.
