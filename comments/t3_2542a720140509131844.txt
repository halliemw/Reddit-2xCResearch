I guess time does make thing better, after all. Good luck OP, and it is incredibly brave of you to be able to go through this against the wishes of your husband. Also, your husband is a good man who didn't force you to keep the baby even though he wanted it. The support you received from him, shows he is a keeper even if he is upset about it as he has a right to be. 

I don't know why I am saying this. I know you already know all this. You sound like a very logical and smart person.
