The best way to help his is to leave him.  If his relationship is on the rocks, he can leave on his own.  Your presence in his life can only hurt.  You will make it harder for him to get much in the divorce.  He's a cheater, and that can't help him.

And even if he leaves her and stays with you, he's still a cheater.  You'll be dating a cheater.  The saying "once a cheater, always a cheater" didn't get popular for no reason.  Respect for the woman he made vows to clearly isn't something he possesses, so he'll most likely have no problem cheating on you.

And like it or not, you are in the wrong here.  You disrespected the boundaries of their relationship.  Obviously he did too, and that's his fault, but you didn't end the friendship when you realized you were falling for him, and that's on you.
