The reconstruction you linked is normally not performed during the same operation as the mastectomy. The additional damage caused by the secondary operation on the belly or butt should be avoided until the patient has recovered from the primary cancer treatment. Either the patient has already undergone chemo or is likely to start soon and the body is or will be weakened further. If radiotherapy is required it's better not to radiate the healthy tissue that is transplanted.

This is not to say immediate reconstructions are not performed, but usually these are done with silicone implants.
