I'm not sure how "love is love" is relevant given what I said?

It's not about accepting someone's lifestyle choice. It's labeling children, before it's developmentally appropriate, based on the child's rudimentary knowledge of how marriage works. Most young children don't understand the connection between marriage and sexuality which is why they say ridiculous things like "I want to marry daddy", "I want to marry my dog", or "I want to marry Ariel". Marriage is an social institution, not a sexual preference.

After reading your edit, I think the problem is you are equating marriage with a crush. OP never said she had a crush on Ariel, she said she wanted to marry Ariel. And she probably wanted to marry Ariel likely because she loved the character. There are different types of love. I love my family, my cats, my favorite movie, and my house all in different ways. I don't have a crush on any of them them. A crush implies a more romantic love, and no one was talking about crushes. You're the one who made that leap in logic.
