I too have pushed out my diva cup unexpectedly. I went swimming a short time after I learned that this was a thing that could happen, and my 10 year old niece asked, "Hey! What's that plastic thing floating in the water?" I thought for *sure* it was my cup and that my cavernous vagina had expelled it yet again, somehow without my knowledge. Thankfully, this was *not* the case, but you can bet I slunk off to a corner of the pool and shoved my finger up my cooter to see if it was still in there. 

In other news, I had a terrible experience with clots today. A giant clot had completely blocked off my cervix and was excruciatingly painful. I have a super heavy flow and you could almost *see* my abdomen filling up with blood. I tried all sorts of moves, jumps, and positions to try and knock the clot loose. The cramping was unbearable. I even resorted to punching myself and ramming my stomach on to hard objects. Pure desperation. Finally, I took a super hot shower and kept squatting down and coughing. A clot the size of my fist came flying out and just ugh. I'm so done being a girl. 

I'm all bruised up now and I just hate everything. :(
