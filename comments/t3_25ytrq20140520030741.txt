There is a kind of person who has the emotional life roughly equivalent to that of concrete. As one of those people, I often find it difficult to believe, and borderline absurd, when people have emotional reactions to things that didn't happen to them directly. 

It has taken me a lot of time to realize that other people have inner emotional lives that I do not understand. My knee jerk reaction when people demonstrate feeling in the way described here is irritation: it seems to me as naive and over dramatic. 

My guess is that this particular guy responded the way he did is because your empathy is broader than he can understand. Thus, he perceived your emotional response as a wound that was unnecessarily self inflicted. His next thought was that anyone who runs around wounding themselves for no good reason should bear responsibility for their own suffering, and you were trying to extend the responsibility to other people. It irritated him you were (from his perspective) externalizing the responsibility for your suffering, and this is why he responded with hostility. His choice of words is telling. Calling you a 'child that would be obliterated' underscored what he saw as irresponsibility and naivet√©. 

I'm not trying to defend him. I am trying to explain why he said what he said. He has limited empathy, and lacks the imagination required to discover that other people have more of it than he does.
