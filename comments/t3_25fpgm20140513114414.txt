Let your professor know what is happening. Even if you don't think that they will be willing to help, at least give them the chance to! The worst that could happen is literally nothing.

Also, if your college has counselors, speak to them as well. They may be able to help you cope with your grief, and will also be knowledgeable about any policies or procedures may work in your favor.
