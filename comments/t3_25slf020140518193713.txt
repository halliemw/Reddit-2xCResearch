I work at best buy right now. I 
feel like I really had to prove myself to my male coworkers because they would talk down to me and exclude me from their conversations. I feel like I have gained their respect and I'm just as good at my job as they are. The customers however will always be themselves and many don't think I could possibly know what I'm talking about. They'll be very straightforward about wanting a male to help them before giving me the chance.
