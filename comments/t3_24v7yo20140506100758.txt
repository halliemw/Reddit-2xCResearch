He's seen you. He knows what you look like, and he likes it. Why keep moving this back? You're only going to push away an amazing guy that you could potentially fall in love with over something he doesn't seem bothered by.

As for weight loss and getting in shape, I like to do things that are scheduled with other people. It's much harder to blow it off if I feel like I'm letting my friends down. I don't know what sports you played, but if there are any community or church leagues near you, maybe you could join those to give yourself something physical to do? Find a friend who wants to get in shape, too, and become running/lifting/swimming buddies or go play tennis a few times a week. That lack of motivation is also characteristic of depression, so you might consider seeing a counselor or someone to discuss the possibility that you might still be depressed. I'm also focusing on exercise because it helps relieve depression. Diet is important, too, of course, more important than exercise when it comes to pounds lost, but you might find that starting regular exercise that you enjoy helps you feel better, and I know personally when I feel better, I eat better. 

For motivation, check out /r/xxfitness and maybe /r/90daysgoal. 90 days goal starts at specific times, and I think they might have a new one coming up soon. I'm not subscribed, but I've been considering joining in this next cycle. My understanding is that you make your own goal and then use the subreddit to help keep yourself accountable and to celebrate little victories and things. I'm suggesting it because it would fit into the timeline you've set for yourself.
