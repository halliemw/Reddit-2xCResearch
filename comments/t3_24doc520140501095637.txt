No, they'll just try to milk as much out. 

Edit : unless you actually experience how bs some clinics are in Peru, you would know about their "great" healthcare. 
My Uncle wasn't diagnosed properly and just sent to rehab for back pain, several months later he came to the states, cancer. Died in the US. 
This year, my grandmother who lived in Peru, fell off her bed, then taken to the nearest private clinic because forget public ones, you would wait outside for hours. $5000 US fee the next day to even keep her in and we get a "that will be 2000 soles a day for every day she's in here". And of course in Peru its illegal to take someone off life support so she died when her body couldn't anymore, even though she was mostly gone and it was just the machines keeping her up.

Anyways I'm glad OP received help and diagnosed properly but don't think third world countries have the best in medical. Even if it's cheaper
