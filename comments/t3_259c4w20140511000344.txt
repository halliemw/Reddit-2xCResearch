I'm so with you here. My big thing is that I'm working to pay my own way through college, since my parents aren't paying for anything. I flip flop between 20 to 40 hours per week at my IT job, and on top of that I'm doing a full schedule of classes, even over the summer, that require a ton of out-of-class work (good old programming projects). I know its not a super uncommon situation to have to work and go to school but maybe I'm not that strong because I am burnt out as all hell. I graduate in a month and on one hand I feel a little guilty about how happy i am to leave since these should be the "greatest years of my life" and I probably didn't make the most of them. On the other hand, I don't know how anyone could have the time of their life when working what amounts to two full time jobs and still living in poverty.  I think this next stage, where I have money and don't live in a windowless crapshack and have nights and weekends free to do whatever, is going to be much better.
