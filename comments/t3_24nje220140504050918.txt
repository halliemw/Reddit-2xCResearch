Oh my gosh the tampons thing! My mom didnt tell me about the either and wouldn't let me use them. I think she was afraid I would leave one in too long or something. But I started at my cousins early one morning, I think the sun had just started rising, and went to the bathroom for a pad but her and her sister and mom only used tampons. I had no clue how to use one and sat in the bathroom crying for hours trying to understand how to put it in before finally waking up my cousin to help me. It was so embarrassing.
