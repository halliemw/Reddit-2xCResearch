This happened to me while taking birth control- I went on to develop vulvodynia (painful vulva). After finally finding a good specialist after a year, she explained that some women develop this condition during/after taking birth control, and she was able to reverse many cases by prescribing some estrogen cream in the initial stages. There is sometimes a lack of estrogen while on BC which thins the delicate vestibular tissue, and the cream corrects that. You may need to apply this cream anywhere from 1-6 months, during which you cannot have any sex to ensure healing is complete. You should also definitely be tested for BV or yeast and take the appropriate meds for that, but stay away from over the counter yeast creams. Also, steroid creams thin skin even more, and made my situation worse (these are useful for skin disorders of the vulva, which I suspect is not the case for you). Try to find a sexual pain specialist right away. Good luck!
