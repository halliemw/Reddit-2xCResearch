I'm always so glad not to be a famous person when I see things like this.
Because.. I would either be absolutely torn apart or hailed as some kind of "fashionista rebel" for my level of "I don't really care" casualwear.

I guess I dress up a little nicely when the situation calls for it as well, but the media has this extremely odd image that what you wear is somehow always a statement, that you are trying to impress the camera man; rather than just wear something to cover your flesh.
