There is no such thing as a pleasant brake up, and conflicting feelings are going to arise, but in the long term it would be best to end it, then continue to trudge through a relationship that will not lead anywhere. 
Your "asshole" feelings are normal, but it doesn't necessarily make you a bad person.
