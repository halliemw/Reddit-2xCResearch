*Humans* have body hair and for millennia it went unchecked for both males and females. In the 1300's, it wasn't considered "masculine" to have hairy armpits because *everyone* had hairy armpits. We are primates, we are mammals, we are covered in hair. It *is* bizarre that at some point, the majority decided that half the human population should look like it is naturally hairless because otherwise ew gross. It is bizarre that we as primates can no longer own up to the fact that we have hair in most places. Who are we trying to kid?
