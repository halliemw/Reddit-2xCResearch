It's been a few years since I saw the studies I'm thinking of, and basically they didn't look at healthy but they did look at longevity. The conclusion was that the upper end of normal was the sweet spot for longevity. And really, at the weight she is, she's not in a position where she's really at a significantly increased risk of any metabolic issues unless we're talking about someone with other risk factors for metabolic syndrome. I also don't think that bitching about paying for her healthcare is terribly helpful or relevant in this conversation, especially when she's at a weight that is statistically healthy and she sounds like her lifestyle isn't exactly unhealthy.
