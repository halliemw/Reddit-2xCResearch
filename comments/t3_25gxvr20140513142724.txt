I'm sort of disinterested in generically "strong" female characters, because I think that can end up putting an emphasis on charismatic hero-antics, and sometimes I just want to talk about people in a slightly different way than that.

I like stubborn female characters, women who insist on being present and doing things their way, and who are willing to make mistakes along the way. Girls with a lot of headstrong determination that sometimes leads them to make dumb mistakes, but they always, always stand up for what they believe in.

I like witty female characters, the babbling brooks of clever metaphors who always have a thing or two to say about this or that.

I like pensive female characters, who prefer to step back from a situation and think about just what it is that's going on, what it means, and how to handle it. They might feel aloof at times, but their wisdom and levelheadedness really comes through, and resonates with their inherent kindness.

I like conflicted female characters, individuals who inherently recognize the complexity of the world. That in a war, both sides may be wrong. Who sometimes find themselves caught between two wrong decisions, but have what it takes to make a painful decision.

I like courageous female characters, especially those with the courage to face their own vulnerability and respond to it in a realistic, heartfelt way without compromising the person they want to be.

I like hardworking female characters, who always can find a job to be done in order to get the things they want.

I could do on, but I maintain; there are many, many ways for a character to be strong, but I would rather discuss what characters we like and why, be it because they are strong, or not.
