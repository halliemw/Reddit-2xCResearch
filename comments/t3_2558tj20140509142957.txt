Little known fact: oxygenated cleaners like [Oxyclean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OxiClean) work mostly the exact same damned way as Hydrogen Peroxide - they just package it in a powdered form so you can cause the reaction by adding water. 

Always spot-test - the fabric you're working on has more to do with bleaching/weird reactions to cleaners than the color the fabric has been dyed - but your cotton undies are almost certainly safe for this.
