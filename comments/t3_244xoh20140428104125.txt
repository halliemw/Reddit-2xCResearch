I can say that I've gone through a few different ones, trying to find one that doesn't make me feel crazy. So give it a month or so, and if you're experiencing any weird side effects, talk to your Dr. There's many options out there, and they might be able to find something that works better.

I've never not felt like a woman on it though, so I can't speak for that.
