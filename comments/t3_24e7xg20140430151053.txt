I've read that most pregnancies that occur while a woman is on the pill are due to taking the first pill too late--the first pill is the most dangerous one to miss.

Yes, get Plan B.

>You may become pregnant if you are off of your active birth control pills for longer than seven days.  Use condoms and spermicide until you have taken pills for seven consecutive days.
