You have a great point, face structure is a huge contributor. I think the reason that short people tend to blame their height, is that well-fitting and age appropriate clothing can be hard to find in petites, especially if you have a small frame. I'm generally one to be frustrated with my small frame more than my height, but I used to work in campus admissions and having your middle school and high school guests be taller than you definitely contributes to the age appearance/respect issues.
