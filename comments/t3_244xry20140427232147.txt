They're using "real size" in reference to Aerie models.

Aerie is using a variety of models across a range of body shapes. They don't really cover plus-size women well, but then, the products they offer are not targeted to fit that demographic so it's not appropriate. Other than that, the diversity in representation is more than adequate.

Complaining about "real size" being negative when it's actually being used in a positive way and associated with positive change is silly.
