True, and I agree, but OP's description seemed to include a mix of employees who are public and non-public facing, which was why I was suggesting it seems like it would be better offered as an optional perk vs mandatory. 

And, honestly, my experience is that sales people are very aware how important their personal appearance is. If they're not, they don't remain salespeople for long. Most sales folks I know would be as likely to be able to teach a course on personal appearance as they would to need to attend one, at least the experienced ones.
