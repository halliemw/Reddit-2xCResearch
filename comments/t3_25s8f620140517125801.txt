I understand that but let's not pretend that the dress doesn't look two sizes too big and that she's on the red carpet not looking like a disaster. Black shoes and a floral dress that is too big in the waist and bust. She does look like she wrapped a set of curtains around her. 

She's a celebrity who lives in the public eye and as such, she's held to much more scrutiny and judgement.  Plus, it's not as if there are television shows devoted solely to judging what people wear on the red carpet.  She's a celebrity, people love judging them. Unfortunately her outfit, while beautiful to her, looks like a dumpster fire and it invites criticism. 

Oh my god I'm sorry, I cannot get over her shoes. Black clunky heels with a strap that cuts her leg and makes her look heavier. She should of had the dress taken in around the waist and bust. Instead of a giant billowy mumu bottom that makes her look bigger, have a slit running halfway up the side that gives the illusion of a longer leg and it would help lengthen out her midsection. 

The dress is designed awfully, plain and simple.
