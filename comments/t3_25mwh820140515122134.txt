There are a huge number of highly conservative people in the U.S. (and elsewhere).  They support each others' aggressive behavior.  Think about the homeschooling prom and their ilk.  They are everywhere (the number of people homeschooling their kids to keep them away from evil sexuality is significant).

Not that all homeschoolers are about that - but some are.  And I've noticed that even the more liberal homeschooled where I live end up hanging out with the other, highly conservative homeschooled (they have to show up for certain meetings at the school district and meet each other).  I've seen some kids who were raised to know better go through a rebellious conservative phase.
