If he becomes problematic and you feel unsafe, you should look into a no-contact order if possible. I don't know what your personal finances are, but most cities have free legal assistance available if you know where to look. I used to help people with abusive spouses and boyfriend/girlfriends and the attorney I worked for did this quite often.

At the very least, someone might be able to sit down and help you file the form and then self-represent, or you may get lucky and find someone willing to represent you (although from my experience the former was far more common).

Him breaking into your place is a big deal. If he does sometime like that again, having an injunction in place may give you some peace of mind.

Just something to consider if he continues to be a serious problem.
