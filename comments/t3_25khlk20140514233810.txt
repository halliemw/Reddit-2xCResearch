This is something that really irritates me when I'm in a conversation with more than one guy. I've had them "listen" to my input and basically brush me off, then a guy in the group will say either exactly what I said or basically what I said and all the other guys will be like, "Oh yeah! That's a great idea/really funny/an interesting point..." It's *sooooo* frustrating!
