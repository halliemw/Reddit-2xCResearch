Yeah this is what I was trying to say with another post. Even if it wouldn't hurt for her to lose weight, what the hell does someone else have to say about that? There was a post in this thread that said "she's fat, it's the truth, no need to sugarcoat it" (deleted now). Like what?! Might be true, but that doesn't mean all of reddit's nasty people have to tell her she's a whale...
