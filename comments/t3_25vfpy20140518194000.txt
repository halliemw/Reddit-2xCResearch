Wow, this was ridiculous. I was on the fence until I got to this part: 
>Fishman reminded Kelley that she'd signed a contract, agreeing to "abortion in case of severe fetus abnormality." The contract did not define what constituted such an abnormality.

Okay, so obviously they can't force her to have an abortion, but they can rescind their financial support. I don't know about parental rights- I'd assume that's something that isn't finalized until the baby is actually born? Anyway, she presumably was aware of this clause and agreed to it. But then..??

>She'd always been against abortion for religious and moral reasons, 

What the hell? Why did she agree to a contract that explicitly outlined abortion in case of severe deformities of the fetus, then?? 

>....but she really needed the money. 

Oh, that's why. I have very little sympathy for this woman. She knew what she was getting into, and if she didn't, what the hell was she thinking, and what about the agency that was supposed to be vetting her? Then, when it gets tough, she asks for extra money. Her opinion on abortion is totally valid, but she loses a lot of credibility after agreeing to that contract. Either the money was so attractive of her that she decided she didn't care that much about her morals, or she never had any intention of honoring that part of the contract. 

>"The not-so-subtle insinuation that Ms. Kelley attempted to extort money from your clients is unfounded and reprehensible," 

But that is exactly what she did!! Pretending that she arrived at her actions through a position of moral superiority when money obviously played a large role is disingenuous at best.
