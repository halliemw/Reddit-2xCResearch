I think this is the best advice in the thread. Sit your mom down and calmly tell her "I understand that you want to support me whatever I do with my life, and I appreciate that, but I promise that I'll tell you what's going on with me." and tell her you're hurt that she thinks you'd lie. 

Then just ignore the behavior. Eventually you will go on a date with a guy and then it won't be a question. It's easier when you aren't living with them, but I've always found with my mom "Ignore behavior you don't like, reward good behavior a ton" works really well. 

Also, maybe your mom just misses you and this is her weird way of trying to say she wants to talk more about what's going on in your life? If you moved out recently that might be part of it.
