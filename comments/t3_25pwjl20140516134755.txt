I get you're sad about 2x. But I think fragmenting is a positive. There's actually a huge list of related subs stickied to the top of /r/femmethoughts right now. The reality is that there have been other great subs for women for a long time, and I think that's a great thing. There aren't so few of us that one monolithic community is enough. I say, spread out. Today a few hundred subs, tomorrow the world!
