A white prom dress is a cheap alternative to a wedding dress and can still be very beautiful and classy. Also the lack of a train will come in handy for an outdoor ceremony.  Walmart sells wedding bands cheap (good thing, too bc my husband lost his working on the car and my post baby fingers are too thick to wear mine) Do your own food for the reception- it's easier than you think. Print your own invitations. The kits are still kind of expensive so when you find one you like, check ebay. People who didnt need as many as they thought usually sell the excess. Use fake flowers instead of real.  Thats all I can think of for now. Congratulations!
