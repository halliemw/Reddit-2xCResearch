I had the opposite experience! I had been getting LaSenza bras for ages, and they never carried my size, and I was incorrectly measured. I went to a smaller boutique in my city and found out my proper size (bought a bra there), and then went to Aerie to try some on. I didn't ask to be fitted, and I tried on their sample size bras. Most of them were stretched out, but the cups of certain models fit me super well, so I tried on the real version, and have been replacing my LaSenza bras with Aerie ever since. 

I'm also super happy that they offer bathing suits in the same shape as their bra styles, I may have my first properly fitting bathing suit ever this summer! (though admittedly more padded then I'd really prefer..)
