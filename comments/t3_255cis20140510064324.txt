I felt the same way about a position I applied for- it was competative and exiting and great, and really probably a waste of time for me to apply since I knew I wouldn't even get past the first round. But I knew I'd feel bad if I didn't apply, because the position was so exciting! I just had to be able to say I applied! 

And they gave me an interview! It's next week and I'm so nervous. 

I guess I'm saying I'm really glad that you're putting yourself out there, too. I aldo think just putting your name in the ring is a good move, politically, regardless of whether you get the position or not. But I hope it goes well!
