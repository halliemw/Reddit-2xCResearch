Congratulations!! When the hubs and I got engaged we talked about our top 2-3 things we HAD to have. For me it was: a pretty dress, a great photographer, and cupcakes. For him it was: a great suit he would wear again and a great "getaway" car. We ended up getting married in Vegas on valentines day, all our parents came too. We planned it in 12 weeks, but honestly could have done it in much much less. If we include airfare, a suite for a week, shows, rings, clothes, hair, cupcakes, champagne, pictures, and buffet for the 26 people that ended up coming to our ceremony we were around 5 grand. That's everything, and people still talk about our wedding two years later as something that was awesome and unforgettable. You can do this!!
