I think that can be chalked down to unluckiness because it should be about 7 days before she starts ovulating after her period. Perhaps she ovulated earlier than usual that cycle and the sperm managed to stay in there. 

Also I think pulling out before a period would be safer than after, which was what I did. A day after having sex without a condom, I got my period.
