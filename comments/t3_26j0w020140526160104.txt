The reason it's harder for men to "get" women than it is for women to "get" men is because we're using different definitions of get. When you say "get", you mean "have sex with". Now here's the thing, you're not considering the social climate surrounding sexual stigmas at all. The reason it is easier for a woman who wants sex to get it than it is for a man is because society has decided that women shouldn't want anonymous sex, and shames those women who do. Men, on the other hand, who want anonymous sex are encouraged to do so, and those who achieve it are praised. Not only that, but it's just easier for men to have a satisfying sexual experience. Men's bits are typically pretty straightforward, women's bits - while also not that complicated, do typically (at least in my experience) require a little bit more effort to get a satisfying sexual experience. Additionally, there's always an inherent danger involved when you decide to go somewhere alone with someone who you've just met that can physically dominate you, which further pushes women away from pursing anonymous sex.

So why is it easy for women to "get" men? Because anonymous sex typically just works better and is more rewarding for men than women, both due to social pressures and the satisfaction from the act itself.

If instead of using "get" to mean get sex, we use it to mean get romantic needs fulfilled, then no, it's not easier for women to "get" men than vice versa. If we talk strictly about the difficulty of both sexes finding partners who fulfill their very specific needs, I think it's pretty equal.
