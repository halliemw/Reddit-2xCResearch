I get your point but I don't think you get mine. Let's take an extreme example - genocide. The Holocaust was smaller in deaths per time than the Rwandan genocide. But overall numbers were much smaller in the Rwandan one. Does it do us a favor to say the Rwandan genocide was LESS EVIL than the Holocaust? Does it translate to one being less important, less meaningful? Is it more important how many people died per minute? Isn't it unseemly to try to compare the two to get which one is "worse" and therefore which one is by logic " better? 

Of course there will always be degrees in how one can quantify it but my point is to not quantify it so we don't end up diminishing the importance of the "lesser" crime. Just because something seemingly more awful pccured does not make thr "lesser" one better.
