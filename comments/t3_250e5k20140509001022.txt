>Who has time to wax their head in between every other uniform maintenance? 

It takes less time than it does to comb your hair.  You literally just spread it on your head and buff it with a washcloth.  It takes all of 30 seconds

>What we they afraid of, us cutting our heads?

It all goes back to faddishness and uniformity

Most men who razor shave their head do so because they are balding, so that exception is allowed because it makes for a neater appearance.

You're looking at things from a point of view like you're back diddybopping on the block and not from the point of view of when you took the oath
The question isn't ever "why should this be banned", but "Why should this be allowed" and frankly while women do get thinning hair, I've never seen a woman bald all the way back to the ears.
