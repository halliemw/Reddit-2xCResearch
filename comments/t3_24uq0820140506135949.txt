Hahaha, as someone TRYING to get pregnant, the fact that most pregnancies are 'oh look/whoops I'm pregnant' is mildly infuriating.

My SiL had unprotected sex once and my nephew is now 17mths. The fact that she managed to get pregnant in the small window of possibility, with an 80% failure rate and then 30% chance of spontaneous abortion in the first trimester, is, like, baffling. There are some women on /r/tryingforababy that have been doing their damnedest for years. 

I think God/Mother Nature is just an evil troll and getting pregnant is crazy easy when you don't want it and nigh impossible once you do.
