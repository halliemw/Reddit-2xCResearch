I'm so glad you posted this! A month or so ago I was laying in bed while my boyfriend was getting ready for bed in the bedroom. He was talking about his day, and I was randomly playing with them for this same reason, not sexual at all, and when he turned around and burst out loud laughing at me. I tried to explain THIS EXACT THING to him and he couldn't really wrap his head around it. I can't wait to show him this thread just so I can say I'm not the only one!

Also, I just made an account JUST to comment on this.
