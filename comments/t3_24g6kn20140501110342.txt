This was happening while I was finishing a dissertation on substance-using mothers. I interviewed a bunch of substance-using pregnant or recently-pregnant women about their lives, their thoughts about motherhood, and their experiences seeking treatment. It was fascinating work. I successfully defended that diss on April 9, and now this law has passed in TN. I'm looking forward to continuing to research this topic and to fight for treatment, not punishment.
