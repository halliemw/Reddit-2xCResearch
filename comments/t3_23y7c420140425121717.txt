What a lovely story and lovely picture! 

I had a friend who was a clean eating fitness junky! She had amazing abs-this girl was seriously 100% muscle-but one day was complaining because she held a teensy bit of fat right above her pubic bone she said she couldn't tone, couldn't get rid of. When we told her that it's totally normal for women to carry weight there to protect for the baby reason the look on her face was priceless. So much relief!
