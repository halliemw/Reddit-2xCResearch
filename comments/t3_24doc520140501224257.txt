I'm really sorry that happened to you. Obamacare is absolutely imperfect, but it did do some things (mentioned previously) I really like. Overall, though, it's not even close to the solution that we need. Single payer healthcare needs to happen in this country, and it needs to happen soon. I wish I were optimistic about the possibilities of that happening, but I'm not.
