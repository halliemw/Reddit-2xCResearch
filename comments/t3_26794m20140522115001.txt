I respectfully disagree.

If the supervisor has already hired a whole 'nother body to be in the office to pick up the slack for Sister2, then the supervisor already knows full well about the situation...he/she is just afraid to address it.

Also, as you said, it's not the OP's job to hire/fire/give work evaluations, thus it is also not her job to confront Sister2 about her work behavior, or to start a detailed dossier documenting her behavior.  That's not the OP's job, and it's not her place.  The OP has already been proactive in talking directly with Sister2 by "[reminding her] to get back to work or finish doing x, and y".  

It's also not OP's place to be telling her supervisor whether or not to intervene.  The supervisor should have taken action a long time ago.
