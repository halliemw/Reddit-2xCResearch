Iron and aluminium don't do jack. Copper does have an antibacterial effect, but it's very slow and works best with very low quantities of bacteria (visibly clean hands leave bacteria and that will be killed, hands with eg. some poop smeared on them it has no chance against) and for a very long time (half an hour or more between people touching it). You also have to clean it really regularly, to make sure there isn't a layer of grime between the bacteria and the metal. It's cool, but not as effective as it's sometimes claimed to be in a challenging environment, it's more of a baseline reduction benefit.
