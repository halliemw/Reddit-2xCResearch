Copper IUDs do have the side effect of a significantly heavier flow in most women and sometimes more cramping as well. Hormonal IUDs, because they are a local application of the hormone, have much less systemic side effects than oral or topical birth controls. They are also progesterone only so they stop the build up of uterine tissue and many women will cease to have periods altogether, while those with a copper IUD will always have a period.
