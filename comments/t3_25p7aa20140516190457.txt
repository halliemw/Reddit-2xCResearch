It depends on their income and what happened. I had a few things get forgiven when I had an emergency and was broke. 

I have seen a lot of people say, 'Thank you TwoX, the doctor caught a early stage illness/cancer' because most people usually say, 'Go to a doctor'. If it's something completely mundane, the chance of it backfiring is pretty low. It's like saying, "Well what if the power supply to a computer is broken? By saying that the monitor isn't plugged in, you're potentially giving a wrong answer'. Sure, that is true, but most things are mundane. No one is going to come here and say, 'I've been bleeding out of my anus for two days, should I go see a doctor?' or something like that. Things that are out of the ordinary get told, 'No, go see a doctor for that lump/ache/rash'.
