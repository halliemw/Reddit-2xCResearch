What an absolutely beautiful Abyssinian. My family had a similarly majestic, fearsome beast of an Abyssinian for 17 years until he passed away about 10 years ago, and to this day we marvel over his amazing beauty, bravery, attitude, confidence, nerve, and the bizarre yet awesome love he developed for our dog after years of being a fiercely independent only cat! They are such incredible animals. I'm so sorry for your loss but rest assured you will never forget her!
