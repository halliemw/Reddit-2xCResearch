I'm graduating from college in THREE WEEKS. This quarter I'm feeling like I'm doing a lot of stuff right. Earlier this quarter I got asked to present a paper I wrote last quarter at "Scholars' Week" where students from the department present their work. I presented that last week and felt like I did really well. I got a lot of great questions. Last week, I got asked by a professor for my other major (yay double majoring!) to present a research project that a partner and I did in the fall. So, we get to present that at the end of this quarter!
