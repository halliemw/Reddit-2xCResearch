I think I disagree with your terminology.  So I'm going to propose some more specific ones.

we shall define TRP as being a *philosophy* based on acceptance of a specific *interpretation* of an *underpinning* of various conglomerations of popular science.

Similarly, we will chop the manifesto into similar pieces.  We will attempt to use this common mapping of pieces to assess where they are similar, where they are different, and why they give everyone the heeby jeebies.

The *philosophy* is normative - it attempts to tell you how you should react to the *interpretation.*

The *interpretation* is a subjective reading of the the *underpinning*, which is generally regarded as descriptive and expository - it seeks to describe observed behavior and proposes explanations for why this occurs.

The earliest phrase from the quoted passage from the manifesto that seems to resonate with key text from "core theory" pieces is the bit about "instigators" or women having the ability to "control which men" get sex, etc.  It would appear that this is a vague reference to the idea of "sexual selection," as espoused in various evolutionary psychology circles.  I will point to something popular science stuff like "The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature" as an example of the concept.  It's pretty easy to trace a progression from there.

component | TRP | creepy manifesto 
-|-|-
underpinning | pop sci evopsych stuff about sexual selection, usually cherrypicking of the "humans [read: feeemales lulz] are biologically predisposed to like X" variety | looks pretty similar.
interpretation | something about how these biologically predisposed preferences are immutable and that modern social norms mask this. Exploitation of these preferences = success, adherence to social norms = failure. | views these perceived preferences as a moral ill (word choices: "beasts," "vile impulses"). 
normative prescription | Change yourself to better exploit perceived evopsych profile of women | Eugenics


I think we're looking at a very embittered philosophy which can best be described as post-TRPism, or something. To me, it's very interesting that he had a lot of traffic on puahate.com.  Site is down, but google appears to think that it is primarily composed of people who are against PUA/Game/TRP-like stuff, largely from trying it and it "not working" or something. I would imagine that a lot of these people are going to reject the normative bits of their PUA/Game/TRP-like exposure, but that the vocabulary from the underpinnings espoused by PUA/Game/TRP-likes are probably going to leak into a lot of their post-PUA/Game/TRP thinking.

edits: frantic table editing attempts

edit2: just realized that I did not deliver on the promise to examine why both give varying levels of heeby jeebies.  Manifesto is pretty obvious - it's pretty much Hitler but towards women. TRP is a bit less obvious, but probably stems from that whole profiling of all women based on biological determinism type logic.
