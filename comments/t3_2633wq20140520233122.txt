Some of my very best friends are guys.  Hell, I lived in apartment full of guys in college (even shared a room with one of them).  It was awesome and totally platonic.  I'm married now, my husband is good friends with my dude friends, and everything is fine and dandy.  People who think men and women can't be friends have missed out on some awesome friendships.
