I think I've thrown up in the lap of everyone I've ever had an extended sexual relationship with. I'm a fucking class act.

One of the messiest I can recall happened on the night of a first date. We didn't mesh personality wise but holyshit we had some crazy sexual chemistry. We're sitting a coffee shop kind just awkwardly talking. Our eyes meet and he touches my hand and says "hey uh, do you wanna get a hotel?" I reply with "fuck no just come to my dorm". Classy right?

Anyway another hour later and he's balls deep inside me. At this point I'm wet. I mean super wet, like someone had dumped a bottle of water on the bed. He cums, I cum and there's a frenzy of making out and nails digging into flesh. I start crying for whatever fucking reason.
Afterwards he's running his hands through his super long hair and then hands me three false eye lashes and pulls the another from my forehead.
He eventually falls asleep and I'm stuck there wondering how someone managed to fuck the eyelashes off me.
The next day after he's gone I strip my bed and find; dried semen, blood, another false eyelash, a shit ton of mascara and another mystery stain. Needless to say I just tossed the fucking sheets. I also found one of his super long hairs in my buttcrack ew.
