It's the joy of non-specific, smooth-muscle-triggering hormones. Both the uterus and the intestinal tract are lined with smooth muscle, and so the hormone that the body pumps out to start the menstruation process (often enough to generate rabid-angry-badger-clawing-its-way-out-of-your-abdomen grade cramps) also affects all the other smooth muscle in the body. Just as strongly. 

The result is somewhere between a regretful midnight Taco Bell run and a full-on cruise ship cleansing.
