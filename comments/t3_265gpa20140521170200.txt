It's mostly a clash of lifestyles. I find very passive people very difficult to deal with since they're pretty passive aggressive but can't communicate any issues. I can always pick up on tension or that I'm annoying them or that they're unhappy, but since they only stay in their room nothing gets resolved.

Or I feel like it's not my home it's theirs. They're always home, they're always in their room (and I have no idea if they're sleeping), I feel like I really have to limit any social activities that take place in the apartment. I pretty much feel as if I have to be overly considerate.

I also noticed that shut-ins have very low tolerance for repeat over night guests, and that's always a major source of tension.

Then there's the minor issue of my feelings getting butt hurt if they continuously turn down my invites to hang out outside the apartment :)
