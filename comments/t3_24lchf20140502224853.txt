You've got multiple issues here. For the fear that you don't have a normal vagina, you should have see a therapist years ago, but you didn't so here you are. They're definitely going to want to do a swab, but it doesn't necessarily have to be inside you vagina. If it's a severe yeast infection, they can typically find yeast on your vulva, between the lips. 

Also consider that having a doctor take a look means you can get a real answer once and for all as far as whether your vagina is normal or not. It probably is fine and your anxiety just makes you tense up, but knowing it's fine might help relieve some of the anxiety. There's also a condition called vaginismus which is treatable that could be the culprit, as well as something like a separate hymen. These don't mean you're doomed to never have a sex life. They mean that having a doctor take a look can only help everything. And then get some therapy to deal with this phobia of yours, because it's clearly preventing you from living your life and that's no good.
