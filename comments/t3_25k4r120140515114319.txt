I have been in a similar position before. I remember that the morning (all-day) sickness truly made the situation more difficult to handle. 

For the time-being, here are some habits that can help decrease the nausea/vomiting, or at least did in my experience: 

Instead of eating three big meals a day, graze on much smaller meals throughout the day, so that you are not eating a lot at once but also are not letting your stomach get empty. 

Avoid eating fatty foods, spicy foods, and aromatic foods. 

I also found that getting fresh air/avoiding stuffy rooms was helpful.

Drink as much water as you can each day.


I cannot respond to your question about whether you should get an abortion because it is such a personal choice. Do you have a close friend, sister, or other family member you could talk to? If so, I would recommend talking to them because they will ideally be able to advise the best.

Finally, I know that I am a complete stranger, but I am willing to support you by listening to your concerns through PMing. I totally commiserate with women who experience an unexpected pregnancy. I just won't be able to say what I think you should do!

Good luck. You're going to be OK.
