> Edit: you might find this segment of this episode of This American Life interesting: http://tal.fm/491/3[1] it's an excerpt from Debbie Lum's Seeking Asian Female.

I heard that segment when it aired, and it gave me a while new perspective. The couple she followed really broke my heart. Thanks so much for referencing that.
