Damn, I had more info I was going to include but forgot: both of the friends who said these things about are a tad unreliable, and no one else heard the elevator rumors or saw the ex pursuing the other friend (it did theoretically happen over the summer). The ex denies the rumor accusations, and I've never asked him about the other incident.  So basically, I'm not convinced he's a scumbag.

And I was really just going through clicking on most all of my Facebook friends on the invite.  I didn't even think about him as her ex at that moment--just as a guy who goes to our school and I talk with occasionally.
