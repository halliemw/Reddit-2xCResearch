I'm not bragging and this shouldn't even be a form of validation. Finding a cool girl that you like shouldn't be hard. I'm one really ugly guy but even I can find a really sweet girl. and it's because I don't over think it. Society puts too much focus on getting women. It slowly becomes a necessity to get women instead of just knowing and committing to one just because you find her a worthwhile individual.

These two mass murders both stem from having troubles finding a girl, if we ignore any mental problems (since most here are). 

I personally think it's not about them finding a girl but more so about them proving that they can get a girl. Once you want to prove to others that you can get girls it makes things harder for guys. Because they over think things. This might be subtle but it's true, because you become stifled. You can't think straight when talking to girls. There's just no connection because there's an ulterior motive. 

Once a guy learns that he just has to like the girl solely because the girl's a cool human being and not because of any other agenda things become smooth sailing. If things don't work out it's OK because you can always find another girl. no one's going to call you a loser because of it  and even if someone did you wouldn't care because you've got nothing to prove in the first place.

Sorry about being blunt but it just pisses me off to see people fixate too much on getting girls. plus all this will sound a bit incoherent but i'm just here to address my thoughts
