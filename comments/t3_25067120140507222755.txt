13 is REALLY young to go on hormonal birth control. At that age your body is still developing and your hormones are all over the place. Altering your hormones and biochemistry with BC is risky. There's a higher incidence of conditions like vulvodynia in young women who take birth control for many years from a young age. It could more permanently effect her [sex hormone binding hemoglobun](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/35663.php). That is the experience I had anyways and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

Obviously you don't want her to get pregnant, so if she does have sex it's important that she uses a reliable form of BC.

And since she shouldn't be having sex without birth control, it's better to wait until she's a little older and can handle both the physical and emotional responsibilities that comes wiht sex.
