>I nicked a nipple while shaving my hairs once - never again...

>I even lied and told my boyfriend at the time that my hand slipped while shaving my armpits, to hide my secret nipple hair shame from him. 

My hand actually slipped while I was shaving my armpits once and I accidentally cut my nipple
...omg never again. Ever. I'm so careful now with when shaving and refuse to let any razors come close to my chest. Non-sharp Tweezers for nipple hair it is!
