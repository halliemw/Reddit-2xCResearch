I think it depends on the nature of the encounter. If it was a polite expression of interest, then "I have a boyfriend" says "I'm flattered, but not available, thanks!". If the interest was expressed more crudely, it seems like you're relying on the "property" excuse instead. There are definitely different connotations in different situations; barring the phrase entirely removes any nuance to the social situation.
