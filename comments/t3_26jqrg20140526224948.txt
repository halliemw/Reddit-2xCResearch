Don't let people's comments about your appearance get you down, and don't let the people who bother you and make you uncomfortable push you around. And don't be afraid to ask questions. If a teacher or anyone of importance is giving you shit for asking questions, well, you might have to take it but there's always the possibility of a new teacher next semester. Just gotta hang in there. 

Friends, internet, real, imaginary.. friends can be a lifesaver when times get tough, but don't forget to tell them that you have homework that needs doing, studying that needs to be done. School won't ruin your life, but it sure as hell can make it a lot easier.

College isn't everything. It can help, yeah, but if you're determined, you CAN find other paths that work for you.

CHALLENGE YOURSELF. BE BRAVE. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
