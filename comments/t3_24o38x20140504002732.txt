You say no one else has ever been fired.  Neither have you!  (Even if you have.)  No one can prove that if you never use her as a reference.  Which, you obviously shouldn't.  You weren't fired, you quit!  Because you weren't being challenged enough, your talents and skills could be better applied elsewhere, you had serious concerns about the viability of the management structure.  Or whatever.  It is not you, or your fault, and you have to believe that.

It's discouraging to have your whole support structure crumble underneath you and it can also really undermine your sense of self worth and ability if you let it.  Don't let it!  You know you have skill and talent, right?  So just take that somewhere else that will value you and never undersell yourself.  

If there's common thread I've ever noticed about people who are successful, no matter what field they're in or what they're doing, is that they have total confidence in their ability to do whatever they set out to accomplish.  (Even when they're totally incompetent... and you'd be shocked how far this can get some people.  Far more than any reasonable person might expect.)   Someone who is actually competent and believes themselves to be right can go an awfully long way.  You just have to own it.

So, if I'm reading this right, this bully is no longer in power because you quit.  Go grab your future!  It's absolutely not contingent upon her as much as she'd like to believe that and make you believe it too.  She's one tiny little person in a giant field and her opinion means shit.
