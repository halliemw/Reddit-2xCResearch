It's interesting that your non-dehumanizing examples are of "female" modifying various occupations. While not necessarily dehumanizing, I personally find that usage a little offensive and definitely old-fashioned. 

My over-70 mom will still say "female doctor" instead of just "doctor" ... she's still stuck in this world where it's so NOVEL that a *woman* is a doctor that she has to call it out that way rather than just say, "I saw my doctor and *she* told me ... blah blah blah." Obviously, a woman who is a doctor is called a "doctor," not a "female doctor." I smile and remind my mom of these things. I can't help myself.  

When you modify an occupation with a gender, it's confirming that the default is still male. And I don't believe we should assume that anymore, or use language that makes that assumption. 

For me, the appropriate time to use "female" as an adjective would be to describe something non-human: female baboon, for instance. But I'm annoyingly feministy and stuff. :)
