I am in a totally different line of work so take what you will of what I write.

I don't think you should be communicating with them. Those people who are contacting you, you should politely inform that that you regretfully were let go with no warning, and that you aren't sure who they should be contacting in the company. I dont think it's even a tiny bit your responsibility to try a facilitate anything further for your ex-business.

Good luck. That sounds infuriating and heart breaking. :/
