Be real with her, tell her whats coming - how it could happen at 8 or 10 or 15. That it's normal and you and she are prepared for her entry into that phase of womanhood. My daughter started a year or so before I was expecting but it was easy and no big deal. Well, I asked her is she'd like it to be a big deal (a period party) and she declined. So instead I got her a variety of supplies, some new undies, and a dot girl calendar so we could track her cycle. It blended into our lives easily and naturally.
