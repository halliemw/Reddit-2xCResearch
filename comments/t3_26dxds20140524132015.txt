I figure ordering boots online carries with it a risk that they won't fit at all, actually. All companies seem to size things sliiiightly differently. I didn't want to take that risk, these fit almost perfectly (like 90% fit). Also, I prefer to give my money to smaller vendors, especially ones in small towns like this one.
