Dude, I can see from your posting history that you're male. Maybe you should consider that you're *just not getting it*.

As you presumably know, the people on this board (largely) do not want it to be a default board. Prior to this change 2X was not small and unknown, but it was generally frequently by women. The expectation was that men were welcome to read, and to occasionally participate, but that the majority of participants should be women. This worked. The goal is to return to that state.

I am a woman. I know many men. I feel that my perspective on many things -- childhood, travel (in many continents and countries), living abroad, parenthood, pregnancy, fashion, science (undergrad, grad school, faculty position) is different from that of the men I know, many of whom have been exposed to similar things. I do not speak for all women. But every one of my experiences has been colored by the fact that I *am* a woman.
