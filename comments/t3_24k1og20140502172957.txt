He ran away almost two weeks ago and I was talking to the neighbors about it, then they told me the indian reservation police department behind our houses came over looking for the owners. I'm in the process of moving houses, which was how he got out in the first place and how I missed them when they came looking. I called the police dept. They called me back, let me know they had him given him to someone who could care for him. They got in touch with that guy and had him bring him back. Called me back and let me know they had him in a cell and that I could come pick him up.
