The author of the article correctly points the finger towards his narcissism, loneliness, and entitlement as the root cause of his violence, but I think misses the point about why the violence manifested itself as it did. The fact that his violence was aimed principally at women, and partly also towards the men who he thinks were complicit in the women's evil plot against him, is deeply revealing of the level of misogyny and hatred towards women that is fostered through the MRM. The MRM is an unchecked source of confirmation and support for men like Rodger in their paranoid narcissism. The "alpha" ideal that it props up is an embodiment of dominant white male privilege. When men like Rodger fail to live up to that ideal, they are rebuked as beta and summarily dismissed, further isolating and antagonizing them. 

No, Men's Rights Movements did not put the gun in his hand and tell him to commit this awful crime. But the movement's worldview is targeted at men like Rodger, and it does all but encourage vitriol towards women. It gave him a target for his narcissistic hate, and for a man as disturbed as he clearly was, that's all he needed.
