I stumbled across this and I gotta say, I am quite impressed. Had I not being paying more attention, I'd have sworn........ well you know. 
Without any basis for comparison ( the start of your transition) I can only imagine how far you've come. I applaud you, as I cannot imagine it's been an easy journey. I respect you for you choice and I wish you all the best in your new found happiness.

Edit: That really is an awesome shirt!
