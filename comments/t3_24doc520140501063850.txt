Damn, did you have an EASY button or what? I have PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, I know it's probably already been explained) It is incredibly painful for me and causes all kinds of non-sense, including acne, unsightly body/facial hair growth, inability to lose weight and other horrible things like infertility. It took them nearly 5 years to figure out I had cysts and cost me thousands! My Gyno said that 90% of women have it and only 1-3% know about it or have adverse reactions to it. Just be on the look out for insulin resistance with PCOS because in this day in age, it's a road to Type 2 Diabetes. Especially if it runs in your family. Good luck with everything!
