Right, but if she worked towards accepting her body *when it was still societally unacceptable* that would be different. I totally think she should be allowed to be proud of herself and the work she's done, because getting fit is totally an achievement! But that's different from espousing the great effects of accepting her body when she looks that amazing and flawless.

And naturally, when fat women post pictures of themselves talking about how they feel like they're beautiful and have beautiful bodies, that gets shut down pretty hard as some ridiculous notion of Tumblr Fat Acceptance Gone Mad. It's a little silly. If that situation (actually societally-unaccepted woman accepting her body despite still looking societally-unaccepted) weren't considered patently absurd around these parts, I don't think I'd have as much to say on the matter. But it's pretty clear that this post only did as well as it did cause OP looks, like, amazing.
