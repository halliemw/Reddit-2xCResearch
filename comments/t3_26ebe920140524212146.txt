I hope that you do not take this the wrong way, but, "better late than never", because it sounds like you were far overdue for a major emotional release. I am happy for you that your attacker has finally been caught and punished, though mostly the good thing about it is that you could finally let go of all of that bottled up emotion that is and was, a form of poison in your system, now you can truly get on with living your life, so good luck and i wish you a fun and joy filled life.
