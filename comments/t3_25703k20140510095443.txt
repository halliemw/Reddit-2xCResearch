The fact that these things upset you does not make you thinned skinned; This is the proper response. It's easy for an insensitive asshole to brush off this behavior. They'll claim that they understand, and they've mastered themselves. But their understanding is only in theory, they're too numb or too cowardly to actually experience the full visceral range of their emotions. You have been brave enough to wade through this hurt. Remember your emotions are watch signs, they're not there to bog you down, but to warn you might in a place that is unsafe and unhealthy. Trust yourself and trust your intuition, if people are making you feel like shit they're probably shitty people.
