You two are arguing over mental health of women post abortion like all of this is universal. Guilt, remorse, relief, and happiness will be experienced on a personal level, and no scientific paper or anti/pro abortion website can either confirm or deny how a woman will feel afterwards. It's generally a traumatic experience, and many women will question the decision in the short term and feel guilt. Not all do. That's fine. And those who do feel intense remorse in the short term will most likely go on to be fine mentally. But let's stop pretending that a woman will be unaffected by this decision.
