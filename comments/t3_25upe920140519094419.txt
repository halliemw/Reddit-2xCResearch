My dad made a big point growing up of how sitting was the best way, etc, and I never paid it much mind.  Couldn't be that much different, could it?

Wrong.  My husband and my cat and I are all sitters (yep, the kitty pees in the toilet too).  I *always* know when a non-sitter male friend has used our toilet, because the cat will come yelling at me to put the seat back down so he can go pee, and I'll walk into the washroom to a toilet rim full of tiny pee sprinkles to clean up. Occasionally, they'll put the seat back down, leaving the sprinkles *lurking*, so now I clean the toilet after our houseguests leave.   Seriously gross.
