My wife is 5'9" and is nowhere near as busty but she was between a size 18/22 for the first few years of our life together. I still remember how she used to feel when she went clothes shopping and how hard it was for her, especially when styles came into fashion that were even less suitable for a larger lady. As I've grown older and matured, I have a better appreciation now how the demands of our society to conform to a certain appearance can heap so much emotional pressure on girls (and to a lesser extent boys too). It was heart-warming to read your story and know that you felt comfortable and confident in the clothes you found.
