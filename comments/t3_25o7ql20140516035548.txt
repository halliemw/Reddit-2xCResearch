My cousin is the single mother of 2 adopted children, absolutely by choice. I've never known her to date anyone, though apparently she did date when she was younger, before she made the decision to single parent. She is just the most wonderful, capable, nurturing woman and I'm so proud to call her family. She brings so much light to the world. Her kids are awesome and seem to be growing up beautifully (though it's been awhile since I've seen them). They seem to have such a joyful family, and although I'm sure there have been difficult moments, there doesn't seem to be any serious lack of anything a partner could bring to the table. I don't know if she ever wishes for a husband or a partner, but I think she rocks the hell out of single parenthood.
