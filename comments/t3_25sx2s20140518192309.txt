I went through some promiscious stages in my life and was never offended by the word slut, even if used as intent to insult me.  My retorts were either "Yea, so?" . 

Another: "You wanna know how a person knows that they are a loser? When even a slut won't fuck them". 

And one more! "If you have a problem with anything I do or say, just remember, you're the one with the problem, not me."

It's just a word.  The amount of power it has depends on the intended target.
