I see your point but I'm with Tina Fey on this one. Upon receiving the Mark Twain award for comedy, she said it would be nice to reach the place where being a woman was not noteworthy (the media was quick to point out that she was only the 3rd or 4th woman to have won the award). White male is the default and it would be nice if it wasn't but we're clearly not there yet.
