It was not your fault and you could not have prevented it. The only person at fault, who could have prevented it, is your rapist. Your rapist is the only one who did the wrong thing. 



Your boyfriend is so out of line, it's disgusting. **It was not your fault.** No ifs, ands or buts about it. Your boyfriend is a horrible human being for even suggesting that it's your fault, he sounds like a terrible and toxic human being.


I hope you're doing okay. Please don't let his words get to you.
