I don't think you understand what I am trying to convey. I'm trying to show my support for women who are troubled with their body hair, and feel as if they need to get rid of it in order to be beautiful. Of course everyone has their preferences, and if someone chooses to rid themselves of all body hair, that's fine, but if a person doesn't wish to do that, or can't find an easy solution, they shouldn't feel less about themselves. When you say "you have to accept that most people will not find body hair to be attractive", I feel as though you're suggesting that my self worth doesn't matter, and that it is only my attractiveness to others that counts. This is how I interpreted what you said, and if you don't mean this, maybe you can reword what you wrote.
