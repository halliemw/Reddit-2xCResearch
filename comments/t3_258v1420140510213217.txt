Yes! I've met so may men who had no idea that the girl they praised for "not wearing makeup" was wearing make-up all the fucking time.

Also: hair pieces. Plenty of men believe that something that looks like [this](http://www.ioily.com/wp-content/themes/shopperpress/thumbs/Hair/claw-clip-straight-ponytail_103251.jpg) is possible to style with real hair. I used to wear a fake messy bun occasionally, and when I took it out at work once, one of my male coworkers just about fell over in shock.
