Welcome to the wonderful world of self pleasure :) Never ever feel ashamed. Knowing your own body is an empowering thing. And now when you have a sexual partner you can better communicate what you like based on your experiences pleasuring yourself. 
That being said I consider myself a little bit of a connoisseur when it comes to toys. My general advice is go with something rechargeable and something that is waterproof for two reasons
1. You're not limited to just one setting. I know a lot of women enjoy masturbating in the shower or tub and a waterproof toy gives you that freedom. 
2. Generally if you have a toy that is rechargeable you're going to be dealing with a higher quality product. And conveniently,  many of the higher end toys while they cost a little bit more have a pretty great warranty program that comes with them.

My absolute favorite toy I've ever owned is the Jimmy Jane Form 2. Their website www.jimmyjane.com would be a great place to start as they have a lot of different models to choose from as well. And if you're worried about the price point on the toys I recommend going to a website like Adam and Eve to buy. They'll have the same vibrators and toys for sale but usually have some pretty kickin discounts that you can apply to help bring the cost down.
I hope this helps and if you have any questions or wanna talk feel free to PM me!
