I had a similar experience and I'm in my 40s. Some fella hung himself half out the window of his best friend's ride to holler "FAT BITCH!" at me. I was like okay fine, fat, yeah, I'm in Los Angeles and I'm not a size zero, so I'll own fat, but bitch? Lucky guess.

I guess after all those years on usenet, I just treat "fat" like "Hitler". Its misogyny's Godwin.
