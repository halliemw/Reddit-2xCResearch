This is some great advice, thank you!
I think my main problem is being interesting! Unfortunately. But, I'm working to fix that and hopefully it'll help me have more things to talk about/more people to talk to them about!

And yes. Relaxing is a MUST. I'm really self-conscience, whether it's warranted or not, so I'm always over thinking everything.
