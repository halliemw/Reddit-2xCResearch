Thank you! I e-mailed my doctor yesterday and got a similar response. I am actually having what seems like a normal flow period now with just a tiny bit of cramping, so maybe it was just leading up to that?

Four day periods sound great. If you don't mind me asking, what were they like before? I am coming from paragard (so about 10 day periods) but before that I'd say they were about 7 days long.
