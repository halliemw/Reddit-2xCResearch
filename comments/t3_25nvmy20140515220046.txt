Unfortunately that's the opposite of innocent until proven guilty- unless there's sufficient evidence that the man raped her, the man is not going to be considered guilty of the crime.  If they assume that he did do it without having the evidence to support, that's guilty until proven innocent. 
 
Not saying that it's a good thing, but that's how innocent u til proven guilty works.
