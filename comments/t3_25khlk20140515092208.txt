> what i have come to realize, though, is that cis-males are a lot stronger than i previously thought. i was once play-fighting with my ex, and at one point he had me pinned down and no matter how hard i tried, i just couldn't get him off me, or move, for that matter.

This actually scares me.  I really feel vulnerable now, like if some guy wants to mess with me it feels like my ability to stop him is minimal, at best.  I got some pepper spray, but I've also strongly considered looking in to getting a big dog as well.  I like to go for walks and to parks and stuff, and I've really started to feel the threat of unwanted attention.  I see now why so many women I've known owned large dogs, inspite of the work it takes to keep them.  Lots of times, they're trying to keep the creeps at bay.
