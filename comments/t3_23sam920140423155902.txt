I think it's sad that men don't have more say in pregnancy.  In this case, there was no decision to the abortion of the fetus... when my ovary erupted, the pregnancy was terminated.  Regardless of that, my SO and I were on the same page on what to do if the pregnancy was viable.  We had a verbal agreement before we starting having sex.

I really view everything pregnancy related to be a partnership, though- even if the law disagrees.  There's a lot of grey area, obviously.  Do I think it's fair that a woman can get an abortion if the father really wants the child? No.  But honestly there isn't really a good solution in a situation like that.  Unless we like.. make a law that every time you have sex with a new partner, you sign a contract saying what would happen should it result in a pregnancy.  But that's never going to happen.
