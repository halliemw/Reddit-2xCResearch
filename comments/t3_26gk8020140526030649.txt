I think it's how a lot of people really feel. I often hear my parents saying something similar. Whenever anything about the handful of old tv/radio celebrities who've been accused of sexual abuse comes up, they always feel the need to say that, "they can't *all* be guilty," as if every single tv & radio personality of the 70's & 80's had been accused. They also have a thing about turning every such discussion into a commentary about how people are always in things for the money, and so probably only the first person to have made an accusation was telling the truth. Jimmy Saville was guilty, obviously, obviously, but only of the one offence, and everyone else is just the victim of vicious women out to get rich quick... because they've all been getting rich off this, you understand.  
Of course, my mother has also been making a point of mentioning UKIP's recent electoral success to me with a smug grin on her face (and I'm glad you're proud that we're an international laughing stock, mum) so maybe they just like to say incredibly irrational things at me to keep me in a state of perpetual annoyance whenever they're around?
