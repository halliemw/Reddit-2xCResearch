My doctor began by prescribing me the pill. It resolved many issues I had been having (i.e. difficult and irregular periods, extreme cramping). I've never had any issues with it and it seems to work well for me. I've been on it for 4 or 5 years now and just really haven't ever given much thought to trying something different. Don't fix what isn't broken, right?
