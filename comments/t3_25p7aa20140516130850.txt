/r/science has strict moderation, which is a good thing. They delete jokes which get upvoted enough to become top posts. They also delete the other joke comments in those top posts as well. It might seem harsh but it isn't really. It keeps people on topic, helps avoid low hanging fruit issues, makes accurate information more visible, and fosters more substantive discussion.



I haven't found many, if any 'unscientific opinions' deleted in that subreddit. There is a guy who keeps posting about 'aether theory' there and in /r/physics. They don't often delete his posts but he is downvoted to all Hell and back because he's a pseudoscience whack-job.
