I guess it's just a really tricky topic because of how diverse this world is. I just wish that social norm and social expectation were non-existent and people could just handle things using their own judgement. 

Unfortunately things just don't work that way no matter how much I wish for it. The best I could do is gather all of the information I can so that I can be more constructive in how I handle the situation.
