I think another factor to consider with child support is not that he will get arrested, but that his checks will get garnished and his tax returns (if he were to get any money back) will be withheld and that money turned over to your for back child support.

My brother has been a deadbeat dad, and for the last 20 years or so, he has been getting about $800 per month garnished from his check (2 kids to pay for) and he never gets a tax refund. The first time this happened, he was expecting $3,000 back! Oh wells. Went to the baby mamas. Eventually, my brother just learned to accept that he will be paying for these children, he can't escape.

Wouldn't that money come in handy? That's all I'm saying. No, it isn't punishing the guy, it's only so your child can be taken care of.
