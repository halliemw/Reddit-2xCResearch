Trust me, I was tempted to ask if anyone could stand in, but she's such a bulldog that I really want her doing negotiations. We'll wait until mid-day Monday and hope for the best. In the meantime...I'm keeping myself busy trying not to think about it. If it doesn't go through, we're trying to remember that there will always be other homes. The market here is flooded with similar new builds, with endless others on the way, so I'm trying to be optimistic. This one just happened to have certain qualities we haven't found in others very often. :) Thanks for the luck, my nerves need it! :D

*Ninja Edit* By the way, your house is really cute, it looks like it feels like a home already
