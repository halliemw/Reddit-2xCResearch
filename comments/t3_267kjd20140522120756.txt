I (26yo) quit BC pills when I got pregnant 6 years ago, I had a rough pregnancy (bad acne being the least of my problems but it was one, for the first time in my life). After the pregnancy, I opted for a hormone-free IUD. My skin problems continued and my periods were unpredictable in all ways except intensity -  it was BAD; I assumed it was just my body changing (for the worse) post-pregnancy. I stuck it out BC pill free for about a year and a half, then switched back to the pills. My skin has been miraculously clear since and my periods are predictable and manageable. I am emotionally level 99% of the time (last month, my only PMS mood swing occurred while watching the Katy Perry Movie - cried through most of it, that was it and that was the worst mood swing I've had in 6+ months) Essentially, my body/skin is addicted to my birth control and I almost dread quitting it again when I am ready to have another baby :/ But it sounds like I may the exception to the rule here where birth control pills are concerned...
