I've never heard of them used as gender neutral. Growing up when I wrote papers in school I initially always tried to use the she/he, him/her, format. It just got annoying to type all of that though when I was really trying to hammer out an idea onto the page, so I began using shifting pronouns, aiming for a balance, or even sometimes just writing it all with "she/her" pronouns to have a greater effect.  
  
I think a blend is still the best choice. Outright gender neutrality I believe, though I am not certain, may leave us prone to the prejudices of our imaginations. It is good to use gender neutral pronouns, but also throw in gendered ones especially when you're trying to help alter perceptions about men and women. So a crying character may get male pronouns more often, and an athlete or scientists may get female ones more often.  
  
All of this of course varies with context though.
