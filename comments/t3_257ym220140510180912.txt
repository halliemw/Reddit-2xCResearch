> I'll probably never find my dream house husband to stay home with the kids.

I would love to work from home (I already do on my own project but it hasn't advanced to the point where it's a job in itself, so I still have my day job).  I have to take frequent breaks from my work and do other stuff (it seems to help think better about things to do something different for a while).  I don't imagine it would be difficult to do the chores and take care of a child during that time (depending upon the child of course).  My sister does similarly (she has a home-based business and a few children at home).

There are a lot of men who get burned out with the traditional grind, with new changes in the workplace that make stable employment and benefits less likely, etc...  So, especially for hard workers with some knowledge, it can make sense to start your own business and have a home office.  I have a woman friend who is a book keeper for a company and she has a child at home.  She has a home office.
