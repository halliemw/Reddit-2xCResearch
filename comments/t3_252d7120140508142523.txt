Well, if you look at it from his perspective, nobody wants to be intimate with someone who isn't enjoying it. Physical intimacy is a special thing for two people in a relationship and there's nothing enjoyable about it when you know the other person is just "tolerating" it for your sake. Give and take should go both ways. Both people should be giving and taking both sexual pleasure and love and companionship. I think you are falling into stereotypes too much. If you don't derive pleasure from intimacy, perhaps you are asexual and should look into how other asexual people deal with relationships, or if you have some other hang-up maybe the two of you could see a sex therapist. Keep in mind that not all women find "procreational" activities pleasurable. You might have to experiment to see what you enjoy.
