>  Don't worry, I'll keep my comments to myself. I know this isn't a place where my voice needs to be heard and I will respect that and stick to read only behavior.

Please feel free to comment. I think people here are mostly worried about people trying to derailing conversations or invalidating and/or devaluating the experiences of others (which tends to happen when talking about topics such as rape, ageism or things that influence women negatively). A reasonable, respectful comment on topic is always welcome, regardless of gender.
