I took Ibuprofen and she used a topical numbing agent on my cervix and those two combined didn't do squat for me. Although it only lasted 5 seconds, I screamed NO NO NO for at least 2 minutes haha. I ended up having the terrible neurological response followed immediatley after where I couldn't sit up for the first 20 minutes after insertion because I got hot, cold, dizzy, lightheaded and nausous as hell. I promptly went home and ate a pint of Ben & Jerry's cookie dough ice cream with a heating pad on my lower abdomen for the rest of the day ha. 

Edit: I forgot to add I have not had a baby  25/F :)
