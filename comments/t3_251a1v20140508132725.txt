What I said.

Honestly, I think minimum wage is outdated, inefficient, but trustworthy.  

I think we should be working towards firstly getting minimum wage up to where it is at least keeping up with inflation, along with cracking monopolies so prices of goods will be kept down by competition.

Then we need to look into something like basic income or a similar concept, because it just seems to me to be a much more future-proof system, if automation keeps the way it is today.
