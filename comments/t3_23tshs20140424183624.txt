if you're in a miserable relationship with your husband, how do you think that's going to affect your daughter? children are sensitive to these kinds of things, and she's already worried about you. i'm not trying to guilt trip you here, but as i'm sure you know, you have to worry about yourself and her as well. leaving isn't easy, but how much more difficult is it compared to subjecting both you and your daughter to an unhappy relationship for years on end?
