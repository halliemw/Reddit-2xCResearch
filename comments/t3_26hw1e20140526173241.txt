applauds to your bf for handling himself well. that's a big trust bridge you guys have. as for the coworker, it's his job to manage it and sounds like he's doing a solid job. fair enough to be ticked off for a rant, trust in your bf and he'll manage it. as they are coworkers, it's probably very awkward for him as he's trying to work his job and be a standup guy. can't be angry, be proud you have a good man.
