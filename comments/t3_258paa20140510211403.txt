Man, I can't even imagine that. Examining myself? No way. I know what this looks like, I've seen it and it's awful. I don't even look at myself in the mirror when I get undressed to take a shower. I literally don't look down, I cover myself when I get out, then I wrap a towel around myself. Alone. With the door locked. The idea of someone else seeing it, and someone I care about? That's a horror story.
