Its okay, no on ereally knows how bad it is. It was just a blow to the gut to find out my bra size's band was so huge. Adding another huge 'god youre a fat fuck you dont get to eat today' thing. Its that mentality, but when people see me all they see is a fat glutton, but I rarely eat more than once a day. My therapist knows about all of my other problems, but this is one I keep very secret.
