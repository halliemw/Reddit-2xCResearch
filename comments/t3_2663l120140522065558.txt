Well, A had three reasons for going to M for help on this one: 1) she was too uncomfortable to confront D on her own, 2) M is considered to be the leader of this group, and 3) M is a man. A's reasoning here was that, if D's art reflects his view of women, then he doesn't view them as actual people and therefore doesn't respect them. A felt that D wouldn't listen to her or take her seriously if she complained solely because she is a woman. She felt, though, that he'd listen to a fellow man.
This sort of logic applies to anyone who's extremely bigoted. A hardcore homophobe won't listen if a gay person complains because he doesn't see them as an actual person, but as an inferior being. If a straight person complains, though, the homophobe listens because he views them as an actual human. At least, in theory.
