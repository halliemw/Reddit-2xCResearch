Second the suggestion from /u/temporius. That subreddit actually knows an insane amount about breasts, I wouldn't be surprised if someone there had some experience similar to yours.

Having it in the groin is really not that weird - it's along the [milk line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_line).

I did some googling - "ectopic breast" or "accessory breast" are the key terms you want. It's generally benign and is only removed for aesthetic purposes. I can imagine it would be somewhat traumatic though. Sorry.

Breast growth through early to mid twenties is also definitely normal.  Go check out /r/ABraThatFits or /r/bigboobproblems :)
