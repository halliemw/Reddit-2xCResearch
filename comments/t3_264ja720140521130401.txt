this will be the craziest suggestion you have ever heard probably.... but, I'm going to share it. LYSOL Spray. Seriously. read the panel. don't eat it and don't get it in your eyes. But skin and fungi and viruses..... I have used it on my skin for various reasons and it works like a charm for all sorts of stuff. even acne. If you try it and it bothers you, stop using it. But hey, I bet everyone has gotten lysol on themselves using it to clean the bathroom or something and it didn't kill em. GOOD LUCK!
