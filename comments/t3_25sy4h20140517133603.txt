Interesting point about the self-preservation aspect. I hadn't considered the functional reasons why the elimination of vanity isn't a societal priority. I agree that's a sufficient explanation for why vanity isn't seen as as much of a problem.


I don't think I can agree with your conclusion though. Or at least I hope you're not right. I think people are more rich and thoughtful than just hedonists at heart, even without religion. Maybe in the case of vanity though it will run more unchecked without religion.
