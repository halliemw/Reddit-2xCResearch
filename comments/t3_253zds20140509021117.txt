Finding out where you can get condoms for free would be a good start. If they have business cards, take a bunch so you can give them to her or anyone else that asks. It might make conversation less awkward too since you can just give her a card and tell her to check the place out. In my experience most of the places that carry penile condoms have vaginal ones too, so she can take a few of each (this is good because if she's having sex to survive on the streets she can always use a condom of her own if her partners are iffy about it). I'm sure some places would even carry things like spermicide and dental dams too. LGBT* oriented places are usually pretty great for having a variety of free things like that.

Every area is different, so definitely look around and see what options are available. That sort of thing is just good to know for anyone!

That's really nice of you to be concerned about her too, by the way. It sounds like she was in a bad place, thief or no thief.
