Thank you for seeing my point. I think that girls/women are kind of under-represented in school/college/ careers for STEM. I was just trying to say that if we use grades as an indicator (higher grades), we could maybe open up more opportunities for women instead of auto assuming we suck at math, science, technology, and engineering. 

I was also offended by the comment about girls being "kiss ups". That kind of demeans the work that they've done with the work given (homework) and insinuates that girls maybe flirt, give compliments, or are somehow less deserving of the grade given, even when doing better than male counterparts. 

That seems incredibly sexist to me. I would love for my daughter to have every opportunity to work in any STEM field without someone saying she only did well by being a brown noser or doing the homework that men were to busy to do because they are naturally more "knowledgeable"
