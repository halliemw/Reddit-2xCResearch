Self-care is important. Whenever I'm feeling less than great about myself, I do stuff like get my nails done, buy a new outfit, make my favorite meal, etc just to remind myself that I'm awesome and worth it. Since you're college-aged, maybe see if your school has a body positivity group? They're usually run through a Women's/Queer Center. 

I think almost everyone has felt that way at one point, but I wish you all the best!
