I have a very different point of view.  (Not trying to be combative here. Just trying to provide a variety of points of view.)  Everything matters.  Every single point on every single test.  Every single thing you do has consequences.  If you make a mistake, learn from it, and do better next time.  To each his or her own, I suppose.
