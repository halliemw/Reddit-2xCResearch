It is worse than that.  Because the company has actually *said* that they'd [be willing to make a version of the shirt with "black people"](http://www.theouthousers.com/index.php/news/127142-controversial-fangirls-t-shirt-maker-vows-to-make-shirts-hating-other-groups.html).

And also that a version with "fanboys" wasn't actually actively being sold, it was just an option they could theoretically make.  So in your analogy there'd be a shirt disparaging black people, but they could *totes* make fun of white people if anyone wanted them too!
