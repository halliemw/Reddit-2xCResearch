According to Google Ad Planner's estimate, as of May 2013, the median Reddit user is male (59%), 25â€“34 years of age, and is connecting from the United States (68%) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit

Personally I'd say from my experience the average Redditor is closer to 25 than 34, and on average, incredibly socially challenged (just check advice animals for all the embarrassment and loneliness memes for proof) and full of repressed rage. Reddit is their platform for venting.

I mention all this because I really feel for this subreddit. I can just imagine how much the average Redditor would see this subreddit as a troll's playground.

I'm male btw.
