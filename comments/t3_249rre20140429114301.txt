Well, pressuring girls to participate isn't a good mode of operation. I was operating under the assumption that the girls were willing participants. Of course they shouldn't be forced, but this sort of thing really appeals to some kinds of people. I know I always loved making things "official" whether it was by being "blood sisters" with my best friends or signing a covenant and wearing a purity ring. I like those declarations of commitment... But not everyone does and that's fine.

I don't think 12 is too young though, especially nowadays. When I was in middle school, there were kids who were already sexuallt active. And now, with the prevalance of smart phones and the like, I'm sure that at the very least, a good portion of them have been exposed to blatant pornography even if they aren't sexually active yet.

The whole concept of "virginity = purity" needs to go away anyways... Any Christian who considers themself "pure" simply because they haven't had a penis in their vagina (or vice versa, etc) needs to re-read their bible.
