I've seen this happen too, and I understand it when the group itself has organized itself to be more or less gender-exclusive (like my aunties in the kitchen, who want to get down into the details of certain topics and don't want random non-expert questions - including from younger people).

But, in the workplace or clubs, this is very disturbing - and I've still seen it happen.  It seems easier to fix/break up than the male version though (longer history?)  In little classroom experiments, I found that the fastest way to fix it (when a group became female dominated and there was only one male) was to add one additional male.  Apparently two males can easily break through this barrier.

BTW, a very odd thing:  many times, in small groups, if there's just one male (one class I teach is mostly female), the group will elect him leader!  This is in a gender studies class...the students have a very hard time explaining how (in one 10 minute sitting) they came up with their leaders, but the ones who have the hardest time are the ones who immediately chose the male.
