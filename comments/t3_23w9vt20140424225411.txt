My husband's cousin got pregnant with her third child with an IUD. Just like your situation, they couldn't remove the IUD. I didn't realize her pregnancy had been so risky because she nonchalantly told me, "They can't remove it, so it's just going to stay in all pregnancy." She had a beautiful & healthy baby boy about three years ago :) 

Everyone is different, but, if I was you, I'd probably be asking my doctor more questions. Like... is there a point in the pregnancy when the IUD isn't a big problem anymore? Do you just need to get through, say, the first trimester or maybe the first 20 weeks? Is there a "riskiest" period, like maybe the first month? I had some difficulties with my second pregnancy (not IUD-related), and I just remember counting off the weeks and then days for the pregnancy to be viable. For me, it helped to kind of have a countdown--a tangible goal to strive to.
