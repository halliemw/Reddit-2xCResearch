Can we add the whole, "Nobody wants damaged goods" thing?

I was told that once I had sex, I couldn't have sex with anybody else because my mom said that no guy would want to have sex with a girl who has slept with somebody else. 

Also, my mom once asked how my weekend was, and I said I spent it with my SO, and she said, "what'd you do?" and I said, "we fell asleep watching a movie." She said, "no sex?" I said, "nope!" She said, "maybe he's losing interest in you!"
