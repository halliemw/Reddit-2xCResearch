As far as I'm concerned, this question is just a derivative of fat shaming. 

Are skinny girls criticized for wearing yoga pants? I've never heard such a thing (I do understand that there is a universe beyond my experience, but I can't imagine this discussion revolving around someone whose ass looked "good" in them.) 

That being said, since pants rarely fit my weird-ass body, I wear what's comfortable. If you don't like the way my ass or crotch looks then you can just avert your eyes.
