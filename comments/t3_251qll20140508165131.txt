My hope is that with time, the downvoters and trolls will get bored and lose interest in this sub for the most part, and our community will be able to overcome the initial adversity. The posts I've seen so far from people who found this sub because it became a default and people who've learned about women and what feminism actually is rather than the misinformation they'd had before really fill me with hope. The mods are working really hard to take care of the trolls too, so hopefully that will help stem the flow as well.

I want to stay and stand up for this community and what it means to me rather than giving up and declaring it a lost cause just yet.
