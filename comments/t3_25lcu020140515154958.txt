Former bike mechanic here, just fucking excited my obscure knowledge of bikes is now useful:

Step-through frames are not girl bikes, as they've said. They're unisex. Step-throughs are easier to dismount/mount in casual to formal clothing, without risking damaging it. I live in Toronto, right? All the businessmen who ride bikes ride step-throughs around the down town core.

When I worked sales as well at a small shop, I really tried to intervene in people suggesting "get a girl bike, your a girl". No, just no. I'd stop that shit and go "What're you gunna be doing with your bike, and what in the past have you found comfortable?" and then I'd send them on a nice long test ride. 

In terms of bikes being designed to fit proportions: If you're riding at a level at which that becomes a factor, gender is the be all end all. "Bike fittings" are when they measure your arms/legs/various reaches and find a frame for your exact proportions. Gender isn't a factor because whats relevant is your arm/leg lengths in relation to your body and so on.
