I don't understand what you mean?

I wanted to get a degree in Software Engineering long before graduating from school. When I found out it was only offered as a 1-year specialization I decided to go into the program I'm doing now and then do the specialization when I finish, since having an engineering degree is mandatory for the 1-year SE course.
