>4chan can be pretty progressive when it comes to gender. "Femanons" aren't derided with "tits or gtfo" just for being women, "camwhores" are.

Either 4chan has changed a LOT in the past 3 years or you're visiting a different website than me. /b/ was very vocal in deriding women. And everyone else for that matter.
