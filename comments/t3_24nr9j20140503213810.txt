I can totally relate right now. Yesterday my boyfriend of 2+ years said it'd be best if we broke up. Granted, he isn't in love with his ex, but he was my first everything and it feels impossible to think rationally. 

You are an intelligent, capable woman with a lot to process. For now, wallow and enjoy that Ben and Jerry's. Do whatever you need to do to release your emotions and understand your desires. As others have said, find positive ways to keep yourself busy. Eventually, it *will* get better. It might be hard for us to see now, but it happens to everyone. As my sister told me, "The pain will hurt, fade, and then disappear."  -hug-
