If there's anyone still following this thread, I want to let you all know that I really appreciate the support and that the professors did bust the concrete today. They were able to open a space as big as two tennis balls and now we just have to hope they had enough air in there for 24 hours. We're also hoping that they did indeed cleared some air passage, cause, sadly, there's a possibility that there are still stones deeper that they just couldn't get to. Without tools and without the cooperation of the planning department, they were not able to dig any deeper and we don't know yet the direction of the tunnel or even if there is a tunnel, but at least we didn't smell anything, so maybe that's a good sign. The rescue effort will continue today, so maybe there will be some good news. I will update on it as soon as I can, either here or with an update thread.  I did well on my exam and was able to sleep a few hours.  Even though I am still devastated, I'm also hopeful, and the panic/anxiety have subsided, so thank you all so much again for the support, and please wish us luck.
