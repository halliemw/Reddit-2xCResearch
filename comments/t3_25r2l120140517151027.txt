Actually, yes, especially in the U.S. where sociologists and psychologists find that "conformity" is a higher value than "freedom" for many people particular those under 40.

Your post underscores this (even if you feel disgusted, you want to "find the trick of the equilibrium" - middle point that helps you conform to the setting).  

Whether or not I'm approachable (in general or in the moment) is part of who I am, but I have a job where I knew going in that I'd have to do some acting, which is how I view it.  A new skill for me.  So I guess that's how I play it to myself.
