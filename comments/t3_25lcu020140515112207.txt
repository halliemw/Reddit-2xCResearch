Wow, I had the exact same fight with my father a few weeks ago. I went to visit him and he had five bikes. We we're going for a twelve mile bike ride with my brother and he tried to force me to use a female "cruiser" bike. The ones with the weird U shaped handlebars and only three gears. There was no way I was going to get on a cruiser and ride 12 miles with that man. He would have bitched the whole way that I wasn't keeping up because I'm a woman.

I compete in triathlons. I know what bikes are best for me and how I ride. Riding twelve miles on a stupid beach bike because I'm a woman is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

Good on you for standing up to him.
