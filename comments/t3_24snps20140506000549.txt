You know, most of the time I dont care. I have just been more curious as to where people get this from? And why it matters? Sure, it would matter if I was making new friends and they were curious so as to who to pair me up with or something like that but random people?? Like, really? Whats the point to this conversation? I try and ask them the same thing and they give me this look of, "of course I am!" How am I supposed to know? Ever seen those ads on craigslists for m4m? A lot of 'straight' postings on there for some odd reasons.... lol
