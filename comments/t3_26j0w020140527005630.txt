>>And, you know, six people just got murdered.

>Four of which were men. People seem to be neglecting that fact.

No, no one is neglecting that fact. This whole thing is devastating and no one here is saying that the women who were killed were more important than the men. What they are saying is that if he'd gotten in that door, the body count could have been much larger (which was his goal). And all the resentment and anger towards women that he had and which, at least for me, was an eye opener how many other men share with him is really sad and scary.
