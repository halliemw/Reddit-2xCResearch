most have been good. I'm kind of a busy person so i can only occasionally do meetups. Consistently going to the same group's events over and over again seem to be the easiest way to find a group to acutally hang out with. And really it depends from group to group since the membes can be so drastically different. 

I think there's a sub group for "meeting people" like there are subgroups for arts and sports and such.
