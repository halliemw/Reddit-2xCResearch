Oh, I absolutely am a mess. I can't really hold anything down after eating because my stomach hurts and I feel nauseous all the time. 

I last called him, leaving a message to the tune of "how can you do this to another human being? You have to know that this hurts me, and I am affected by this. You are upsetting me and you don't even care." I know he listened to it for sure, and he hasn't replied. That was Tuesday. I'm not reaching out again, though my best friend is urging me to try one last time for his birthday on June 12. I have a gift that I saved up literally for months for, and it's something he's been wanting for a while and... she thinks I should send it to him with a quick happy birthday note and a "will I see you in (name of town)?"

I don't know if that's a good idea, but the gift is useless to me. :-/
