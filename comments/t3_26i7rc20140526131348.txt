I reported three, and I hope something comes of those reports.

I really resented that admin post, actually, because I feel that all it did was make it more difficult for women who are receiving these nasty PMs to get support. Now, every time PM harassment is brought up here, some loser troll will say, "UH, BUT THE MODS SAID THAT THOSE DON'T REAL, SO IT'S NOT A PROBLEM."

Not exactly helpful.
