Thank you all for the responses! I just took the time to read them all and they truly meant a lot to me each. It is good to know that 2X and reddit have so many kind and thoughtful people. After the first hour of responses I took the time to think and then I decided that he was being negligent of my humanity and my feelings and decided it was time to end it. Off to his house!
