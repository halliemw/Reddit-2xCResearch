Is this author really comparing grown women to boys? Those grown women who were in elementary school 20+ years ago?

~~The problems facing school age boys will rear their head 10-20 years from now when they are grown up and trying to enter the job market.~~ Edit: I guess I was wrong about this.

The longer we let these children slip the the cracks, the more problems there will be later down the road.
