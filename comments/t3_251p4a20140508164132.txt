It totally is tokenism. I'm getting downvoted to hell because I ask for a stabilizing factor that would make for an equal & opposite platform. I really don't get the whole "reddit is full of males" idea; I've always thought of reddit as a neutral entity. Like, is it now a "them vs us" type of mentality for this type of ordeal? I don't understand-- the impact of defaulting this subreddit is more of division rather than inclusion, as if to say "Hey, us women are *different* from the rest of reddit. Treat us differently because we are a minority and isolate us to our own territory." I'm also loving the downvote = disagree principal. Am I not contributing to the discussion? Does reddit really just want to upvote what they want to hear?
