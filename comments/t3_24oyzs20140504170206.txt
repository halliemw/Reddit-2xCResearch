Yes. Yes yes yes yes. How are there still people out there in the world who think porn is real life? I'm a white bi girl who's dated (and just plain fucked) black guys, and somehow people think this means I'm under contractual obligation to only date and be attracted to black men for the rest of forever. Sorry, but no. When black guys approach me and say something like "so, I heard you like black guys" it's seriously the biggest turnoff in the world. By your logic, just because my ex's great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother came from the same continent as your great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother, I'm now obligated to coo about how big your dick is and say mildly racist dirty talk to you? No thanks, sweetheart. I can see why you got so excited, since I know someone with that mentality isn't getting anything from any black girls. 

I can only imagine how hard it must be for trans ladies to get someone to take them seriously as a person, and not just as a sex object. Wow, you *don't* spend 3 hours a day putting on makeup and running down the street in 6 inch heels with a rainbow flag on one hand a a dildo in another? Whaaaa?
