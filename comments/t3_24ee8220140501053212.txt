I'm going through the same stuff. I crashed last year, right at the beginning of my fourth year of college. I quit my job, cut back on my course load, upped my meds, and still ended up withdrawing in the middle of spring semester. I'm still dealing with the mental and emotional drawbacks, even though I'm doing much better. I'm pretty hard on myself which certainly isn't helping my recovery, lol.
