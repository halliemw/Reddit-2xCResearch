Politics is a touchy subject for a lot of people and usually leads to kneejerk reactionary thinking. If you encounter a situation when someone treats you in an sexist manner, it's natural as an educated individual to contextualize that as being about a much wider issue i.e. institutional sexism. Which it is. 

But perhaps when talking about it with him, it would be better to reframe the moment as a personal experience where you felt yourself *personally* being unfairly treated and dismissed and how bad that made you feel. That way it would trigger his 'empathy' circuits rather than his 'politics' circuits. He's your boyfriend because he cares about you, not because he is a feminist after all.
