As molecool said, the curly hair subreddit is where it's at.  It is best to get rid of as many of the sulfate products as you can, yes it does severely reduce your options... in the grocery store.  There are lots of options you can order online though.  I get the new loreal sulfate free curly hair stuff, they carry it in most grocery stores now I think (the sulfate free thing is starting to catch on it seems).  I use their hairspray too.  But I still use an argon oil that has sulfates in it I think.  I need to find a replacement for it now that it's summer.  It works fine for me in the winter, but in the summer it's super humid where I'm at.  So the frizz just gets crazy.  I still haven't quite figured out how to tame it all summer long.  But most of the fall/spring/winter, my hair looks pretty good now.  Haha.  The no poo method really does work though.  I get lazy and don't always remember to buy more shampoo so a lot of the time, I'm only washing my hair with conditioner.  The main reason I still use shampoo is because I have some minor scalp issues.
