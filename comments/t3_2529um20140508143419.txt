Hey Mortified,

Thanks for being brave enough to post this. 

I didnt read anything I thought you did wrong. Its not pathetic to be "love-blind" as you are saying. When he saw you and was repulsed, that was his problem. I think what is happening is you are afraid that same situation is going to happen again. I just want to remind you not every male is the same, not every situation will be the same. You said you haven't been with anyone since, so the last memory of you trying to be with someone is that painful memory of him being repulsed. What I think might help you is to put yourself out there. 

I once had a situation just like this. I was set up on a blind date from my friends.Our texts and talks beforehand were very playful and friendly. When we finally met up,  She saw me as a short Asian male and right away the smile turned to an indifferenced face. I didn't hear or see any of the playfulness from the text in real life. I felt like the biggest loser ever because of that. I know it wasnt the same intense connection you had with the guy, but what helped me was actually meeting someone that wanted me for me. It might happen right away, and it might not happen for a while. But I think once you have a better experience the romantic self confidence will grow as well.

Hope that helped at least a little.
