I just discovered Iggy Azalea for the first time because of this story. The racist stuff she says (and the culturally appropriative stuff in her videos) makes me sad, but as someone who also grew up in Australia, I'm not really surprised. I've lived in the US for over ten years now, and something that's become really apparent to me is that, in large part because of the Civil Rights movement, the United States is better than Australia at having open discourse about racial issues. In Australia, we don't even understand that half the shit we say about other races is offensive. We haven't had to examine white privilege or culturally institutionalized racism to the extent that liberal whites are being confronted with it here. Some of the racist stuff that I see her doing is obviously the result of sheer cluelessness.

It doesn't excuse it by any means. And she's lived here long enough now that she should be starting to get a clue by now (although perhaps she's lived in a bubble where she hasn't had to examine race, I don't know). It's just one of those weird comparisons between two countries which on the surface seem to share a lot of culture, but the more time you spend in both, the more different you realize they are.
