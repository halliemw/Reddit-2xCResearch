I'll offer up my seat to anyone who looks like they need it & would be open to the offer. *However,* I generally assume that if people need something, they can ask for it. I have health problems, and if I suddenly find myself in need of a seat, I'll ask- "I'm not feeling well, would you mind if I sat there for a bit?" 

I have trouble opening heavy doors, but I don't stand next to them and expect people to open them for me just because I look feeble. They often do, which is great, but I'm not offended or upset if they don't.
