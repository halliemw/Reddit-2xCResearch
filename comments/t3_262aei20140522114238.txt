No, we're talking about personal beliefs and why they're okay for anyone to have until you force them onto someone else. Law is something else entirely, because it's a societal construct (normally) created to avoid abuse and harm to its citizens. 

The only way law could be valid in this conversation would be regarding the fact that a doctor might have to forgo their personal views and perform acts they are not morally okay with, such as an abortion. However, I personally believe that taking on a job like that - that is essentially aiming at helping people - requires you to accept people's choices if it's in *their* best interest, regardless of whether or not you agree with it or not. That includes abortions.
