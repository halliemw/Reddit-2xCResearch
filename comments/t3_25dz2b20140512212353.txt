I was fifteen years old and walking home from the June fair, around sunset when I walked past this car filled with drunk ass sailors stopped at a red light. They started wolf whistling and calling out for me to get in the car. "Come on baby, we're going to a hotel party!" I waved them off and said "No thanks, I'm good." When they realized I was walking away they started shouting, "SLUT!" I just rolled my eyes and kept walking. I'm almost home, about two blocks from my house when a car pulls up beside me. It's this nice guy and his friend asking me if I'd like a ride home. I say "No, my house is pretty close, there's no need, but thanks!" The guy pauses for a moment and then responds, "We won't kill you." *crickets chirping* "Yeah..no thanks". 
I walked the rest of the way home.
What a night.
