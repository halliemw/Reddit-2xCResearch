good thinking. if you're not happy, moving on is a valid option.

when i was there i talked to the (male) bosses about the attitudes and questionable office discussion topics - mostly male-bashing or gross sex talk, which i don't really mind but they were already the meanest group of women i've ever met, but it was hard to concentrate on work when i was filling with rage. well, the bosses brought up the rude discussion topics in a floor meeting once. everyone immediately knew it was the new girl who complained, so they all made it a point (espeically the girl next to me) to passive-aggressively mock my complaint whenever the questionable topics would come up. i'm filling with rage just remembering this. 

ANYWAY again, i hope you can sort this out, no one needs this sort of drama affecting their paychecks. my situation is better now, but my career change took a drastic pay cut. i'm still happier than i was at that job, with money.
