This is what rape shield laws are designed for.  It has no relevance to the case if consent was given for other sexual acts in the past.  It disturbs me that you have to be the right kind of victim to get a conviction.  What does it matter if she isn't a virgin and sexual experienced?  That has no bearing on this instance where consent wasn't given.  She consented to sex outside of the school she did not consent to sex in the school.
