I have been getting professional brazilians regularly for about a year now. I also have ridiculously sensitive skin and I have found that a few things can make a BIG difference in the experience:

* take an aspirin or ibuprofen ~30 minutes or so before your wax
* shower and gently exfoliate before your appointment..you probably won't want to shower afterwards
* I always wear a loose-fitting dress to my appointment and pack a pair of my boyfriends old boxer-briefs. They're soft and streched out enough that they don't rub on my skin but still tight enough to stay up and not look weird underneath a dress.
* Try to find a salon that uses hard wax vs the soft wax and strips. It lifts away from your skin as it hardens and doesn't hurt me nearly as bad.
