I guess if you really want to get to know someone you can seriously read and process perhaps five profiles a day and write them in a meaningful way without mixing them all up, but if you're just shotgunning it you can easily do 50. So even if there's a balanced ratio of serious and shotgunners (a big if), you'll get 10 shotgun messages for every serious one.

Well, online dating is weird anyway.
