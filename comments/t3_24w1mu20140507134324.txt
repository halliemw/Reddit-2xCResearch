I actually started out just finding some guided meditations on Youtube. With the anxiety, I had a really hard time trying meditation just on my own, sitting still and trying to just relax. I just couldn't do it. So having guided meditation really helped me, by giving me a bit more structure. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPh92erBDw8) is the video I still use all the time for mindfulness. I highly recommend it. It's a good introduction to mindfulness meditation. :)
