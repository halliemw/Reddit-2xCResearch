Well, yeah, I knew that xD I was just wondering if my body would have a bad reaction to suddenly being denied the amount of estrogen/progestin it's now used to.

EDIT: Also, if my packs do come later than I want them to, I'm going to either have to use the morning after pill (if my boyfriend and I do have sex), outercourse, or anal sex since my boyfriend doesn't like wearing condoms.
