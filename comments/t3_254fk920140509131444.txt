Just like everyone else - I agree! My sister and I are big feminists, grew up in a very body-positive, supportive household and would play with Barbies for HOURS. We didn't even really think about their body proportions or the gender norms - we would have them go to battle with our brothers' GI Joes and spent half the time making up intricate stories and setting up their houses. Barbies =/= evil symbols of anti-feminism always.
