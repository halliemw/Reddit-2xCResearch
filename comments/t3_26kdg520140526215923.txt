Hi there - I'm a woman, and I wanted to say, /u/eraf is right. I'm sorry that you're freaked out about this, but yes, you are normal. I cannot emphasize this enough: **you are not a freak**. I sort of had the opposite problem as you - I developed super early (ie, period in 5th grade) - but that's the point; there's a range.

If you want a sub with fewer men, check out /r/femmethoughts. I would also check out /r/abrathatfits. They're the bra/chest experts, and are super levelheaded and kind. Trust me, I freaked out when I saw what my "correct" bra size was (36 F) - I didn't even know they came in letters that high! You'll make it - I believe in you.
