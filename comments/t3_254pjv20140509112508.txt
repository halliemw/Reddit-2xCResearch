When I was small I thought my mum was the most amazing person ever, like actually a superhero. When I was a teenager she was my best friend but we fought a lot because we were so very different. My mum is very outgoing, outspoken and generally a brave take-no-shit kind of person whereas I have always been very shy, meek and had self-esteem/confidence issues. She couldn't (and still can't) understand why I just can't snap out of it. Since growing up and  getting my own views and having a child of my own our relationship has actually become pretty strained which makes me sad. The hardest part of growing up for me was realising that my mum is not some sort of infallible perfect hero whose every word and opinion is right and true.  

I love my mum, I had a great childhood and she raised me wonderfully, she is a fantastic grandmother to my son and I appreciate everything she has done and still does for me. We do clash on a lot of issues that are important to me though.
