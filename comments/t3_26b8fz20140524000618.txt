While these tactics aren't new to Reddit (or the internet) in general (amazing what lengths some people will go to to "win" at internet), it is exceptionally refreshing to see an Admin shedding some light on such unethical practices.   


What I fail to understand is why people wouldn't want more good, contributing users.  Why would someone *fabricate* harassment where none exists (for that individual) just to keep people out of a subreddit?  It's truly insane.
