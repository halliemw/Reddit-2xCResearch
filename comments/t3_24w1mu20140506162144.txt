I appreciate your comment and I know how fortunate I am. I am thankful every day for what I have and I volunteer and give back in as many ways as I can. 

Unfortunately feeling thankful for my lot in life hasn't made me feel any more fulfilled. I know it sounds bad, but I can't help how I feel. But thanks for your input! I appreciate all responses, even the negative ones (not that yours was negative) because sometimes they help put things in perspective. =)
