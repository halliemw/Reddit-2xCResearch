It has taken me a long time to realize that we have to love the body we're in, even if it's not exactly the body we want to be in. It's still ours, and it's amazing. And then, once we realize that we love ourselves regardless, it becomes a lot easier to make changes. 

For the first part of that, you're beautiful. I don't know you, but I know you're beautiful. There are things about you that are splendid, both inside and out, and I know that sometimes it's hard to see them. But I bet you could make a list. Your beautiful eyes or strong arms or gentle kindness. When you're feeling yucky, remember how awesome you are. 

As far as fitness tips, find something you love. Walking, running, dancing, weight lifting, whatever. If you try to exercise in ways that aren't fun, you'll never make it a habit. Also, I'm a big fan of proper nutrition. I don't subscribe to one "diet" or another, but every so often when I'm feeling squishy and just generally not happy about how i look and feel, I'll challenge myself to cut the junk for a week or two. Once I do that, it becomes super clear how much better I feel when I eat right, and I'm much happier overall. 

Tl;dr: you're awesome. When you don't feel awesome, just remember how fucking awesome you are. Then, find something active that you love, and do it.
