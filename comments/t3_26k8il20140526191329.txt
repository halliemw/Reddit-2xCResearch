The link isn't working on mobile so I'm just making a general comment based off the title.
Yes there certain styles that look better on certain body types but it's up to the individual whether they want to appease society or themselves with what they wear. As an example: I'm short and there are so many articles that say cut of jeans I should wear but I'm more comfortable in a longer, boot cut style pant.
I also would never be runway model for a bikini company but I don't give a flying fuck because I'm comfortable wearing a two piece. I'm well aware that some people may find it offensive that my non-perfect body is being displayed but again, I don't give a flying fuck.
