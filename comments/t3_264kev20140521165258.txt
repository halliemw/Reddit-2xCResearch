Nay. In almost all cases where they are used, they are separated by gender. That is a form of gender roles that are enforced by schools, which is completely unacceptable.

They also hinder students from truly expressing their identity, which inhibits creativity. The right to free expression, even through your clothing is a right that is way bigger than your right to have an easy selection of clothes in the morning. I mean, seriously, apply this "only having one choice is simpler and therefore better" to any other part of our society. It's horrible.

Lastly, they don't really fill a practical purpose. I come from a country where there are no rules regarding dress codes in school. It didn't take anything away from the education.
