This is a great resource thanks for posting! I would like to add that progesterone based birth control can still cause unusual clotting.  I have a vascular condition that makes me prone to clots, an OBGYN that I used to go to assured me that the Depo shot would be totally safe because it only has progesterone.  I ended up having a mini-stroke (transient ischemic attack) within a week of getting the shot (luckily there was no permanent damage).  Because of my medical history I now use a copper IUD.  I had a history of blood clots so I'm not in any way trying to say that the pill or shot is not safe just that before you start any hormonal birth control that you know your history and talk to your doctor and do some research.
