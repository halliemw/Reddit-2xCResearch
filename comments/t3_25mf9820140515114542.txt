My ear lobes have two piercings in them (one on top of the other) but I only ever wear jewellery in the newer ones. And even then it's just a standard piercing bar, not anything flashy.  I got the lower holes pierced when I was little and haven't worn earrings in them since 2009ish. I just find it uncomfortable to wear "regular" earrings. So you're not alone, even among piercing enthusiasts. (I have other ear, lip and cheek piercings.) Just do whatever floats your boat.
