This is great advice, thanks you. It's heartening to hear from someone who has experienced similar feelings, so at least I know I'm not alone or crazy! 

I want to try to transition into a less demanding role but I'm so afraid of the feelings of "slacking off" or "giving up on a good thing" that will accompany that. Plus finding a job in this economy is hard... even if you have a great resume and stellar references. But I think I'm just using that as an excuse...
