Thank you for sharing.

As someone who lost 130 lbs and decided to get the excess skin cut off I have to say you've made a wise decision to keep your natural body.

While I did get the aesthetic benefits of a tight midsection, my body has been entirely thrown off and it takes a ton of stretching to feel comfortable and relaxed. 

All in all, congratulations on your achievement and your mind state; you are certainly an inspiration I wish I had seen before my surgery.
