The OCD sounds difficult to deal with, for both of you, but that is something that could be improved upon if he was willing to get help for it.

On the other hand, he's a homophobic misogynist who seems to have very little respect for you, your roomates, or women in general. He doesn't seem to care about upsetting you as he continually falls back on things you don't like and insults you when you try to mention them, he doesn't seem to care about your wants or needs sexually, and he seems to be unable to separate his legitimate OCD behaviour from being picky and rude (like sending you photos of the vacuum, that's not OCD-related, it's uncalled for). OCD aside, do you want to date a man like this?
