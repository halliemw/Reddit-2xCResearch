If I had to do it over again, I would probably go for some sort of science-y degree, but when you enter college at 17 - you're not always making the smartest decisions about what to study. I loved political science and it was hard to think about how much easier it would've been to do computer science or something. But I have my dream job now, so it's all worth it!
