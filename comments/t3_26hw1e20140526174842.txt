I think your boyfriend is great. I also think this woman is boundary-hopping like it's a jumprope.

I'm curious about the "out of the blue" part. Perhaps she and others at the happy hour were talking amongst themselves and she wanted a guy's opinion. (my female coworkers and I have talked about episiotomies at work, though we did not ask for a guy's opinion on it)  Much more likely that she is either hitting on him or she's just rash and thoughtless. Either way, she's unprofessional.

My answer to topics that are veering toward uncomfortable is to say, semi-loudly and in a comically panicked way, "HR violation! This is not an appropriate discussion to have!"  That way, it draws more people into the situation and can be laughed off because everyone knows that HR details the letter of the law, not the spirit of the law, and many discussions (episiotemies?) happen that people don't generally mind. His co-worker doesn't follow the law at all. But by calling it out loudly in a humorous way, it stops the question and defuses the situation.

ymmv.
