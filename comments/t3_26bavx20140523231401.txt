you should not forgive him and you should call him out and make him feel bad. you shouldn't do this for you, you should do this for the next girl. if you teach him that he can just get away with this, than you are going to end up helping some poor girl get raped. you have a moral obligation to convince him that this was not acceptable, AND that he is a piece of shit for having done it. 

if he doesn't have any regrets he will do it again. he needs to be taught that it is not acceptable to do this stuff. and if you forgive him, you are teaching him that it is acceptable. don't do that, don't teach some guy that he has the right to do stuff like this. it isn't about you, it isn't about him, its about what he will do to the next girl if he thinks that this is acceptable. its about the unnamed "her" that will have to deal with the consequences of him believing its totally cool to fuck with a drunk chick who is passed out.
