So I'm a student at an art school. I'm older than most of the students there, so I don't really know "youth culture" as it happens at my school. That being said, I have noticed that polyamory and the genital obsession is SO POPULAR at my school. I'd say 75% of the art is focused on the idea of genitals, pornography, or polyamorous relationships. I think it's one of those counter culture things that has just gotten really really trendy and popular. I don't want to belittle that lifestyle, as it's totally valid and acceptable and I don't hold any judgement to it, but I do think that it's similar to every other trendy phase (stoner, goth, emo, punk, anime, hippie, raver, etc). Young people are going to explore and try to find out about themselves, most move on, and some find happiness within the lifestyle. Your friends are simply exploring a new culture, and they may or may not stick with it. 

I'd continue to maintain some level of friendship with them if you want, because I'm sure this is something that will go as quickly as it came. I've had acquaintances that were the same way, and they grew out of it for the most part. 

I just really want to stress that I'm not passing judgement or trying to belittle any way of life, Every person can live however they want and that's totally cool and not at all a "phase". 

I wish I could give you more advice on making friends when you're in your twenties, but I've never figured the whole making friends thing out yet :)
