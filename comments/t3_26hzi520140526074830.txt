Go ahead and get a taser, but yes, sprays may be more effective.  Carry both though, why not?  My fiance is a dog-walker and I got her a taser to carry while she's out, as she's mentioned that sometimes there's creeps and weirdos out and there's been a few rapes at the big park she often takes the dogs.  Better to have it and not need it, I say (and it's non-lethal)
