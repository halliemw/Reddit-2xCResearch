It's okay to be upset. You don't need to move on or feel strong right away. You lost something that was a big part of your life for nearly two years so it's completely reasonable that you'd feel that way. Take things one step at a time. Allow yourself to hurt, but also allow yourself to heal. Realize that these things happen and that you are surrounded by so much love and beauty despite that. You'll get through this. :)
