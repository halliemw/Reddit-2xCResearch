haha.  I studied PR and marketing, and the professor that taught us about being a publicist, said: " Journalists used to uncover the truth and did good research.  Not anymore.  Don't worry, journalists are easy to take care of.  They never do their research, even though they think they do, and it's LITERALLY their job."
