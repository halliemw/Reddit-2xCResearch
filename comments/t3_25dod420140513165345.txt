Thank you! Yes, her practicality seemed very cold to me, but really, it's a trait I admired in many other characters (morwen, cimorene, honor harrington). Maybe was just thrown by Eddings' style, he tries, bless him, but his writing of women is a bit off, I think. Women seem to define themselves as being in opposition of or manipulating men for their own good. But regardless, yes, she is extraordinarily strong and I love her for it. I loved the Polgara book, where she threatens then slices a dude with a dagger, then calmly and coldly sews it back up again and tells him to behave next time. I laughed.
