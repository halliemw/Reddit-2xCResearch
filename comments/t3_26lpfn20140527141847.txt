Well it really depends - do you want a different job? Do you feel like you'd be better off with a higher paying job, and does your current situation allow for it? By that I mean are you going to school or recovering from something medical/mental that would require a stress break? Because priorities definitely come into play.

My situation is a bit different because my boyfriend makes more than enough to cover the both of us (we're both 26), but I've still been helping out a little with groceries/necessities etc from my savings. I'm actively looking for a job and fingers crossed that I'll get one, because I *want* to contribute more. He's fine with things right now, but I don't think it would work for him (or me) forever. If I wasn't actively job hunting I think he and I would have a conversation since he didn't sign up to support me.

However, if I got a part time job that didn't make enough for me to cover 50%-50% on our joint expenses (and manage a reasonable savings on top of that), I think it would only be fair to go with something like 30%-70% or 20%-80% proportionate to income. It's something he and I would have to discuss and come to an agreement on, because it really depends on what you and your partner expect in a relationship and how each of you defines "fairness" when it comes to expenses. It can be really tricky and stressful to discuss this kind of thing, but it's so important to be on the same page as your partner!

All the best â™¥
