I don't shave any of my body hair, just the odd trim with scissors or eyebrow neatening... however I do not like nipple hairs. Those can certainly go. I love my leg/crotch/armpit hair, but nipples? No.

As a side note, where the fuck do those hairs come from? I mean, really, I'll just be minding my own business and all of a sudden there's a single inch long nipple/chin/shoulder hair. I'm completely convinced that they sprout up overnight, or in the 45 minutes between finishing my coffee, travelling to work and looking into the bathroom mirror there. 


....just me?
