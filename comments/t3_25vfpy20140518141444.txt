I have been considering becoming a gestational carrier for some time and ess furious when I originally read about this situation several months ago.

These contracts are incredibly specific in terms of laying out the responsibilities of the surrogate and their obligation to the parents.  This woman was disrespectful and very much in the wrong.

Shame on the agency that allowed this woman to become a surrogate in the first place.   Better screening of potential carriers is needed on their part.

Also, I feel like the title of this post is misleading and missing the point.
