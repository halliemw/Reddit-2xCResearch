The only thing that will make you more comfortable is practice.  If he knows you don't have experience he will probably (at least SHOULD) be patient with you because you might not be "good" at it, but you will learn quickly and not have to worry about that anymore.  There is kind of a learning curve with everyone anyway, since everyone tends to kiss differently anyway.  If they care, they probably aren't someone you want to kiss in the first place. It is kind of just something you have to get over unfortunately :/
