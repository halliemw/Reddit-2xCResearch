5'9" girl here. I always wanted to be dainty and small - but that's not me. I'm thin, but I'm pear shaped, which in addition to my height makes me a pretty substantial person. 

Get her into sports, and maybe float the idea of modeling? I wasn't into it, but models are NOT short. I would only advise this if you could use modeling in a female-body-empowerment way. 

If she is concerned about the ability to wear heels or date boys (as were my concerns), a LOT of boys like taller girls, and heels are good for self confidence.
