there is a movement of men who plan on abstaining from relationships called men going their own way (MGTOW). i have seen some spinoffs within that community of women going their own way (WGTOW). if you frequent the MGTOW forums and spaces, expect to see a lot of misogynists. some of these men have been through some brutal relationships with some women that did very cruel things to them and have sworn off relationships as a result of the abuse they have been put through.
