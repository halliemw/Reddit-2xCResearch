thank you!  i spend a lot of time grabbing and pinching and pulling my skin in the mirror imagining what my body would look like if the loose crap wasn't there.  it can be so heartbreaking sometimes but when i remember how far i've come and what i'm able to do now that i could never do before, i am able to move past my appearance and onto life.  i  hope you are able to find the same peace soon.  be PROUD and kick ass at life! <3
