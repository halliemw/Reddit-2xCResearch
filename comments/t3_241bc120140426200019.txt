Well, I mean, I'd hope that most people (myself included) would take legal advice from Reddit with a grain of salt. I probably could have googled the legality of this. I was just wondering what others knew/thought about the matter. It IS really interesting to see how the answers vary-- from outright illegal in places like Canada and my state (Connecticut), to "frowned upon, but allowed" in other places, to "completely ok". :)
