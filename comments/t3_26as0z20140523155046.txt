marylou5 and I were discussing a side issue. This is why I replied to her comment and not yours. I hope you can understand. It's fairly common for conversations in /2xC to talk about side issues that might not have been raised yet. We're talking about our experiences, not having a debate, so there's not really an argument to straw man.
