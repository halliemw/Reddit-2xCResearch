Actually I think so. I was more than a little horrified when he told me the story. Notice I referred to him as an ex. :P

But on a serious note, I want to echo what other people have said in that you are not the problem in these situations. Lots and lots of people have appalling boundary issues, but we can't let that stop us from being proud of what we have. I've been used, I've been groped, I've been harassed, stalked, told I'm too thin, and it really did a number on me when I was younger. At 26, all those things are finally falling away, and I am so proud to be me. You are the only person you can change. Love who you are, and take society by the balls and show it who is boss. :)
