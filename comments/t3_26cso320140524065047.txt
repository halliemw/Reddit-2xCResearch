I'm sorry this happened to you. Full disclaimer, I have no personal or professional knowledge about things like this. To answer your question on whether it's a crime, is there an equivalent of legal aid in your area - free/low-cost and easily accessible legal advice?

Honestly, from the way you've described it, I'm concerned he was also molested in his youth. This doesn't at all excuse what happened to you, but it might explain his behaviour.

I'd really recommend trying to find a counselor/therapist that you trust to help you get through this, especially with the way that people you've told have reacted. You need understanding and support to help you get through it.
