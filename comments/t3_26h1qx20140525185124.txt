Victoria's Secret Body by Victoria are the most comfortable panties I own.  I have three, and they're the first ones I wear when I do laundry.  They're soft cotton bikinis.  If that's too much frill, seconding the H&M suggestion below.  I think I have like 15 pairs of them, white, black, grey, colors, designs, whatever.
