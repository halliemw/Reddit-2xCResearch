I tried the pill for awhile, but it always made me sick to my stomach- and I tried several different brands. Then I did the patch for awhile but ultimately my skin decided that it didn't like the adhesive (I developed an allergy) then I went to NuVa Ring and the shot and those made me CRAZY.

After a few years I discovered that I have a blood clotting disorder, so I stopped all hormonal birth control. Then we decided that if we have a baby things would be pretty awesome, so I went off it all together. I just had my son in February and six weeks later they put in a copper IUD and so far I love it.
