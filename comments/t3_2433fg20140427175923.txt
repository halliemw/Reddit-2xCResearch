Research is critical, as is having clear criteria for what you do and don't want.  
  
My husband and I have a brand-spanking new car turning up in 3 or 4 weeks. I can't wait, for all that it's technically his.  
    
We needed a station wagon. No SUV/4x4 big monstrosities. It was shocking how few manufacturers make an actual station wagon any more. That narrowed it down to Ford, Holden, Mazda, Subaru. I told him to check out Skoda as well. I'd spent 10 months working for Europcar here, and we had the Octavia. It surprised me when I got into one to move it to the proper car park just how much room it had and the build quality. Having watched Top Gear, I'd heard little good about them.  
  
The Ford and Holden websites were atrocious for working out what the engines were and so on, so we ruled them out (I hate Fords anyway).  
  
So we went out to look at Skoda's Octavia, the Subaru Outback and Mazda 6.  
  
The Mazda, for all that it was a large car on the outside, had little room inside. For the price and that, we ruled it out. The Outback was similar. I had to scrunch up my knees just to get my feet out of the back seat.  
  
The Octavia, on the other hand... is spacious. A huge boot (trunk), and all the tech gadgets my husband and I (both total geeks) could want.  
  
So my husband test-drove the Outback and the Octavia. We both then re-test drove the Octavia, and put in an order for the top-of-the-line Elegance with everything except the automatic-opening tailgate, sunroof and headlight washers. Blue.  
  
The salesman didn't seem to so much as bat an eyelid when I asked about parts and how easy they are to obtain. Skoda's relatively new around here, but they, VW and Audi are all part of the Volkswagon Auto Group, and share many parts.
