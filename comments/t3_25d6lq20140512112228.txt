Yes, we have. It's not for lack of conversation. I actually asked him to *stop* bringing it up because I thought it might help me stop thinking about it so much if we didn't have so many conversations about everything from "do we want to spend our lives together" to "do you think we should have a cake or dessert table?" and it did help, a little. But I'm still very much *looking forward* to it. And that's what I'm trying to stop being so focused on. I would really like to enjoy the moment more.
