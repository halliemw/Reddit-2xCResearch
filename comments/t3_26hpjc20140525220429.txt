I have had to learn to tell my BF what I need help with. Why? Because I don't mess with his to-do list and he doesn't mess with mine otherwise. 

If he gets pissy with me about not helping, I remind him I'm not psychic. I do my best to realize that goes both ways. Yes, it was hard to learn to ask for help - but it was worth it.

I feel for you though. Some days are going to suck no matter what.
