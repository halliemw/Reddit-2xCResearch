Aww, I'm sorry it wasn't a good experience for you.

Honestly, though, most people's first times are nothing like you expect. I was one of those girls who envisioned it as this super romantic, life-altering moment that I would look back on for the rest of my life as this incredible memory. Yeah. No.

My first time with my boyfriend a few years ago was horribly awkward and uncomfortable. We had no idea what we were doing, I was super nervous, and I just kind of laid there for awhile while he did his thing. We eventually gave up since nothing was happening. He was embarrassed because he didn't finish, I was upset because I thought he was mad it didn't go well... it was just an awkward mess all around.

It's been almost three years since that happened, and I'm still with him and sex is fantastic. Sometimes we mention our horrible first time and laugh over how hilarious it is to look back on. Practice makes perfect! It was only your first time. Some pain and awkwardness is to be expected, but all of that will pass and you'll be okay :)
