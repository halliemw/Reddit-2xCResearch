I've been reading a lot of conflicting facts, but my current understanding is that:

* this company did sell both "fanboy" and "fangirl" t-shirts at the conference

* although only the "fangirl" version is on display at their website, they are a custom t-shirt company and therefore willing to replace "fangirl" with pretty much anything you like.

I haven't really been able to find good sources though.  In general, I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt and take them at their word.  Though even at their word, I think we both agree the situation is still problematic.
