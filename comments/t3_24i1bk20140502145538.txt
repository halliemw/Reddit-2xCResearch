It's not distracting, honestly! An old coworker of mine had a couple of moles removed and the scars look very similar to chicken pox scars, little shallow craters. I would just assume they're chicken pox scars if I didn't know that she had a procedure done, really. 

P.S. We are cheek mole twins! Seriously the same spot - my sister has one too but it's lower.
