Hey, I hope you don't get hate mail for this post. Thank you for telling your story - hearing about the backlash from unsupportive partners and family is incredibly important. This is why we fight to have the morning after pill available at drugstores without prescription. This is why we fight for abortion access and sex education. And this is why we fight for easily accessible women's shelters. Because your story is sad, painful, and common - and that is not how it should be.
