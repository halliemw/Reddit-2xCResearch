I switched out of private schools in 7th grade after bouncing between them because of bullying.  It definitely wasn't so late in my schooling as that, but I was a lot happier in a bigger school.  There are more people, your classmates change every hour or so.  There's still bullshit.  Some kids are still coddled and stuck up.  But for me they were easier to ignore and I stopped being the glaring odd-ball target since there were so many different types of people rather than just 30 kids.

And actually within a couple of years, some of the students from my old schools ended up transferring to my new school and suddenly stopped acting like giant assholes/became decent human beings.

If you have the option of transferring, I would suggest it.  It's not easy,  but for me going to a bigger school was the best thing I did as a teen.  There's no point in subjecting yourself to social ridicule and being constantly torn down.  The extra educational benefits you might get at a private school aren't worth it, in my opinion.
