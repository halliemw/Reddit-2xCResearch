About politics...

About Modi, his ideology looks tame compared to the Reublican right with its members talking about LEGITIMATE rape, segregation, gay rights issues and other social issues

>I think the greatest concern now is the election of Modi, who is nationalist and has been called a Hindu extremist because this huge swerve to the right screams that minorities (women included) will probably suffer.  


Stop taking out of your ass. He hasn't been called a Hindu extremist by anyone. He refers to himself as a hindu nationalist. If you read his campaign coverage, youll see that he ran on a plank of economic development, and not faith based nationalism, as opposed to anti-immigrant campaign  policies or bible thumping religious panderers in America. 





If you actually took some time to learn, you'd actually set how extremely ignorant your knowledge of the situation is. A out your being called racist...after browsing your comments id say.., if it looks like a duck.....
