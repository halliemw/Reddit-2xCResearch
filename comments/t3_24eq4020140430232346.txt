I had not heard the no massage rule for first trimester.  Sorry for stupid question but why is that?  Can they just modify how they do it?

I'm due next week with my first. Yes it's annoying to have to avoid some risky things,  but in the long run its worth it.   And it does get easier. ... I promise.

You don't need to risk yourself getting sick right now.   And as you probably know some sicknesses will hurt baby.  If our parents or grandparents may not have worried about as many details,  but I know in my grandmother's generation about half the kids didn't live past age 5.    I'm old enough that my generation put in a car seat and our oldest car had no seat belts at all.  I survived but some kids didn't.   The safety guidelines are there for a good reason

There are only a few big things I think to be careful about.   In my case,  I had had to ask my partner to clean cat boxes (toxoplasmosis).  And I do miss the occasional beer.  But it's just easier to give up some stuff now than dealing with a sick, developmentally delayed, or birth-defect child later.   I know It seems overwhelming at firsr. There's so much to think about right now.   But it gets easier!  And once the changes become habits, you may not even miss certain things

I don't think you should have any patient holding you and kicking you. I don't care how old she is, it's assault.  I'm a RN.  I would have a talk with a supervisor about facility policy.  If any employee forced to deal with it and get hurt, they will be dealing with a workman's comp claim.   Can you talk with them about options for safer response?  Can you perhaps back away and summon help?  Maybe the patient needs chemical sedation.  These got to be a safer way to handle that (even without you being pregnant)
