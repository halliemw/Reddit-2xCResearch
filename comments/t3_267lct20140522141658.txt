I think mine really came about once I started working, and particularly once I took on more of a leadership role; everyone in the professional world ma'ams me out of respect. Calling me "miss" would read, in this industry, as dismissive rather than respectful, especially since I'm pretty young for this position/industry and most of my peers are older than me.
