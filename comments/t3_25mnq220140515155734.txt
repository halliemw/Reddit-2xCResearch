My little one was born with a cleft palate and could not breast feed. He was also taken to the NICU so they could make sure he could eat and breathe correctly.

Pumping breast milk became *very* important to me in his first week of life. I felt like getting him breast milk was all I could do to help him. 

When he got home I continued to pump, sometimes it was a total hassle, but worth it to help him boot up his immune system for when he had surgeries. 

I did end up supplementing with formula sometimes, like when he would want to be fed an hour after being fed, and the milk from the fridge wasn't warmed up yet.

All and all I think breast milk is certainly the healthiest option, but all women need to find which balance fits their baby and their life. Working can get in the way of pumping regardless of the laws protecting us.
