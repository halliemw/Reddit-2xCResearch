> I remember when I was around 12 or 13, some kids at school teasing me because I hadn't started shaving my legs. So I went home & asked my mom if I could start shaving. She started crying & told me that I was too young to do such a thing. So I did it in secret. We never had The Talk. We never discussed anything beyond the most trivial of things.

WHOA. The exact same thing happened to me! Except I was maybe a year younger. I was teased at school for not shaving my legs and I was so upset that I actually had the guts to tell my mom about it (I also never talked to her about "lady things") and she just got upset and said I was too young. But I did it anyway because I didn't want to be picked on.

(I was picked on regardless, and brutally for the next year--to the point where I wanted to kill myself. I told my parents as such and my mom became *furious* with me and grounded me. I think that experience just further nailed home the fact I can't talk to her about "feelings").
