Getting rid of pain is ALWAYS worth it.  I'm 27, and I got a reduction almost ten years ago now.  I still consider it one of the best things I've ever done for myself. Before my surgery, I had constant neck, shoulder, and back pain, not to mention the ever-present rash underneath my chest that I didn't even realize wasn't the norm until my first appointment.  All of that disappeared post-op.

The social aspect of it was never a concern for me though.  Since I got it done a week after graduation, my close friends in high school knew about it because I had to skip a few open houses.  They were all very supportive of me.  A few of my relatives were negative about it, but I'm used to ignoring my relatives' old-fashioned ideology. If anyone else has noticed, they haven't bothered to mention it to me.
