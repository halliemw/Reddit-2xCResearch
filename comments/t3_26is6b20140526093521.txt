Have you voiced this to her? It may be worth it to try and have a calm dialogue with her. Tell her what you feel you're doing to help her along and explain that she isn't reciprocating and making you feel generally bad with her excessive critiques. 

Another question: were you two friends before this? If so I would never not advise trying to talk through it. With that said, do remember I say this with no context on the social dynamics of your relationship with her. 

If there really is no getting through to her, as the tone of your post may imply, then maybe it's time to start searching Craigslist or similar sites for new places to live. If you do look for somewhere new, try meeting with those people first and get a feel for how you mesh with them. And above all, try to keep your head above water! It's easy to get overwhelmed but in my experience (which was very similar to yours), things can turn around rather quickly.
