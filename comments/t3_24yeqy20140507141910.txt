If you are confident in your classroom management, I would recite Walter's White's "I am the one who knocks" speech.  If that's not your style, think about whether you want to continue teaching in this district once you've finished your time in the program.  I haven't tried to transfer districts myself but my colleagues often talked about how hard it was.  Maybe they didn't want to lose seniority pay, maybe districts don't like transfers?  I'm not sure.

Does your boyfriend feel his fear is rational, or irrational?  You don't sound afraid so I wonder if he feels you are misinformed about the risk, or if he feels that any risk is simply too much.  Ultimately your career is your decision and while you should listen and consider your partner's input it sounds like the only reason you'd pass on this job is to make another person feel comfortable.  That doesn't sound fair!
