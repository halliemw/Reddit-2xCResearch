Just be sensible. I had a terrible experience where I dated a totally unsuitable guy who turned out to be abusive and cheating, and so I was on my guard with everyone. 

Take your time, if you feel your spidey senses tingling take some space too. It's ok to have a few days or a week between dates, even if you really like him. Set boundaries until you feel more comfortable, such as curfews for date nights. If he's a decent guy he'll go with reasonable requests anyway.
