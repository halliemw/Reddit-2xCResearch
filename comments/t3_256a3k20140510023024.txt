>And as far as ideas:  The drawer hunt each month for the period panties because dammit I am not ruining my good ones!

Haha so true! Last month I scrounged around in my dresser and found a pair of ancient, Aeropostale-brand panties I probably haven't worn since high school (I've kept them for this purpose only). When my boyfriend saw them, he actually complimented me on them! "Are those new? ;)" he asked... I cringed and changed before he noticed any of the stains.
