What you've written has compelled me to ask a question that's been on my mind recently.

For quick background, I've been really into 'geek' things (video games, anime and manga) since an early teen, but I took a break from video games for the past three years due to the demands of university. Since I'm close to graduating, I'm starting to pay a bit more attention to the scene again.

And when it comes to women, the contrast between when I left and getting back in is startling. Except I can't tell whether it's because I've grown up, the community has grown down, or a bit of both. I mean I held some internalised misogyny as a teen which I've since grown out of, and yeah even back then there was a guy's locker room atmosphere, but if anyone just coughs the words feminism or females or SJW in a video game forum now, good grief the things people feel compelled to write. You can just tell it's all being written by boys. Not men, boys. Under 18.  In most video game discussions you can't tell the ages of the people present, but as soon as women come up their immaturity is exposed. I start to avoid these discussions entirely now only because I like to maintain the illusion that I'm a 22 year old woman trying to have engaging discussions with other adults, not people I would be babysitting in real life.

This isn't how I remember it at all. Has it really changed this much in just 3 years or am I growing up?
