I was 13 but I was sexually active. If you're not sexually active or need birth control then you're good :) If you are nervous because of a family health history or just good 'ole unable-to-stop sexual health paranoia, I'd make an appointment to speak to your doc to see if there is any reason to start regular pap smears. :)
