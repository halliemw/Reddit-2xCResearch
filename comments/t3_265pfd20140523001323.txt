The first is always the hardest to get over.

I was with someone from high school through the first few semesters of college. I loved him, and he loved me. We were engaged.

And it ended. Disastrously, I might add.

I was lucky enough to already have someone else who supported me and had already been enamoured of me for a while, and now we have a wonderful relationship.

But while I was still with my ex, I felt the same way you do now: afraid of being alone for a very long time. No one ever feels like your first.

So you know what? Rock being alone. That's right, go ahead and rock it. I wish I had time to be alone before dating my current boyfriend, because I honestly have no idea how to live my life as a single person. If you can do that, your relationships down the road will only benefit.

Have fun. Have friends. Find yourself, however you feel is right. And when you meet that special person, they will love you more than you ever thought was possible.

Good luck. :)

ALSO:  As a sidenote, don't worry about the "click". No checklists, no instant chemistry. I promise you, you will miss out on some amazing guys if you look for someone with the same feeling. And no settling either. We have high expectations for men these days, and they are fantastical creations of our imaginations. It's not settling, it's being realistic.
