Hahaha, I got mine cut yesterday. It was really just a trim, it was to the middle of my back and I probably only lost 3-4 inches in length (which I okayed), but I looked in the mirror afterward and my initial feeling was "OH NO MY HAIR IS GONE!"

Luckily, it grows so fast, it'll probably be back to how it was within a month and a half.
