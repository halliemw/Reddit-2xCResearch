Cut an inch or so off the string. It's still easy to remove the tampon once it's spent, but the string isn't so long that it's wandering around in volcanic period shits. Magic. Also ends string peek-a-boo with bathing suits, enables me to go commando in tight jeans without string-related tampon shift. Nice.
