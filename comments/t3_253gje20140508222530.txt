I'm going to attempt to construct a thought experiment  in an attempt to determine the way sexual violence does or does not seem "normal."

Imagine that you have gone on vacation to an island that is remote, but otherwise very similar to any small, industrialized city that you've been to in the world. You have been on this island for a week so far and have overall felt as though you fit in easily--the people are friendly, and many of the customs and expectations are similar to the ones in your hometown. Now imagine that you are having a conversation with a native on the island who tells you that in the island's entire history, there has never been a single occurrence of sexual violence of any kind. How would you react to hearing that? Would you be surprised? Would you even believe them? Why or why not?
