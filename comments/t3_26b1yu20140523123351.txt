If you are comfortable with yourself, nobody can tell you what you have to do. If you want to change your diet and exercise, do it. BUt do it for yourself. Do not do it for anyone else. You are the one that has to live in your body. And no matter what size, shape, color, or whatever it is, as long as you're happy, that should be good enough.
