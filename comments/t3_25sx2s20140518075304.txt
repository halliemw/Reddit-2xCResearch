>I think, is just as important, and part of a much larger problem with how society still views sex. 

It is pretty deeply ingrained in our society that there is.  One need only consider the topic of children and sex to see this.  Consider how hard it is for many parents to explain even the basics to their child.  They are outright ashamed and embarrassed about it.  Two kids playing doctor (which is often times not even sexual to the children involved) has about become a sex crime in some places, or at the very least has everyone screaming to have children questioned to see which one was sexually abused (notice how it is assumed at least one was).  Masturbation?  There are laws where I live that make it illegal for a parent to tell their child when it is/isn't appropriate to do such (they laws may not be really enforced, but there mere existence tells you something).  Until 2 years ago, two same age kids caught having consensual lewd interaction (doesn't have to be sex) could both be put in prison for up to 20 years.

Once you hit college, people start embracing it as a normal side of human behavior, but even then there is still elements of shamefulness.  And most people still don't make it to college.  They are thrown out into the world with almost two decades of being taught that sex is dirty, nasty, and illegal til you are an adult.  Sex is like a sinful pleasure, compared to cigarettes.

And this is all if you are ignoring religion's contribution.  Most religions (at least that I've encountered) go and take all the 'sex is bad' that we give children and go and make an adult form of it.
