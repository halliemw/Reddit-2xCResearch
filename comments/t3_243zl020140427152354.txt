Most of it sounds good! Just one thing - while it's good you switched soaps, you shouldn't really be using soap to clean your vagina. Feel free to clean your vulva (very carefully as to not get any in your vagina), just not the inside. Personally, all I do is use some water and let Mother Nature clean the rest.
