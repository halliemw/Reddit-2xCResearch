House cleaned, all laundry done and put away, clean sheets, meals provided and cleaned up after. Leftovers would be a great bonus. A day of effort that will provide a week of ease for a mom. One mother's opinion.

Edit: Forgot to say one year my daughter had my car detailed. That was a great gift, too.
