That *is* very clever. Slightly off point, I see a lot of people confusing Lena for Hannah, and I think it's important to remember that there's always a reason for a way a *scripted* character acts and behaves - it's part of their character, and not dependent on the actor. Hannah's also a wee bit of a bitch (and a horrifying mirror for a lot of us), and is so self involved that it would take someone who is very much able to look outside herself to create her. We're not meant to 100% support any of the characters, or their decisions, and that's what make a good script (in my opinion anyway - I'm not one for ideal role models). Love the spanx thing.
