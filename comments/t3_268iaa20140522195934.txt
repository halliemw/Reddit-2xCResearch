Lucy Liu in Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever. Terrible movie, but her character is awesome: Intelligent, highly trained and doesn't need a man for romance or to kicks ass.

X-23 in Marvel comics: Wolverines female clone, has most of his attributes including his temper, prefers to work alone. 

Lara Croft because she's goddamn awesome. 

Faith in Mirror's Edge: Fast, agile, lean and realistic. Works out of motivation to help her sister.
