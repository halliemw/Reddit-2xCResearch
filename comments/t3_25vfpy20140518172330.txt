She clearly did not think about what she was doing, the child is not hers to make decisions for, she agreed to a contract, was paid, and then violated it. She should not be let to be a surrogate ever again at least. 

She did not abort partly because of religious reasons, she should have not accepted a contract if she knew she was against aborting a fetus. 
This is plain stupidity on the surrogate's side.
