>Once it is signed, you are beholden to it. 

Maybe it's different in the news industry but from my experience, if you sign your contract, you can ask for raises at any time. It's more appropriate to ask for raises during your reviews (3/6/9month or yearly marks) but you are allowed to ask for a promotion or raise at any time (an employer can just say no). I agree that most women don't do this enough but I've seen many men ask for raises regardless if it was review time or not.

So in my experience, you're not really beholden to your pay.
