If it's a chore you do frequently, an electric one is well worth the investment! When I use my gas weed eater, my arms are out of commission for the rest of the day, but my electric one works just and doesn't hurt nearly as bad! The cord is a bit annoying though

I secretly only bought it because I ran out of mixed gas and I was too scared to mix my own, because surely I would measure wrong and blow something up?
