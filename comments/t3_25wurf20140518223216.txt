I DO, but I tend to put it on lockdown when I meet new people, unless it's *very* gentle. My boyfriend told me recently that one of the things he likes about me is that I am *always* a lady in public, no matter how I feel about a person (for example, a family member). I am seriously where drama goes to die. When it comes to work colleagues/"friends," I keep confidences. I don't gossip.

Thanks for the questions. It's actually helping me to think this through.
