You said in your post that "there should be" a limit on how many abortions someone can have.

You said in your post that you were shifting to an increasingly anti-abortion point of view and questioned whether you were still pro-choice.

So I was just pointing out that legislating the gray area that you're uncomfortable with is extremely problematic.

Now you say "in no way means I would prevent these women from having the choice to get one." So you're still pro-choice despite your questions on whether you were or not. Confusing.
