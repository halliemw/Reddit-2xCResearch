My aunt is a SPED teacher, and when all of her assistants were unavailable (one out of the room, the other with a child in the restroom, etc.) one of her students threw a desk at her. The guy was almost six feet tall and really strong, and it bruised her ribs badly. She also broke her wrist in the fall. Even though some of these young men and women don't understand what they're doing, they can be dangerous to themselves or others without very careful behavioral training and supervision. Most are capable of understanding what should and shouldn't be done, so with the right care should be able to follow these norms.
