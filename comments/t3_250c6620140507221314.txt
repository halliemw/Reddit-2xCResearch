One of my best friends agreed to be a bridesmaid for me, then took a job at a summer camp across the country. She then decided to come back into town on THE NIGHT BEFORE my wedding even though she had never even tried on her dress, and even though she had additional leave days she could have used (she told me she "just didn't want to leave sooner"). Because of this she missed the rehearsal, rehearsal dinner, and bachelorette party. Was I hurt? Yeah. But I didn't kick her out. It wouldn't have fixed anything and in fact would have just made things worse.
