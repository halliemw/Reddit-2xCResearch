Fake it until you make it. If it's 3-4 times per semester (so once a month?) make it a goal to attend 3/4 of them at least. Even if you don't enjoy attending them in particular, it will mean the *world* to your sister. It sucks that your parents didn't attend your concerts, but don't take their mistakes out on your sis!
