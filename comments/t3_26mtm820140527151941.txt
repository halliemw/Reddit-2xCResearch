I definitely know it's been changed to every 3 at the minimum since back in 2011 when I got mine, was when the doctor told me that it was changed from every year to every three years-but every 5 years if it's normal? Seems odd to me, but a doctor told me that last week. Though she also didn't seem so bright, either. The only "every 5 years" candidates that I am reading up on say for women over age 30 with normal paps...I'm 26 so...yeah. If I have to make another appointment this summer then I will.
