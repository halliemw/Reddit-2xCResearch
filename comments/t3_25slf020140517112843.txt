I used to work at a Kroger. We would have this man--the red jacket man-- who would come in every single day. He would go to the lines of the cashiers who were women, just to belittle them for being women. "Why don't you have a man? Why aren't you at home taking care of children?" or "Wow. if I worked here, I'd hate myself. You should go better yourselves."

And no matter how hard we complained, management would do nothing about this customer. He made one of my co-workers cry. 

So not only was this fuck allowed to be sexist and rude to the cashiers, the management, who was supposed to do soemthing about it, decided it was okay.
