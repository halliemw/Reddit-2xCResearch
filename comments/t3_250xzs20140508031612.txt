He asked why you had let him drink so much. You. He's placing the blame on you. Then he said he wasn't himself. He's taking the responsibility off his shoulders and placing it on other things, mainly you. That's a huge red flag. I have been drunk with many people, many many people, and never once have they done something like that to me. Bringing up rape, trying to choke you with a seatbelt, hitting you....Frankly I've very concerned, mostly because I would never want you to be in a situation like that again, as it very easily could have gotten much worse. It is your decision what you want to do from here on, obviously. I'm sure if you brought up ending the relationship he probably wouldn't understand, just because it already sounds like in his mind he's convinced himself that he's done nothing wrong. And I mean, yes he was drunk, but he still didn't take responsibility for what he did, even if he did apologize for what happened, he's still diverting the blame. He's still placing the blame on other things, and placing the blame on you specifically is also a major red flag. I also wouldn't want you breaking up with him alone, as it's apparent that he might have some repressed violent tendencies and I'd hate for that to come through again should you try to end it. If you were my friend, I wouldn't want you in a relationship with someone who's capable of doing that though, drunk or no. I think you guys really need to have a serious talk about what happened, but if you really want my advice, I'd get out of there. That's not the kind of thing you want happening again. It's your choice in the end, but that story is very, very concerning. I don't wanna insinuate that this guy is a horrible person because from what you described earlier he seems very sweet to you but...you just don't play with fire, I guess. You can't take second chances with violence, regardless of the source.
