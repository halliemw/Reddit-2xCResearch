Then remove "from a women's perspective". We are default now. Its no longer just women or men who seak it out. Its adding another us them element and setting up two sides of the fence it a issue is so inherently female that a man can't offer perspective then he shouldn't comment. But other issues which are broader and men can comment or ask or offer there take or support then why make them the clear other. Its not about just being a woman's sub for women anymore because we are very public now and to start this with us vs them is only harmful.
