You're spot on.  There's a thread circulating on reddit now where a woman attacks a man and one of the comments is:  "you can actually see in her face when the feminism kicks in..."  WTF?  The only thing we need to be called "crazy" feminists is a vagina.  Then again, I may be biased.  I'm a feminist and proud of it.
