These are good, tough questions. Answering at random: 

The verbal abuse hurt more than the physical, and that's what brings me the most pain to remember. I try not to dwell; it's unproductive.

My key to moving on was understanding that he most likely suffered from depression, and that he wasn't emotionally well-equipped to handle raising children. I think being responsible for two other lives gave him a great deal of anxiety. This realization allowed me to let go of some of my own pain. That, and plain old time. 

As for anger, that's not something I felt much of. It would be like getting angry at the sky for raining. I know I'm still messed up in some ways. But having a decent relationship with him has helped a little.

Good luck with your mom. I hope some little part of my experience can help you.
