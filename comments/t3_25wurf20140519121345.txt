I would definitely attempt to inquire if you can. I know someone that frequently organizes meet ups, and as a result, his core group of friends usually sign up first (it's often limited groups, like only X number of people allowed into some sort of outdoor adventure event) - there may be some sort of waitlist if anyone backs out.  What if your rejection was in some way nothing to do with you, and entirely based on something like first come, first serve, or something of that nature?

I'd hate to see you give up based on an arbitrary thing.  And, it might be an opportunity for you - as the number one comment said - there's no friends there, no reason not to just try to ask about what may have contributed to their decision to decline your request.
