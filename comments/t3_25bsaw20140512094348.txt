Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry you are being bombarded by responses, but I have been in abusive relationships in the past... none of them were physical. The hardest part of being in an [emotionally abusive relationship](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/02/20/signs-of-emotional-abuse/) is that it's much harder to prove or detect. Even [being gaslighted](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/power-in-relationships/200905/are-you-being-gaslighted) is a form of abuse. 

These other people are correct in saying it will do more harm than good to ignore it and "put on a brave face". These are the stories we hear on the news about couples that bear it out too long without help- then snap.

You are a human being, and don't deserve poor treatment- *especially* from a man that vowed in holy union to keep you, and keep you safe from harm. You said he wasn't always this way- so there should be a way to reach his sensibilities.

Good luck to you. You have a great support system here. I would love to hear more about your journey through this.
