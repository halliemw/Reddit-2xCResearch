Hugs!
I am glad you are getting out of a crappy relationship. I know it is never easy to do it, just keep moving forward and don't look back.
Also, I have to note that you seem like a good empathetic person. What you for the sex worker was commendable. Maybe your compassion will guide her in the future.
