I am so sorry you felt the need to make a throw away account so you can make a sad attempt to "call me out" on my post u/dfhdfg45634 you're a funny little one.

First of all, I may be young but i'm not a child. I'm 20 years old, so no, no child. It was 1 in the morning and he was asleep so when else would you like her to give me his phone to read the text messages? When he's awake looking for it? Inbetween Candy Crush levels? Mmm... think not. Am I too young to see the man I've been calling my father tell another woman he loves her via text? I think not. So no, my mom is not a "terrible mother." She didn't want him to be mad at her and kick us out of the house for going through his phone but also wanted to confront him so we put the blame on me so she looked innocent in the whole ordeal. After I had called the other woman and woke her up and confirmed what I had read then I confronted her. 

You're a sad individual and your throw away account is obviously the yell out for attention that you claim I need. This is a caring community that offers help, advice, and support which is what i'm asking for. This story is 100% real and none is exaggerated or made up. 

You also broke rule #1. Great job, bud.
