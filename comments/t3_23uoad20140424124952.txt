So what constitutes a "normal fan"? I don't find this just sexist, I find it generally offensive to *all* fans. The t-shit is annoying but their comments about it are just ugly.

>Fangirls/boys are like those creepy fedora wearing neckbearded bronies...

It shouldn't matter what you look like or what you wear, fans shouldn't be afraid to be themselves for fear of being categorized as a "fangirl/boy".

>or hetalia fanfiction shippers, who make us all collectively cringe in pain at what they do to the things we love.

You don't like fanfiction? Then don't read it! You don't have to put down a group of people that enjoy to write about a subject they love just because it's not your cup of tea. (By "you" I'm talking about the company, not you OP!)
