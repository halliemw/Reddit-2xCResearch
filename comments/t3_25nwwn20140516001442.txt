Forgive still trying to figure out some of the acronyms and I haven't got 'IMO'. 
I hear you though, I could afford a lot of shitty food or a little health food because I too support myself with no help from family.
I know it was a compliment but personally I wouldn't use weight as a compliment because I'm not sure how it could effect somebody.
