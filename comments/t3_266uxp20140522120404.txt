I'm in absolute agreement with your response.  I just wish there were ways for mods to put rational, sensible responses like these at the very top as sticky post.   I have been keeping an eye on this thread because of how serious it is  and, even though I was one of those random people on the Internet who advised, I just couldn't agree with you more.
