Tried it for one period. I thought it worked pretty well in terms of my period, but it did not work well for my bladder. I also always felt like I had to pee, and it was hard to pee with it in. And to top it all off, by the end of the week I had a UTI. Never again. Threw it out when I got home from the doctor.
