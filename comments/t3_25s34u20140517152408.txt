I see a psychiatrist for general depression, and to be honest I haven't talked about this situation as much as I probably should have. After writing this up last night I wrote a really long document explaining everything that happened and why and how I still feel upset about it and just emailed it to my psychiatrist and told him it was everything I wanted to say but couldn't ever find the courage to. I know he's really busy so he might not have time to read all of it right now and I don't think it was the best way to do things, but it does feel better finally telling someone.
