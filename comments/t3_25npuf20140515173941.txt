I remember going to this get together, a birthday party, for a girl in a yoga class at a Hindu temple. It was a hot summer. They lived in the attic. There was a belly dancer at the party. Well, I hung around after the party. Her roommate was cute. She was standing there talking to us while she held onto a beam with both hands. She had bushy short arm pits. There was something about it. It turned me on.
