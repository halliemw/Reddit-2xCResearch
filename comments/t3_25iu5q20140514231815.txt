I just got to that part of the blog, and I returned to this thread to see if anyone else saw that, too. That's a ridiculous spin to put on what the girl said. It bothers me mostly because it has a tone of "you're not as hot as you think you are." It seems like this girl is trying to say, "why would they be staring at you, when they could be ogling all the other girls there?" That's not an acceptable response to what the Clare girl said. Not only does it not diminish Clare's complaint about how creepily the adult men were acting, but it's also incredibly demeaning.
