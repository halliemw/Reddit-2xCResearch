I haven't tried this one out myself, but a friend of a friend who works in HR told me that when an interviewer asks a question that stumps you, it's okay to say something like, "That's a good question. Do you mind if I take a moment to think about it?" It's better to take a second and have a good answer for them than it is to answer immediately and give a rambling, non-answer kind of answer.

Things are still incredibly hard out there. When there's only one position and there are oodles and oodles of qualified candidates, then a lot of people are going to walk away disappointed. Let's hope you left a better impression than you think!
