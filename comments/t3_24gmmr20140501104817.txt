leaving without two weeks notice is kind of a dick move on your part so the sooner you tell him the better so that he can find someone to replace you. 
I hope you didn't really need him as a reference cuz he probably won't give you one.

Call him saying you're leaving on said date and you left him a letter of resignation in his box. I know you said you're bad at talking with people but you're really gonna have to just bite the bullet and tell him.
