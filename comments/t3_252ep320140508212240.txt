Having been a tampon user for quite a few years, I had a suspicion that the diva cup may not be sized right for me. (Too deep)

There's some blog out there with like all the different shapes and sizes compared against each other. I opted for one that was a bit shorter and less flexible (Mooncup UK). It doesn't contain heavy flow completely (boo) but I'm pretty happy with it.

The biggest problem for me now is the optimal way to fold the thing. I find that if you don't fold it properly, it pops open on you before it has reached the appropriate depth, which hurts AND has to be redone.

But once it's in, it's AMAZING.
