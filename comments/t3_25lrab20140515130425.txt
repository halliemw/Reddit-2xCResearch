I get a "You look nice" etc., every so often, but beautiful?  That was a couple years ago.  I was taking the train home from a Kentucky Derby party at a bar in Boston.  Me and my group of friends had dressed up for the occasion although I failed to find myself a hat in time for the day.  

I was sitting alone on the commuter rail when this rough-looking young guy came up to my seat.  I had already seen him walking around at North Station.  He had neck tattoos and was wearing baggy jeans with an old leather jacket over a t-shirt that had some kind of design with skulls all over it.  He said, "Excuse me, Miss, no disrespect, but I just want to tell you look very beautiful."  I was pretty shocked, but I managed to say "Thank you, I appreciate it."  He went back to his seat and didn't say another word to me.  It's the nicest thing a stranger has ever said to me.
