Thanks so much for your input. You're right, my issue was exactly that - I was having trouble writing something so clinical and "cold," but I think I've got it down. It took a few beers, but I got a little cocky and I'm nearly finished. I'm super excited about the MHA program, and the one I am most interested in actually has two "tracks" - health care ethics and health informatics which I haven't seen anywhere else. Thanks for the positive feedback, I'm even more excited now.
