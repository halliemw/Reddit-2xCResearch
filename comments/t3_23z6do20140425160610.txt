yeah, i thought the same thing. turns out the RAINN statistic is from a study done in allll the way back in 1998. a little digging turned up a few articles from 2013 stating sexual violence against women has actually fallen by 64% in the past decade (see below for a link), so 1 in 6 is definitely outdated and most likely pretty off-base.
