I just want to say that you shouldn't feel bad about continuing to job hunt while knowing you're pregnant. I know a lot of women who have started new positions knowing they're pregnant and not telling their employers. Depending where you are it's illegal for interviewers to ask if you are and can't deny you a job because of pregnancy. You don't need to notify your employer that you're pregnant for a while.
