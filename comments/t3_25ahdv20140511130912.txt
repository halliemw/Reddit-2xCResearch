Well, if you're the person at the company that future employers will be calling to check his references, tell him that he's overstating his role. Can't do anything about his current position, but you can change how he approaches future positions. 

It can also be difficult to explain how roles relate to one another. For example, I'm currently an associate scientist reporting directly to the senior scientist. I probably help him label tubes once a week if I'm updating my lab notebook while he needs to get stuff done in the lab, while otherwise we work on separate projects. He returns the favor for me as well. As such, despite my job title, it wouldn't really make sense to say that I "assist" him.
