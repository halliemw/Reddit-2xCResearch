First of all, what /u/redtaboo said, and second, for me it confirmed that there was definitely something shady going on with a couple of the posts and members

 I had a feeling. I got caught on 2 of them (not officially confirmed but I know) and the kind of reactions in comments didn't read quite right. And I've had barely coherent people comment to me on other subs and I was able to read those fine as being authentic.

So as far as I'm concerned I got gaslighted by a few women. Nice. I was relieved to see the admin post because it affirmed what I was experiencing. I wish I had found it earlier in the evening but I had rl stuff and was mostly being reactive.
