I would not assume that the relationship is over just because she isn't invited to the baby shower.  If someone is going to be that offended over not getting invited that they would rather not see their grandchild, then good riddance.  The child will not melt if they are short a grandmother, especially one like that.

The baby shower is a one day event; the next 18 years are are going to be where the drama, stress, and other trouble could mostly come from.
