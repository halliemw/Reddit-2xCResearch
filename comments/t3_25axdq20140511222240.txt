>In fact, you were quite rude here[1] invalidating the experiences of women who don't like to be told what to do with their hair. 

If you consider that to be rude, I don't know what to tell you. I didn't invalidate anyone's experiences; I asked questions, presented an alternate perspective and received a snotty response. So I told that person to shove it in very mild language. If people here can't handle that, well, tough. 

>addressing their level of politeness vs. the point they are bringing up sounds too much like tone-policing.

Because it sounds like "tone policing?" So, we can't do something if it sounds like something else, even if it's clearly not? Do you object to the use of the word "niggardly" because it sounds racist?

>(or people like you who just feel like one person's response is the way everyone should respond)

Pardon? I'm presenting my opinion. I didn't suggest that everyone should respond the way I do. That's just something you imagine because you don't know me and think I'm wrong. I could make the same comment about you.

>It's not a contest of which contingent is more polite.

No, it's not. That doesn't mean that it's not a better forum if everyone is more polite. For the record, when I said "rude", what I should of said is, a good number of the people panicking have problems discussing without resorting to insults or obviously poor arguments. And there were more than a few comments that would be considered sexist and ignorant by any standard which is antithetical to this sub. It was disappointing and the people involved should be embarrassed.
