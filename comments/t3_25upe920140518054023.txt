I love cooking, but I don't know that I associate that with being feminine (maybe because my mum wasn't such a great cook ;p).

I used to wear pants all the time, and now I pretty much live in skirts and dresses. And I'm in Melbourne, so black used to be the only colour I'd wear, but I've built up quite a wardrobe of pink tops and tights, so I definitely feel more girly when I look in the mirror these days!
