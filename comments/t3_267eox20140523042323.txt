I have a Bachelors in Computer and Mathematical Science, but now work as a Business Analyst. My experience was a little negative throughout uni, being in an extreme minority of females that did Comp Sci. However, a became friends with a few of the guys and they were great to work with. I have done a little bit of programming at my current workplace and have always been treated equally. There still is a majority of male programmers but not as overwhelming as in uni. In my business analysis team there is a significant amount more females, which is quite interesting.
