I am late to the party, however, here's my advice. It's been six months since my breakup with the ex that i thought was the one. The solution is to fall madly crazily in love with yourself. Take extra interest in dressing up everyday just to look great, it makes you feel great. Cook a delicious dinner for yourself. Enjoy it while reading or watching your favorite show on tv. Take up exercising or yoga, join a class, as a result, look and feel fab cs of endorphins. 
I couldn't dance properly even if my life depended on it, so i am thinking of taking dance classes.
One more thing, be super polite with everybody you meet, listen to their stories. Sometimes listening to other people, helping them in tiniest ways even, helps us a lot. 
Plan your day, fun activities included. Take out your bucket list, try to cross off things. Write a gratitude journal every night. 
Tl;dr start doing more of whatever you enjoyed doing when you were single. Fall in love with yourself unconditionally. :) and this too shall pass. *virtual hug*
