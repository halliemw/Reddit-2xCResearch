Agreed with above suggestion. If you're near a 24 Hour Fitness-brand gym, have a friend take you to Costco and help you buy a multi-year membership. Sounds nuts, but that's the cheapest way to go @ $12-$15/month. Also, make sure you get references for places you look at on Craigslist. There can be freaky people renting places in exchange for sex or drugs. I'm assuming that's not your thing.
