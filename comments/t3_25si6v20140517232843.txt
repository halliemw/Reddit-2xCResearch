The problem is, now we have people derailing conversations, downvoting, harassing/threatening users, and making this subreddit unfriendly and unrepresentative of actual women.

How this has turned out is indicative of two things: (1) how many Reddit users are male -- Reddit/the mods thought making 2xc a default would attract more women, and instead it's attracted a bunch of assholes and trolls, and (2) Reddit is simply too misogynistic of a site to handle attention put on women.

Reddit as a site needs to **step up** and do something about this that doesn't involve throwing the largest women's subreddit to the wolves. This will continue indefinitely, as far as I'm concerned and have witnessed.
