I have to believe that it is and will continue to get better. I am very excited about the department I am entering. I am in a STEM field that is predominantly male. Many of the departments I applied to have maybe one female faculty member - some had none. The department I am entering is at a very progressive research university and has 40% women!

During my interview, no one brought up the family questions, so I actually didn't know the family statuses of the faculty in the department until after I accepted the position - then I found out that there are ~15 kids in the department! 

I think there must be a link between the progressive policies and attracting an outstanding and diverse group of faculty members. In fact, with my hire, old, white men are now the minority in the department, which is certainly unique from all other departments in my field that I know of! They are attracting not only women but also minority men and women. That is incredibly exciting to me as I believe scientific advancement is greatly enhanced by bringing together teams of people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

Anyway, it's very exciting to see where things are going and it gives me a lot of hope for the future of my field and STEM fields in general.
