It depends on what the adult in that situation does. If she decides to touch him inappropriately and he reacts negatively, tells her to stop, etc I don't see that as him doing anything wrong. If he encourages it, that's a different story. 

I'd say that a 27 year old taking a 14 year old out shopping and drinking is pretty inappropriate even if he doesn't touch her.
