No, your comment isn't too harsh. I appreciate it.  

Yes, I've been back to see my family and his. We do go on holiday with is parents and my parents and my sister have stayed with us a few times.  
I guess as much as it bothered me it also made sense for me to stay home when he goes away since we'd have to put the dog and cat in to kennels, find somewhere for me and the baby to stay ( like if his parents are travelling we'd have to stay in a hotel) etc. so it's a lot to organise for such a short trip and expensive too.  

Yes, him ignoring my texts/calls has been the source of a few arguments. He was much better about responding the most recent time he was gone and I hope he is again the next time he goes. It does worry me that he doesn't respond, especially since I have no family or friends near by.
