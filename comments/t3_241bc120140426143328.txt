A couple of years ago, I'd gotten a divorce and was looking for a job. I looked for a job for 2 years, filling out countless applications for the job I was most qualified for- waitress. At that point, I'd been working in the restaurant industry for 15 years, always as a waitress or cook. I had great references and got several interviews.  One question I was asked over and over was if I had kids. Never mind that I had a great track record- if I had kids, they didn't want me since they figured I'd probably call out more often than the college kids they hired. I told one interviewer that I was a lot less likely to call out *because* I had kids. I was broke and they didn't eat unless I worked.

It killed me because it seemed like the same places that passed me up a few times were hiring every other week, trying to fill a spot they couldn't keep the people in that they'd chosen over me. And they were worried that I qas going to be the one calling out or quitting without notice, lol.
