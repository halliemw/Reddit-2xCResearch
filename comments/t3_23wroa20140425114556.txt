It's upsetting to be viewed as something you're not (especially with this level of determination), it doesn't mean any problem with people ACTUALLY in that category. I've always been very pro-LGBT and I was in OP's situation in high school. Always a tomboy, dressed in a boyish punk style, and got my hair cut very short just before high school. Lots of people assumed I was a lesbian, including family and, memorably, at least one guy I had a crush on. 

It's frustrating to think everyone mis-percieves a big part of your identity just because of your style or personality - especially when you realize it's seriously impacting your dating pool as well. 

Also, when you're put in the position of having to argue/deny it, it makes you look very defensive and in-denial to people who refuse to listen. I don't want to be seen that way. I don't want people to be thinking, "Oh, it's so sad she won't accept who she is or be open with the people around her..." or think I'm full of shit. I just want to shout that I wouldn't be embarrassed if it were true, it just isn't.
