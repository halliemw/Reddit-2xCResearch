Depends on what you do with it.

I went to a Midwestern public school for video production, and everyone I know from that program that's moved to NYC or LA has been successful, easily making enough to pay off school loans. Like 40-50 per year move to these cities to work in television/movies, and all of them are making bank. Personally, I work in Hollywood and I'm doing quite well. 

Everyone that stayed back in our home state? Can't say the same. Some of them have done well... most of them have irrelevant office jobs.

It's not even a privledge thing. I came out to LA with no job, no car, no apartment, and only about $4,000. The network my school has is strong and helped me on my way. 

Conversely, I know plenty of engineers that aren't making enough to pay off their school loans.
