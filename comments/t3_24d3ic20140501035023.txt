It is a lot easier when it comes back with a positive. I cried like a baby and had a melt down in the doctors office but I had my boyfriend who fully supports me with all of this so it was way easier to face. Try to bring someone with you because they shoot a lot of facts at you and I found it easier to have someone to talk about that was there instead of relaying the facts later.

Another thing to do is to try not to see it as losing them, your just getting ones that will pretty much always be awesome and perky! I don't have much advice for that point because I don't feel that way but I know my mom had trouble after her surgery and never opted for reconstruction. As a little kid you don't notice that they don't look right because you don't have them/see others but thinking back I could see how it was an issue. 

Are you on birth control? If so YAY, my doctor says it helps protect your ovaries. I can't remember how exactly but its good to be on it if you aren't :)
