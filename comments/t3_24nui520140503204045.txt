I did respond to the other poster,I was in no means trying to be dishonest.

The circumstances were less than flattering,and I was kinda trying to save face. Neither guy I am sleeping with is my boyfriend,I'm not exclusive with anyone.

I have fat days like everyone else,and the day that I posted that previous question,I was feeling really badly about myself. But I'm like a lot of women,constantly trying to improve my self esteem and self image.
