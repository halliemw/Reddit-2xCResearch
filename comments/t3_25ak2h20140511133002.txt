Good to know. Thanks for the info. I felt like I needed to make a decision, but it looks like it's not something that can be done right now or quickly. My daughter calls my boyfriend dad, and he calls her his (this was a choice my daughter made, not us). Still, I don't think I want my boyfriend to adopt my daughter right this second. He's a great dad, but that seems like more of a "we've been together 8 years" sort of decision, rather than a "We've been dating two years" one. 

Ok, so legality aside, do you think I should stop asking her bio-dad to watch her or visit her or take care of her? What if he decides he voluntarily wants to see her? Should I let him? Or should I cut him off completely now, and only talk to him again if/when my boyfriend wants to adopt her years down the line?
