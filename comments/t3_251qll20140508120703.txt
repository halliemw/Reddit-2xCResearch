When you report a comment, it gets put in a special list of comments/posts (a moderation queue) that the moderators of the subreddit (like me!) see.  Then we read through all the comments on our moderation queue and delete/hide the ones that break the rules.  We can also ban users from participating in the subreddit if they are repeat offenders or particularly offensive.

Reporting is very helpful, because it puts all of the problematic comments in one place.

Please continue to report any posts or comments you find problematic/offensive.
