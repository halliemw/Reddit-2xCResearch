Married 20 years here with four kids. When we didn't want to get pregnant, we relied on coitus interruptus, which was very effective - but as a guy, you have to be really disciplined. (My vasectomy was a major experience upgrade for both of us for sure)

As with other commenters, the partner might be wanting to use this because he's heard of some girls not taking the pill to deliberately get pregnant. (trust issues?) On the other hand, I could imagine a woman wanting to keep taking the pill because she might not trust her partner to pull out when he should.

Because no birth control method is 100% effective, a belt and suspenders approach isn't a bad idea, unless your both OK with the idea of maybe having a baby together.
