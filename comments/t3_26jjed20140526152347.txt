Did you look up "tasers" or "stun guns"?

Tasers are illegal in almost every state, those are the ones that shoot out little conductive barbs that cops carry. Stun guns are the ones you have to physically press into someone to shock them. They're often confused.

Are you entirely against just taking a defensive firearms course?
