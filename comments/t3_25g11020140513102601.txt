So you're a fish who doesn't notice water because you're always immersed in it. John Scalzi describes this as living life on the [lowest difficulty setting.](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/) Just because you don't notice it doesn't mean it isn't there, especially when evidence can be produced (as the original author does) that it's still in effect.
