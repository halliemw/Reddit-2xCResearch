You're an inspiration. I know a lot of people throw that around, but you really are. I'm just about in tears reading your story. I've lost 21 pounds since February and have about 80 left until I'm at my ultimate goal weight. (I'd be happy at 175-180 but I guess my last goal is around 150.) I'm amazed at how strong you are and how far you've come. I'm going to bookmark your story and read it every time I think I'm incapable of continuing. You're a testament to how important health and strength is, rather than just looking like a Sports Illustrated model. I want to be like you one day :)
