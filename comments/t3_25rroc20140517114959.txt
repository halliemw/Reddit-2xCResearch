>it is tacky to put something that looks tacky without everyone in "the know"

You're assuming that; a) your estimation of the crowd's knowledge is correct, and; b) that your subjective evaluation of the cap as "tacky" is somehow universal. Neither assumption holds. Beyond that, your argument is just a personal opinion on etiquette asserted as fact, which is also nonsensical. 

You're perfectly entitled to your opinion, but you don't get to class it as "truth" arbitrarily, and especially not on behalf of people you haven't asked.
