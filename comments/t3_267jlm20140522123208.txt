Right, which is why Christians are expected to reconcile with those they have wronged.

The fact is that people hurt each other, whether or not you believe in God. But it is God that will hold everyone accountable-- including me and you. That doesn't negate anyone's pain. On the contrary, it's a reminder that someday the oppressed will have justice.
