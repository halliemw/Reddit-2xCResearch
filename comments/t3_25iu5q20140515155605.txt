"Impure thoughts"...seriously? I wasn't aware that the mother from Carrie was chaperoning the dance. I agree that this is a ridiculous claim. There was nothing wrong with her dress and like she said why should be penalized for the thoughts of others. This way of thinking has always irked me to no end.
