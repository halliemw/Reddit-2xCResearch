The issue with childfree gals getting IUDs is that the cervix and uterus are really small. Possibly too small to fit the IUD in. It took me about 2 years to convince my doc that I really really wanted one and before the insertion he did an ultrasound to see if my uterus was big enough (it was *just* barely). He also, mid-insertion, told me that he didn't think it was going to work (i.e. my cervix was too small). I, while I was in immense pain, demanded through gritted teeth, "just do it." And he did. And I'm so glad I made the switch.

I believe that getting off BC pills and switching to an IUD made a huge difference in my quality of life. I'm happier, more motivated, I lost weight. Also, for some strange reason, my hair got waaay curlier. I really believe stopping BC changed my life. However, as a caveat, this is all completely anecdotal. 

I have had both the ParaGard and Mirena IUD. First off, the insertion procedure was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. I think it's worth it though. I started with the ParaGard because I wanted to be hormone free. A side effect of the ParaGard is that you can have heavier periods. I had extremely heavy, long (like 10+ days), and painful periods. Plus random cramping even when I wasn't on my period. After 2 years I decided to switch and try the Mirena. I have no period on Mirena and no cramping. The only issue with Mirena is that I'm kinda paranoid about the hormones. My doc claims that it shouldn't affect me as the "hormones don't leave your uterus" but I've been struggling with depression lately and in the back of my mind I'm always concerned that it's the Mirena.

So, I encourage you not to take no as an answer from your doc. It's your body. You get to make the choices. Also, feel free to ask me any questions.
