Thank you very much! That link is very interesting. It's very hard to measure emotional/societal impact with hard numbers, so not surprised they haven't noticed an impact. Regardless, I approve, both that and the parental leave system. Small steps are still good solid progress. 

Belated congratulations on the birth of your son!
