It's unlikely that OP couldn't find a loving family for a healthy newborn with no siblings. Children in orphanage are mostly older children, children with siblings and children with special needs. 

To be clear, I am not saying this to suggest OP should get an adoption; she has stated this is not a solution for her and we don't know what her SO would think or if he would agree at all.
