This is the perfect perspective, I had a girlfriend who suffered from bulimia when I was younger, it is hard for a person to figure out how to support someone they love in that situation. It takes positivity and a lot of energy. One of the big things that I did to help her was to make sure we were active and eating healthy food because the way food and exercise affect your body and brain chemistry plays a big part in how you feel. It takes a lot of focus and understanding to help someone you love with an issue like this and you won't always get things right, but it is a process and you will have to work through it to get through it, both of you. It can be scary, but fear and anxiety will try to hold you back, just know that it is something you can do if you commit to it.
