I'm so sorry that happened to you, and I am so grateful for your concern. G does want me to have friends, he really gets emotional for me when I tell him how lonely I am. He has even tried to introduce me to his friends, but to no avail so far. I posted an update and we came to an agreement on the situation, feel free to let me know your input. Thank you for sharing about your ex, I'll keep it in the back of my mind.
