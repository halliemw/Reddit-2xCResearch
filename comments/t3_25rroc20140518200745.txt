Ok, graduations are about everyone. That means it's appropriate to show up without a shirt, or drunk, or to jump up on stage in the middle of the ceremony Kanye-style and start ranting at the crowd, right? We wouldn't want to rob anyone of their right to self-expression. Where do you draw the line?

I'm confused as to why you think a graduation ceremony is political. It's just something to honor the time and work that the students put towards their degrees. It's to say "Hey, you worked your ass off. You earned this. Congratulations." It's for the students and their families. It doesn't matter in the slightest if those students and families are Republican, or Democrat, or left-wing gun-loving alpaca farmers who believe that aliens are secretly controlling the government. People tend to put all of that aside for the sake of maintaining a respectful and professional environment for a few hours during the ceremony. Why is that such a problem for you?
