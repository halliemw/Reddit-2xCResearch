So true. I could try my graduate student advisor. My PI, who is a woman, works pretty closely with the sexist prof, so I don't really want to bring it up with her. 

My advisor and the sexist professor are in the same department, but I think that since the advisor's main job is to advocate for the students, this may be a good option.
