Can someone help me with this? I was involved in a discussion just last night where this came up. It was about that woman who drew the naked pictures of men who sent her offensive messages on Tinder.

People began saying things like, men do this and men do that, whereupon it was pointed out that "not all men" do these things. I didn't really feel it was a derail. No one was coming to the defense of the idiots on Tinder; they were condemned universally.

I think it's a fair point. If your primary argument is "women aren't interchangeable sexual objects with no other distinguishing features" you might not want to use language that generalizes about another group. Because it's an obvious double standard that people are going to beat you with. And it will spark a defensive reaction from douchebags and gentlemen alike. Which is bad, because you're losing people who would otherwise be your natural allies. It's an honest and defensible argument, to my mind. But I caught a lot of flak for it.

Can someone help me out with my thinking here? Is there an obvious flaw in my argument that I'm not seeing?
