Hey OP. Google RND or RSD. I have it. It's a pain condition caused by over active nerve endings. It can be anywhere in the body. Mine is in my knees, hips, ribs, neck, and head. It only started in my left leg but it spread over the seven years I've had it.

It took about nine months to be diagnosed because doctors don't really know a whole lot about it. Physical therapy is basically the only "cure", and even then, it probably won't help a bunch. Some medications can help, like Neurontin. I saw an orthopedist who happened to have heard of the disease and he referred me to a rheumatologist. You should consider seeing one.

Lots of people who have RND/RSD (reflex neurovascular dystrophy/reflex sympathetic dystrophy) go undiagnosed forever or for months/years like me. Not saying you have it. Just a thought :)
