Just a caveat to anyone reading this, deeper may not always be better. For years, I couldn't use tampons because they always leaked. Turns out I was putting it in too deep, and the majority of the tampon was past my os (cervical opening). It depends on your personal anatomy. Play around with different depths and figure out what works for you.
