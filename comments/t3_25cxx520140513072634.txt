I think the "everything will be alright" comment demonstrates that he recognized that everything was *not* alright for you at the moment - with that short phrase, he acknowledged that your facial expression was caused by *feelings,* and that you probably had *reasons* for those feelings, but he wanted to try cheering you up. That sounds like one human empathizing with another, and trying to be encouraging for one fleeing moment. 

To me, that feels very different from "smile!" all by itself, which sounds like an order, and disregards the recipient's emotions/experience entirely.
