I have never been through the system, but I assume they'll be asked for their address and possibly their NHS number of GP contact details, which might flag up that they're from NI.

I would guess the difference could be (hypothesising here!) is that say a Scottish resident has an abortion in England, the English NHS can claim back the cost from NHS Scotland, but they can't do the same with NHS NI because NI does not cover abortion.
