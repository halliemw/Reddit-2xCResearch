We are reading all of the community input.  We are doing our best to address individual concerns as best we can.  This is in large part a learning process for all of us.

However, I can't promise you that we'll have any kind of "official" poll or consultation.  We know from experience that ultimately, dissent is always the loudest voice when we first make changes to the community.  There is no way of conducting a fair vote on any discussion or topic in an open forum.  Brigades from other communities voted and posted in the threads and poll that were up.  Meanwhile people who are satisfied with the changes or simply don't care, don't comment.
