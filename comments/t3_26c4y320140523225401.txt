What is "plain old right" for some doesn't always feel that way to others. I'm always amazed at the amount of acts and comments from people who just don't realize that there can be anything wrong with their way of thinking in the first place.

Which is why I like that kind of publicity: people who read about it and previously thought like the offender may rethink their position.
