I moved out when I was 22 from an abusive household. My younger brother had just turned 18 so I offered to bring him with me because I couldn't stand to leave him with my mother. Honestly, at first it was very difficult. He had extreme anxiety and I was recovering from depression; but a year and a half later we are both happier people, he is applying for jobs and going out to meet people we lost touch with, and planning his future. 

It takes a lot of emotional availability on your part and patience, if you feel like you can embrace those responsibilities then this would be for your sister, in my opinion, a chance to provide her with a healthy recovery environment. My brother was not open to therapy or professional help, and it sounds like your sister is, so that's great news. It will help her feel back to her best self sooner.

If you want to talk some more feel free to send me a PM. Best of luck to you both!
