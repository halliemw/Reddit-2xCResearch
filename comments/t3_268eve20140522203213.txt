While you absolutely must do what's best for you, I would encourage you not to think of it as rape or even non-consensual sex. Here's why: the drug has a tendency to create short-term amnesia. When I was on it, I would read several chapters and then go to sleep. The next night, I would pick up the book and couldn't remember any of it and had to re-read it all. Does that mean I didn't read it the first time? Does it mean I didn't enjoy what I read? No. It just means I can't remember. It's quite possible you had sex and enjoyed it and that, in the moment, it was something you were fully consenting to. The trouble is now, you only have his word for it. So, it comes down to trust. If he proved himself trustworthy up until that night, why assume that he suddenly betrayed that trust. Does it match up with everything else you know of him?
I'd hate to see you throw away a friendship over an event that you have no memory of. But again, if that will bring you peace... it's your life and you're the only one who gets to live it.
