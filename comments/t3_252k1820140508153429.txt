Block him on instagram or other  social media other than your phone. However, I think you should disclose to you husband that the ex is suddenly interested in visitation and that he has said some inappropriate things to you. It will cause less tension for you to disclose than for your current husband to find out another way, and since you aren't the one being inappropriate you have nothing to hide.
