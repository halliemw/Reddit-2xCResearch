I think the big difference is despite the fact that an enormous number of people hate their job and the people they have to deal with, there is no community of voices chiming together to focus that hate into a laser beam of 'these people are subhuman, they don't do what I want so I deserve I take my anger out on them.' Doing that is, well, kinda looked down on, so when it does happen, it's generally assumed that yes, it was probably a mental health issue. 

But there is definitely several vocal and vehement communities of men that do this for their negative feelings about women, communities that the shooter was part of. Being surrounded by nothing but like minds is basically like an echo chamber for the worst aspects of the group. 'I resent women for denying me sex so I deserve to take my anger out on them,' is a state of mind that a huge number of men either have, or unknowingly contribute to in our culture. The toxic messages about what define manhood and dehumanize women in just about every form of media just hammers that mindset in even further. 

I mean, he definitely had a slew of other problems as well, no one's denying that. But if this misogynistic atmosphere we live in wasn't so overwhelmingly strong, it wouldn't be so easy and commonplace for these kinds of feelings to spiral into violence. Not addressing misogyny as at least *a* root cause is a huge oversight, and calling it just an outlet is practically brushing the problem off when it really needs to be examined.
