Yeah, this isn't my first baby, but it's been a few years so I have likely forgotten how exhausted I'll really be. Last time I watched The Golden Girls because it took zero energy to process. I don't know if I'm having a boy or girl, so if it's a girl I bet Gilmore Girls would be an amazing fit!

I just finished Gossip Girl since it was on Netflix and it was so, so bad that it was good. I got so much flack and teasing from my SO for watching it, and he would come in the room and ask what the characters were doing and who they were, and it's just absurd to try and describe it to someone. "That one is Chuck, he's extremely wealthy but has deep issues." "That one is Dan, he's the poor guy from the wrong part of NYC but is in love with the prettiest girl in school!" Haha, sometimes he still says "xoxo, gossipgirl"
