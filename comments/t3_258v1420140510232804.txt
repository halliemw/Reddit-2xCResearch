When I first started dating my husband, he didn't know that women's breasts/nipples are an erogenous zone. He thought that women just put up with men touching them during sex because we know that men enjoy them, so he figured a considerate man should keep his breast groping to a minimum.

But I am a woman who enjoys a lot of breast play, and so he was delighted to learn that he had been wrong.

Furthermore, he didn't even know that his own nipples were an erogenous zone. The reaction when I licked his nipples for the first time was kind of priceless.
