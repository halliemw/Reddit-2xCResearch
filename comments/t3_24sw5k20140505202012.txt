I think you're me in a parallel universe haha
My relationship was 3 years and I was younger but the break ups sound exactly the same. 
I always felt uncomfortable about him going to hang out with his friend who he briefly dated in high school, but I didn't want to be "that jealous girlfriend" so I begrudgingly said it was fine that he would hang out with her. Well one day he gets an iPhone and wants my help to set it up. I had a feeling something was going on so I read his texts and found some going back months that said he loved her and called her the same pet names he called me. Just bad shit. So we broke up and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want him back at first. You incorporate someone into your life for years and then in a very quick snap its all different.  

Stuff like that can really throw you for a loop and make you question your judgement, but you aren't wrong in what you did. You trusted your partner like every relationship should have. You should always be able to trust the person you're with. I think the best way to look at it is to see this as him doing you a favor by getting caught. You aren't wasting your time anymore. Now you don't have this man sized anchor dragging you down, so you can go out with your friends, cut your hair, pick up a new hobby, whatever you feel like it.You're allowed to have a big sad for a while, so if you want to stay in your PJs all day saturday and cry and watch movies then go on with your bad self. 
It might take a few months and that's perfectly fine. Just be kind to yourself and realize that you don't carry the blame in this because you are not responsible for other people's actions.
And when you feel ready, you'll be able to find yourself a partner that respects you and doesn't take you for granted.
