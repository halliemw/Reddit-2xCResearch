I discovered [Bodyglide](http://www.amazon.com/Bodyglide-Original-Anti-Chafe-Balm-1-5Ounce/dp/B00288L2N6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398909373&sr=8-1&keywords=bodyglide) when I started running, but it's useful for everyday use.  It works well and takes a long time to sweat/wear off (14 miles on a hot day for me)
