I believe that how dress codes are implemented by staff members in schools can make women feel ashamed about their bodies. I don't agree that dress codes themselves can shame women. Saying that you must dress a certain way to look professional is fine and is teaching women what it is like working in a professional environment. Telling women that you can't wear x,y or z because it will "distract boys" is what teaches them to be ashamed. It's not the dress code itself that's the problem (in my opinion) it's the reasoning behind it.
