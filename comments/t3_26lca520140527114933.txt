Honestly I feel so validated reading responses like yours! I wasn't sure if I was completely out of line for feeling this way about him. It's really great to see that I'm not the only one who wouldn't want to date someone like that.

And I know, especially because he seemed so completely nice and sweet when I met him. I was SO surprised to find his twitter full of disrespectful shit like that. I'm just thankful for the warning sign.
