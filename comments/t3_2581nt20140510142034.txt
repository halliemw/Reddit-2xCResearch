I was 30 when I got my hysterectomy. I got approved because I had crazy fibroid masses in my uterus. I had a choice of a hysterectomy or some short term fix that would leave me able to have kids but I'd have to go back every ~10 years for surgery. I told my Doctor that I didn't want kids, ever and to schedule the hysto. When I met my surgeon, she asked me how long I'd known I didn't want kids and if I'd asked for a hysto before. I had known since I was a pre teen and first got my period, and I'd asked when I was 18 but denied because I was "too young to know" then I spent my 20's in pain.
