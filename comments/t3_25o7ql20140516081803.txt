Not what you're looking for but I booted my abusive ex a month ago. I'm surprised to find that men, and even men my age (I'm 20), still want me both sexually and relationships wise. I was led to believe (admittedly very much by reddit and the internet in general) that no man would want a single mother, especially a young one.

It was a hard decision to make because I was very scared of that, and of the financial implications and such. It's very stressful and not easy at all, but I'm happier for it.
