If she doesn't live in the professional world, why would she dress like she's in the professional world? Isn't she an under-employed writer?

It also seems worth mentioning that a lot of the clothes she wears are actually pretty fashionable and expensive. I've recognised brands like APC, Marc Jacobs and Dusen Dusen. I'd love to own her wardrobe. She wears unconventional clothing, and she dresses down when she hangs around home.
