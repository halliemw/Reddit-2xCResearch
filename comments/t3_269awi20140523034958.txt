**Diet**
*Basic* imagine your plate. Fill 1/2 with veggies. Fill 1/4 with meat. Fill 1/4 with carbs. For dessert, have fresh fruit--an orange, a banana, or something else around that size. 

*Advanced*: eat as many natural colors as you can in one day, avoid white foods. 

**Body Health** 
*Basic* walk for 30 minutes daily. 

*Advanced* join a fitness class where they expect you there every time. Yoga or pool aerobics--doesn't matter, so long as it's interesting to you.

**Mental health** 

First, get specifically treated for PTSD with a counselor or psychologist or psychiatrist who specializes in this. After that, then do the basic/advanced, which are meant as general life advice, not treatment for PTSD. 

*Basic* do mindful meditation every day for at least 10 minutes. These are available free online. 

*Advanced* volunteer. Meet people or work with animals. Give back to the community and make friends. 

Overall remember that the important thing is that every day or every week you are making healthIER choices. You are making positive, permanent changes. 

*edited to clarify that I'm not trying to treat PTSD with meditation.*
