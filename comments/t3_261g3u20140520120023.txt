I agree entirely that it is odd she contacted me - I guess I hadn't thought of the fact that it could just be another manipulation from him, but I should have. I need to just step back and away from this situation, and the viewpoint that alcoholism is a "spiritual" disease is definitely one I share. I think I'm going to block the friend that contacted me about his girlfriend as well; it seems she's either trying to get me back in contact with him, or else is being conned all the same. 

Having seen alcoholism and its effects vividly first-hand, I wish you all the best. Good luck in your future sobriety, and thank you for your insight.
