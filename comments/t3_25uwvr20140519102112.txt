If you're really upset about the way the subreddit has fallen, then you should petition to have it taken off the default subs list. Assuming half of reddit's new users are males, then they are all being forced to be on 2x from the beginning. They are going to respond. Now, realistically, I would assume more than 50% of new users are male based on the demographics or reddit users as a whole, so the default list is actually sending tons of people here who shouldn't be. Do you think they care about the sub the way you do?
