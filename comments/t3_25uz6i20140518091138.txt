Sex and intimacy is all about being comfortable with yourself as well as with your partner. Take it slow. Feel good about being naked around your partner. Have you masturbated before? Don't be afraid of self stimulation (rubbing your clit) during sex to reach orgasm, especially because a lot of women cannot orgasm with only vaginal stimulation. Porn =/ real sex (this may affect more your partner's expectations than your own). Open communication about what feels good and what/where/how your partner should touch you will help improve sex.
