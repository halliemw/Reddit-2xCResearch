I'm a teacher and the other teachers and the principal say far, far worse things about the kids than this when we're in staff meetings. For example, we have Student A, who can be a little tough to work with but I really like. Student B punched him in the face. The principal joked, "How much should we reward Student B for that?"

I have attempted to stand up for students. Two days ago, I was fired for "not being a team player."
