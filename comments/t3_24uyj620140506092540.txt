I hope you share with her and HR why you're leaving, for the sake of everyone else there.  

Not in a mean or petty way, but in a professional and polite way, tell them that her remarks after your interview made you feel that you didn't have a future in the organization and that your work wasn't valued.

I understand if you don't want to - you don't have much to gain - but you also don't have much to lose and it's really doing the co-workers you leave behind a solid.

Congrats on getting out of a toxic environment and good luck on your new job!
