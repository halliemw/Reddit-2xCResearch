I work in a store where we get a lot of young, nerdy, slightly awkward people (which includes me and ~90% of our employees!). I honestly don't believe that anything that happened today was a power dynamic, although I have had that happen to me at work before. 

I would not describe either guy as creepy, just a little awkward. One seemed to have a "can't hurt to ask" attitude, and the other seemed really nervous and shy. So not creepers or knob-ends. :)

Even though it's not "fair" that people have to put up with this while they're at work, the reality is that responding harshly could get me in trouble. My goal is to diffuse the situation without being rude, because customer service is a huge deal.  I'd prefer to say something funny that lets them know it's not appropriate but that I'm not upset with them or insulting them. Something like "hey now, I'm at work, but no hard feelings!" although that seems a little weird to say.

If anyone ever harassed me or said something overtly sexual, it would be an entirely different story!
