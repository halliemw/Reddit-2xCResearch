Don't tell me how I should react or what I should do, then. That's infuriating.

(See how quickly this gets ridiculous and hypocritical? You can't criticize me for what I did/said without doing the same thing to me. Except in your mind you're right and I'm wrong, but that doesn't make it less hypocritical.)
