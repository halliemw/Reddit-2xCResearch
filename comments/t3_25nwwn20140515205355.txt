yeah, me too.  If I know someone well (very well) naturally I will inquire if they're looking like they lost weight then they're already thin.  I would never mention weight loss to someone who was overweight.

Yes, this implies that most of us can see whether a person is a little less than svelte (I'm not thin - but personally, I like when people notice I've lost weight, I guess I come from a carrot/stick generation).
