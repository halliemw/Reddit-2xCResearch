Pretty much any book that has to deal with coming of age or tough stuff.  *Hatchet*, *Bridge to Terebithia*, *Catcher in the Rye*, *Tom Sawyer* and *Huck Finn*, *Harry Potter*, *Clockwork Orange*, *Kite Runner*, *The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay*, *The Outsiders*, *The Giver*, *Lord of the Flies*, *Ender's Game*, *Holes*, *The Graveyard Book*, *Fuckness*, *Fight Club*, *Another Day in Paradise*, *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, *On the Road*, *Dharma Bums*.....

And that's not counting TV and Movies that have manly men being manly while women are nonexistent, side notes or relegated to whiny, unimportant roles.  *Mad Men*, *The Walking Dead*, *Breaking Bad*, *Stand By Me*, *Shawshank Redemption*, *The Godfather*, *Saving Private Ryan*, *Band of Brothers*, *American Pie*, *Back to the Future*, *Fast Times at Ridgemont High*, *Ferris Beuller*.....

Men and boys already get enough instruction telling them how to be because the default in our culture is male.  Girls learn to look up to Harry Potter before boys learn to look up to Katniss.  There are very real struggles that boys have to go through, but you're still far more likely to see a movie with a guy learning to masturbate than a girl.
