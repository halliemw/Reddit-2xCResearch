Sorry to hear about your troubles. I wanted to alert you to a book that might be interesting to you as it broaches the topic of "is the problem my vagina or is the problem my relationship" - Susanna Kaysen "The Camera my Mother Gave Me". This is the woman who wrote "Girl, Inturrupted." This is her story of a problem she had with her vagina and i've read it twice for its insights! Good luck.
