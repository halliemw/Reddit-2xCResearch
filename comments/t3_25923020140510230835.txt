Yes, I agree wholeheartedly! I wasn't trying to say that I think people *have* to find hairy people attractive, or that they should. Even hairy people don't have to think that hairy people are attractive. I'm sorry if it seemed like that's part of what I was saying. I really was going more for self-acceptance. I was also pointing out how little hair-everywhere is referenced, generally, and I think that more people would be more accepting, at least, if they were more aware of it. I know first hand that there are people who don't necessarily express disgust, but surprise when they see hairy females. I think it would be better if the surprise element was taken away.
