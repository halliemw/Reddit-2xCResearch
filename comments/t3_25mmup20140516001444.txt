That's not true in my state.  While the campus police have jurisdiction, the college is still inside city boundaries and a student can call either (jurisdictio applies to crimes not reported and to crimes reported to the campus police).

If the crime is deemed minor by the city police (stolen backpack) they refer it back to campus police, but campus police have no choice but to accept the jurisdiction of city (or county) when a crime occurs.  (My campus falls mostly inside a city, but part of it abuts a county, unincorporated area).
