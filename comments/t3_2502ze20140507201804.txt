This has always been a trans friendly sub. We have Trans women that comment regularly and they're treated like... well, women. Because they are... 

They usually only talk about being Trans when it's relevant. Maybe that's why you haven't noticed them as much? Some of our most active users are Trans women. 

I don't know how friendly this place is going to be now that it's a default (my guess is not very) but in the past we've always been supportive of women's issues. 

Judging by the influx of downvotes I think this sub is going to hell in a handbasket. I know I won't be commenting as much but I'm still deciding if I want to stick around and watch the show.
