I think that your boyfriend seems trustworthy, and that the coworker is not.  I also think that feeling ambivalent/angsty/anything is totally okay.  You are entitled to your feelings - and by posting on Reddit rather than flipping out you have handled those feelings in a reasonable way.  Writing things down is a great way to explore how you are really feeling before deciding on your actions.  Everyone has lots of feelings - which ones you allow to shape your behaviour is an important skill.
