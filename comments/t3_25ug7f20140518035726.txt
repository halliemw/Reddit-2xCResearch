Here's the thing. The guy you love? The guy you want back? He doesn't exist. The guy who exists has lied to you for years and had multiple affairs. The guy you love is the front that this jackass put up to keep you on the hook. 

There's no shame in grieving for the relationship you lost, but you have to realise that it's not coming back.
