I know the feeling.  Seeing everyone on FB wishing their mother a happy day.  I want to do the same, but it is hard to do it without bringing the mood down.  And that was a great article.  I'm still working through a lot of the boxes, and I'm hoping to find some more of her things.  No one likes to think that they might not be around, but there is always that chance.

Sending love and light to you wherever you may be.  And know that "losing it" isn't strange and is very healthy.  Healing takes a lifetime.
