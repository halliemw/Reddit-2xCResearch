I know what you mean.  I haven't found a way around that part, but once I accepted casual sex just wasn't for me, it did get easier to just take out my Battery-Powered-Boyfriend. What I'd do is run over who I could call up, I'd shudder a little over each guy for various reasons: one wasn't that great at sex unless I was really in a pinch, one was too damn passive, etc. So I just accepted that this was my life for now, till I met someone I could really date.
