Still sounds brutal! I'll stick with Alesse, which I loop 3 times (take for 9 weeks straight) and then have a period. It's awesome! I only have to deal with a few periods a year!

PS - I definitely consulted my doctor before doing this. If you plan to do this, ask yours as well as it may not be good for everyone!
