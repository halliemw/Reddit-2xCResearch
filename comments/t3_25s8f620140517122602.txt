She looks so happy in pictures from the event, and all people can think of is how ugly they think the dress looks. 

I'm not gonna lie, I see where they're coming from, technically speaking. Because of her body and her interest in comfort, the dress doesn't fit on her perfectly, and that's where all the criticism is coming from. You know what? She's not wearing a bra that lifts her tits to the high heavens, because that shit is uncomfortable (source: personal experience with G cup breasts), and that's where half the criticism is coming from. The rest of the criticism is just more picky sneaky ways of judging her for being fat, and generally just trying to pick out every detail they can to judge her for. Because when you sound like you know a thing or two about fashion, nobody can call you out for a thinly veiled insult on her being fat. Right?

Like the fucking shoes. Nobody gives a shit about the shoes. They're black, black goes with everything. If they were sexy black pumps and that dress was on a skinny woman, literally nobody would have a peep to say on black shoes. It is only because she's fat. For fuck's sake, the dress barely shows the shoes anyway. 

Everyone's just having a fucking cow because a fat woman wore a bold, noticeable dress to a famous event, and how dare she not do her absolute best to blend in and disappear into the crowd.
