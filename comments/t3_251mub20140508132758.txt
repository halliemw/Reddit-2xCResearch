It makes people sensitive and jumpy to get lumped in with psycho extremists, which might be why people react badly if you start out by saying you "don't agree with feminism." Most feminists are equally supportive of the concept of 'feminism' or 'gender equality' and view the terms as basically the same. We'd all rather have a perfectly equal society where concepts like feminism are not needed, but we're not there yet. 

The Women's Suffrage movement was for the sake of getting women the right to vote. Men already had that, so nobody needed to fight for them. Could it have been called the "Equal Suffrage" or "Voting Rights for Everyone!" movement? Sure, but women were the ones who *needed* it. If the movement failed, it didn't hurt everyone equally, only women. 

The NAACP isn't the National Association for Equality of Everyone. Gay rights isn't perceived as anti-straight. I hope in the future all this stuff will be terms in a history book and we won't need to fight for equality, but we can't ignore that huge groups of people are still marginalized today.
