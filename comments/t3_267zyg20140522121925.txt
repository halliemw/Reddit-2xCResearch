Yeah! I worked HARD for this and have known it's what I want to do since I was a little guppy. :P 

People change and that's true. I'm hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, really. I don't want to just show up at his job or anything so, though I know that would *guarantee* a response, I'd rather call like a normal human being lol. 

I have a lot of Dutch friends already from outside of his circles (I used to live in Italy and would visit friends in the NL a lot), so I think I'll be okay. Or... I'll try to be!
