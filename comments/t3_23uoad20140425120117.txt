Do another thought experiment: What if the phrase used was "fanperson", where there'd have to possibly be a dagger explaining the connection between understood impliciation of "fanboy" and "fangirl" to "fanperson" being the same, just with the gendered part of it removed.

So, were it "fanperson", I don't think it would suit your criteria for being sexist anymore. Actually, it sort of draws a border around your criteria, and becomes a way of looking at that criteria itself: is using gendered terms *fundamentally* sexist?
