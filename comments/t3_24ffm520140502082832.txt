I have two issues.


The first is that this study only measured girls who fell into one of two categories, either called fat by their parents or not. 18% of American children are obese, and 1/3 of children are overweight, and parents are *typically* not sadistic, so you know the pool of girls being called fat were collectively not thin. (You could go so far as make a very safe assumption that a large number of these children were chubby, but this assumption is not necessary.) Therefore, the study measured what happens when not thin girls are called fat---it does not measure how thin girls respond. Therefore the title is misleading because it implies all girls are influenced in the same way.


My major issue, though, is that the study can be interpreted in two ways. The first is that calling girls fat increases their likelihood of becoming obese (direct relationship), and the second is that a relationship was established between girls who are called fat and girls who become obese (correlation). 

The first interpretation says that the act of calling a girl fat increases her chances. No where is this proven. After this study, for all we know, these parents are simply noticing that their children are heavier and they would have grown up to become obese anyway. This could have been better proven by testing a group of girls who were not fat but were called fat by their parents. Would they also have a higher risk of becoming obese?


The second interpretation says "Hey, we noticed a pattern, but better, more detailed research needs to be done before we can claim a direct relationship." Because we can't claim the act is responsible for increasing the chances.
