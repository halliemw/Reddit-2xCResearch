I live in an area with a lot of cyclists and if they're on the road they're expected to follow the same rules as cars.  There's a minority that doesn't, they blow through stop signs, no blinkies at dusk, etc. So it creates resentment. There's also self important people that get annoyed because the cyclist isn't moving as fast as a car, and think roads are only for cars. Those people really suck. I'm pretty sure in this case that guy was just an asshole using the stuff above as an excuse to be mean to cyclists in general. :(
