I completely understand feeling like not saying anything makes you feel like you are allowing the harassment. The strategies that I use are simply for my own benefit, so I don't feel like I am just accepting their shit comments. It probably won't do anything to make the comments stop, but they are fun. Also, if you are getting cat called, I would advise getting some pepper spray to put on your keychain in case some guy gets too close to you.

The frats at my school have a thing where they make the pledges cat call out of cars when driving around campus. So twice a year for about a month at the beginning of the semester I can't walk around campus without getting cat called at least once. Because of this, I have established a repertoire of responses.

A pretty common cat call is something along the lines of "hey babe, suck my dick!" I usually yell back "Okay, why don't you pull over right now?!" I like this because it calls them out, usually gets some laughs and high fives from people around me, and (surprise) they never pull over.

Another common one is the "nice tits/ass!" I usually flip them the bird with both hands in front of my boobs.

There are a bunch of other cat calls that these idiots make. Usually if it is them asking me to do something inappropriate I will say "no" or "fuck off" in a really bright and excited voice as if I was really saying yes in an excited way. But I love sarcasm.

Good luck with dealing with these dick wads! And please stay safe.
