First of all, don't feel guilty and terrible about anything. We all have our issues, and now it is about finding a way to love yourself enough to take back your life. I would really recommend you start intensive therapy. I don't mean meeting once-a-week type therapy, but perhaps even an in-patient care facility. Us random internet strangers are not equipped to help with something so severe and what you need right now is a support system.

One little recommendation I have is creating a goal chart that you can put on your fridge or a wall with things like eat 3 meals today, take medicine, light exercise, or maybe even meditation or reading. That way, you can take it step-by-step and track the things you are doing over a period of time. You can also search for a good gyno in your area by going on yelp.com and typing in your zip and gynecologist and then reading the reviews until you find someone who you think you might be comfortable with. I will be sending positive thoughts your way - you can do this!
