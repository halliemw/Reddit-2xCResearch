Just curious, have you tried posting in r/fancyfollicles or r/haircarescience? (not linking to them, mods seem to be deleting posts with links today)

Both of them can help you find other ways to get your hair to cooperate. 

Also, you wouldn't necessarily see the damage as damage, but everything we do to our hair has the potential to screw it up. Blow dryers, straighteners, highlights, bleaching, dying, even using some conditioner/shampoo products can screw it up pretty bad (i.e. if I use *any* of the Vo5 shampoos, my hair looks like a freaking oil slick. A giant, frizzy, oilslick). I'm not saying we shouldn't DO those things, but there are ways to protect our hair even through them!
