I feel like with all sex things, you need to do more exploring to figure out your preferences.  There have been people that went down on me and whatever they defaulted to doing was awesome and there have been people where it sucked.  You figure out the things you like and the things you don't, and be sure the COMMUNICATE with your partner.  

Side note:  If you go in my comment history, I recently commented on a post that was on r/bestof with instructions on how to go down on a girl.  Maybe reading some of the comments and that post might give you an idea of things you might like or things to say to your partner.

Edit:  I should warn you that some of the comments were assholes, but some people made good points.  Just like most of reddit, you need to sift through some bull shit to get to the good stuff.
