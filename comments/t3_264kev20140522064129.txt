The only issue I have with uniforms is that they kinda restrict one of the main purposes of childhood; finding your own identity and what you wear/how you look is a part of that identity. 

Also they can cost a lot. My school had a Uniform that consisted of black trousers/skirt with a polo shirt, then changed to a uniform with a blazer shirt tie etc... It cost Â£100 more and no one got financial help if they needed it.
