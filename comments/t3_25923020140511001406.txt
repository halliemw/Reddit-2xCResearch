Fellow yellowish tone pale skinned person here - look into asian foundations, particularly japanese ones. I had my lyggage lost on a trip and picked up a random Japanese BB cream (Ettusais BB cream, the regular in the Natural color) and it was by far the best foundation for color, staying power and coverage. I now order it from Japan and it's still cheaper than fancy drugstore foundations. I also like Smashbox the lightest tone from local ones.
