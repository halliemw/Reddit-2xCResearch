Very true! One of my favorite books has a main character who is a rather naive trend-follower in a world where the US has invaded the UK. So it ends up having this really fun interplay between witty satire and this narrator who doesn't really get what's going on and is constantly embarrassed by her grandmother "being rude" to American soldiers.

That the author still portrays this character sympathetically, that the reader can still look at her as a fundamentally good-hearted person with her own sort of intelligence and creativity, is what really makes the story great.

(Also, wow, I should really reread that book.)
