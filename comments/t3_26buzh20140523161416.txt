Not smooching a pillow, but here's this:  My SO were at the mall in a book store. I found a book I thought he'd like so I found him in the computer section, approached, and rubbed his shoulder a little as I asked what he thought of the book. When the stranger replied that he already owned it, I about fell backwards. And there was my SO a couple aisles over laughing hysterically. They had on the exact same outfit and even looked alike. I was mortified.
