From the article "Evidence for a paternal age effect has been proposed for a number of conditions and diseases. In many of these, the statistical evidence of association is weak, and the association may be related by confounding factors, or behavioral differences" and "There is no clear association between adverse health outcome and paternal age but longitudinal studies are needed"


This wikipedia article basically says more controlled studies need to be done to form any sort of definite conclusion.
