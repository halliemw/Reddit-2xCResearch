Thanks for posting! I really appreciate this. And I don't think the tone is a problem like some people do. I think it's more that the knee-jerk reaction is to assume that being asked to recognize privilege is an insult, when it's not. 

And to an extent I understand. It took me a while to understand what it was to recognize my white privilege, because I had dealt with poverty as well as being middle class growing up. We definitely need more discussions about what privilege is and isn't, and that it doesn't mean you've had everything handed to you. It means you've found things that other people in that situation wouldn't have and you never had to think about why.
