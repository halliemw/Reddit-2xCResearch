I don't know if anyone has said this, but this kind of thing should be brought to the attention of the administrators. I know it seems like they don't do anything, but they are the only people who can do anything. You could write up a brief overview of all the things she has said to you and present them to an adviser or the principal. That way you can stay professional and keep on track with your message. Its very unfortunate that you have to deal with this, but coming from someone who has dealt with sexual harassment by a college professor this semester, the best way to make things happen is to talk to her boss.
