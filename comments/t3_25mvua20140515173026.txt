It was tougher than I envisioned. I figured, oh no internal organs are getting cut, this is relatively nothing.

Instead, they cut into your pectoral muscle so once you heal, any and every movement you do that involves your chest (think not just exercise, but also lifting yourself out of a bathtub or pool, carrying heavy groceries, etc) your muscles must relearn how to do.

I also didn't expect the emotional aspect of it all. I thought since I was doing the clinically correct thing, it wouldn't be so scary. Instead, I had a hard time. I drank more. I wondered what I did to myself. I was frustrated that it was so hard to get back to working out and feeling healthy. I hate that my boobs have virtually no sensation and my chest muscles still don't feel right. I wondered why at the age of 27, as the youngest person in my breast surgeon's office, I had chosen this.

And this doesn't touch on the weird guilt I feel whenever my friends breast feed their children. And that doesn't include the comments I've gotten about maybe I should've waited until after I had a baby so I could still breast feed. Who says I want to have a baby? Wouldn't my children rather I be there? Even if I do have kids, it will be some time. I don't even have a boyfriend!

My mom says I will wake up one day and forget I had a mastectomy. I look forward to that day.

The upside to all of this is that my boobs look great!
