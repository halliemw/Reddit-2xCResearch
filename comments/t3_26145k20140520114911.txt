I get the same reactions, I think everyone does.
But like, why let it upset you? I'm not trying to be facetious, I just honestly don't understand why people take it to heart. Like, if I paid that much  attention to everyone who was nasty to me I'd be constantly thinking about it, and why waste that much energy on scumbags?
