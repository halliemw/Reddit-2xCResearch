Double so because the nerds are so out of date. As a woman, and as a self-professed "nerd" I hate the show doubly much. All the references and stuff they make are off either a) extremely mainstream comics like Batman or Superman or Green Lantern, comics which are so popular with mainstream audiences they have their own blockbuster movies, b) Star Wars or Star Trek. Again same reason. Its honestly hard to find people who havent watched these movies. 

There's no jokes about what nerds find funny today. No discussions of people liking weird girlie cartoons like MLP or Harry Potter or Adventure Time. 

But mostly the outrageous misogyny. Like the episode when Sheldon is told to give a speech on women in science "shudder"
