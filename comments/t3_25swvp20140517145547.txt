you might want to reconsider the kind of people you are hanging out with

and its never your fault, if someone else is touching you without your explicit permission.

try to view your own beauty and attractiveness in a dispassionate manner, like something to be utilized and analyzed.  hold yourself to your own ethical and moral standards.  look to philosophers and role models if you dont feel like your own standards aren't clear enough.  dont let other people judging you affect you too much; always remember they arent living your life, you are.  they can't understand what you have to live through.  there are some that can, but those are the people we deem as the wisest and that's why we read and listen to their thoughts.
