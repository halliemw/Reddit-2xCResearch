Oh my dear, my heart goes out to you.  One of the things I console myself with is that, as sudden and traumatic as my mother's passing was, 99.9% of my memories of her are when she was whole, and happy, and active.  I have always thought it would be harder to lose someone over time, when the physical presence is still there, but the mental presence is not.  I admire your fortitude in caring for her.

Your mom's letter brings a tear to my eye.  What a treasure!
