I think the main thing missing from sex ed education in schools is the very basic principle that sex is meant to be *pleasurable.* In school we get "it's really bad you shouldn't do it you really shouldn't but if you HAVE to... this is a condom." It's a very guilt-inducing type of education. In the media we get "hey boys see that hot girl over there? you should want to have sex with her NOW... girl, you're there so that guy can have sex with you. Isn't this a great arrangement?" This is stressful for both guys and girls and creates problems like rape culture.


There needs to be a more realistic education which recognizes that at the heart of it, sex is meant for pleasure (this even works from a religious standpoint) and yeah it can have consequences if used improperly, but hey let's focus on how to actually use it properly. This would help girls figure out despite mixed messages that we ARE actually supposed to enjoy sex, and would hopefully change the ways some guys look at "scoring girls."
