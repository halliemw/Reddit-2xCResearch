The worst thing that happened in this situation was you betraying your SO's trust by going through his wallet after he asked you not to.  The 2nd worst thing was when you asked your friend to keep something from her spouse.  The only bad thing that happened by someone other than you was when the husband got involved in something he didn't need to when he texted your SO (something that would have never happened without your previous actions).  I'm not trying to be harsh, but if that couple are good friends, I would say you should forget about all of this as quickly as possible and hope they have no hard feeling towards the perpetrator of this entire situation.
