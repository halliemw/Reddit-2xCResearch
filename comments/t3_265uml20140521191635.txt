I can't speak from experience myself, but after having two children (an 11 year old, and 8 year old), my friend ended up getting pregnant by a man who she was seeing occasionally, but never in a serious relationship with. She did not want to have a child with him, let alone even see him that often. 

She had been friends with him for years, but chose not to tell him. She had the abortion, (and since many years later has a new baby and new husband), but when the man found out she had the abortion without telling him it severed their friendship. Now I can't speak for her whether she regretted not telling him or not, I can just say from the outside looking in, it ruined them. Or, at least, him. 

However for you, it clearly (as they are all) will be a different situation, as in my friends case I suspect he was more hurt by the secret, than the actual abortion itself. In your case, it seems like he could obviously be upset if he found out because of the abortion. 

But I do tend to agree with a few other posts here that even if you decide on the abortion, you should tell him. He's your husband and deserves to know about it. 

Either way, good luck.
