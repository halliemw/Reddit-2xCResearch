Are you serious?

15 days ago:

> It's going on 5 years since I was diagnosed with Anorexia. My eating disorder is pretty hardcore, and has left my body undeveloped and in my opinion, unattractive. My weight is never over 95 pounds, typically closer to 80, and I'm 5'5". I've accepted that I likely won't recover anytime soon, if ever, but I would like to love my body and shape.

> My ex and I are hooking up,and acting like a couple again,without labeling anything,or calling ourselves exclusive. Is this a mess waiting to happen? 

So which is it? And what do you really want advice on here?

Do you love your body or not? Is he a friend or something more? Are you *really* interested in whether people are comfortable being naked around others, or whether your "friend" is out of line?
