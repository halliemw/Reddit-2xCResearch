> "Nothing" isn't exactly true but most people really want to hear the minutia of my bike ride or experiments in the kitchen, the all night conversation I had with my best friend who lives far away, the tv shows I binged on, the half started projects that will never get finished, or reading a good book.

You know... I never thought about it that way. Interesting perspective and it definitely gives me something to chew on. I guess I just feel like I'm not being that productive when I do those "nothing" activities (well, some of them anyways.) I think part of my problem is that I'm also kind of ashamed of how I do spend most of my time. I often wish I could be doing something else, but (and I know this incorrect) I don't feel like I have the options to do so. Even though I shouldn't care about other's judgments... I do. (Damn social anxiety!) 

> My job is pretty isolating too. My boss is damn lucky to have found me because I don't think many people could survive in the conditions I work in.

I feel the same way actually. I don't even know how to meet people at work without really putting in a lot of effort. (There aren't really any social groups at work, but I'm sure I could join a sports league of some sort if I wanted... the only problem there? I really dislike playing sports. haha)
