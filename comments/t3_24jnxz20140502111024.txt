No, but a long time ago I test drove a Chevy HHR because it was in my price range at the time. It had butt warmers, which was nice, but also brake problems that the dealer was unwilling to fix or lower the price for, so I didn't get it. Also the visibility in it was terrible. I wouldn't recommend an HHR. Terrible car inside and out
