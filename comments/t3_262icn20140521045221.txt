I have been following this story too and it makes me sick. Lets send this guy back to the place where he can easily commit the same crime! This woman was in her home, a place where she was supposed to feel safe and secure, but was still violated. To top it off the state makes it sound like its no big deal. I need to find this judges name so I can hopefully vote him/her out. Disgusting.
