Well, he apparently had a Google alert set up on my IRL name and when a call for research subjects in my area (he was not from my area) was opened he emailed the university issued email address to "chat" me up since he knows no working email address of mine anymore (got rid of them many years ago) and thus hadn't been able to contact me for years.

So, within 8 hours of that research contact page being up (it was signed with my name) he had contacted that university address in a very weird way what got me into the situation of having to explain that strange blabber to my colleagues. 

You have to know that he is an unemployed autist with some form of learning disability/dyslexia who is convinced we are in love (I never met him) and even threatened suicide since we 'could never be together'. He is also convinced to suffer from a fatal disease so he is regularly begging me to meet him so he can die peacefully or some shit like that. He is also opening up Amazon wishlists in my name so he can sent me presents or something. (But he does not know my actual Amazon account so it doesn't work.)

He is the roommate of my sister's ex-boyfriend and since he couldn't have my sister he got my name from my sister and since then decides to online stalk me. I wish I made that up.
