So they never wanted to do another LEEP even though you had abnormal PAPs afterwards? That is reassuring. I get that we need to be thorough and check every little change right now, but the stress is starting to interfere with sleeping/eating.

I'll try to focus on the fact that needing a biopsy does not = needing another surgery, not just yet anyways. Thank you!
