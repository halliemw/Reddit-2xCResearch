I can totally understand your point, but I think that the point she's trying to make is that you shouldn't feel guilty for feeling so detached. I had an abortion myself, best decision of my life (I was a teenager), but I can't really speak about it openly and not express without people thinking I am a monster. But I do see what you're trying to say, this was a little too intimate for her to share with the world, IMO.
