It's not wanting him to shut up so much as it's like.. the more he asks and the more I say no, the more I start a) feeling super guilty for saying no, b) thinking if I don't give him what he wants he'll stop being a friend/whatever, and c) self-esteem issues where I basically think he's the only one who's going to be interested ever or whatever. I'm seeing a therapist to help with the latter issue.
