The sort of guy who's like that is just really, really insecure. They don't want an Asian woman, they want a blow up doll. Or a robot to just agree with everything they say and give them hand jobs. They're scared to death of someone with any sort of agency, because they know that they're really weak, and it would just kill them for anyone else to realize that. It's kind of sad, because they'll never know what having a partnership based on trust and affection is like. They'll always be worried that their little control bubble may pop, or that their girlfriend might realize she deserves better and leave them. 

Basically, they're not worth your time. Take screencaps of whoever sent you that message, send it to the mods, and get them a nice ban. Report all creepy comments like that. Don't even respond to them.
