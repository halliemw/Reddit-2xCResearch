I'm so sorry :( I don't know your area or country, but chances are there's a free clinic somewhere for those who need medical care but cannot afford it at all. Is there a local information number you can call and ask? Another option is to call your general practitioner and explain the situation and see if you can delay or divide up payment over a period of time, and in some countries doctors may have samples of the drug you need. If nothing else, you could call them up and ask for advice on what to do, they might also know of low-cost or free options :)

I'm going to tell you one thing, though: You're probably not infecting everything. Often with fungal skin infections, those are the everyday fungi we normally carry around on our skin, and most of the time most people do just fine with them, so don't worry too much about other people right now, okay? They're going to be fine being around you with standard precautions, and many will understand some of what you're going through. What you can do so far that doesn't require medication is keep things clean and dry, to avoid an infection on top of the one you have. If you can afford cotton gloves (they are usually quite cheap), put those on for protecting your hands - perhaps get two pairs so you can wash the one pair and wear the other.

Your body is not well now, but it's still the only body you have, and you can do a lot of cool things with it once you get a bit better, even if it doesn't feel like that right now. And I really think you can get better. Maybe not perfect, but definitely better! I'll be taking medicine for the rest of my life (chronic illness and all that), but I'm feeling pretty okay with it now. It's under control, and I know what to do when it isn't, and that really helps a lot.
