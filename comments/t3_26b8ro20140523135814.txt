"Equanimity: No drama-inducing crossposting of content found in other subreddits, or vice versa. Likewise, posts found to direct odious influxes here may be removed." 

Directing twox traffic to other subs is not disallowed by rule 2. I'm not posting content from another sub. Your mod load bearing point is a good one, I'll ask at the other subs if they mind being linked to in twox

Edit: 2xlite has a link in the sidebar.
