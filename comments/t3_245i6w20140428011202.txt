Shoe size is not necessarily a terribly good indicator.  I'm 5'5" on a good day and wear a size 10.  My feet got to size 10 when I was 12.  My mom is 5'2" and also wears a size 10.  Granted, she wore a size 9 until she got pregnant with me and then her feet got bigger, but we just have genetically big feet.

Is her mother tall?
