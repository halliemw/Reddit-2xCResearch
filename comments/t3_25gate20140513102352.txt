I would say keep it moving forward at a slow pace. Once your stress levels are down, if you genuinely like him, those feelings won't go away. If they do, then you may have been enjoying an outlet for all of the stresses in your life, and not truly connecting. Tread carefully with someone who has had an extreme prior relationship as they can leave a definitive mark on a person. It takes a lot of patience and selflessness to help someone through/get past a traumatic relationship that carries over instinctive retraction from you. Good luck, hope all goes well.
