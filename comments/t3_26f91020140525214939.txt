I actually didn't date through most of the improvement process. It was about 4 years before I started dating.

The only reason I would try to warn you away from places that would talk about being happy being single, is because I find those types of places can become bitter circle jerks. It's not just "Let's be happy being single" but "People in relationships aren't really happy, we're really happy!" type affairs.

You are definitely not a loser. Being single is an amazing opportunity to be selfish. Everything should be about you while you're single. What have you been doing to keep you distracted?
