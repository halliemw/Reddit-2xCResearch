Well, yeah but according to OP, he doesn't KNOW about her wishes yet. If he's still under the impression he married an antichoice partner and it's been discussed and agreed on, I think he should respect her to make her own decisions, but I wouldn't be surprised if that itself put a major strain on the relationship, maybe moreso than if she had told him when she first started having doubts about that stance.
