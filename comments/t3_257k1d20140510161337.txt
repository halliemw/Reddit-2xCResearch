> an OBGYN that I used to go to assured me that the Depo shot would be totally safe because it only has progesterone. I ended up having a mini-stroke (transient ischemic attack) within a week of getting the shot (luckily there was no permanent damage).

Provera is actually made with the progesterone-analogue Medroxyprogesterone-acetate. Some women can tolerate this drug, but it is probably the least-safe of all the different imitation-progesterones used for birth control. This is because the other progestins are similar enough to testosterone to be trapped by the sex hormone binding globulin. Provera is very good as an imposter-progesterone...
