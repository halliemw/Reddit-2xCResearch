This makes me kind of mad because I've been through it myself.  I've got six siblings, and let me tell you, when you do something to your own body everyone has a fucking opinion about it.  I learned the hard way that I would have some support, but I also felt stabbed in the back by the people I loved the most.  "So and so wants a baby so badly and you've killed yours."  That one hurt the most.  But, you know what?  What another person wants and what I'm doing with life are not the same.  I'm not responsible for whatever anyone else is feeling over an abortion I had.  

If I had to do it over again, I would, but this time I would keep my mouth shut.  

Your mom needs to let it go.  That guilt bullshit is ridiculous.  Sounds like some bored housewife manipulation because she's got nothing better to do than to make her daughter feel like dirt.  I would advise your sister to get a therapist and talk this out.  They'll be able to guide her and wade through the crap, so she can focus on her own feelings and emotions, and not worry about what everyone else thinks.
