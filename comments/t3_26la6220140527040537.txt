Leaving him was a good decision. Being with him was harmful to your mental health, and while I know leaving him must have been difficult, it was the right thing to do. I agree with the no-contact order thing. If you are worried that he might come back and try to hurt you, then please take action against that.

Best of luck to you, OP. You have the love and support of TwoX to help you. <3
