Hey!  Thank you so much for replying to promptly.  I have switched to the generic in the passed, specifically camrese, and had a negative effect. I think it was called a drug eruption?  I wasn't allergic, but it made my whole body break out in red splotches.  I asked my gyn about overriding the superscription for seasonique, but she declined.  I am not sure why, though.  I realize now that there are two other generics out, so I may try those and hope for the best.
