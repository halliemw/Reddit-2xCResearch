That's not any more accurate than saying muscle weighs more than fat. Muscle is more dense than fat, so *given the same weight*, muscle takes up less room than fat, but it's also true that *given the same volume* muscle weighs more than fat.

Really, though, given how context is implied in conversational English, both your phasing and OC's are perfectly acceptable ways of expressing the idea.
