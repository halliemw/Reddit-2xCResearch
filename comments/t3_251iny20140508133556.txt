Never browsed this sub before, I'm here because it's a default now.  I wanna give a guys honest perspective, hopefully without being an asshole. 

 To me it seems like you're being hypocritical regarding the flirting thing.  He was a bit dishonest, and you had a right to be upset with him, but to break up with him for something like that, when you say you flirt with people and seek attention yourself is unfair.  Honestly when you said " I must admit it was pretty satisfying watching a 6'2" semi-athletic manly man type break down and throw himself and his future at my mercy." it made me think you broke up with him expecting this to happen and wanting the satisfaction of knowing you were in control.  Maybe it was a subconscious thing, maybe I'm wrong, who knows.

Again, to reiterate, he wasn't in the right, but I think you overreacted and were manipulative, especially if you're flirty with other guys.  I know that's the kind of thing that I might same I'm fine with, and act fine with, but irks me just a little everytime I see it happen.  And then if I'm getting attention from another girl, I'll probably enjoy the attention, and use the excuse, well she does it all the time so it won't be a big deal, even though I have never and will never cheat.  

I'm not really sure what I'm saying anymore, but I guess maybe cut him some slack?  And make your boundaries very clear, and make sure he's ok with them, even though he might not say he has a problem because of his communications problems.
