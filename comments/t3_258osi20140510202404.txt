Thank you so much for writing this. My mother is technically alive, but she has fairly advanced dementia and doesn't recognize or respond to any one anymore. She got sick when I was in my late teens and declined very rapidly. One day I found these letters she wrote for me when I was about a year old. In one of them, after telling me about my first Christmas and how I was started to work on walking, she wrote that she felt so lucky to be my mom, and that she hoped one day to be my friend as well. Nothing breaks me inside more than realizing that we never have and never will be able to do that. 

Mother's Day has become of the more difficult days of the year for me. I'm sorry if it is for you too. I wish that no one had to feel this way, but somehow, someone writing down exactly how you feel makes the situation slightly more bearable. I hope tomorrow goes alright for you
