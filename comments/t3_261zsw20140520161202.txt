The other suggestions are all good and I second them. On top of that, I think you need to approach guys more in your daily life. Just strike up conversation and see where it goes. 

I have one friend who seems like she makes friends/boyfriends/fuck buddies everywhere. She finds it very natural to strike up conversation with guys. Think about if you know anyone like that and hang out with them/ask them to help you branch out your network. 

Summer is coming up...that means more street festivals, music festivals, outdoorsy stuff. Those could be good places to meet people. 

Professional networking events are also a way to meet people. Since you have a legitimate reason for talking, you can get a feel for a person without the pressure of framing it as a courtship. It also helps to zero in on people who have similar backgrounds and lifestyles to you. 

Also try speed dating. There are organized events for it in most cities.
