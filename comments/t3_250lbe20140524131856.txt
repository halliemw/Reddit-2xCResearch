Yeah, ponytails just look...  sad on me.  I don't wear them unless I'm working out or camping or whatever.  I'd never wear one as a 'style'.

One small consolation - I spoke to my mother because we have similar hair - once its over 60% silver, it thickens up because each strand is now wiry and stiff.
