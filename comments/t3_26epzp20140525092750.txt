I was raised as a Feminist in the 60's and 70's so it is frustrating to me that people seem to actively claim to NOT be Feminist.

I was only able to run track and cross country in high school because of feminism.  I was the only woman at my high school TO run and I never ran a race against other women until I got into college.  When I was in high school, the only sports women were allowed to participate in were tennis and swimming.  Now days there are just as many women as men in high school sports.  The administration tried to prevent me from participating my putting me in "boys PE" which meant I had to dress out in the boys locker room and not the girls.  I ended up dressing out in the janitors closet and averting my eyes while walking through the locker room.

I think that there are a LOT of little things that people take for granted that they are only allowed to do BECAUSE of Feminists of the past.  I see a lot of the things we worked hard to gain slipping away due to people being ashamed of claiming that they are Feminists and fighting to keep what many of us older people worked hard to gain.
