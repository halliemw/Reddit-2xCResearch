A similar thing happened to me and my bf. He seemed overly concerned I was cheating on him so I then became concerned he was projecting on me. So I snooped. And I found some shit. He was flirting with a few different girls. After a lot of struggle and conversations we realized he used flirting to feel better about himself. If you and your boyfriend can talk things through there could be some other explanation for it. But he needs to admit that what he did is wrong and not okay. If he doesn't agree you have some tough decisions to make. You are worthwhile and your feelings matter. Be strong! You're worth it.
