Well, I don't believe it should be considered that there is only one gender because there isn't. There is a natural plasticity to gender, more multiple than singular, that doesn't mean there can't be equality. There isn't a single race, does that mean there can't be racial equality? I don't think you have to remove all differences to be equal, there is value in those differences. That is what should define social equality; we can each be what we are and still be equally valuable. That, of course, is the ideal.
