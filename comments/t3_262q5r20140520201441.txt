> OP's need to keep safe is more important than this random guy's need to have his day ruined.

Absolutely agree 

>he does not have a right to know about things that would not otherwise impact his life.

Disagree...I've always thought it must be terrifying to be a guy in that you can't really know for sure if you have a kid out there somewhere or if someone you slept with got pregnant.  Of course a kid out there would be a much bigger deal (in terms of affecting someone's life) than an abortion, but I nevertheless think since that entity is half his, he has a right to know.  This definitely does not supersede her right to be safe and like I said, if this is her concern, she should absolutely not tell him.  Still, many people seem to be saying "just don't bother to tell him, it makes absolutely no difference" and I disagree.  I think he has a right to know and I would want to know if I were in the same situation.  In a similar vein, I've always thought I'd want to know if someone was cheating on me, even if it was in the past.  I think it'd my choice to use/mull over that info as I choose and this guy should have the same right to deal with her getting an abortion instead of not being given the opportunity to know.
