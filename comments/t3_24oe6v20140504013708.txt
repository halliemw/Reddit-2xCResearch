1) Relegate the cleaning to your partner. You'll be essentially working two full shifts if you come home from work and clean the house! Caring for children is one thing, but doing all the mundane bullshit on top of work every day is something that can and will be detrimental to your health.

2) Take vacations. If you get a chance to take time off, use it. I grew up in a workaholic family, and it sucked both for me and for them. You'll have health problems before you know it if you bleed yourself out at work.
