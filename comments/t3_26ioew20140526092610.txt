In 10 years your will look back and think how easy it was to be 16. Even with all of the hormonal emotional upsets of being 16 you were free. Nothing owned you and the paths in front of you were wide open for you to explore. As you get older those paths tend to narrow and might, depending on the choices you make disappear all together. My favorite thing to say to my kids when they were in their teens is from my favorite Cat Stevens song:

"But take your time, think a lot,
Why, think of everything you've got.
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not"
