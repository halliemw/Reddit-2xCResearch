To add on to that, keep in mind that everyone has high highs and low lows! My husband has struggled with some bipolar tendencies and ptsd. After some medication and counseling it took him a while to get past the "is this normal for people?" feeling. He had some fear that strong emotions were a return to an unhealthy place...he's come to recognize that we feel what we feel, it didn't have to control us.
A crap day is likely just a crap day, not a looming specter of possible return to bad places. I know that coming to be able to see this has given him a lot of peace.

Long story short, congratulations, here's wishing the best for you, that your past stays where it belongs and that you get to keep moving deeper into happiness and peace. :)
