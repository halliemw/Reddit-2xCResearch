> It would always be possible to turn off if that was decided

Right, you guys keep repeating that, my question is what would it take for you guys to decide to turn it off? If you're basing this on the userbase's opinions, and it's supposedly "impossible" to gage our opinions, then what are you basing this on? 

Just, hypothetically speaking, what is the set of circumstances or criteria that would lead to the mods reversing their decision; where's the line in the sand, is what I'm asking.
