I have the unknowable pit as well. I realized today that I have been trying to fill it with external things, telling myself that it is part of me and I must reach outwards to distract myself from it. However, despite my best efforts, nothing truly tastes good; landscapes just look like land; even when I am with someone, I am not *with* them.

The pit—I realized this on a walk 20 minutes ago, coincidentally—is a lack of loving myself. It's completely ridiculous to think of, because I am so proud of myself for a great many things that have happened over the course of the past year, and even for my recent break-up. But I do not love me and I will never not feel that pit growing larger unless I can learn to go above just being *okay* with me.

Figuring this shit out is going to suck. BADLY. But I've said its name and can't go back now.
