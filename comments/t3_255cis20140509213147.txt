"If a woman walks into her boss’s office with unsolicited opinions, speaks up first at meetings, or gives business advice above her pay grade, she risks being disliked or even—let’s be blunt—being labeled a bitch." 

This is where I am right now. Being assertive, being labeled a bitch, then back to self-doubt and trying to 'fix' things by being quiet again and dumbing myself down to the 'appropriate level' (must use feminine soft question at the end of sentence speech-- not asking things directly).

 My current situation is better than the last in that there is less overt sexism but there are still 'sit downs' to talk about all kinds of things **other** than the quality of my work-- things male colleagues do NOT have discussions about. + extra work requests male colleagues are not asked to do. I set boundaries and say no to this but get seen as someone who is not a team player or being 'rude'.
