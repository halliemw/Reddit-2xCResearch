I don't think it's necessarily fair to say that someone should dress only in ways that make me comfortable, but at the same time, as a society we do and always will dictate what is and isn't acceptable to wear. Some things, like covering most of your butt, are gender-neutral and so I don't really have a big problem with them. It also seems like the social acceptability of exposed butts is similar to the social acceptability of exposed boobs. Showing a little crack or cheek is generally considered unfashionable and only appropriate in specific contexts but not awful and a whole butt is unacceptable in most contexts, just like showing a little cleavage is ok and a lot is only appropriate in specific contexts and showing whole breasts is unacceptable in most contexts. Note that I have a problem with the difference in acceptability of female breasts and male chests, but it is an example of other body parts where there's a gradient of what's ok.
