Thank you so much for posting this! There are so many times where I look at my body and obsessively pinch at my tummy, thinking "I'll be good once these fats are gone", and I get so angry/dejected that I'm 3 years into working out and I barely see any improvements since my initial weight loss on how I look. Yet I'm squatting more than I ever did before, I shocked myself doing a 24" box jumps. I finished my first obstacle course race. I'm at my fittest and thank you for reminding me that I should be proud with what my body can do, instead of what it looks like! *Internet Hug*
