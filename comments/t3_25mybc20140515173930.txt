PRO PRO PRO do it. i was 16 and i had 10-day periods of biblical flooding proportions. i was miserable. and had horrible cramps. went on the pill (took me a few brands to find one i liked), but it regulated my cycle. my periods are still sort of long (5 days) but i know to the hour when it's coming so there's no guesswork. PMS symptoms are usually mild. 

ive had ZERO negative side effects from taking the pill, when i found a good one for me. no depression, no blood clots, no weight gain, nothing. i was on YAZ the recalled pill, but it was only for about 2 weeks, i didn't feel "right" on it. you'll know when you find a good pill for you. there's not one pill thats good for everyone.
