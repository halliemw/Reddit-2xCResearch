I can relate to OP, our mom passed away 4 years ago, and the first couple of years had been rock bottom for me. Although I was already in my 20's when my mom passed, we didn't have as much opportunity to grow up and be with her due to certain circumstances. My mom went on coma on Xmas day and she died on NYE... So celebrating holidays had been quite rough. What made me strong is knowing my mom is in a better place, and that she loved us very much despite all. Stay strong and only time can heal....
