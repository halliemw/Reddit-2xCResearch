I think both of your points are entirely valid (having personalities/characters for each dolls v. blank slate)... Maybe at some point if this project becomes a thing, they could have a contest or something and have girls write a story about their favorite figure, then one or two winners for each will get made into a one-shot cartoon or comic book :D
