I'm glad you finally figured it out! What a journey you've been on. I have been on the same kind of pills since I was 18, but I guess now that I am more concerned about health, I am realizing that birth control is not very natural. Changing my natural cycles freaks me out a little I guess, but it's worth it if no harm will come from it in the future. I would be devastated if I caused myself some sort of damage in the long run.
