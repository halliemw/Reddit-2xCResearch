Well my first long term relationship was also my first sexual partner. He was emotionally and physically abusive and I didn't know better. Foreplay was to get him going, sex was for him and I was just the object being used to get him off. It didn't matter if I wasn't wet in the slightest, he would just go to town. When he was done, it was over. 

I had 2 years of being single and had no sex drive. Sex wasn't for pleasure fore me. Sex was for the guy. 

Then I met my new partner. He tries to get me off but doesn't have the stamina himself. He gets me right to the point that I feel like I'm about to lose control then usually a noise that I do will make him finish lol. He tries. A lot. We got the bullet because he wanted to try and do what he couldn't himself. Now I have a partner that wants me to enjoy myself, I have a blast. But, I have also been conditioned to get my pleasure from pleasing a guy. I can enjoy myself and feel sexually satisfied just from giving him a blowjob!

Even now, I struggle to take pleasure from a guy fingering me or giving me head. I've only let my current partner go down on me twice as I just don't enjoy it. He is slowly teaching me otherwise but it is a long slow battle we are fighting. However in a way, last night was kind of a break through. I wanted sex for my pleasure and I only just realised how big of a thing this was!!!! Thanks haha, I actually feel really happy now! (see my other post today about that, it was my other issue I'm dealing with)
