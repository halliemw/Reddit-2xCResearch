If I was to go back in time to being sixteen I'd tell me that I will never feel grown up. I never woke up one day and suddenly wanted to study harder or do the cleaning. Just needs to be done and you get used to doing it. 

Also it's okay to not know what direction you want your life to go in. I just turned 27 and only this year figured out what career I wanted, I still haven't completely decided if I want to have kids. 

Aaand friendships will change. At 16 I had an image of being a big part of the lives of my friends, being a bridesmaid at their wedding or godmother to their kids. Most of them I barely see now outside of my Facebook feed and the people whose weddings I am attending I've met later on and have more in common with.
