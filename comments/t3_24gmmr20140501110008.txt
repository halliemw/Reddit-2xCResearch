Do it as soon as possible since he'll need to find someone to replace you even if it means leaving the letter on his desk. I'd probably end it by thanking him for employing you and include something about not being able to meet with him in person. Here's what I'd say:

"Hi (boss) - I wanted to let you know in person, but our schedules don't match up, and I thought it was important to tell you as soon as possible. I received notification yesterday from a scout that they would like to hire me starting May 12. My apologies for the short notice, but I'll have to end my employment here on May 9. Thank you for the opportunity to work here."
