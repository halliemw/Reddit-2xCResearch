If we teach children to wear whatever they want at a young age, how on earth are we going to be able to expect them to follow dress codes and  uniform guidelines when they enter the work force? I see no problem with having a respectable dress code than bans yoga pants because what occupation allows them to wear yoga pants and leggings to work every day and still looks respectable?
