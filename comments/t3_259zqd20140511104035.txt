My husband is a cook and works with a lot of female waitresses. When it's dead, he hangs around the waitresses more because there is nothing to do. If I feel insecure or jealous about it, I just remind myself of his feelings for me. He committed himself to me, as I did to him. That helps me shake the feeling.

However, I'm not a very jealous person to begin with, so I don't feel that way often.
