I'm almost 25 and I started taking birth control when I was 16. I've done a couple different things -- I started with normal 28 days cycles, then I started taking a 3-pack continuous of Alesse (so one period every 9 weeks cuz I don't like my period, go figure. That made my cramps worse but my periods lighter). Last summer, I wasn't sexually involved with anyone, so I took the summer off OCP, to see what happened with my body. Nothing spectacular happened, it was weird not knowing exactly when my period was going to come. My flow/cramps/duration were similar from what I remember. When I started on it again, I did the regular 28 day cycle, and later this afternoon actually, I'm going to get an IUD put in. 50% chance of no periods, not having to worry about a pill every day, and no babies for up to 5 years, sign me up. They say it's better after you've had a baby, but only because the uterus is less likely to expel it (more used to having "foreign" objects in there). Do some research, but I felt comfortable doing IUD if you were interested in it.
