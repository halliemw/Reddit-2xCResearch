I'm currently a housewife who will be going back to school after a year between degrees who left my job a month ago so that we can move for my schooling. 

I now have 0 income and it is hard because I, like you, often feel like I'm not doing enough. However, you are working and bringing in some money, you are taking care of the house, and you are making life for your and your SO easier/better. 

How much schooling do you have left? What kind of job are you looking to have after completing school?
