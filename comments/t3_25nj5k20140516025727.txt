Some people do have a very hard time with names, I'm one of them.  I've offended people.  I mean I recognize them though, and I greet them, so it would be weird if you didn't look familiar to her.

If she's just forgetful like me, pity her for her poor memory. Help her out and maybe go "Remember me? I'm snarkyredhead, we meet at the pool party.  I think you're forgetfulaquaintence right?"

Or she's a bitch that's ignoring you intentionally because she doesn't like you for some stupid reason.  More likely she's some combination of self centered and forgetful.
