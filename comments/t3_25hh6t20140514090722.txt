I waited until I was 18 and in college. Which I find out is kinda late in relation to my peers. I am attractive and had offers- had a long standing bf in hs and we def could have if I wanted to. Do what is right for you. While when I lost my virginity was to the right person at the time and emotionally good for us both- I look back on some of the partners (13 total- don't care who knows) and about half of them I wouldn't sleep with again knowing what I know now about them. Your body is the only one you get and you must be comfortable with your decisions and choices. If I could do it over would have slept with less men.
