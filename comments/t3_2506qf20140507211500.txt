Nutrition education is SO important for any gender and I think all young people appreciate learning more about it because there's so much conflicting information. I think it's great to teach girls especially though for the reasons you and others have mentioned. I would go over stuff like how to read food labels. A surprisingly large portion of Americans don't understand how they work at all. You could also cover portion size, metabolism, stuff like that. Emphasize eating for health rather than body shape/size and seeing calories as a good thing for providing you with nutrients and energy. I suspect they will have a lot of questions so it would be a great opportunity to have them write down questions for you to answer.
