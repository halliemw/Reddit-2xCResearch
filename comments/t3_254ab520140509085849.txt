As people already said there are other options that would probably work for you. 

There's a non hormone iud called paraguard, that means there's no daily pill and nothing for your parents to find. If you don't know about IUDs they are a great option, planned Parenthood has some more info on them. 

They can improve period symptoms too, which is a nice perk. 

Side effects are usually minimal, and since there's no hormones you won't have the weight gain or other side effects. When I got my IUD it was just some discomfort for the first few days, now there's no side effects at all. 

Two methods are better than one, but in no way should you have to do anything. You should talk to him and say ultimately what you do with your body is your choice. He can't and shouldn't make you do anything. I think this is the most important part out of all of it.
