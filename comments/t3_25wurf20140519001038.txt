You know, sometimes I feel like I sympathize with you and OP (not necessarily that I can say "oh, that's me, I have the same thing for sure!").  It's really weird though, because by the way you explain it, anyone who doesn't follow those weird social cues *right from the getgo* could be labeled as that, when in fact our personalities are just very different. The way a lot of other people act, I find to be offputting, and they frequently do not take social cues from me that the way they are behaving does not mesh well with me when communicating one-on-one. But to me that signals that they see it, and they just don't care; they want to be themselves. Sometimes I feel similarly and I sometimes feel it's so hard to tell the difference.

Not that I think you are wrong, but it's more of a reflection that with me I really have no idea how to tell the difference on a personal level. I guess the only way I would know myself is if I was assessed by a professional?
