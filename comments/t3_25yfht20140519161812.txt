I know of lots of games where you can choose either a male or female protagonist, but as far as games where the ONLY option is a female, that's very rare. Portal's one of them, as is the Metroid series, Beyond Good & Evil, Recettear, Final Fantasy XIII (though I think the game's crap), among others. But at the very least, more and more games are looking to give the option for both genders, so representation is starting to get better on that front.
