I read these studies too, and had the same worries about starting birth control, but decided to try it anyway.

The pill *did* affect my sex drive, but it didn't happen immediately - it was a very gradual decline over several years. I recently went off the pill for other medical reasons, noticed that my sex drive increased by a lot, after about a month. 

Also, stopping the pill didn't affect my attraction to my boyfriend - when we met, I had already been on the pill for a few years. After a year of dating, I stopped the pill, and things are just as awesome as ever =)

I'd really like to hunt down a full-text copy of those research studies. I'm willing to bet that the effect of the pill on MHC preference/attraction is real in the sense that it's statistically significant when you look at a very large group of women, but it's probably such a small effect that it makes no difference on an *individual* basis. I doubt it would cause you to suddenly be attracted to someone who's awful for you, or to suddenly lose your attraction to someone you love!
