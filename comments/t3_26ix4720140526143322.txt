Because betraying someone makes you less of a decent human being for one thing. Other people on the post are suggesting he see a doctor because there might be something medical going on.

If you live with someone for 5 years and things change after you get married you don't just bail on the guy. The first year of marriage is the most difficult anyway. Marriage itself changes things.

You're making it sound like there are only 2 options and that's not true nor are those options in my opinion that are advisable to take.
