Is there anything that would make you ever think that, after a guy repeatedly tells you 'no', that it might be even *slightly* acceptable to get down to your panties and touch him in his sleep?  

If not, and I certainly hope not, then this isn't a matter of being young and dumb.  This is a matter of who someone is at their core.

You keep defending him - fine, don't get upset.

But this guy is absolutely, unequivocally a sexual predator and a rapist.  And until you realize that, you will never be safe in his presence.  Nor will any other girl, apparently.
