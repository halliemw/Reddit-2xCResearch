Oh, isn't that pressure just the worst... Especially with something so expensive; shops should be able to actively offer holding gowns for a short time without the complications of crazy women trying to reserve everything.

But I've done that before. I find so many problems with clothes, especially during online browsing. The photoshopped colored options are what get me the most, and I probably messed with the bride's mood when I vaguely mentioned how bad it was. And everything else I criticized that was important to her. She didn't mean to hurt your feelings. She was just being an ass, and it probably comes from some sort of sass that already exists in her attitude or your friendship dynamic, and it's just hurting more now because this is such an occasion. Talk to her about it. Your best friend's going to feel bad that she had that impact on you.

I actually really like the concept of it. The top layer just needs to be dewrinklied on the skirt. After a few weeks, a while after you've gotten through this emotional pitfall with your friend, see how you feel in it. If you still have the same feeling that it's not perfect, *make* it the "one." Wedding dresses don't usually come out perfect, so alterations are pretty common. They can run a couple hundred, but if it makes that much of a difference for you, it might be worth it.

You're gonna look lovely either way, though! Congratulations!
