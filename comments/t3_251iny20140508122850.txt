Can you be clear on what the boundary is? It seems to me that the boundary is "can't speak to other girls without letting you know," except that seems like he'd need to be texting you every 10-15 minutes: "my teacher is female, I talked to her"; "I said hi to my co-worker," and so on. 

Do you mean a specfic kind of flirtatious talking? It was very hard for me to figure out what the boundary was you were talking about in your post. I really don't think you mean "just talking to any female" but I'd like some clarification.
