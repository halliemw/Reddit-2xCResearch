I only got through the first part of it. There were certainly parts that went way beyond the pale of jealousy and wishful thinking. But there are also parts that are just so familiar. The hostility towards women--not some women, who you know personally, but all women--based on feelings of rejection and incompetence is certainly something I've encountered before. Obviously there were other compounding issues, and in most cases that hostility never turns violent.
