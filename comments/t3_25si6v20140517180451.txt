Yeah exactly, in the end it'll do more harm than good. 

It was a big hit (and big betrayal), but I'm always about making the best of a bad situation and it looks like enough people are sticking around to fight to at least maintain its integrity, even though we can probably never regain its purpose like you said.

Plus, we can be members of more than one sub and I'm already on one of the new ones. So if we can't have our space here, we can at least still have it.
