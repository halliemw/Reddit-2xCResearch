Never heard the term "punching down". Where are you from if you don't mind me asking? Is it lingo from a specific area of the world?

I think he would disagree with you. He says as much in his quotation in the article. He will not apologize for jokes. Humor is subjective. Just because you're offended doesn't necessarily mean you are right or that he shouldn't be telling jokes like that. I think what he might say, is that if it's funny or meant to be a joke, then it's fine. White comedians make jokes about black people all the time. Louis C.K has many bits involving the "N Word".

Hell, Dave Chapelle had a routine about Micheal Richards infamous use of the "N Word". He basically says that he sees himself as a comedian more than he does as a black man, and felt some sympathy when he watched Richards on stage. 

One persons offensive is another persons funny. There isn't anything wrong with his joke at the end, it's just that it was supposed to be an apology and not a comedy stage. It was only inappropriate in the sense that the setting was wrong. Just you might disagree doesn't make it an "inappropriate joke". Just because you might find it offensive doesn't make the joke wrong to be told.
