Oh god, the weight thing is the bane of my existence. In middle school, when all the other girls seemed to shoot up and get tall and skinny, I stayed the same height and just got fat with huge boobs. It took me until the end of high school to lose about 50 lbs, and since then I've stayed skinny by heavy dieting/calorie counting. It's so frustrating. Two of my best friends (a guy and a girl) are close to 6 feet tall and bean poles. They express their distaste for overweight people whilst eating an amount that would make me obese. I envy them so much!
