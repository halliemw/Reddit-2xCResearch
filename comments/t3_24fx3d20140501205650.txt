oh my god, are we the same person?! haha i'm about 310lbs right now at 5'8... my husband met me when i was 150. i gained the weight in under a year due to a medical condition, and every day, i feel like i'm waking up in a fat suit. yet my husband unfailingly tells me i'm beautiful, whether i'm all dressed up or getting out of the shower. it is so hard to believe him when my own eyes and mind tell me i'm disgusting, but just knowing someone thinks you're beautiful (even if you don't believe it yourself) does wonders for your self-esteem.

also, congrats on your weight loss! 74lbs is no small feat. good luck on the rest of your journey :)
