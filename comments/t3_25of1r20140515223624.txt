No, you're right - in an actual attack.

What I mean is, before the attack, when a victim is being selected. I remember watching a video of convicted violent criminals, who were asked to view footage of random people walking along a hallway, then say which ones they would 'go' for. Every time, they picked the same ones - who turned out to have been assaulted in some form before. All the 'victims' carried themselves in a way that sent a signal that they were afraid, or unconfident, or basically, wouldn't be too much of a hassle.

Which makes sense, but is weird when you think about all the hurrah about wearing sexy clothes. Generally, people wear sexy or flashy things when they are feeling confident and valuable - which makes them less likely to be attacked as they are more likely to kick up a fuss.
