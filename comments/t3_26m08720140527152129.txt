It's better to be safe than sorry. Having an untreated UTI can lead to problems like a kidney infection. For me, having UTI's damaged my bladder to the point where I have pain even though the infection it gone. I don't want to tell you to not see a doctor because UTI's are really shitty and need to be treated, but if you're really doubting you have something go buy a dipstick test or wait a few more days while drinking tons of water.
