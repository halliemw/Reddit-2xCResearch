> I think the only way to not be offended or hurt by a harmless question or statement about ones weight (and further even the mean ones) is to not be so strung up about it and thereby pay into the cultural narrative bank.

There is no such thing as a harmless comment, question or statement about another person's weight.  So it's the hurt and offended people's fault?  Such a common narrative.
