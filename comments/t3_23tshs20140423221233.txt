Thankfully we're not living together. I live with my mom and he lives with his (very abusive) parents.

I am concerned because I have a history of mental health issues. I used to take a lot of medication, but I don't anymore, and I'm actually doing great right now (apart from when we fight). If you talked to my therapist you'd know that I'm actually 100% capable of taking care of my daughter, and she's very happy living with my mom, my sister and me. But maybe he'll find a way around it and take her away from me because I tried to commit suicide last year (again... when we fought).
