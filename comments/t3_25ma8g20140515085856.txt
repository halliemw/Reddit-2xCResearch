What has helped me a lot was realizing that i'm my own worst critic. My self esteem was awful, it kept me from having healthy relationships and from ever trying to actually challenge myself. I ended up missing out on a lot of opportunities because this super harsh voice in my head kept saying, "You're too fucking dumb to try any of that, how could you ever think you could do that?"

It was a vicious cycle of having low self esteem and then having low self esteem BECAUSE i had low self esteem. Every single fucking day i would just scrutinize every single bad thing i've ever done IN MY LIFE. Not very healthy way of thinking...

Eventually i was put in a situation where i *had* to challenge myself. I was put in leadership positions and that's when i realized that i *am* extremely capable and intelligent and people don't judge me nearly as harshly as i judge myself. Basically, nobody is paying as much attention to you as you think they are. Once i allowed myself to make mistakes and fully understand that *everyone makes mistakes*, i was able to start fixing all the damage and distorted way of thinking my dysfunctional self esteem had caused.
