Not really, I'm just saying that they throw these obscure "tests" at me like I need to prove myself and if I don't pass then I'm just another airheaded chick. The social cues are completely out the window though and over the course of the weekend there were multiple situations where I felt uncomfortable in a guy's presence but didn't know how to break away politely or without seeming like some bitchy annoying fangirl.
