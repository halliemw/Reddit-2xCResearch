So he doesn't know how to please you is the real issue, not the size. Let me suggest that is a problem both of you have, he doesn't know he needs to supplement his efforts with creativity and you need to ask for more. 
I wonder too if weight is a factor, I only mention it because if either party is overweight it can be a challenge but not a deal breaker. If you stick with him learn to share what you want more so that he knows. He may be oblivious to size issue, as well do yourselves both a favor, keagles ( don't know how to spell it) because the pleasure is better for each of you if you do.
