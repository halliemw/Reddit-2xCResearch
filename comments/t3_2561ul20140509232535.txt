As a wedding photographer, it's photos like these that really make me realise how powerful my work can be. So many times I've received emails from brides or grooms telling me that the photo we took of them with a relative is the last one they have. It's why I work so hard every wedding to make sure to get as many images of the couple with their guests as possible.
