Thank you so much for sharing this.  The pride you have in your progress and the hope for your future really comes across in your words.  I have a friend whose teenager is going through some terrible depressive issues and she is working so hard to find help for him - it gives me hope that even if she has to take harder steps than she expected, there's light to be found at the end of this journey.

Good luck to you and enjoy your new place!!
