I took wellbutrin for 1.5 years.  For the first three months, I had a 36:12 cycle - 36 hours awake followed by 12 hours asleep.  I was very lucky I had friends in school who could cover me in classes while I was down.  Once my sleep stabilized, I was pretty lucky in that I didn't have any other negative effects.  I had tonnes of energy, lost weight, and was able to effectively deal with my depression.  Coming off wellbutrin went okay for me too... Except the weight gain. Ugh.  I wish you all the best!
