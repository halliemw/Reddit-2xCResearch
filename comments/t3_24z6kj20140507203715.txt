Oh I'll bite, if only because I'm a white male who typically abhors blanket statements like the one in the OP.

Yes, all white men should read this article, and/or one like it.  We need to because we live in a world where we enjoy a distorted reality.  Overwhelmingly, people are nicer to us and more trusting.  We enjoy the benefits of being the *default human* and let me tell you that once you realise this, suddenly being a straight white guy seems *really fucking awesome*.

It's like playing your favourite videogame on the lowest difficulty setting:

* Some people get arrested for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  *Not us*, we can be walking through the sketchiest part of town at night, covered in blood, and a cop will stop you to see if we're ok.
* We can marry/love/fuck whomever we like.  Not the case for some others.  In some countries, they hang you if you love the wrong person.  Even in many of the civilised ones, getting married is impossible.
* Let's be honest, being a girl *sucks*.  Menstruating and childbirth aside, they're underrepresented almost everywhere.  Did you know that it's actually *illegal* to set foot on an entire island in Greece if you're sporting a vagina?  Oh, and have you seen the figures on domestic violence?  Seriously, being us is pretty sweet.

Now don't get me wrong, there's definitely some pretty shitty things about being a single, white, straight guy, but no honest person, when faced with the facts will deny that we've got it pretty good.  I think you might even say we've got it *best*.
