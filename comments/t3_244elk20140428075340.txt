Its a long story, My doctors knew because it was in my file that I was born with an external deformity, But a GYN I was seeing in my Mid-teens mentioned in passing that I had internal oddities too, I was shocked because I hadn't noticed anything weird, but after he had mentioned it it all made sense.

Basicaly in the womb my clitoris over-developed and started connecting to the walls of my vagina (which is what happens when a fetus starts to develop male geniality) this resulted in my urethra being pushed out of the way, and the opening of the urethra ended up inside my vagina, surrounded by a small ball of glandular tissue. Externally I had some funny looking labia (which my dad opted to have surgically fixed when I was young) and a normal clitoris. I developed normally as a female, I just could not find my urethra because it was hiding.
