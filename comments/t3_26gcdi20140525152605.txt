Haven't had a double mastectomy, but I could see it as a psychological thing. For one thing, breasts don't have so much of a purpose, if you've finished breastfeeding. If one breast just tried its best to kill you, why should the other one get to stick around? May as well even it up and get implants in both sides.

If you have no genetic predisposition, it was unlikely that the first one would become cancerous... Maybe we do not yet know all the genetic and non-genetic predispositions to breast cancer? Why risk it? If you're already going under the knife for one side....
