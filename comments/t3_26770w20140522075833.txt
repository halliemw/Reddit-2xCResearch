Most teachers' lounges are very gossipy. It's one thing that turns me off the profession because I think it is super hypocritical of us to boast about not bullying and turn around and do it behind closed doors. I have been in a few schools that are very kind and do exemplify the true spirit of being a teacher, but this was just terrible. I'm glad I'm leaving.
