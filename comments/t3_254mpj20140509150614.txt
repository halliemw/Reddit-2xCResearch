The first few times I tried to take mine out I was 100% convinced it was stuck there FOREVER. I can't really explain it but after a few times I got the technique down perfectly and can now get it out very easily almost every time... but that first time I was struggling for about as long as you were, visions of having to go to the hospital flashing through my mind...
