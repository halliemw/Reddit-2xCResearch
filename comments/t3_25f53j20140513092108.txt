This guy does not sound like a good sexual partner. It sounds like he is playing mind games with you, maybe to assert his sense of superiority. Fucking even casually can lead to more serious situations involving health and emotions and if your in the game to come out winning than you need a better partner than a person your instincts are warning you about. And....to be honest if your already scrutinizing your own reactions to his games then your already getting too attached to him.
