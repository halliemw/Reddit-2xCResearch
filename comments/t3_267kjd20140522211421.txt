The "clarity" thing was the exact thing that happened to me! My friends and family couldn't do anything without me freaking out either getting really upset or really angry. 

Getting off BCP and switching to the IUD was the best thing that ever happened to me. I lost weight, became slightly less anxious and actually felt normal.

Just know it *may* take a couple months for any changes to really be apparent and make sure you have another birth control option! Personally for me the IUD hasn't caused any of the emotional toil that I experienced with the BCP.
