I have the 2 step verification for gmail and facebook. I 'think' those sites are safe now. He was emailing me on my school email and so far i haven't been able to find anyway to protect that one. That's where walls and walls of messages from him were being saved but he got in and they're all gone now. I have some screen shots of the amount of messages I had amassed from that email. He even transferred money from my online banking to his bank account, I reported it and he talked with the lady and he was all smug in an email to me about how they told him he most likely didn't have anything to worry about.
