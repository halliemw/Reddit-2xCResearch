Okay. Just curious.

Sex should be enjoyed by both parties, if you can reach emotional climax from a blow job  and that's enough for you,cool.

If you now can experience personal physical orgasm,,then even better!

Good on you for getting out of an abusive relationship and realizing that  sex is two way act.
