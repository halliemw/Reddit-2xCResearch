I wasn't done, I added a bunch of edits. 

Honestly, it's really not relevant if she fought back or screamed. A lot of victims freeze up because it's not exactly a situation that you have a preplanned action to. Drunkenness is relevant, but saying it didn't happen because you must have consented is sort of iffy because it's insinuating that she had an option or was legally capable of consenting. There is a point where it is illegal regardless assuming no other things are at play. 

'Why didn't you file a report immediately' is just fucking daft if it's accusing her of something. Right now we're assuming an accusing or disbelieving tone based on the OP.
