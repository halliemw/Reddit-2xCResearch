If you work out 3 times a week and eat "healthier than any of *your skinny friends"  then there are 2 possibilities for you to consider.  

If you just started recently then you are in a success lag, you are doing all the right things but the results have not caught up with you yet.  It's too soon the be saying you work out lots and eat healthy

If you have been doing this for 6+months, then your nutrition is wrong and you need to educate yourself on this.  You may not be eating as healthy as you think you are.  See /r/keto for a plan that can help you make noticeable progress in as little as 3 weeks. 

I have left out the third option of illness that might cause difficulties as you are far too active to fall into that category.

You have the drive and dedication, remove the obstacles one by one. Start with your diet.  Point your motivation in the right direction.
