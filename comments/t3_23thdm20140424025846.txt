If two conditions are met:

1) taking the day off doesn't jeopardize his work or career 
2) taking the day off doesn't effect his future ability to travel with me to the funeral or go on vacation

Then no, I don't care how he handles his business. And if those conditions were not met, I would be upset that he's not being very supportive of me or our relationship - not that he told a white lie at work.
