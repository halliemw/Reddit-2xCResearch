Do you think *all* employers have the right to force a women to sign a contract **as a condition of employment** whereby she agrees to abort any pregnancies where the child has a disability? How would you feel if this was Wal-Mart saying they would only hire women who agree to abort their pregnancies of disabled children? I could imagine some companies wanting to save money on health insurance, do you think it's appropriate for people to use such a requirement as a condition of employment?
