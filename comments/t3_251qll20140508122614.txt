Look at the subreddit right now. Everything's downvoted. A post about women's situation in Afghanistan has 125 downvotes and a score of 8. It has six comments, almost all of which are downvoted into the negatives. 

No doubt the amount of trolls and MRA assholes will increase as well. We'll be spending more time defending the very existence of this sub and feminism, and less time actually discussing women's issues. 

I didn't post here very much before, but if this continues, well, there are other subreddits out there.
