But don't you think that, if he were to be considering getting something like that, that your opinion should matter to whether or not he goes through with it? Or, as is the case in your post, shouldn't your husband's opinion of it matter to you? If what he thinks about what you do with your body doesn't matter to you, I'm going to have trouble understanding why you're married to him.
