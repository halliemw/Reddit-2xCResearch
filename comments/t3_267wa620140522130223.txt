That's not what I meant. As an "accessory" in a music video, they are essentially at the level of background dancer or so, just not the same as the artist/musician/performer. It's not that it's better for a woman to be an accessory than the center of it, just that it's not at all unreasonable for there to be music videos that women are in, but not the center of. 

And also, as background characters, we don't think about them as much as people. In a movie, you don't usually wonder about the extras' motivation. But in a music video where the scantily clad lady is front and center, the whole time, you're thinking about her. Even moreso when you know who she is, you know about her like we do with celebrities. It's thinking about people you "know," and what they're doing, versus thinking about strangers.

Also, helluva lotta confirmation bias in that article. I've seen plenty of scantily clad fellas in music videos (chris brown, usher, specifically) and them not being in speedos really just speaks to the personas they're putting on (a lot of which a speedo wouldn't match up with. They tend to explicitly and verbally express their sexual prowess rather than doing it with clothes). And a lot of the expressed sexuality comes through dancing, which a lot of male artists (especially those who put nakey ladies in their videos) don't dance. And for one more thing, people absolutely call out men's videos. Absolutely. Robin Thicke has said that his goal with the Blurred Lines video was to be as absurdly sexual as possible and so it looked like a joke, so I can't speak to that. But yea, people call them out. Especially the explicit videos that they can't put on television.
