I was one of those kids who started masturbating at a young age, around 8 I think. But it wasn't really something sexual at the time. It just felt good, and it wasn't something I associated with sex until I was older and thinking about sex as sex. I wouldn't expect a 13 year old to understand the difference, but at the same time I would expect them to understand the difference between masturbating and sex.
