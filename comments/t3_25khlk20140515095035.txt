Oh my God..This exact thing drives me crazy. I hate having to be fact-checked as if I'm not a credible source of information. Happens more often than it should. It seems like the only time my intelligence is acknowledged is when someone is trying to get me in bed...and at that time it seems like someone is just blowing smoke up my arse.
