>Why would you do something different for boys and girls? 

...because she can?

>Would the boys be learning about body image and nutrition also?  Don't get me wrong, body image and nutrition are great topics but I think they could benefit any gender! :)

Think of the menz because they have the same socialization about body image as women do by advertising, media, and their peers.

>Why not do something fun? Do something to encourage girls to enjoy and not be afraid of science. Maybe some hands on projects that are fun. I found some here, even more girly things like making lip balm. I know that if it wasn't for teachers encouraging me to be interested in science, I wouldn't have the career I have today!

Girls are afraid of stem so involve makeup! That's totally not pandering! But body image isn't fun its boring.. So makeup, right?

Welcome to twox where its about helping women succeed when everything in society only promotes men succeeding as seen above.
