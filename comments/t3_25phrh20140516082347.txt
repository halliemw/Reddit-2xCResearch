This album is mostly stuff I post on FB. I told people when she was born if they don't want a flood, unfollow me, and I won't blame them. A few friends told me they did after the second week. We are still friends.

The baby is so freaking happy, it is unreal. We hope we didn't use all our real life karma on the first one...
