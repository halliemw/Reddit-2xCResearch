May I ask please, do you have kids? Because the privacy policy between the parents of the house should not be the same as the privacy policy between the parents and the offspring in the house. I have seen too many examples of kids and teens in radically serious trouble, completely over their heads (sex, drugs, exploitation) and the parents would not have known unless they were being vigilant. 

This is not to say that kids should not have a degree of privacy; of course they should. But if I had kids nowadays, you bet there would be a random-check policy in our home, and if I found worrisome communications there would be serious conversations and more frequent checks.
