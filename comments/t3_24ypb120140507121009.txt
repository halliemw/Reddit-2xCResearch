I'm just kind of overwhelmed by the possibilities. I'm worried I will regret not doing some things later, if that makes sense. I'm definitely going to check out thrift stores for dresses and shoes and such. I'll get married with a justice of the peace. 

I've never been to a wedding before!! I think that's why I'm so confused haha
