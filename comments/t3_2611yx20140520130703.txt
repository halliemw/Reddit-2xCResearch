Things such as: how was your weekend, do you like x or y food, how I'm doing.. things like that. I also have problems with my body temperature and they always let me know how I need to fix myself or how they're so much healthier than I am because of x y z reasons. I don't speak of my temperature issues, they just comment on their own.
