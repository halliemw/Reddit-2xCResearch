I feel you. 

Last year I was staying overnight at the hospital here when my father had a stroke (he recovered very well!) and I was a total wreck. I kept going outside to the parking lot to play with my phone and smoke and some guy thought that was the perfect time to hit on me. And then he got angry when I asked him to please leave me alone while I'm dealing with a sick family member inside. Apparently it was rude of me to not be in the mood to entertain him?
