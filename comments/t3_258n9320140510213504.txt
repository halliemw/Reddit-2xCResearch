Try bikinis meant for surfing and working out! I'm a competitive swimmer and I swim hours a day outside in the California sunshine. Nike and speedo have some cute bikinis that are meant to withstand diving and big waves. Also, Jolyn is a company that makes super cute adjustable bikinis and one-pieces that are meant for water polo, diving, surfing, and sim team. I swear by jolyns. However all bikinis mentioned have no padding in them so if you're worried about support or poking through these may not be the best.
