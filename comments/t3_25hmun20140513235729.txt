I'm a man.  I get 'mansplained' to by people who are either generally arrogant or just don't respect me in particular.  Sometimes I'm sure it's about gender bias, but sometimes men and women are just douchey.  

Though generally men, in my experience, are more douchey and desperately trying to prove to themselves that they are dominant.  Again though it's not necessarily a man vs woman thing... those men are probably just douchey in general and you are experiencing it AND happen to be a woman.  

Oh shit am I mansplaining?  I am kind of a douche but... no more so to women than I am to men :P
