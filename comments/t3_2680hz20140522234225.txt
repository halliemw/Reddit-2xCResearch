I guess this just varies person by person. Personally, I've been attracted to many people who haven't reciprocated and I've still managed to have very fulfilling friendships with them and vice-versa.

 I certainly don't expect anyone to be my friend if they feel as though it is too awkward for them, but to *constantly* have guys ask you out solely based on appearances and then *never* have them want to be your friend or get to know simply because you're in a relationship just makes it feel a lot more superficial and disheartening.
