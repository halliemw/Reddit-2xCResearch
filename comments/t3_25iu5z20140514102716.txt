Up with self respect/confidence, down with double standards and being hung up on people.

For practical advice i'd say, if you're meeting someone, meet them an hour early for a drink, if you're not comfortable sitting down with someone casually do not expect to be comfortable sleeping with them, talk, great way to weed out assholes.
During the talk bring up "sexually liberated", if he smiles and nods, walk away, if he agrees wholeheartedly, walk away, if he reticules the notion, walk away, if he asks what you meant by that, fuck him.

As a side note, if you need catchphrases like the above to justify your choices you might still have some growing to do before miring into the emotionally swamp that is casual dating.

There are guys out there with all the commitment properties of a towel on a tiled wall but who will still treat you right and respect you in the morning, they are just a tad harder to find than using a "nearest horny set of balls plz" app, in life you receive in measures of the effort you put in.     

8 years of age difference is only a problem if he's younger than 26.

Your statement about not wanting a committed relationship and your doubt about him valuing you as anything but a hook up contradict each other, get in touch with him and find out or get over him and move on, any other path leads to sad-panda land.

Don't be too hard on yourself, life is confusing, approach it with an open mind, if only because narrow minds see fewer paths and often miss the one that leads to happiness ,don't be to hard on other people, life is confusing for them too.
