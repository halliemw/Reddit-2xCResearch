I take seasonique. It's designed to have 4 a year, but you can still skip more. I mostly like that each pack lasts for 3 months :).

But you can do it with almost any pill, just skip the period-week pills at the end of the pack. Note: I say almost because I believe a few(like the low-dose pill form) might not have the right dosage to be able to do it, so you should check with a doc.

The period you have on the pill isn't even a "real" period, anyway. It's called "withdrawal bleeding," and it's caused by the sudden hormonal drop-off when you stop the regular pills and start the placebos. When they first made the BC pill, there wasn't a week for periods at all, but that caused them to not be received well. Women of the time thought it must be bad/unhealthy to not have periods, or got scarred that they were pregnant because they didn't get one. So the designers added in the period-week placebos to improve acceptance. 

Again, you don't have to have periods. You can do the research for yourself, of course. Personally, I want to avoid them entirely because I have endometriosis, and each period risks making it worse. Just a warning that it sometimes takes time to for your body to adjust to having less periods, and until the hormones level out with the schedule you're taking the pill, you may experience breakthrough bleeding (much like some women do going on the pill for the first time do). At first I could only make it 2 months without having breakthrough bleeding.
