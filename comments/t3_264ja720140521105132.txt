Hi there! I've had some similar experiences, and right now I use a spray that comes in a can on my feet and it fixes them right up. If you're interested, when I get home today (long shift at work) I'll take a picture of the can for you. It's like 13 dollars and lasts a long time, which is way better than medical debt. PM me or just reply if I can help somehow.
