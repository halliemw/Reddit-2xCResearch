Let me make it clear that I am in no way defending Elliot Rodgers' actions.  I don't believe that murdering other is ever a justified means of dealing with your emotional issues.  I mean how can I on the one hand argue for a more compassionate world, but on the other argue that his murder justified?  That is a complete contradiction and I think you might be misreading/reading into what I am trying to say.


I do, however think that it is easier to disregard/dehumanize Elliot, by labeling him as a monster or crazy than it is to attribute any relatable emotion to him.  I was trying to express that I could understand some of, not all of what he was going through and that these kinds of feeling left unchecked can lead to radical ideology.  Please don't think that I am trying to blame women for this, or that I am implying I think that they deserved this.  


I was fortunate enough to have a supportive group of friends and family to talk to during my darkest days and perhaps if Elliot had the benefit of something similar he may have deviated from the course that lead to that ultimate end.  Trust me, if I was able to talk to him about any of this to be sure I would have pointed out the fallacies of his ways.  How self-entitled and egocentric he was being, how misguided and objectifying his view of women was.  Of course they aren't going to like you.  You blame women for your loneliness and strife, but what are you really doing about it?   There is just a part of me that which I could reach out to him prior to this and imparted what I have learned over the years.  For instance, that confidence and esteem are not something that you are born with, that there was nothing that these other guys had that you didn't except maybe humility, and that no one is born with these traits.  It is something that is learned, and not over night, these things are learned over time.
