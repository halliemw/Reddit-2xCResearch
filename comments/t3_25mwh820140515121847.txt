Have you not watched JackAss or Tosh or similar?  It's an American epidemic.  A lot of this is random (I've seen it happen to boys, girls, men, women, pets, etc).  I live in SoCal.  We have cages along many pedestrian overpasses to keep people from throwing crap at cars.  

I've let people into traffic when it wasn't their turn, waved at them, and gotten flipped off (they must be so angry at everyone, already, that they can't comprehend when people are being nice - I always hope it will sink in later).  Naturally, many people smile and wave, as well.
