And here I was thinking why the hell do they use blue? I'm still thinking that. Maybe it's shocking because you've never seen it so openly displayed before? After years of dealing with blood soaked pads this is nothing special to me. I was actually thinking they got the wrong shade of red and that the chunks should be a little darker if they're going for realism. 

Just think what that commercial would have been like if we had smellovision!
