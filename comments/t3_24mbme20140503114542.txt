 Not necessarily a pen pal, but I've been talking to a new friend online and we're swapping care packages! She's into bone collecting and I'm into books so she's sending me a few specimens and I'm sending her Mary Roach's "Stiff"! I'm so giddy, I'm going to put a bunch of notes in the box and doodle on it, sending physical mail is exciting.
