I am a female with bulimia, currently in treatment. Like some others said, while you might want to tell him how good-looking he is or that his body is perfect, try not to. Putting an emphasis on his body looking any certain way and associating it with good or bad will continue that thought process for him. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't compliment him in other ways. Oftentimes I feel like I'm not good enough, so any time someone praises me in any small way, like "it was really great to see you today" or "you did a great job on ___", it makes me stop hating myself a little and start thinking a little bit more positively. Bulimia is rooted in much deeper emotions; when I sought out treatment, I found out that I also have anxiety and depression. His bulimia is a coping mechanism for something much deeper, and I would really recommend trying to get him treatment. One thing that pushed me to get treatment was when I came home for spring break from school and my mom saw me. She knew I had/have bulimia and she just broke down in tears because I was so skinny. She and my boyfriend constantly expressed their concern for me (and still do!) and that was the final straw. Not saying that you need to break down in front of him, but expressing your concern in a loving, rational, and not attacking/accusing way may help. If you have any questions about the nature of the disorder or anything else, feel free to message me!
