Good job, Girl!  My one suggestion is to get something you like to look at up on the walls asap. Bare walls create a weird feeling that creeps up on you and is unpleasant and hard to pinpoint.  Make yourself some art to celebrate this awesome new step, tack up some cool posters, experiment with your new space so it helps you feel at home, safe, happy.  Good luck!  We are pulling for you!
