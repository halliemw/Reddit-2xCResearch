I'm a huge fan of YA fantasy (even as an almost 24 year old woman, I still go back and reread these...): Abhorsen series by Garth Nix, ANYTHING written by Tamara Pierce (she's fabulous!), The Inheritance Trilogy by N.K. Jemisin, my fiance's brother recently bought me two sci-fi fairy tale books called Cinder and Scarlet by Marissa Meyer... I know there are a ton more out there, but I can't think of them at the moment.

I also really loved The Hunger Games, Divergent, and The Handmaids Tale as another redditor had suggested :)

But seriously, I think every young girl and woman should read any/all series by Tamara Pierce
