Anyone uninterested can very easily unsubscribe using the red button on the side of the subreddit. It won't show up on their front page anymore. If they're not logged in, yes, it'll show up on the front page no matter what, along with all the other defaults. The people complaining are literally too lazy to click a button, or they're purposely staying around because they have a problem with *gasp* a women-centric subreddit being default even if they don't have to see it. How dare those women talk about their experiences!
