The odd thing about that though is that to down vote you have to have an account. And if you already have an account the change of defaults doesn't change your front page. All it does is let you know of new sub's you might want to subscribe to. I'm not saying this is normal. I'm just saying that it's likely trolls that will eventually unsub and forget about it.
