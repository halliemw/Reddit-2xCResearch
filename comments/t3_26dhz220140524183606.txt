I think the snooping you did in the first place is a violation of trust in itself. But at the same time it's not a good sign if it's actually recent conversation. Sadly relationships are not like Jobs, you can't go looking for your next relationship while in your current one. So in that case it's basically cheating. 

Though I think the context by which you found out does not indicate any trust between you at all, and you might as well end it.
