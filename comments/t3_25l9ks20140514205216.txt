As a guy, I don't see any problems with it. But if you're worried about her feelings, I would ask her about it. At the same time however, if she's moved on, then it really shouldn't matter. I should note that I work exclusively with women so I have walked many of my girlfriends through situations quite similar to this one and they're doing just fine and are still friends with their girlfriends.
