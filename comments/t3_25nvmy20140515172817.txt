> . He asked if she was sexually active otherwise, when the last time she had engaged in intercourse was before the rape (more than 6 days prior), insinuated that the semen might be from the sex with her partner and not from the "alleged rape" that she might be making up since she was drunk at the time, asked how she knows she hadn't consented if she had been drunk, asked why she didn't scream or push him off of her (she did try to push him off, but she dreams every night about it and wakes up crying at the point where she doesn't scream). The officer also criticized her for waiting so long to file the report...etc.


You don't do that shit. One it's not relevant, two it's attacking their personal life, three it has no bearing on whether she was raped for not, four when you ask questions like that it's to have a superiority complex over someone, five it's discouraging a person from reporting a crime to a person who is meant to take those reports and do something about them, six there are traumatic things you need to ask, but none of those included any of the above. 

Now that we got what isn't helpful out of the way... The questions that are relevant are going to be painful no matter how you ask them. It's a matter of making it less painful and asking them without attacking the victim or without completely negating the fact that it was a crime. "I'm sorry this happened to you and you didn't deserve it. I'm going to have to ask questions that will be painful to answer, but we need to get through them" is the way to go about it.
