Yeah, daily birth control pills actually even out your hormonal levels over the course of your cycle so most people see a reduction in PMS symptoms. Also, the pill does not make you gain weight. It just doesn't; it can, however, make you retain more water, but that's usually just in the first two months or so until your body gets used to the hormones. Progesterone pills can cause a slight increase in appetite, but not a major one. 

Also, if you're worried about your parents, the FDA approves the use of hormonal birth control to deal with acne and certain chronic headaches. You can always say it's for that.

All this being said, you shouldn't feel forced to do anything you don't want to, medically. You should have a conversation with your doctor about your options and what might be best for your specific situation.

I, personally, love my pills. They'll have to pry them out of my cold, dead hands. It absolutely changed my life when I started taking them- I take them continuously (ie, no 4 day non-hormonal pills) which means I never get a period and it's literally been the greatest single decision I've ever made.
