Gah! Thigh gap! My sister has thigh gap at, like, 5'11 and 170lbs. She wears a 10/12, basically a very normal size for her height. She has thigh gap because she's a little slim through the thighs but more importantly has wide set hips - even when she's weighed more, her thighs haven't really touched.

I, on the other hand, have been semi-underweight and my thighs still touched. 

It's definitely more of a build thing than a weight thing.
