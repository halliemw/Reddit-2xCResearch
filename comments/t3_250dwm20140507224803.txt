Lady I don't think you realize how strong you are *right now*. You have made probably one of the hardest decisions ever. It's so hard to cut someone out when you want to hold on *just a bit longer* to see if they'll change. You are so fucking strong *right now*. You WILL look back on this time and see it for yourself even if you don't see it now.

A good book on manipulation that I read (which I recommend everyone read whether or not you feel you're in a manipulative relationship) is called "Who's Pulling Your Strings." It has been really empowering for me and I hope that it helps you, too.
