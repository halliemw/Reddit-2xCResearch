There are so many things wrong with your response. Your referenced conception of pornography, the conflation of egg and sperm donation, your complete disregard of varying individual decisions to donate, and your reference to a post that is irrationally hostile towards men and about reproduction make your argument very weak. 

If you are seriously arguing that motherhood and fatherhood are strictly biological--using false biology--then there is nothing more that I have to say to you. Parenthood is so much more than the exchange of genetic material.
