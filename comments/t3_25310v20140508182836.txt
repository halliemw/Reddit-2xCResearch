>Would you see it as the company doing something nice and fun that's in line with the interests of the attendees

I'd see it as this one, but also you might want to bring up the idea of the male version (i.e. tailor fitting/stylist session) if there is a similar series of training days for them. I'd also question what would / will be done if there is a mixed-gender training course as well, what would *their* "mood lightener" be. It could just be a gesture meant to be seen as nice, perhaps it was voted on by some of the attendees? (Don't know if you have a way of telling that, they apparently didn't ask *everyone* but maybe they sent out mails to a % of the attendees to ask what they would like to have done as a finish to the course?)
