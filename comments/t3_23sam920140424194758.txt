Sorry I should have included that he was very supportive throughout the whole thing.  He drove me to the ER and everything.  I just remember saying "and now we have this huge bill to deal with.." and he responded with "no, YOU have this huge bill to deal with".  I spoke with him yesterday and apparently he was joking and he also thinks it's ridiculous that since he's the guy, he's technically off the hook.

I agree a lot with what you said.  He and I have always split everything in our relationship. We wouldnt necessarily go Dutch at a restaurant, but we take turns paying and keep it as even as possible.  In our opinions, that's what's fair, and the best way to keep us on an equal playing field.

I don't think it's a woman's world, per se... I do think that in many aspects we've gone way beyond equality.  But at the same time, in many other ways we're still striving to reach it.  I don't think absolute equality is possible, but I'm going to try and strive for it as much as I can, at least in my relationship.  And sometimes that means taking some of my privileges, and some of his privileges down a notch.
