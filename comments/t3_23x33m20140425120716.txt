Good for you. I'm impressed. I think in the loooong run you will be glad you made this decision.

You can't make decisions for your mom, but in future, once you are more settled, you could let her know that you are there for her if she decides to leave.

Also, in many jurisdictions the police will come along for a standby, aka civil assist, to just be there for 10-15 minutes while you pick your stuff up.

Time to start planning for your financial independence. Good luck.
