My only problem with the NuvaRing is it's stupid refrigeration requirements. Means my family planning clinic in the UK refuses to prescribe me 6 months rather than just 3 months like they would for other contraception. Even though they could give me 2 scripts and I could pick the 2nd up 3 months later. Means I have to visit the clinic every 3 months. Think I'm going to make an appointment for a Mirena IUS.
