Good luck. Like I said, I've been exactly there with a close friend. We're at the point now where she just doesn't talk to me about her love life. We're still friends, and I'm still there for her, but I'm not going to be her support system for her own self-destructive decisions. The good news is, it hasn't at all destroyed our friendship, and I (and my husband!) am much more at peace.
