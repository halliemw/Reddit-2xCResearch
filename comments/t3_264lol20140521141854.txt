Employment law attorney here for a corporate defense firm. I don't know what state your are in and will not jeopardize my bar license but some general reminders applicable to all areas;
1. HR is there to protect the company, not the workers.
2. Document, document, document. Ideally you'd keep a diary of the events as they occur and mail it to yourself on a weekly basis. Don't open the envelope, that way one has a "time stamped" contemporary document detailing your allegations.
3. Going "outside the chain of command" rarely helps your case. It sets you up as a "troublemaker" within the company.
4. It will take time for your requests to filter through to the proper parties and for corrective action to be taken.
5. Expect retaliation, either direct or indirectly, and don't expect the law will offer any protection. I have counselled hundreds of cold call cases with people who had legitimate issues (and claims) but they had NO protection under the law because the company knew what it was doing - see point one. 

Last advice, it is a tough world and people need to realize that if you act like a mat you get stepped on. I
