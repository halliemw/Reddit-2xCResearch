Kinda happened to me the other day. Found myself in a conversation in which a guy tried to say that both men and women had been hurt by misandry/misogyny respectively (true), *and that we needed to stop pretending one side had it worse than the other* and move on and treat each other better. The sentiment was well intentioned, but his grasp of the current and past state of being a woman was non-existent. 

I told him "Great, well, the next time you wake up and find that you're a woman, I'll be sure to take your opinion seriously."
