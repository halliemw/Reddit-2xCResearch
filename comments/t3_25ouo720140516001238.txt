Personally, I love that it's socially acceptable to wear heels. I feel powerful, sexy, and graceful when I walk around in a nice pair. I love the click, the sway, etc.

I love the fact that as a girl, I'm not discouraged from expressing how I feel. I think it's more socially acceptable to express their emotions, which is a good and healthy thing
