You see it as victim-blaming, I see it as empowering. 

From my own past, and the cases of women that I helped and who attended therapy with me, the red flags show pretty much straight away in abusive relationships, but the victim ignores them for many reasons.

Part of my therapy concentrated on recognising these red flags for what they are, and being aware of these behaviours in any future potential relationships. Excessive charm is one of them, coincidentally  :) 

You say that anyone can fall for manipulation - but I can't agree. A healthy person with a healthy self-esteem will not fall for an abuser and manipulator, mainly because the 'charm' will just not work, and the 'minor things' that an unhealthy person will explain as 'a bad day' or 'he didn't know any better', or 'but he apologised straight away' will be recognised for the red flags they are. 

One can be a victim and cry 'oh oh why does it always happen to me' or, one can say 'why did I choose such a person, what of my needs were fulfilled and what fears of mine evoked to make me stay for so long ', analyse this and heal what is needed to heal, to avoid making such choices for the future. 

One of these will be a victim, the other one will take the power for herself.
