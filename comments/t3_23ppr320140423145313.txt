It takes me 18 months after vaginal delivery for PnV sex not to be uncomfortably tight for the participants. Sometimes childbirth robs the vagina of its previous elasticity and lubrication, my G spot wishes to be untouchable for about a year. My husband found intercourse to be annoying tight, making it a short activity for him and somewhat painful for me. Yet, I could always count on a sneeze during pregnancy and afterwards to cause leaking urine issues.
