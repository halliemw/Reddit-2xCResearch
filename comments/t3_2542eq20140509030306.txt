You're not selfish.

Your problems are not irrelevant just because other people have problems too (that might seem worse than yours logically). Your feeling are not invalid because other people have feelings too (which might seem stronger than yours).

If you had a broken bone, it would still be a broken bone even if your friend had two broken bones or ten broken bones. Maybe her ten broken bones would result in more pain. But your broken bone would also still result in pain. That pain would still exist and still matter.

Take care of yourself. If these people care about you, they will be fine with that. Don't let yourself be just a dumping ground for other people's stuff. There are people out there who will care about you, maybe these people aren't it, but they are out there.

How often do any of them genuinely ask you how you are?
