My period started on my 9th birthday (is that unfair or what?) but I already knew what to do - my mum had given me a little purse pack of panty liners and pads with a booklet and told me to get the school to ring her if I ever wanted to, when it happened. My auntie started at 11 as well as a cousin at 9 so my mum wanted to be prepared, as well as I had started in bras not long before. I suggest you get a mixed pack of tampons/pads/liners that comes with an information booklet so you can have it on hand for her, if needed - maybe even sitting in the bathroom (in addition to a bin!) and a few additional pamphlets and books. It's not really abnormal to have puberty starting at 8, but if you're worried about hormones or precocious puberty take her to visit her doctor and also encourage her to ask as many questions as she desires.

We didn't learn about periods in school (well, what causes them and what to do about them) until age 11-12 which was too late for a few of us. Be open to discussing anything and everything relating to the body and answer her honestly, don't shame her for wanting information and if you don't know an answer, find out for her. I was so confused and upset that my period started so early, that I couldn't go swimming, I had boobs, I was the tallest, stretch marks everywhere and was wrecking all my undies. My friends didn't understand and I didn't have a big sister. My mum had opened that avenue of discussion already.

My sister started her period at 13, 16 now and I just tell her if she needs to go to the doctor (and she should if she wants to start having sex so she can be safe), pharmacist, psychologist, needs pads, tampons, condoms or any information she can come to me or our mum and we will do everything we can.

If you want to try to have a discussion with her you could try to find TV show episodes or films that deal with these kind of things and watch them with her. With a big sister extending her arm, she will be okay.
