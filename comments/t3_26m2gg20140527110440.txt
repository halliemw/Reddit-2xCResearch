Yes, it's perfectly ok. Love doesn't have to mean you like everything or even anything about her. Sometimes it means that you accept her and accept that she'll never change. It's a mental shift in attitude that I made with my own mother some time ago. I don't hate my mother, but he behaviour is so childish (she even stomps her feet when she doesn't get something she wants). In order to spare myself some stress, I just started finding her behaviour amusing instead of irritating, and when she gets really difficult I just practice acceptance. At this point, there's nothing to gain by arguing with your mother over whether she has it worst. Just validate her feelings if you can, keep it silent if you can't. If she's blaming everyone but herself, play her game and act shocked when things don't turn out well. 

But spare yourself the stress, you need to take care of yourself too.
