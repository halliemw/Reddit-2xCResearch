Huh. All I'm seeing is people who are mad at how men aren't allowed to talk about men's issues here and how this subreddit dares to be aimed at  women. Then tons and tons of people talking about how much we should tip-toe in order to avoid any and all statements that could be interpreted as misandry by anyone. Though that's always been the case. 

Plus, a mod called this subreddit a "girly space" today, so I don't have much hope that it'll go in a good direction.
