I only have a two year old, so admittedly I don't have experience with teens but if we're talking about 18 year olds and older I'd find it worrying if they didn't have the right to privacy in their communications with other adults. I don't see why communicating with a cousin via IM is different from communicating in person and you certainly wouldn't expect to be able to monitor the latter.
