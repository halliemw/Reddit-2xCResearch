Well, I don't think I could be your roommate either. Its like I would be scared to turn down any invitation. I don't even know what you mean by "connect and mesh really well." 

You just advised the whole internet to avoid certain people supposedly because they all have these traits which you just admitted not all shut ins have. These were completely your projections now.

There are more "harmonious roomate environments" then you are willing to deal with, is the truth here and that is all.

I would hate to have a lease with you. I would be constantly wasting my energy to conform to your lifestyle just so I can not be scared I'm about to be evicted.

Its like dan savage said, when you are in a relationship with someone there is always "the price of admission" which is whatever little quirks or unique weaknesses that person has. 

You might as well have been replacing "shut-in" with any category of people and then make a bunch of shit generalizations on.

There is no such thing as a perfect roommate, and since you declare yourself an introvert, and yet go ahead and convince everyone to avoid all shut-ins...'

I would avoid you not only as a roommate, but I would also not have you as a friend. You have waaaay to many strange and nebulous restrictions against others that you go ahead and judge whole groups of people with.

Fact is, judgmental people are probably the type that you "mesh" with. At least, that has been my experience with people like you who only hang out with carbon copies of themselves, or at least, force others to conform around them or suffer dire consequences.

How do you deal with people in your life who come across hard times? Or financial troubles and just can't keep up with entertaining you?

Do you realize then, that there are people who you share space with who might be tired of your bullshit?
