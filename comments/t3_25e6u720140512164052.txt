*I shave my armpits on a daily basis (at least as often as I can remember to). 

*I shave my lady bits on just about a weekly basis. Unfortunately, I have super sensitive skin and get razor burn every single time I shave around there, so I try to space those out as much as tolerable but with bikini season upon us, I am forced to be more diligent.

 *Now I love the feeling of smooth legs, but have been blessed with fine leg hair so I only have to shave my stems once a week (twice if it's a special occasion/i really want oral)



 *(btw, anyone reading this that has any tips on getting rid of/preventing razor burn I would LOVE to hear them! This has been an ongoing problem and no matter what razor/shaving cream combo I've used it's always been that way. I'm considering trying waxing but I don't really have the budget for it right now and I'm nervous about having someone down there do that for me...)*
