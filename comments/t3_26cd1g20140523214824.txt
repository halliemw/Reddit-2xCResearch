That sounds like a lovely thing, and I am glad that your sister had the opportunity to write things down. I bet your words and presence weren't passed over though.

My Gram has been the rock (a tectonic plate) for me/my family.  She is the one who would have been able to read that sort of letter to someone else. I don't know who else has that kind of power right now though.

She is the matriarch, the pillar of strength that has held the rest of us together.
