>If you look at the campaigns, that is what they're saying. If the people reading them didn't leap to "I know not to rape, what a dumb campaign", they might realise what the campaigns are saying. 

If the campaigns were actually trying to, you know, be effective, they wouldn't label at something that they know people will ignore, let alone something that is offensive and sexist and sometimes spreads more misinformation about rape. 

Anyways, regarding your study, it uses the legal definition of rape, so it's not worth much. According to that definition, if you and your SO come home from having a couple beers and decide you are horny and want to have sex your both rapists. It means if you turned 18 last month and your SO turns 18 next week and you have have sex in between then you're a rapist.  It's not at all surprising that anyone is an offender of that, and it's certainly not a male issue.
