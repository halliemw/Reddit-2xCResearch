So, I'm going to preface this with I don't know the guy and I don't know this woman, and the situation is probably more complex than a couple of paragraphs on the internet can properly express. The things I'm operating on, information wise:

* She's pregnant
* She doesn't feel ready to be a parent
* He does feel ready to be a parent
* He objects to the termination of the pregnancy
* He says would feel betrayed if she aborts, and likely wouldn't continue the relationship
* She feels this is putting pressure on her to carry to term a child she is apprehensive (at best) about having
* She feels that having a baby now would jeopardize her future and/or her ability to be a good parent

The conclusion I've drawn from these things is that while she is envisioning immediate parenthood as the end of her ambitions and a major life change, he is envisioning a future where everyone is a happy family of the two of them (married) and with at least one child. If you deny my assumption, I understand, but I have trouble imagining that he's asking her to keep this pregnancy so that he can eventually take total custody and be a single father, and that's the root of why I believe he is acting immaturely. He's envisioning that she will have this child and that, suddenly, all other parts of life for her will lose meaning, and nothing other than being a happy family will matter any more. While that's possible (I suppose) it seems exceedingly unlikely. People being people, I find it more likely that, if she were to keep the pregnancy, there would always be doubt about that decision and longing for the life/career/satisfaction that she sees herself obtaining if she continues down her current path. Doubt and longing lead to resentment, and resentment does not a happy relationship make. I suppose it's possible that my assumptions are dead wrong, but people are rarely as complex as they think they are, and the alternatives are pretty unlikely unless some pretty complex stuff is going on for one, or the other, or both of them, mentally. My point is that he's not thinking through the implications of the decision, or even past the emotional weight of the decision, and, given the consequences, that's not very mature.

As far as the internet kudos part, is it really that out of line to give someone credit for doing the right thing? It's a sad world that only derides people who do wrong, and never congratulates people for being good, or noble, or even just considerate. Besides, can it really hurt at all? It is a discussion that both parties to the pregnancy should have, I agree with you, but there seems to be a way of thinking that says that once the woman is pregnant, the decision is entirely up to her as to whether or not to keep it, and that the man should step up if decides to do so, regardless of his feelings. I'm NOT saying that a man should be able to make a woman terminate a pregnancy. I AM saying that it's a complex issue that deserves the opinions of both parties. Frankly, if I can help someone else arrive at the conclusion that they shouldn't approach that decision without consulting their SO (assuming a healthy relationship) by giving a pat on the back with a few keystrokes that travel through the internet, then I am absolutely going to do so. Besides, people in stressful situations need reassurance of what they've done well in order to make good decisions, as well as criticism of what they haven't. The take-away here is that words have impact, and I was trying to have a positive one.

You are obviously free to disagree with me and my opinions and/or my assumptions, but I still don't think it does any good to be bitter or derisive (which is the opposite of what I was aiming for, not what I think you're doing), and I stand by my evaluation of him as being immature. Maturity is about being able to see through the implications of your decisions and the impact they will have on others and the world around you, and being willing to deal with the bad that comes with the good. Immaturity is idealizing a single outcome to the point where no other ones occur to you, and you end up blindsided by problems you should have seen coming a mile away.

Again, that's what my experience has taught me, and, therefore, just my opinion.
