Screw purses and handbags! It's difficult to find women's pants with suitable pockets (this does not include hiking/camping pants, which are awesome and usually blessed with many pockets), but you can usually find capris and shorts with cargo pockets or a hidden zipper-pocket on one of the legs. I usually wear shorts or capris unless it's painfully cold or would be considered inappropriate attire for an event. Since I refuse to carry a purse, this usually means all of my shorts/capris/pants are usually of a sporty variety and have cargo pockets. If it's too cold and I have to wear jeans, then I'm usually wearing a jacket with pockets. 

tl;dr
I don't need no stinkin' purse fer mah wallet an' phone!
