High five for a fellow acting major!  

As an actress graduating (this Saturday!!) from a small college an hour away from her own hometown, I feel like these past four years have just been a time for me to play around and being financially irresponsible! :P  I by no means loved college, in fact, I kind of hated it because everyone I know is such a party animal, and I'm not. Hardly anyone else took their acting education as seriously as I did. I feel like I've just been waiting to blow this town this whole time.  I see college as just a transitional stage into full-blown adulthood.  Sure, it was kind of fun.  But for me, the real fun won't start until I'm auditioning every day.
