Uh who the hell is expecting to be able to buy a bra for someone without them present? My Mom has literally the exact same size, shape and level of bustiness (we have accidentally switched bras on occasion in the laundry) and even she would never try to buy me one without me physically present to try it on. They also make camisoles with built in bras. I dunno this whole thing seems like something where if the dad has taken literally 5 minutes to talk to one of those 18 volunteer women that he could avoided this whole thing. So stupid.
