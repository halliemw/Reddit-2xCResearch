This is not generally helpful advice.  Most people cannot get in to see doctors or specialists right away unless it's an emergency.  In order to speak to your own doctor, you usually have to go through a receptionist and wait awhile.  Moreover, this is a holiday weekend.  Other than emergency workers, doctors are likely to be closed Monday as well as today. 

People who ask for advice online generally aren't going to hear one thing, assume this is fact, and not pursue it further.  But hearing similar cases can be reassuring or give them something else to ask their doctor about, particularly if it's not the doctor's area of expertise.  

Sheesh.
