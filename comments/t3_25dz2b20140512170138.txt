I might just be the queen of horrible situations. Idk if you read my "sex offender registration day at the court" story, which to me is one of the worst but I also was followed home by a bald guy in a red car walking home from high school, approached by an attractive guy while running at the park who I thought seemed nice but tried to cop a feel before we parted ways (rapists aren't always old creepy men they can be attractive college aged guys too) The guy who angrily stalked me in community college because I didn't give him my number, and I still wonder why I don't have a gun, tazer or pepper spray to this day.
