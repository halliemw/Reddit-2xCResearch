I'm a very private person and didn't really want to tell people what was happening when I went through this, either. I, too, didn't think they would be upset with me, but I didn't want to make anyone sad or worried on my behalf. 

At the same time, even though I had my boyfreind, I remember feeling kind of lonely during my experience as well. I live in a state with tons of hoops and waiting periods and I just wanted to update someone with every mundane detail like "I got this filled out today. I scheduled that today. Morning sickness sucks! It is almost over."

No two people have the same abortion experience, but for what it's worth, all I felt after it was over was relief. A huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I saw my situation as more of a bookmarkor pause. I wanted to have that child someday, and I still can, when I'm in a healthy safe palce to do so.
