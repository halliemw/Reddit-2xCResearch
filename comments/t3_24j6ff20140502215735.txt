Thanks for sharing this. I have invested significantly more into my education than my fianc√© has his, and make more money than he does. We have talked about future plans of scaling back his work when we have kids and keeping me working full time since it makes so much more sense financially. I have still worried that I might experience a lot of guilt I see in my female coworkers with kids, but reading that you're so happy with the situation is welcome positive feedback.

As others have said, gold star sticker to your husband for making concessions for your career and your family. I understand how much it means!
