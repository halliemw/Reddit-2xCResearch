Actually, women are capable of giving useful advice.  And the fisherman/fish analogy is indeed reducing things to predator/prey relationships.  

"Sex is one of the end goals of dating" is an amusingly linear way of looking at the subject (and precisely why someone drew those diagrams).  It's interesting that many of us end up romantically and sexually involved with people who did not have that as a conscious end goal.  The element of surprise and discovery, within an existing friendship, can be quite nice.

But comparing dating/courtship to baiting a line and reeling people in, I find that really off-putting.
