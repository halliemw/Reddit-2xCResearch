I had cancer a couple years ago and lost all my hair. I'd been growing it back for nearly 3 years when my uni held a shave-awareness event. Took me about a week of debating (BUT IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO HAVE HAIR AGAIN BAAAAW) before I put my name down for the event, but [I'm glad I did](http://i.imgur.com/TgTn7FJ.jpg). 

The event was an example of awareness done right, people getting the shave were encouraged to share their stories and it got a lot of people thinking about the need for cancer research and where that money is going.

I went through a lot of the same things as you as well, this time around. Sometimes I have days when I feel very unfeminine...weirdly this didn't really crop up when I was ill but when you have a certain level of bullshit in your life, some things just end up falling off the radar and in my case it was caring for my appearance.

Also hair donation is even more awesome. Appearance wasn't that important for me, but for other ladies (and men!) I met whilst I was in hospital, looking just a little nice made an absolutely huge impact in their overall wellbeing. I hope to donate mine in a couple more years to carry on giving back :)
