Good for you! However you shouldn't feel abnormal for not using tampons. I know a few women who don't use tampons ever because they don't like them. One is around 40 (I think) and has several children. It's just a personal preference thing. I used to use only tampons, but lately I've been using pads mostly, and tampons only during a long work shift.
