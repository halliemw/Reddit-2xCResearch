Enforcing a dress code does not have to include slut-shaming and body shaming. I understand that it's not uncommon for dress codes to be written and enforced that way, but that doesn't mean that dress codes are bad and we shouldn't have them. Instead, the focus should be on professionalism and dressing appropriately for where you are. It should be unisex and practical and in my opinion it should be at about the level of many entry-level or minimum wage jobs, since the goal of school should be to prepare students for the working world. 

So to me, that means that it's ok for a school to say that holes in your jeans and micro mini skirts and workout clothes and crop tops are not appropriate for this setting. It should not be stated as too sexy or too distracting for other students, just as too unprofessional for a school environment. It is important to learn how to dress appropriately for a situation if you're going to thrive in modern society and especially the modern workforce, so I don't have a problem with having a dress code or, better yet, uniforms. I do have a problem with how they're often enforced in a slut-shaming way.
