> When you react harshly to strangers who've not done anything to you, it's like you're stereotyping humanity as a whole. 

While I agree with the sentiment of not being rude to strangers, including those who non-aggressively panhandle, I think this guy definitely crossed a line. You shouldn't go up to a parked car with a woman alone in a dark parking lot and knock on her window unless you have a pretty compelling reason to do so. Asking someone for spare change isn't one of them. I've had this happen before, and even though the guy wasn't even all that sketchy looking, it scared the shit out of me and put me on the defensive.
