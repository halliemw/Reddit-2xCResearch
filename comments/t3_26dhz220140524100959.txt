Oh man. This exact situation happened to me, just like you described. Except he then unblocked her, continued to talk to her for several months, and eventually invited her over to our apartment while I was on a work trip. 

My suggestion would be to end it now because the aftermath is filled with self-doubt and doubt about your partner. I know it's easy for me to say that about your relationship because I have the advantage of being outside of the situation. When it happened to be, I felt compelled to give him another chance. My ex seemed truly sorry and willing to change, but in practice was not.

Edit: My best advice would be to consider why you wanted to snoop through his facebook chats. In my experience, I've never felt the urge to snoop unless something else felt ''off'' in the relationship. Just something to consider.
