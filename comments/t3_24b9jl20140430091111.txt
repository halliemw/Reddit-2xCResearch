Yeah, you know, if they're giving you issues like that, I say it's time to find another method, rather than give up birth control altogether.  =) 

I constantly had severe nausea, headaches, and eventually I developed atypical migraines.  The left side of my face went numb, then it twitched uncontrollably for weeks.  I had strange issues.  I wound up at the neuro who was convinced I was either having mini-strokes or that I had the early stages of MS.  It was terrifying, man.  

Turns out that's what estrogen does in women who are estrogen intolerant.  I'm at a very high risk for stroke if I take estrogens, or if I eat lots of soy.  Immediately got told to stop taking those pills and I got switched to the mini-pill, progesterone-only kind.

Night & day.  No more headaches, very minimal nausea, no more issues at all.  Migraines disappeared pretty much within 2 weeks, as expected.  

And yep, I did have different side effects from different pills.  It's been like, gosh, about 15 years since the first pills I got prescribed (which landed me in the urgent care clinic, I was so sick) but it was generally just awful altogether.  None of them but Micronor (minipill) and the depo provera shot have ever been good for me.

Depo isn't for everyone, but for me it was a life saving medication.  I had been bleeding for weeks and weeks, no sign of stopping, and I have really bad PMDD.  Depo about stopped the bleeding overnight, and I spotted for a few weeks (which is normal).  Then nothing for as long as I was on the shot.  I didn't gain weight, I didn't have any negative issues.  It was a dream, and *no period* to make me writhe in pain.  =) 

Hopefully this helps, and seriously, ask away!  I truly believe nobody should have to suffer through this stuff.  There's a solution for everything and you deserve to feel good!
