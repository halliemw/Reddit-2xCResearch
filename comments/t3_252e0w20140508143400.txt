I haven't read the books or watched the show but it is disturbing to me when there is a sexual assault scene in something I am watching or reading. Typically I will not even want to watch it. For me personally it is not a "trigger" thing but just the fact that it is so horrible to watch, I don't see how anyone can be okay with it. I know they're just acting but even so, how do you derive pleasure (and why watch a show if not for some sort of pleasure) from seeing it. I also don't like watching Holocaust movies or movies about slavery for the same reason. Yes, it really happened, but I already know that and I don't need to live through it vicariously. It's too upsetting and there are many other plot devices that can be used. I think a lot of men like Martin don't realize how much more upsetting these scenes are to women. When it's a regular thing for women to be threatened with rape or told that women who are raped deserve it etc. it's really not something we want to see. It's certainly his choice to write about it but I wish more men would understand why many women aren't okay with it.
