I think you and I must have differently shaped vulvas. I have a little too much skin there for it ever to be pulled completely taut. Besides, I routinely *do* nick the naturally taut skin over my ankle bones - I'm clumsy.

I guess I'll just be thankful that I have older parents. *I* may be of a generation where shaping of one's pubic topiary is expected, but they were downright *horrified* after demanding that I explain to them what a landing strip is. It put things in perspective. Plus, in terms of my desire to be attractive to members of the gender to which I am attractive, I was an early bloomer, and I received a lot of innocent love notes in summer camp praising the 1-2 hairs peeking out of the crotch of my bathing suit.
