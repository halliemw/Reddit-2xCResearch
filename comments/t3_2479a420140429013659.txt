> It shows that the person raising this as a counter point is not versed with the issue at hand. I read a lot of feminist writing and rarely, if ever, have I seen anything saying that every single man on earth is a certain way. That, simply speaking, is not the issue feminists are attempting to address.

It's so tough to find feminists spouting hate speech.

* “I feel that ‘man-hating’ is an honourable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.”  – Robin Morgan, Ms. Magazine Editor

* “To call a man an animal is to flatter him; he’s a machine, a walking dildo.”  -– Valerie Solanas

* “I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig.” — Andrea Dworkin

* “The more famous and powerful I get the more power I have to hurt men.” — Sharon Stone

* “In a patriarchal society, all heterosexual intercourse is rape because women, as a group, are not strong enough to give meaningful consent.” — Catherine MacKinnon

* “The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race.” — Sally Miller Gearhart

* “Men who are unjustly accused of rape can sometimes gain from the experience.” – Catherine Comins

* “All men are rapists and that’s all they are” — Marilyn French

* “Probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison, except for the imminent threat of release.” — Germaine Greer.

Clearly we can conclude that *all feminists* are evil, man hating misandrists.

If you claim "not all feminists are like that" then you're just derailing!
