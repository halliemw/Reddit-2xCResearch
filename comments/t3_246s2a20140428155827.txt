You're not the first person to point it out. The author actually responded to a post [here](http://lalond.es/post/80606276098/but-we-really-do-need-to-talk-about-it) that brought up that point. 

I don't necessarily agree that it's denigrating or even saying anything about women who couldn't/can't fight back - the author is saying that the movie just says that it is okay to do so, and that trying to protect yourself isn't wrong. That's a message that doesn't get a lot of airtime or is, worse, contradicted. Every time a girl is told, "Don't you think you were overreacting when you pushed him away? He was just being friendly. You should feel flattered," I die a little inside.

I get that sometimes women aren't in a position to fight back, that doing so would result in greater consequences, or that they're physically incapable of doing so. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't be encouraging of the women who can.

*edit: A word.
