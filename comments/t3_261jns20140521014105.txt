The relationship with my husband and her mother is a really good one! Just her stepdad... He's controlling to the point of it being abusive and me and my husband are scared that it will scar them and make them have a wrong image about how a relationship should look like....

My husband really can't stand it sometimes, but I try not to worry about it, thinking it is something not in my power to change, so I'd better do my best to make sure they have a safe and loving haven with us!

Thanks for the advice!
