Maybe I'm just weird, but an excel spreadsheet / google spread sheet could be kind of convenient. Think of all the statistics and graphs you could do on it!

Most period trackers I know of just do averages.

You'll probably still notice changes in your period even as long as over the next decade. Could get better, could get worse. You've probably read about things that can make cramps better/worse. Drink a lot of water. Take ibuprofen as necessary.
