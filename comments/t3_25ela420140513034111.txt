Breastfeeding your child is a human right.  Breast milk is so much better for baby's health than formula that even having this discussion feels aberrant to me.  Of course it is good to feed your baby the best food. Whenever.  Wherever.  To compare nursing a child to someone shitting, pissing, or fucking publicly, like some in this conversation have done is a sad statement of how messed up our society has become.
