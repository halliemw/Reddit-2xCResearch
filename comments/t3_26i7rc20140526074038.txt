This phrasing by the administrator does not suggest "one or two", but a more widespread issue:

"We've received quite a few reports about users who have claimed to have received a large amount of harassment, but when we investigate we find that they've often never received any PMs at all, or only one message when they claim to have received many. Some people have even gone so far as creating alts to PM themselves with, so that they can take screenshots for "proof"."

Of course, still a tiny minority in a big and diverse subreddit like this, so we basically agree!
