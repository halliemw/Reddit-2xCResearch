You are not responsible for maintaining your Mom's illusions about the family. There are no perfect families, and the really strong ones get there by dealing, not burying, problems. You are responsible for protecting and making your life as functional as you can; your Mom is well meaning, but wrong, and you cant let her mistakes become yours.

 Best of luck on the roomate hunt!!
