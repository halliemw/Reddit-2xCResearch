(can you tell I got back to a computer by how my replies have lengthened? been out in the field all day.)

Here I actively disagree with you. That skillset of learning to actively participate on what may not be your own home turf is a valuable one, and one that women are forced to learn in many, many arenas - the internet often being one of them. 

Obviously, the more ways in which a given individual finds that they are other-than-default the more they have to do this (I myself am rather privileged as far as this goes, which makes my position as "other" quite unwelcome and incredibly stark when it occurs; believe me, it does) and not all men will find it a completely alien experience. I think it's a bit insulting to assume that men as a group are unable or unwilling to learn or otherwise should be exempt from learning that skillset. 

I also consider it to be a quite valuable to the point that anyone needing an environment to be made specifically tailored to welcome them in order for them to participate at all is lacking a key requirement of maturity.
