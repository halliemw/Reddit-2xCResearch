For periods, you get enough of them to get used to it, although they were definitely weird and embarrassing and confusing when you first got them. Most of the time you don't really think about it, unless every now and then you're like "aha! so thats why I was so horny, I was ovulating!" or "aha! I'm not fat, I'm just bloated from my impending period!"

**Preparation for your period** is kind of an inconvenience: you have to remember to save your black underwear for period week, and to make sure you have extra supplies in your car, your purse, your drawer at work, your boyfriend's house, etc. In those risky days leading up to it, you may plan your wardrobe around things that won't show blood in case The Worst happens.

**Physical feeling of having period** During your period, you often don't feel it, unless it all comes out in a gush. Which make happen when you giggle, cough, sneeze, or stand up too quickly. If you've ever had lube or semen trickle out of your vagina it feels essentially like that. If you don't have a vagina, it feels like an all-of-a-sudden trickle of warm wetness. You don't feel it inside your vagina, just around the vulva.

**Bathroom business** It can take *forever* to wipe yourself clean on the toilet, which is why we sometimes go through so much toilet paper around that time (also to wrap up used products). I feel unclean more quickly around my period - while I might sometimes skip a shower day I normally won't on my period.

**Cramps** for me are weird. Normally I'm like, "really they aren't that bad." And then when I actually have them I think "how did I forget how much this hurts? Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck." And then it passes shortly afterwards and I forget about them entirely. I feel cramps around my lower back and general uterus area. It feels like a metal fist gripping something inside me - not really squeezing or wrenching, just gripping very firmly.

**Boob soreness** is another common symptom. If you're a trans woman, I believe this is a common side effect of HRT. Your breasts feel really full and heavy, and it can be painful to have them lifted or jiggled, but I don't find squeezing problematic.

**Mood swings:** I can be more irritable on my period. I like to think of it like a catalyzed reaction diagram. The energy of activation needed for me to react to something that bothers me is lowered in the days before my period. So I'm not going to be bothered by things that wouldn't otherwise bother me, but I might be more likely to say something about it.

**Ovulation** time is awesome. I feel pretty and confident and I am all over my boyfriend.
