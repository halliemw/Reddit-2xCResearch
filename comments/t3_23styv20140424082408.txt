Yes, that's something I don't understand as well.  I grew up in a football-heavy household and always new that the cheerleaders were essentially volunteers as they were poorly compensated.  And I would think they know what they are getting into as they most definitely have to sign a contract.  However, I would not be opposed to cheerleaders getting a greater portion of the revenue they generate through things such as calenders and public appearances.
