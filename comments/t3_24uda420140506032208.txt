To stay in an abusive relationship and choose an abuser in the first place you must have had what I call a broken good people radar. (which boils down to lack of self esteem and self -love).

It's not a surprise that at that point you also chose friends who were not really good people either :/ 

Abuse was never your fault and I am really happy for you that you managed to disentangle yourself from this crap. Maybe now it's time to cut some 'friends' out of your life.
