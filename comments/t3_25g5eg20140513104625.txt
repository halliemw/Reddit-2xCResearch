I got mine put in in march at PP. So far I've only had one (very light) period, and no changes in acne, weight, mood etc. I was on the pill before this. It's working great for me so far, but if you've had yours for a year and are experiencing all those terrible side effects, you should try something else. I think a year is long enough to try to adjust, especially if it only lasts for 3 years.
