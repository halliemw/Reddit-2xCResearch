When I was eighteen my then girlfriend and I had an accident or whatever and she asked if I could go to the pharmacy and buy plan b and I did. The women at the pharmacy looked at me like I was a monster, it was awful. Granted I do live in a highly conservative town but sheesh. I feel your feels even though its probably worse for a woman.
