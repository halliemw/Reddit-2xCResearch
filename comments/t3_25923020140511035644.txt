I have really heavy hair growth on my arms, like, heavier than a lot of men. Apparently when I was younger, people at the hospital asked my mom if my dad was foreign (I'm Dutch, and so is he). I've tried to shave occasionally, but it's just such a hassle, and half the time, I'd end up cutting myself. Now I've decided to just accept it. Mine isn't jet black, more brownish. Come to think of it, I wonder what happens if you try to dye it blonde, or if that messes up the skin. Has anyone tried that?
