Pharmacist here! If you were local, I'd tell you come down to my pharmacy and I'd help you out! Definitely sounds like thrush because of 1) the consistency of the discharge - could you say it was a bit like cottage cheese? 2) the itch and 3) the absence of odour. Nothing a little Canesten can't clear up! There's a few different types of products, they have pros and cons and I won't delve into them unless you really want to know. I'd probably recommend the once off tablet and cream to use on the outside to help the itch. Should clear up in approx 3 days.

It's very common, I know in Australia we treat it over the counter so you don't necessarily have to see your doctor unless there's anything else that's concerning or you have other medical conditions/take other meds that might interact, or if this has happened many times. I would advise you use only warm water to wash (no soap!) and do not rub profusely. Sometimes cleaning *too* much can make things worse (or cleaning too little). I would advise not to use anything else. Less is better I say!

If by day 3 you see no improvement then you're gonna have to see the doctor.. nothing wrong with being a woman :)

Shoot me up a PM if you need any help!
