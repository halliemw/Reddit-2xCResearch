I, too, grew up watching Disney. At two, I would sit for hours and watch The Little Mermaid over, and over, and over again. Sometimes only part of it if there was a scene I liked...my parents didn't tell me about the fast forward button on the VCR but instead let me think I had to watch from the beginning to see the scene I wanted.

But the thing that I was obsessed with was not the romance, it was these princess' drive to be independent. I LOVED how they took charge, did what had to be done, fought their demons (Ursula, Jafar, etc.), and accepted what help their friends could give them along the way. The romance was just a little bonus at the end. A byproduct of being independent. 

Perhaps you just need to shift your perspective a little? Yeah, all of the princess movies resulted in finding a man and having a castle and status conferred on them, but it was always after trials and tribulations, hard work, seeming hopelessness, or an attempt to become autonomous humans. The romance and the castle was the reward, not the gift. Work hard, never back down, and good things will come is kind of what I always took away from those movies.
