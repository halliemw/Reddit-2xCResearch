I messed up finding a place on the Australian version of Craigslist, so here's what I learned: 

* Meet ALL the roommates first. There will be a few signs of crazy evident. I was silly enough to agree to the place without meeting one of them, and when I met him, I was gone three hours later. 

* Ask what their policies on drugs and smoking are. I messed this one up as well. Get it in writing if you can, making it easier to leave if they don't stick to the agreement. 

* See if there are any student-specific housing websites. I looked at a few where I'd be living with an older couple etc, or with a single-parent family with a college aged daughter where the parent travels. In the end, I couldn't take them, because they weren't comfortable with my boyfriend visiting occasionally, but if I had been single, or only there for a couple of months, it would have been really good. 

* Red flags: how well maintained does the house look? If it's dirty/falling apart, they definitely have a landlord that doesn't care, and they don't care. Messy is ok, but dirty can be a red flag. 

* Are they doing things by the book? Not sure about the US, but in Australia, there's a stack of paperwork that needs to be done. If it's not happening, that's also a red flag. 

* Finally, see if you can put off signing the lease till you've been staying a few days. If there is a problem, you can get out of there. You'll then be stuck for accommodation, but at least you're not locked in. 

Good luck :)
