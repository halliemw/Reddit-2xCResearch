No, puberty is just weird like that. Exact same thing happened to my little sister, where she was pretty flat-chested one summer and by the next spring I think she was bigger than me. I'm 5 years older, for perspective.

Myself, I took FOREVER to grow in the general boob area. But I guess it evens out, because I went into grade 5 with suddenly massive feet for my height. It's just the way these things go sometimes.

Edit: repeateded myself
