I love Modcloth and Pinupclothing.com. If you are looking for cheaper I hear DressLink is awesome. Most of their stuff only goes up to a US size 16 though. And for shoes Solestruck. A coworker turned me onto that site. It's pure evil. I have never ordered from starletsandharlets.com or unique-vintage.com but my friends have. I'm a bit more alternative in my style though. eshakti.com/ has some great stuff and you can customize the clothing to your measurements which I love. Also you can customize a lot of the hem lengths, sleeve types, and even necklines.
