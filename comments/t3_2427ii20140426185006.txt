first of all, it's okay if he's too small for you. it doesn't mean you're a horrible person. i mean, if he was too big for you and caused you pain every time you had sex, that would be a legitimate reason to break up with him. sex is an important part of a relationship. you shouldn't be shamed for this, nor should you feel ashamed.

anyway, if you do some research, there are certain positions you can try to make sex more pleasurable. you could suggest cock rings, sleeves, dildos, other toys. plus, sex doesn't have to be all about PIV!
