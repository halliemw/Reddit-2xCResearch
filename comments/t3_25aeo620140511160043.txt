I'd say this isn't a gender issue, it's a cultural issue. I have experience a lot of "play-harassment", like joke robbing, from people of middle eastern ethnicity. Both men and women. They have many good qualities but can come off quite threatening. Don't play into their shit in any way whatsoever. Don't answer joke questions and don't flee/avoid them. Perhaps just call them out on it, like "why are you being rude to me?". But again don't start anything, any response is just their win.
