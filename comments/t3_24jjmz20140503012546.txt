> without announcing who someone is before all the evidence is in? I don't think advocating for investigating crime requires attacking the rights of the accused.

First, the school has to announce that an attack took place. They don't reveal the names of the victim or accused rapist. 

Second, in most cases of rape on campus, the accused rapist shares a dorm and/or classes with the victim. This means that the accused rapist has to be removed from those places for the safety of the victim. Which means that people notice something is up. Administrators don't *announce* who the accused is, but it's not hard to figure out, especially if people start talking. However, I can't see any way around that without hurting the victim and forcing them out of their dorm/their classes.
