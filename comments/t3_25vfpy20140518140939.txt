According to the Roman Catholic Church, IVF is considered morally illicit, i.e. sinful. They believe it goes against the dignity of human life, and is definitely not acceptable in any way. There's a lengthy amount of reasoning behind it that relates to Catholic stance on the "Theology of the Body", I used to be a copy editor and edited a paper written by a Catholic professor on the topic. Objectively I actually found it pretty interesting to read about IVF from that perspective. I don't know about other branches of Christianity.
