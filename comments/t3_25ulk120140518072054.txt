Your wife needs to be assessed by a postpartum specialist NOW. Do whatever it takes to find someone; ask at the hospital where your daughter was born, search online, ask every OB-Gyn you can find. But get her treatment now. This is not optional.

Her hormones may be completely out of whack, and that can literally make people crazy. I have worked with women who had postpartum depression and even postpartum psychosis, and an imbalance with brain chemistry is absolutely the cause. 

She needs medication and therapy, and you should be able to participate in the therapy a few times too.
