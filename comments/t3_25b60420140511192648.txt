The benefits dont expire. Breastmilk contains a ton of nutrients and antibodies and it continues the entire time you nurse. Anthropologically, we are supposed to wean around age 3-7, if you compare us to other animals and primates. As long as its pre-puberty and mutually desired by the child and the mother, there is no harm. There is not a single shred of evidence it harms either the child or the mother. Most people that nurse beyond infancy do it in the privacy of their home, at bed time and nap time.
