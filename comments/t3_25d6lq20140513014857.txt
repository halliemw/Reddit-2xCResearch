No offense but you are being patronizing to "go over her head" and delay the proposal to make some imagined version of her happy with money for a wedding you think she wants when the actual person is right there by your side ready to answer your questions and tell you what kind of wedding she actually wants and not just "what ifs". I've received that kind of "niceness" in the past and it's just annoying and rather dissapointing. Instead of being treated  like an equal and being asked about my opinion, having someone get an idea they can offer what they think I "deserve" or "really deep down want". It's creepily father like.  

People like to daydream, and pinterest is cocaine for it. Do you fantasize about having some fancy car or computer set? But do you NEED that to be happy or is it nice to wonder what if? Would You love a one year tour around the world honeymoon? Oh sure who the fuck wouldn't. But plenty of couples have modest weddings and are extatic. 

Yes many women would love a 50000$ wedding made in a fairy lights orchard wearing a lace one of a kind and eating exquisite food while partying with their friends while a lovely band is playing but.... The same women would also be happy with something realistic. Pinterest is nice cherry on top stuff but for most people it's not necessary (or even realistic). 

Why don't you just talk it out with her. I bet she would preffer if you spend more money on a house/honeymoon than a one day affair
