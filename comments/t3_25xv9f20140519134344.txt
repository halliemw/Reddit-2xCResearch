The article addresses 'harassment' in the form of in-game communication. Kids in COD calling peoples moms whores and stuff. There is next to no possibility of doxxing your opponent in a game.

Would you are to address my first point about the ability to ignore people you don't want to talk to (or in this case, delete their posts)'?
