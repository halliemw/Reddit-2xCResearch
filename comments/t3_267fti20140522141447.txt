> Speaking of feminism: Isn't it a good thing to move emphasis away from looks and toward intelligence and personality?

Sure, but that should be done by changing mindsets. Getting women to cover up suggests causes mindsets to change the other way: that women's bodies are inherently about sex and they need to be hidden so as to prevent men thinking impure thoughts. If you look at a country like Egypt, this is exactly what has happened. I read one article about the groping epidemic there even happening to women in hijabs. When the journalist asked young men about it (men, who of course were dressed in t-shirts and shorts), they said "yeah but some girls wear really tight fitting hijabs so they're asking for it".
