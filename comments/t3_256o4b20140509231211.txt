I had one at 21, never been pregnant and it was fine. Your doctor just has a ridiculous view. Is she old? Try a different doctor. If you still have issues you could try getting it as emergency contraception. I had planned to get one but ended up having to get it as an emergency contraceptive. I'm in the UK tho. I went for the copper type because I had a bad time with anything hormonal. Good luck!
