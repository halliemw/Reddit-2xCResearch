As a women who is not grossed out by blood or her period in the slightest.. This actually made me cringe a little. I was not expecting that and always thought the blue liquid was dumb. I stand corrected.  

I also realized they don't really show blood in bandaid commercials either. Good guy advertising executives know what's up. 


Edit: welp, doubled my comment karma with a quip about period blood. Seems about right.
