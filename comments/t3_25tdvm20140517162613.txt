He has two options. To take full custody of the child (if you offer it up for adoption), or to let the adoption take place. He can't force you to abort. He can't force you to keep the baby either. 

All of that bluster about making your life hell and getting lawyers involved is just bluster. He can't force you to do ANYTHING. For better or worse, this is one of those areas of the law where you pretty much have all of the control. So realize you have all the options and power here, think on it, and make the best decision you can.
