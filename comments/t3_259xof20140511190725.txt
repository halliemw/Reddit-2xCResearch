That does suck :/ It's hard to explain to other people what's going on in your head when you probably can't even really explain it yourself. Emotional stuff can be pretty confusing. Maybe you could find some resources out there for loved ones of people who are suffering from depression and get him to read them?

All the BF & friend quest aside, it sounds like a good place to start would be trying to boost your own self confidence. I don't know if this will help but I saved an awesome post that somebody else here in 2X shared with me.

Good Luck :)
