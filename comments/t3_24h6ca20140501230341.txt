First I picked the pill, because it was simplest. I was very emotional for the first two or three months, but then it evened out. My schedule varies day-to-day, and I didn't like having to take it at the same time (plus, if I missed ONE, I'd immediately get a period). Also, I'm in a long distance relationship, and it sucked having to take a pill everyday when I only "used" it every few weeks. 

After about 6 months on the pill, I got a mirena IUD instead, because it lasts 5 years and I don't have to do a thing. I chose it over the copper one because I heard it makes your periods a lot worse. After the initial pain, there have been no bad side effects that I've noticed.
