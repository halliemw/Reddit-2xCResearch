I'm not sure exactly when the shoe buckle was invented (elementary school Thanksgiving projects would have me believe they were all the rage in the 17th century), but it could be from back in the day when women were dressed by maids/servants and it was just easier to access buckles that are on the outside of the foot than between the feet.*
