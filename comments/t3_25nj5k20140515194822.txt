I used to feel this way about a girl in my friend group for over a year. I really, REALLY didn't care for her at all. Then she became my best friend. Eight years later, she still is :)

If I could give advice, it would be to be patient and open-minded. I think my bestie and I didn't click at first because we are both very strong-willed and neither of us wanted to "make the first move" on a road to friendship. But I couldn't be happier with the way it turned out. 

Whatever you choose to do, I hope you find some balance in this situation.
