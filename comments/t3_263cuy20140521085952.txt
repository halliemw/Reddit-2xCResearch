I highly recommend joining [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/). If you haven't heard of it before the jist is that you join these Meetup groups based on your interests. I joined a hiking group, an outdoor adventure group, and a group for people who have relocated to the area from another state. It's a great way to meet people you already have something in common with. Plus there are groups for EVERYTHING. Knitting, Mom's over 40, Wine lovers, Dining out groups, Movie fans, etc. Check it out. :)
