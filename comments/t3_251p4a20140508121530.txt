I'm pretty sure most sane people will connect the dots.  It's good proactive advice for some people before the fact, but saying it after is like saying "nyaaaa told ya so."  And let's face it, telling someone not to get shitfaced isn't new and groundbreaking information.  People screw up or get forgetful or wind up in bad situations without meaning to.  No one's walking around thinking "leaving my stove on all the time is a great idea!"  And no one is walking around thinking getting hammered is a great idea, but I think a lot of us have overestimated our tolerance or taken medication that screwed with our livers or what have you.  If I got badly hurt every time I made a dumb choice, I'd be terrified to leave my house.  Telling a girl not to get too drunk is like telling her that water is wet.  It's common sense at this point, but we all make mistakes and we shouldn't be brutally punished for them.
