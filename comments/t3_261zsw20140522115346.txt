Men cruising for easy sex tend to shy away from paying $100 to join a dating site.  Craigslist and POF are easier to use and cheaper.  

If a guy is willing to shell out $100 for a membership to a dating website, he is often times serious about what he wants.    

I posted a long essay above so I'll just say this: Match.com worked for me.  2 months of using match, as a guy, and I found my Mrs Right and fully intend to ask her to marry me before the New Year.  Probably around family at christmas time (both families love us and are already hinting at our future...and we have talked about marriage so I know she would say yes)  

Accrued_Interest is right.  I have had deeper conversations with women on Match than any other site I've used.  It was so worth paying for 3 months (and I never used the third month...I just cancelled my account two weeks into my second month since by then I had met Kat and gone on three dates with her)
