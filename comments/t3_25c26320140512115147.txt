Two mildly related stories

First last summer my sister and I realized we would be behind where we needed to be by the end of the summer to pay our tuitions for the fall semester and that earnings it all back in time to pay for spring wouldn't be possible. We were looking for extra jobs and were pretty open about it with our coworkers. A month into this process our boss, having caught wind, and noticing we'd worked there a full year with no pay increase (which to be fair is pretty unusual but we are just interns) gave us both raises. 

Thinking on it sometimes I feel bad. Did I really deserve it? But then I think about all the work we did that summer and all the ways we drastically improved the office. We helped implement a lot of positive changes. And we deserved a little recognition for that. 


Second story, last week my coworker (really my boss but everyone's my boss) gave me a project to do. I started doing it a little differently than she envisioned and she took it personally and got snippy with me. This being the day I got my period and having yet to go through the crying part of my cycle I was close to tears for the rest of the afternoon even though it wasn't a big deal. I was lucky that I could escape to the file room and bury myself in the project but I still had to shove my emotions deep down when another coworker decided to intrude (she meant well but it was entirely unnecessary). Point is sometimes it's really really really hard to keep the tears down and if your boss is a decent human being they'll understand that. Nothing and I mean nothing makes me more angry than people who get angry at others for crying. It's a natural and difficult to control physical reaction. It's like getting mad at someone for bleeding when they get cut
