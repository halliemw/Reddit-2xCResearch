>Honestly, I find it a bit upsetting that some of you are angry that you can't just reap the benefits anymore and will have to work to keep the community supportive. It's like high school cliques all over again.

The fact that you've trivialised so many detailed and thought-out  explanations by so many people in the last day or so and just melted then down into us not liking that it's not our "obscure little club" anymore is gross. Just gross.
