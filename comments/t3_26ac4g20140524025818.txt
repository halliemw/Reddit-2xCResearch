Your point is a very correct one. It's also really problematic when you mush all the states together - some states are WAYY worse at gender pay equality than others. 
But the pay gap still stands within industries and even specific jobs. This is a brief article on the topic (with a fun graph!), but there's plenty more: http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/the-gender-pay-gap-by-industry/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0

Pretty interesting fact that the construction industry has a very small pay gap compared to others.
