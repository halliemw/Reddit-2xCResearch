Well then, keeping these tight rules on what is and is not appropriate won't stop the sexualization. The taboo surrounding women's attire (or, really, attire in general) will only be enforced if children keep learning, "showing skin is bad!" Skin is not an inherently sexual thing, so by abolishing dress code, society can start working towards a more equal society.
