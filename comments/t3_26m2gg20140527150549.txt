While my issues with my mom are probably not as bad as some of these stories... I do empathize. When I was assaulted on NYE at a small party with friends 7 yrs ago, I called my mom... because I felt small and scared and I wanted someone to protect me. My roommate held my hand while I talked to her. I was having trouble breathing but I told her my story. She said something like "oh my" and then "but you weren't actually raped, right?" and then immediately started telling me about her  New Year's. I was astounded. I interrupted a moment later and asked if she was listening to me. She said yes, and did I need something else?
I mean -YES, I needed something else from my mom at that moment in time, but I'm not sure why I went there. She cares about me and we've been friends but the major maternal thing is not really there. And in issues with other family, she's never been able to manage the big things... while she's good at little stuff, weddings/funerals and an attack on her daughter - she can't do. I figure it's a defense mechanism, but it broke our relationship in a big way. Here's the thing - you can pick people to be "family"... Some time after this, working on a play with some themes of violence on women - this stuff came up, I broke down and an older actress (close to my mom's age) said every damn thing I wanted to hear from my mom. She was angry, and puffed up like an angry lion (albeit 5ft2) and hugged me. She was so mad someone had hurt her friend. And I basically adopted her as my aunt... I realized that that was what I needed someone to do for me and there it was, the fact that I had that person in my life was the important part. I choose my interactions with my mom carefully now, and I choose other supports for the big stuff. It's okay to look elsewhere for the things you need.
