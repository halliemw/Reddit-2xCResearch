As long as I've had a job, it's been ma'am... So 15, I'd say.

This topic has come up before, and the miss vs ma'am distinction has different connotations in different parts of the country. Here in the south, "miss" sounds very childish and I would be insulted to be called "miss" at my age (26). But others, mainly up north, have said that "ma'am" is too matronly and would prefer miss.
