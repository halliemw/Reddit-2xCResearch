It took me YEARS to totally trust it.  I was put on birth control at 14 to deal with some serious menstruation issues.  12 years later and I've been through tons of different types - patch, ring, pill, 3 month pill, etc.  I'm on an IUD now.

I think I was in college when I finally felt no anxiety each month.  And the IUD?  I hardly even think about it.
