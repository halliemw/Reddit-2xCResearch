hmm that makes sense. Thanks for all the information! It was really helpful! I'll make sure I keep up taking my probiotics. I just thought it was strange that the doctor said everything was perfectly fine, even though the results showed the shift in bacteria. I guess I'll just keep keeping an eye on it.
