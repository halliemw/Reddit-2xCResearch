> teach her to be firm and say NO

This should start much younger, in my opinion. Learning how to stand up for yourself in any situation is important. They actually started teaching us how to say no in an uncomfortable/upsetting situation in preschool and kindergarten. Saved my butt when I was 9 and being harassed at a bus stop by a guy in his 40's or so.

Say some kid (doesn't have to be a boy, but for the sake of a sexism example, we'll say it is) grabs a block from her and says he'll take over because girls don't build. She should already be able to say "NO!" and get that block back. (Same thing if a girl takes it and says that girls don't build and that she should only ever play with dolls.)
