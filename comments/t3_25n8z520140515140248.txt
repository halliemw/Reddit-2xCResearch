maybe this won't be super helpful input, but here goes- this woman is a control freak, and she has apparently taken a dislike to you. i would hazard a guess that she's also difficult to worth with/for, as the "nice" instructor from your story has left her clinic/school. so, that said, you can grow a thicker skin and deal with her rude ways, or you can stop going. if you stop going, are these the sorts of things you can practice at home with dvds? i sorta imagine there's some specialized equipment that's needed, so idk how well that would work. if you would rather stay there, and it sounds like you would, i would talk with some of the other students after class, off-site, and see if they also feel bullied and if they notice how she's treating you and how that makes them feel. and then once you've sussed that out, go to the instructor. say "this is how i feel things have been going. i'd like to know why they are happening and how we can change it. if nothing changes, i'm no longer interested in paying you and attending your classes. (also, btw, you ARE a customer, you are paying her for a service)" and then if you do end up leaving, i would probably leave a politely worded review on yelp or something like that, so that others don't have to deal with her crap. just be very careful how you write it up, there've been cases where people get sued for libel for reviews they wrote.
