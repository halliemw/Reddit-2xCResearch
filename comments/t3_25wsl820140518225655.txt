Same thing happened to me about a month ago. I had brown discharge that stained my underwear. Nothing was different but the color. It went on for a couple days before I realized I should get it checked out. Made and appointment with my gyno and turns out it was a mild yeast infection. Got some meds and it cleared up in a couple days. That would be my best guess as to what it is. I made this account just because I wanted to try and help you out! I was freaked too and google did not help. I would definitely get in to see your doctor still, of course, everyone is different!
