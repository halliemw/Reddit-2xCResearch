She probably doesn't realize it bothers you, honestly. I had my boyfriend around too much, thinking it was all cool because he was also friends with my roomates, and he had some issues with living arrangements and was in-between places. They said something, finally, and I had him leave. He moved in with his parents for a minute then found his own place. I honestly wasn't even thinking about it and them saying something embarrassed me and he left right away. 

So from "her" perspective, just be nice about it. I was probably just subconsciously waiting until they said something because I felt bad for my boyfriend and like him around. I knew it was reasonable for them to want him gone, even though they like him.
