I've made most of my friends from dorming, the equestrian team (club sport), classes, and the jobs I've had on campus. I'm a pretty busy person so the only club I have had time to commit to is the riding team but if I could I would join more. We have an outdoors club at my school which goes on hiking and camping trips. If that's something you're into, maybe you should see if your school has a club like that
