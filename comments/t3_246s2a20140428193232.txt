I haven't seen the movie either, but teaching to fight back is still a new thing for me in some ways.  I was a teenager in the '90s, and any training I remember on rape was "don't fight, don't cause problems, attempt to memorize his face, be compliant."  Everything that I remember learning from "official" sources was wrapped around not fighting back and simply being a good witness to your own victimization.  This has always horrified me...it seems to perpetuate the whole environment that says "well, you didn't say no, so it wasn't rape."  It encourages ambiguity for those who don't think much of anything is rape.  I absolutely believe rape can happen without any sort of fight or even a vocalization of dissent.  But I think it's important to give girls as many tools as possible to make the situation unarguable if they have any opportunity to do so.  Even if it's small, it's one more tiny defense against the idiots who will claim it was somehow the girl's fault.
