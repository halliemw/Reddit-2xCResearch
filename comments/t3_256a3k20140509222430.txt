I thought about this at length last time I had my period. I resent most tampon commercials because they show people being happy and doing shit, and that is just so far from my reality. I'd love a tampon commercial that didn't try to sell me fun and happiness, but normalcy. That's all I want. Clean, quiet, normalcy. I don't need to ride horses and go swimming. I'm usually chained to the couch for a while with terrible indigestion and a hot water bottle. I just want to be able to go to the store or to a restaurant. It's like they're trying to sell me a silk ballgown (those damn pearly applicators and chic boxes) or a pile of sports equipment, when what I want to buy is a comfy pair of jeans that make my butt look cute. Does that make sense? It might not be funny as a commercial, but those are the tampons I would buy.
