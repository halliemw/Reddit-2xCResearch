What disappoints me the most is how little coverage this has been getting in the Irish press. Apparently it was one of the front headlines in Poland. If the church was willing to commit such atrocities (enslavement, rape, murder) against their most loyal followers, you can only imagine what crimes they've perpetrated elsewhere.
