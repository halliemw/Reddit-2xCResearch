It's not about how hard our job is.  

It is about making an informed decision.  We intend to make an informed choice about whether to stay in the defaults based assessing the long-term changes  that being a default subreddit will bring.  

We can't make an informed decision about that impact if there are brigades from inside and out of the subreddit *deliberately trying to throw off our baseline*  by singling /r/twoxchromosomes for vote brigading, trolling and sexist comments.
