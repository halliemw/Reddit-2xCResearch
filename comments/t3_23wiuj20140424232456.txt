I used to work in a mostly male office and luckily I didn't have to deal with offensive jokes or anything like that, but I did get the impression they expected me to keep the kitchen tidy. And they'd always ask things like "where are the coffee cups?" "do we have any more paper towels?" I don't know! I'm not the office manager.
