I wore mine a bit too high when I first got it, and it would sometimes leak. It doesn't sit at the entrance to your vagina to the point where it's coming out, but it basically sits low enough I can feel the stem sometimes when I wipe after peeing. 

It takes a little practice, but worth it once you know what works best with your body.
