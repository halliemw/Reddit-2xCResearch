I started taking generic wellbutrin xr 150mg a little over a month ago, and the first four or five days I felt pretty twitchy and jittery and could hardly sleep at night. After about five days though, my body began to adjust, and after a week all those side effects were completely gone. A week ago, my doctor raised the dose up to 300mg/day and the same thing happened, except even worse. But now I'm adjusting and am sleeping a lot better. I'd say just give it time and you'll more than likely adjust. Good luck, I hope it works out for you!
