I think that acknowledging the problem would be a good start. Medias are still denying that extreme misogyny motivates crimes against women, even with a clear manifesto pretty much stating it literally. A lot of men feel that they're being put into the same basket and they immediately go for "not all men", and they're not wrong. But that doesn't help anything, because it usually stops there. "I'm not doing it, therefore I am not part of the problem, and do not have to change anything."

The only way we're going to lessen misogyny - and all types of discrimimation - is by becoming aware of the subtle forms it takes place as, the words like "pussy", the unsollicited opinions, the "nice guys", recognizing and admitting, *even if just to themselves*, that it's part of the problem. I sincerely believe that most men out there genuinely don't mean harm, psychological or physical, to women, and that they don't realize when they do it.

But when we tell them, we're overeacting crazy bitches. The change needs to come from within, because usually, they're not listening to our side. Feminism is, apparently, a dirty word.
