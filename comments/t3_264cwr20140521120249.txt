What would you say to your best friend if she asked you this question? 

That is the advice that you should follow. I think just by posting here, you know that this isn't right. I know its hard, but get out now. I went through something similar, and somebody told me that. I wish I would have listened, but instead found myself stuck in a horrible relationship for 3.5 years. This man would also make jokes about other girls, and tell me too much about past sexual encounters. He would also point out how hot other girls were and tell me how I'm not a real woman because I didn't do certain things. It really hurt me and my self esteem. I didn't feel good enough for anybody. Thats probably why I stayed so long. I just kept trying to please him. 

But in all of it- I still trusted him completely, we lived together, and I thought he would never cheat on me. 

How did I finally get myself out of that relationship? I caught him CHEATING. In fact, he had been cheating on me the whole time. Looking back, I can't believe I trusted him so much after all the signs. 

Basically- Does he make you feel better about yourself when you're with him? If not- GET OUT!
