I think the debate is based on the people who wear the ones that are so thin or so far from the correct size that they're stretched so thin that you can see the details of their underwear or lack thereof. I've seen them thin enough that I could see the outline of a birthmark on one girl's butt, which made for a very awkward escalator ride since my face was at butt level. It wasn't exactly appropriate for the situation. 

I don't think the debate should be "Are leggings/yoga pants pants?" I've been known to wear them as pants, so I'm not really opposed to that use in general. At the same time, please make sure people can't see right through your leggings and yoga pants when you're in public. If I can see through your clothes in ways you don't seem to have intended, it's probably not appropriate for class or work or really anywhere public where bare butts aren't appropriate.
