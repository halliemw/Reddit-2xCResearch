I just had mine replaced last week! I was worried about it but it was way less painful and much quicker. It still hurt and there was some cramping, but not like the first time. I also didn't have days of painful cramping like last time. Your experience could be totally different than mine though. I think part of the improved experience might be due to a more skilled doctor and maybe it being a more common procedure than it was 5 years ago.
