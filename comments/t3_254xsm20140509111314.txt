I definitely value bonding over gross stories and other unpleasant experiences related to being a woman, and wouldn't want to deny anybody that. I guess I've just personally found the joke to be old. Maybe it's more about when I'm logging in and whether i am glancing at my front page versus coming directly to 2X. But if it's just me, that's ok. Wondered if anybody else felt the same way.
