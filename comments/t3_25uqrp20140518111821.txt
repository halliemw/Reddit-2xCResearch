You aren't homeless.  If that is your house as far as paperwork, bills, and license - he can't just kick you out.  You would have to be evicted by him and that takes a while. 

He won't talk because he was put on the spot and doesn't know how to react.  Not your fault at all, but that is it.  You may need to give him a few days to process things before he talks.

Good luck.  It WILL work out, it just may take time.
