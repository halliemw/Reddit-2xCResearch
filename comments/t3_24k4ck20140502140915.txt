I don't know that I would necessarily classify this as gender discrimination rather than just 'discrimination'.  I've worked at quite a few jobs where the manager of the department just didn't want to let someone do something even though that person was experienced enough because the manager just didn't really like the person, or undervalued that persons' experience.  Out of the times I've seen this happen the majority of time both the manager and the employee were men (I work in a male dominated field though).

So, I'm not necessarily saying you're not being discriminated by gender, but I am saying it's possible you aren't.  Regarding your 'how do I address this', assuming you're already doing a great job and holding yourself up to the same standard your manager is and the job is still going nowhere then yes, your main recourse is to simply find another job.  I've done this quite a few times myself.  A lot of fields the only way to 'move up' is to switch companies unless you happen to get lucky and work for a really really good company. For whatever reason a lot of companies hate to move their own employees upwards.
