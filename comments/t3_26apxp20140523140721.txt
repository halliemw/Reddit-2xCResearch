Well it's hard because it's the workplace, and personally I find sticking my neck out is a thankless and usually uncomfortable task, but good on you for trying.  Pointing out how mean they are might make them turn on you.  

That being said, remaining professional should be some sort of shield.  Maybe asking "What does that have to do with her performance?" "So should I be judging your work on your eyebrows?" or simply "That seems very superficial."  

You could be funny about it. "What do you guys care about her eyebrows, you want to date her or something?"

Or like with children you could try redirecting the conversation.  You could try turning it into a gender debate "Would I be considered sexist if I were judging her appearance like you are all doing now?"  or "Isn't there something more interesting to talk about than so-and-so's eyebrows?"
