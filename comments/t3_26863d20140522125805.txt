Yeah, there are specific things going on. I would say the biggest problem is his little sister. She is spoiled rotten, but she is going on 21 years old. She takes one college class, works 2 days a week as a hostess, and her mother does literally everything for her. She does the sister's laundry, buys her everything she needs and MORE in excess, and even sometimes does her school work. The thing that really put me over the edge was when she got pregnant ON PURPOSE, and now has her mom paying for everything. It seems like everyone around them is too afraid to challenge their fucked up, weirdo behavior because if you do, you are ostracized. My fiance has gotten into multiple fights with them about it, but in the end caves in and apologizes just to fix the situation because they are his family. I could go on and on, that isn't the only issue, but it is the biggest. Thankfully, my fiance is normal (aside from his family)!
