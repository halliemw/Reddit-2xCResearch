Then do something about it. You've got an entire life that is yours to do with as you please. If fitness is something that you do not wish to place a high priority on, that's fine. You don't need to be at the top of your game. Maybe you like other things. Maybe you're into baking! Maybe you're into anime. Maybe you're into fashion and design.

But whatever you're going to do, do it because you chose to, not because you are too lazy to do or be what you actually want. And if you choose to be something, then don't feel angry or bad about it.
