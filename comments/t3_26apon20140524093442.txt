Sorry for not replying sooner; I got to baking and then my boyfriend came home early to surprise me.

Thanks for sharing your sister's story. Although I'm still unsure about children, it just shakes me because I never about them seriously until now. If that choice was taken from me instead of me making it for myself... I'd just be very upset.
