It makes sense to confront the sexist speech and to call out casual sexism, especially among friends. However, I don't relate to your second point about sexist activities. Sexist activities to me are for example, business related social funcitons that exclude female colleagues, etc...Stripclubs don't fall under that category for me. I enjoy them, and if I woman chooses to work there she shouldn't be shamed for it. Simple as that. If you don't want to spend money that's one thing, but to say a woman can't use her sexuality to make money or a man can spend his money to watch her isn't being fair to anyone.
