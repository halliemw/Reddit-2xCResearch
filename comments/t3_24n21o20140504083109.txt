I already read that, "It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that personâ€™s sex." what im saying is
a) He doesnt do it because of their sex, he does it because they are better workers than him and he uses  their sex to insult them (as I said, if the better workers were chinese he would make a racist slur instead and b) he is not harrasing a person, he is saying women are whores in general, which is fucked up, but a political statement that cannot be used to fire someone. Would you please calm down btw? You're a pretty hostile person you know?
