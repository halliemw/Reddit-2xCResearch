I think the concept of "real" is great. I think the concept of "real sized" just slaps another label or excludes other people who don't fit the new criteria, which is the last thing we need. We don't need to be setting one beauty standard or another - either way. I think "real" and less photoshopped, regardless of race, size, age, etc., is something we can all get behind.
