I think the problem isn't that there's fewer women on redidit. Not all reddit women think the same way. Some women hate twox too. It's not like twox is a homogenous representation of all women on reddit and pidgenholing women on the site is not exactly a good thing to be doing.

/r/twoxchromosomes is just one subreddit. It's not representative of the whole gender and has never claimed to be. It's just one of the many places occupied by more women than men on the website.
