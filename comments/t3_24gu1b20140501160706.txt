No, I can't. My mom is against the idea of using hormones to manage it (she doesn't want to mess around with that stuff) and she won't let me try anything else yet. My period really isn't that bad, I just really really hate it and tampons/cups freak me out so as a swimmer it really sucks to miss out on it so much.
