You can find similar descriptions of people who have found the church after leaving homosexual relationships. It doesn't make them credible. If you listen only to anecdotes from something's most ardent and "reformed" detractors, you will find that almost everything is a result or cause of psychological damage and moral illness. (Including religion, lack of religion, prostitution, pornography consumption, pornography production, hatred of pornography, homosexuality, bisexuality, feminism...)

These people may be expressing completely honest beliefs based on their experiences, but it doesn't make them unbiased or their experiences representative.
