But what about you? No one can make you happy, only you can. Nor can you make him happy, only he himself can accomplish that.

It may seem like I'm trying to talk you out of this current relationship, but what I'm trying to help you do, is see for yourself what you really want. You may feel that you are being selfish, but maybe you have to be in some ways, to fulfill the promise that is your life. With the exception of your children, there's nothing worse than looking back and seeing time wasted expecting others to be happy with and love you for what you've given up or compromised of your self for them. I'm sorry, no one ever will...
