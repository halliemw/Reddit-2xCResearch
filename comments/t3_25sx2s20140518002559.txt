The thing is the word SLUT isn't just used towards women who 'sleep with lots of people' - its used against people who have dressed up for an evening in a short dress and heels,  someone who dances 'sexily', someone who looks sexy, someone who talks with a lot of men at a bar even if its only because they are a social butterfly.

The term slut has been used as a slur against many women for many reasons.  It's a term to take power away from their sexuality or expression of it - apparently wearing a short dress and heels is TERRIBLE so the woman deserves to be shamed.  It's a way of trying to disempower her, make her feel bad, make her retreat, control her, sabotage her.

It is about hate, hating the empowered women.

I have no idea why you thought you needed to think of a very male-dominated activity as an example for me, that is irrelevant as is your analogy - which does not work, AT ALL.

Football players are a very definite thing that you can define, you can see, you can all agree that Bob over there is playing football.  It's also not an inherently negative thing.

Whereas a 'slut' is a very negative thing, it's also not something that is agreed upon.  It's been used against women for far too many reasons, or for no reason at all.
Any woman is in danger of being called a slut on the whims of the people who think it's cool to hurl those kind of slurs... as a form of keeping other people down, or triyng to disempower them in their own minds so they feel better.  It is a form of hate.


:Downvoting is not for disagreement, or because someone made you look stupid.  You don't have a good reply, that's fine.  But downvoting to save face is just immature.
