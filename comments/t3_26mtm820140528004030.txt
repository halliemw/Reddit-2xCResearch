Yeah, unfortunately Family Planning's only free until 22 here, but the rest of our healthcare's pretty good - I wouldn't know the first thing about going about getting health insurance because there's no need for it here unless you choose to go private. I don't mind paying $23 for smears though, small price to pay for peace of mind :)
