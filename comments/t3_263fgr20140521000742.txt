Just for clarification - are you still in therapy? That seems like a vital first step. 

This is a weird question, but do you masturbate often? I'm a firm believer that to have a rewarding sex life you have to be comfortable with your own sexuality and nurture it. I know it took me a while to have a zeal for sex that most men seem to and I think what really did the trick for me was finding out what I was into. It's a very personal journey and you've got to have some "you time" to figure out your kinks and wants and interests. Also any medications you're on could be limiting your sex drive, especially certain types of birth control so that may be worth looking into.

I don't have the same past experiences as you, so I'm sorry if that lessens this advice in any way.
