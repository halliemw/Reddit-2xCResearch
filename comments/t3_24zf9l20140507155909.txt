You'll never be completely sure, but you need to remind yourself of accurate odds making it unlikely you'll become pregnant.

Also, my ability to trust my birthcontrol is based on the fail safe that I would not be stuck with a child.  If getting pregnant meant having/keeping a baby, you shouldn't trust just the pill and pull-out.
