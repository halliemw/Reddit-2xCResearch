There's a huge difference between baking all day and being a Stepford wife and not wanting your child in daycare for long hours. The evidence shows that there are disadvantages in terms of emotional development to daycare particularly for infants under a year old and not everyone has an extended family nearby to lean on for support.

With the situation as it is taking time off is likely to damage your career and I think going back to work is a totally valid choice but to pretend that it's a simple choice and doesn't have very serious disadvantages is to ignore the reality of the situation.
