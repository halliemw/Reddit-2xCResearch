Dude. Your skin is literally falling off. I'm trying *reeeal* hard not to sound like a smartass, but the vagina is the *last* place bits of flesh should be peeling off from. Being embarrassed is the last thing you should be worried about. I doubt anyone will dismiss you if you're presenting visible issues like you are. Please, if it gets any worse, at least call them up. Especially considering that this happened at such a rapid pace.
