I'm sorry my words were lost on you. Not trying to be mean, but I understand the discussion at hand and was simply trying to relate that while the problems are not the same, they are caused by the way we handle students, and how we teach them to operate in our world.

I don't have enough time to elaborate on the 3rd point. Just ignore it. I was simply trying to say that we should teach our kids to be more open with their problems and helping them than to continue a nanny state approach of trying to police any interaction where someone could have a hard time. (not that we should quit that altogether though, we should always be mindful.)
