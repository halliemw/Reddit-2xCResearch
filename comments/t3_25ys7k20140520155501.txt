It depends on your timetable and if you're at work and whether you'd prefer the privacy of doing it with the pill or the quickly but with a dr all up in your business. 
Personally I went for surgical because I wanted it over and done with for definite. I had a bit of a reaction to the painkillers and possibly a bit of shock on the way home (passing out and vomiting) but that was a tiny downside to what was otherwise a great  treatment. The dr was very understanding and it wasn't painful at all. 
The evening afterwards was pretty emotional and crampy but only like a suped up period. Overall it isn't fun but it isn't traumatic.
Hope it all goes well for you.  If you need any other advice or just to talk feel free to pm :)
