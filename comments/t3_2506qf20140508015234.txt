Aside from just basic plain language anatomy regarding the clit?  Well, okay...

* Anything about nutrition as tangible fuel that helps you do different things would have been cool.  I did not understand what foods did beyond basic calorie/fat science experiments.  
* Also exercise science (what lactic acid is, the fact that you tear muscle fibers to make yourself stronger, that weightlifting is super helpful, etc).  
* As a tall kid, if there was a tasteful way to teach about sizing measurements that'd have been nice.  That's just a miserable time of body changing and discovery.  Boobs are showing up.  Everyone's different shapes.  I had no interest in clothes, but I remember being self conscious that at nearly six feet I was wearing a size 10 pair of jeans that were inevitably high waters and - gasp - had to wear medium and large shirts.  Re: boobs - I did not understand bras and that there were options.  If you covered clothes, form (sizing is all jacked, these cuts do x, these do y) and function that would be weird, but useful.
