"I'm not personally offended," isn't the same as, "it's not offensive."

To answer your question in your post, I'm glad this is the sort of sub where casually referencing how much you'd like to sexually assault some omnipotent force is grounds for a post removal.

Bonus fun fact: If you hadn't said anything offensive or done anything against the rules of the sub, your post would still be up. It's not like there's some anti-menses agenda here; there is a plethora of period related posts.
