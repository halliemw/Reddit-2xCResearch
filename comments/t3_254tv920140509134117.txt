Well, the standard dealerships will offer you a wax job in order to try and up your "resell value". 

That's been the conventional wisdom for a while now, but a lot of people feel like it might not effectively keep that itch at bay. Plus, when you start talking about being overly concerned with a third party's valuation of you, you're possibly going to slide into the realm of rentals. 

Not that there's anything inherently wrong with renting out your car, as long as you're doing it for the right (healthy) reasons.

But, if you're happy with your vehicle and aren't looking to cash out, I'd suggest going one of two ways. Either totally mod it out with all the aftermarket parts that catch your eye, OR get some really awesome mud plates that will protect you from dangerous four wheeling. 

As a bonus, both options allow mounting points for external cranks, stabilizers for pneumatic jacks, and power ports for vibrators.


(kinda lost the metaphor on that last point, plus i'm typing with one hand so this is taking a long time)
