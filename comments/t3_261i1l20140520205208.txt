No hate at all. 

If I was guaranteed a loving happy, stable family that were ready to have kids, then I would be fine with her keeping me and putting me up for adoption, no doubt.

I'm not upset at being brought into this world by someone her age, it was HER raising me, the circumstances, the upbringing and the lifestyle I've had to lead as a result has been extremely tough from her poor decisions and inability to properly take care of a child. I turned out extremely well and level-headed despite everything I have had to go through.

My mother has admitted that she knew before having me that she could never put up a child for adoption. She is way too easily attached and could never handle giving up a child that grew inside her and she bore. For some, it can be an easy, happy and/or smart decision they make, but for a lot of women it is NOT easy to give up a child once it comes into this world.

I hope this answers your question.

Edit: I'd like to add actually, that if my mother had been unsafe during pregnancy and then gave me up for adoption, I'd rather she just abort me. I wouldn't want to be in a womb with someone smoking, drinking, using drugs, etc. Keeping an unborn child to go through that, to me, is morally irresponsible and wrong but alas people do it because they think it's more wrong to remove cells that later develop into a fetus. To each their own, right?
