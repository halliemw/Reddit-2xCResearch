I appreciate your point of view, but let me be clear that I didn't mean anything negative about my ex by saying "drag on". It was an expression that came to mind in the 30 seconds I took to share a very emotional anecdote that greatly affected the lives of everyone who cared about her. There is no judgment that was intended to come along with it. I was supportive of her throughout her ordeal and then some. While I can understand your intention, I don't appreciate your negative attitude towards a post that was clearly intended as a call to action for OP. It appears that you're either trying to instigate discord or shift the topic over syntax.
