The point is she's living well & not like the fat stereotype. She is doing everything right, but people make judgements about how she looks. Another girl who is thin has a different metabolism that never exercises and eats poorly is judged differently, despite the fact her lifestyle is poorer.  She's saying that you can't always judge a person's lifestyle or health by their appearance. 

Also, she didn't ask you for advice. This isn't /r/fitness or /r/loseit. If she wants info on what she should do I'm sure she's grown up enough to inquire. You spouting advice unasked is tacky at best, and nobody appreciates unasked for advice.
