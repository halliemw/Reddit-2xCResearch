You sure she didn't take a dramatic license with "the whole building" talking about it? If she's been the first one in TWO months to say anything, I'd be surprised if the entire building has heard you. Perhaps she's heard you a few times and got annoyed enough to approach you, but felt the need to exaggerate the reality. 

Don't feel too bad about something you didn't know. Now you know, so you just remedy the situation. Don't let this eat at you!
