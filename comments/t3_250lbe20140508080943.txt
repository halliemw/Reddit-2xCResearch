I , too, have super thin hair. While I have many stories about hairdressers and their response to my hair, this is my favorite: 

I got a groupon to go to this random hair place in town, The woman was an older foreign woman, and we did the usual chitchat about jobs, etc.  At one point, the inevitable, "Has your hair always been this thin?" Came up. No, I'm not sick, I don't have cancer, my mother has this hair, this is is just what I look like.  

After listening to my explanation, she pat me on the shoulder. "No worries. You are beauuutiful.... You have good job..... You will find husband." 

Lol I wasn't worried about that at all, but thank you! Apparently I have hair that will make it hard for me to "find a husband"
