Sadly, I wish this were true, but honestly, they are probably just assholes.  I guess TwoX has been pretty insulated from this kind of internet behavior, which I think is both fantastic and mystifying, because this type of cruel idiocy is something I have come to not only tolerate, but expect from anonymity. 

I was honestly shocked when I found out that many of the people on this sub hadn't already experienced this kind of stupid bullshit.  It's not frustrated men, it's not sexually shunned boys, it's just people who think it's funny to be shitty people.

My best advice is, as soon as any of you recognize the inappropriate comments or statements, just delete the PM. It's *extremely* important to recognize that getting mad or aggravated means they win. I am not sure if there is a means of reporting their behavior, but if there is, definitely do so. I know accounts get banned with pretty fair regularity for inappropriate comments, and while they can just create another one, most of them are too stupid to create new accounts just for trolling.

I want to make it clear that these fuckwits are just stupid people embracing the internet as a means of doing stupid shit where they can't be caught. Don't read their comments, don't bait them with responses, and if you can report them, do so. Eventually they'll get bored and screw off back to their lonely little bedrooms.
