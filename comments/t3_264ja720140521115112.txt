Okay. :) Well I know how frustrating it can be, though I bet you're in a whole different world of it by now. My feet felt like they were flaking off and I didn't want anyone seeing or touching, it was just gross. I hope you can find a cheaper remedy though! There are lots of powders and sprays around, so I hope there is one out there for you.
