I've never had regular cycles. Like you, it's been, at most, 3 times a year, but it's now been over a year since I've had one. I've been on BC via the pill for the better part of 8 years, and just a couple months ago switched to the Depo shot. BC has never ever affected my cycle. I get annual check ups and everything is fine. Irregular cycles run in my family, apparently, so no doctor has ever been particularly concerned.
