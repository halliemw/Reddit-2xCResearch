When I had mine removed it was very easy and I dont recall it hurting at all.  It was just a little prep and a tug and it was out.  But the first time I had sex after removal, my fella told me after that he thought he had "jogged something loose" and being super cool about it, he wiped off a bit of what I can only say was maybe cervical sludge? I hated my Mirena. It gave me awful mood swings and spotting almost the entire time, but I do know that its really really good for many women.
