I would just treat this like any puberty case I was by no means an early bloomer, but I recall most if not all girls in my class wearing training bras back in the 5th grade (9-10 years old).

Support her in that if she wants to talk you'll listen, as I'm sure you'll recall sometimes that shit is awkward as fuck and you're embarrassed because you think you're weird and alone in a completely normal experience. Have extra pads/tampons ready for when she starts maybe, offer to treat her to stuff that she's craving I dunno.

What would you have wanted/needed if you had an older sister looking out for you?
