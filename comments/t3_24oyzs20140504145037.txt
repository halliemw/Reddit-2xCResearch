>There is a documentary "Seeking Asian Female" that looks really interesting. 

That documentary was really interesting, especially since the Chinese woman was anything but submissive. She nagged, argued with him over his sloppiness, got jealous and made him cut off contact with a woman he was writing/seeing. The only traditional thing that I recall her doing was the cooking/cleaning. That guy was in for a rude awakening to reality.
