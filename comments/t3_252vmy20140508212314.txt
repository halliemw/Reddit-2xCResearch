I really appreciate the thoughts in this comment, thank you.

I think what is so difficult for me is that our long term goals (years down the road when children and a family are more relevant than they are right now) actually aligned very well. And he was always incredibly supportive of my studies now and desire to work in the future, he'd never ask nor want me to give that up for him. Unfortunately for the next number of years, our goals didn't seem to align (at least right now it doesn't look like there's any way).

But thank you, in the wake of this awful loss and all the emotions and questions and doubts I have been dealing with, I have forgotten what it is that I love about my work. So reminding myself of that is important.
