I feel like maybe it comes from things like Madama Butterfly. Rather than get angry at Pinkerton for being unfaithful by marrying another woman, she takes her own life. I mean the dude impregnated her and left for a few years and came back with a "real" wife, while Cio-Cio stayed blindly faithful in his absence. They describe Cio-Cio as being childlike, too, if I recall correctly. 

Also, there's the whole "gaman" thing, which means sort of like "suck it up" or "persevere". And the whole putting others or the group before oneself mindset. Maybe it made some people think it meant a Japanese woman will put up with someone's self-centered shitty shit and be submissive.

Edit: you might find this segment of this episode of This American Life interesting: http://tal.fm/491/3 it's an excerpt from Debbie Lum's Seeking Asian Female.
