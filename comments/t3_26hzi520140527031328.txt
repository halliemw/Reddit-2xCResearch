My SO bought a taser at a thrift store on a whim, now one of us will make a point to bring it if we're going out at night. It's nice to have a bit of protection. The one I have is also a really good flashlight, so even if I never have to shock anyone, it's still a good thing to carry around, cause you never know when you'll need a flashlight either.
