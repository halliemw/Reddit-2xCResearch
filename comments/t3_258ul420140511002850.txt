Abstinence only funding ceased in 2009 after numerous studies showed it didn't work (shocking, I know). States can opt out of sex-ed funding under current guidelines, unfortunately.
Tri city life is a faith-based anti-choice pregnancy center, according to their website. I would be outraged if my daughter's school tried to pull that crap- I'd think separation of church and state would prevent such blurred situations.
Sorry you had to go through that!
