I'm going to say people I don't have a mutual friendship with? People I consider 'insignificant' when it comes to people pleasing are strangers, non-friend coworkers, friends-of-friends, etc. If a coworker said I couldn't do something because I'm female, I'm not just going to roll with it. If my mom asked me to help with dishes because women traditionally handle that in my family, I'm not going to rant about why the women have to do it, I'm going to help her because she's my mom and I love her.
