Relationships remind me of hair, especially growing luscious hair. 
    To be in a long term relationship there is a lot of patience and trust in the perceived final outcome. Especially if you are used to a short hairstyle per say, you have the crutch of knowing it will be safer and less of a risk. However, imagine growing luscious flow, like a lions mane majestically flowing in the wind as it surveys the serenghetti. You always had a buzzcut, lower maintenance, comfortable and safe. But one day after much deliberation, you decide. 
    You are incredibly excited and optimistic at first, the flow is exciting, it's something new, something fresh even though it's different. As you progress through the process, you go through the "dark ages" where you aren't sure if this is what you want. You get scared of what could be and question the effort it takes to maintain something you aren't sure is worth maintaining in the first place. 
    There are heaps of hairstyles to choose from...Why is this one perfect for me when it takes so much?

Congrats on growing your luscious flow, it is finally paying off, the dark ages are over and I must say it looks rather good on you.
