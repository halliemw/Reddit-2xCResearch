Holy crap. I feel like that's a discussion to have with your pregnant patient prior to the whole squeezing out a baby thing, not to shove down their throat after days of minimal sleep, pain, and excitement. (not a mom, just a babysitter for 15+ years and annoyed with people being rude to new moms or not bothering to educate themselves before trying to shame someone)
