Sometimes I think that our society is filled with insanely wealthy undercover robber barons who all own fuck-mines in foreign countries where child laborers and slaves work 18-hour shifts chipping and hammering and digging fucks of every shape and size out of the darkest and most wretched crevices of nature's crystallized hostility, which are then sorted, polished, and smuggled into the country in cargo ships and private planes and inside of diplomatic packages.

It is the only explanation I have for people in our supposedly free and open society having **so many fucks** to give about other people's business.

That's what I think about moms breastfeeding in public.
