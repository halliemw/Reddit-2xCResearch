There's a part of me that thinks you're right, the dress didn't fit well and the shoes didn't go. But the other part of me thinks who cares? It's a pretty dress and she liked it. I know it matters to a lot of people but I don't think someone should be pilloried for their fashion sense. At least I hope not, I only own one pair of dress shoes and just did my biannual switch to my summer black sweater at work. Sorry you're being downvoted for a legitimate, if un-PC point of view.
