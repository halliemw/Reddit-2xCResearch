I believe that men's rights are important. Gender roles have hurt men just as much as they've hurt women and modern feminism is working towards a better way for both women and men. 

I think that the men's rights movement would do well to spend a little more time actually working on making the world a better place, and a little less time whining about how feminists are evil, and it's ephebophilia not paedophilia and why can't I masturbate to a 14 year old, she has boobs?
