I know what you mean, taking the test means that you're admitting to the possibility, which is super scary. It doesn't help that stress makes periods late-- and late periods are really stressful! Just think about the test as being for your own peace of mind, don't focus on all the things that could go wrong. No need to borrow tomorrow's trouble.
