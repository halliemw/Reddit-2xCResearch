It is a joint party, so she should have equal invite power.  She wanted me to make the Facebook event and invite everyone, though.  This guy is a friend of some of our close friends, and used to go to my church back when I went to church.  We've stayed amicable acquaintances, and uninviting him would certainly be awkward.  My friend isn't going to not attend if he goes--she just mentioned that she wished I hadn't invited him.
