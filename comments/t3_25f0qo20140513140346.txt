Thanks for your reply. I am having so much trouble calling PP. I have called 6 times and no one answers. The way he is responding is making me believe that he didn't actually get tested. How did you deal with your ex? I want to figure out a way to be civil in asking for proof because I am afraid if I am too confrontational he will just get mad and blow me off. I don't care if we stop seeing each other but I would really like to figure out a way to get the truth first.
