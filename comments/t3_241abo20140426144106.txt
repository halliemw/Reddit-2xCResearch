We aren't meant to be alone. We're social "animals". I don't want to go as far as saying we "need" other people, but it certainly makes life a little happier and a little easier with someone else, anyone else.

I hope you and OP will find that missing someone, whether it is a friend or SO to make your experiences more complete. I feel a bit of the same, that I can do things alone - I just prefer it with an SO.
