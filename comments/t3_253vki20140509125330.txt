i hear what you're saying about fighting back. if i feel safe i will totally call guys out for harassment. 

but it's not always a safe thing to do. i'm 5'3." when i was in my early 20s, i went to a concert by myself and ended up with a bro behind me who thought it was his right to dry hump my ass. i told him, several times, to stop. i got verbal harassment in return, was told to stop being such a bitch. eventually dude, who had almost a foot and maybe 100 pounds on me, pushed me to the floor. i grabbed a bouncer, but bc he hadn't seen it, nothing happened. 

just thought i'd try to explain why lots of women don't fight back. fighting back is scary and dangerous.
