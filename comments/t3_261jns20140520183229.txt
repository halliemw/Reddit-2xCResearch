As someone who is quite close to his step mom I have only a couple of suggestions.

1. Take an active genuine interest in something that she likes, preferably not with a strong connection to dad. This is both difficult and easy because it's tedious to keep a constant active interest you didn't develop on your own but it also doesn't require you to break down emotional wall directly.

2. DO NOT TRY AND FORCE IT. It's been reiterated enough elsewhere but its too important not to throw in.

3. Don't lose hope. Kids get upset with their parents all the time (biological or otherwise) and can be cruel about trying to hurt you. It's, usually, not because they are mean but because kids are short tempered and don't think about the big picture.

4. Be thrilled and encouraging of accomplishments. Not overbearing mind but make her aware that you know about the good things shes doing (school, sports, etc.) and that she knows she has your support in those things.

5. Remember the purpose is to establish your relationship as a 1 on 1 not as part of the larger family. 

- I hope this helps at all. It's a difficult but rewarding endeavor and I wish you luck!
