Its important to note: it's also totally cool to not always want to do it. For similar reasons, I still occasionally don't like being touched. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't, and that's totally fine. Its also fine to be triggered in the middle of a sex act and stop enjoying it. Also fine. So if you like it for a while and then decide you aren't in the mood for a while don't get discouraged! (It can still be rough on my self esteem sometimes when I'm not feeling it, even when I know it's okay.)
