Thank you for the advice! I have no idea why he is doing this but its funny you should mention about his next girlfriend. When I met him he used to tell me his ex abused him and would tell me all these stories, but then when we broke up suddenly I was the one "abusing" him...

I would love to just follow him around with that report and remind him of what he did, and call him out, but he is seriously mentally unstable and I am afraid of what he will do. I don't care if he tries to get psychical with me again, I Will fight back this time ( I was too stunned last time) And I only hope its in a public place so I can have witnesses (that aren't his friends) this time around.Then maybe he will get arrested and his entire life will be ruined and he will finally get what he fucking deserves...  But somehow he got an entire group of people to believe something entirely different than the truth and has altered the reality inside of his own head...  No matter what I do I am "abusing" him ... Hell he told me he grabbed me by my neck and pushed me because I "triggered" him... He is crazy and I just don't want to be a part of his mind games any longer. I really wish he would stop thinking about me all together.
