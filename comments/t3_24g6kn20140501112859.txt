Definitely. And half of pregnancies are unintended, so that's going to be a lot of 'em. 

Now, if we grant unfettered access to completely free effective birth control, we can drop that unintended pregnancy rate to something more like 15-20%... but that'd be encouraging slutty sluts who slut, so we can't do THAT. Might not get into someone's very narrow definition of Heaven (which conveniently ignores the whole camel/needle thing that is ACTUALLY IN THE BIBLE).
