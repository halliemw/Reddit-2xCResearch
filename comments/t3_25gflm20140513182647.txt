I kind of feel the same way you do. I'm also a fat girl, and I've had guys woo, kiss, hold hands with me etc. I've never had trouble getting into a relationship. Maybe I don't get as many interested guys as a thin woman, but I've definitely never felt the desperation described by this woman who is, frankly, not really even fat. She's chubby, but the dialogue makes it sound like she's 400+ pounds or something. 

You're right, everyone has their preferences. Personally, I prefer people who are heavier, whether they're male or female. I'm not that specific about looks since I can only be physically attracted to someone if I'm attracted to their personality, but for the most part, I like "fat" people. People have accused me of settling, but I've actively turned down thin/buff guys to date fat guys.
