Your anger is entirely justified. The fact that your gay friend knew you were in a committed relationship should be reason enough not for him to have done anything, regardless of any "signals" your boyfriend was sending him. On top of that, your boyfriend made it clear, or at least attempted to do so, but your gay friend continued. There is no excuse for that kind of behavior.
