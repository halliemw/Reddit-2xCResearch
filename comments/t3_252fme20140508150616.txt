I can't tell if you are trying to be funny or not. If you're serious, we are normal people just anyone else! Some of us are funny, some are serious, some like animals, some don't. There's no rule to communication beyond simple respect and interest. You probably don't need insight! Just say, "what's up."

I feel silly explaining this.
