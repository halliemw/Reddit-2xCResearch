yes I would say so. Also the severe acne could most definitely be hormone related. Believe it or not back acne can be a sign of too much testosterone. (yes ladies have it too) I'd make sure you get a full hormone work-up. You say that hormonal meds screw with your head and body - so does having extremely painful periods and being on morphine. Keep going until you find a doctor that's willing to be patient and work with you to figure this out. Write down all your questions and thoughts before your appointment. It's very easy to forget things once your in the Dr's office. Also, do you know if other females in your family have any issues like this? That's important information to have if you can.
