I think you should really examine what it is you're saying here, because what *I* see is yet another apologist going *oh no, YOUR assault was real, I'm talking about all those other LESS REAL assaults*.

Whether I followed the rules or not, the only relevant factor was that MY ABUSER **CHOSE** TO ABUSE ME.
