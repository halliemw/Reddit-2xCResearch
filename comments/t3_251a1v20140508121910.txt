White, fiscally conservative male here, and yes, front page status brought me here.

The government's role in an economy is to protect the rights/freedoms of the people. In the case of our particular brand of capitalism, that covers workers rights.

Toward this end we have things like Anti-trust laws, OSHA, and minimum wage, all of which are good and necessary.

Now, as for raising minimum wage. It was originally started as a means to keep businesses honest, a laudable goal. I would say its been very successful. The problem came about when inflation took off, but minimum wage stayed low. Then we started opening up "free trade" with countries that had zero workers rights (out sourced slavery) which made the US even more non-competitive.

Now we are in a catch 22, because many businesses cannot afford the higher rates, the competition is the world and many around the world will work for less, undermining our own workers.

Minimum wage *must* be raised, and $10.10 is the correct number as dictated by the current inflation rate.

BUT this won't fix everything, we also need to enact legislation (or more likely, repeal some) that will encourage business based out of the US and stop outsourcing slavery for cheap iGoods.

PS: Minimum wage can also go the other way, if it is raised too high then it becomes a tax on the middle class as the cost of goods they purchase dramatically increase in cost without actually increasing utility. I think raising min. wage to $15/hr would do this for much of the US, however $10.10 seems to be the safe mark.

PPS: Just realized I didn't really tie this into mothers/females issues. If my post violates sub-values, feel free to remove me.
