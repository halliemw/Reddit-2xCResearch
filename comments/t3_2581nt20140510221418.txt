I am a male in my early 50's and i knew that i did not want children when i was still in my single digits, mostly because my mom was a nurse and i had a very basic understanding of genetics and the chances that any kid of mine might have some of my characteristics (i was a ROYAL pain in the ass when i was little) and i also just did not like being around little kids and i still don't. So i completely understand your point of view and can sympathize.
