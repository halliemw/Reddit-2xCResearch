I agree. I just really hate being put on the spot like that in my workplace, mostly because I have to be professional even when I'm made to feel incredibly uncomfortable by some guys.
 
Aside from just not being happy with the discomfort that I have to deal with, I care because I do want to be friends with some of the guys. It's not that I want nothing to do with guys just because they asked me out and I rejected. What sucks is that they want nothing to do with *me* after dating and romance are out of the question. This is uncomfortable and disheartening, especially considering that I work at the only store for 12 miles and will probably have to see them again eventually.
