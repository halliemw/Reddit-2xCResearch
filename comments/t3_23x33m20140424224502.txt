I went through something similar and it will suck for awhile, in my case, about ten years.  The thing I learned in therapy is that I cannot *make* anyone do anything to me or hit me.  I cannot *make* someone seek emotional/psychological revenge upon me, I can't *make* them ball their fist and hit me.  You're brave and smart in what you did, getting away.  The next couple years of your independence are key.  Don't let it happen again and don't let it happen too soon.  They will get the message after awhile that you aren't available to be used, bought, etc.  Every family get together was a ploy to make me feel bad, that I wasn't there and it was somehow hurting them, meanwhile I was doing my own thing.  It was hard to to do without them, thinking of good times, but it was important to keep that distance until I felt comfortable again.  I do now, but it's been about 7-10 years.  I started off small, one birthday party here, one thanksgiving there... It was so hard.  It does get better.  Edit:  the nights you have a lonely pit in your stomach and have a wet pillow, just know it will pass.  You're setting boundaries that are important for many arenas of your life.  It will feel lonely and what you're doing is hard.  They will tell you it is wrong, but if you feel it is right then keep going.  You don't owe them an answered email or phone call.  You only owe yourself.
