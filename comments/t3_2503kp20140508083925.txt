I know she is... I could hear in her voice how much she's shaken about this.  It made it easy to realize my role right now is not a "punisher" but a trusted confidant and scared to death.  Again, as her mother, I did try to advise her so she'd not be in this position, but I also know we have to look forward and I need to best guide and assist her. 

Thank you so much for helping me keep that in focus.
