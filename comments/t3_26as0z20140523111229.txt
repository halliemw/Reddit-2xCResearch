>Don't make these things a test of his love and devotion to you. The ultimate goal is a domestic sphere that functions well, not a political victory for feminism.

This is a great point and one of the smartest things I've read on reddit. You're comment was focused on the domestic sphere and OP's problem but I've seen so many guys and girls do this in other aspects of a relationship.  I've even had those kinda battles with roommates. 

DO NOT let little tasks/issues become a test for larger feelings. It is a recipe for disaster! Your point is great for men and women in a variety of relationships/shared living arrangements.
