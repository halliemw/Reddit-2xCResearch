There's the Skyla IUD which has the lowest level of hormones that lasts for three years. (there's also the implanon arm implant that lasts for three years that you could look into) 

the Mirena IUD also has really low hormones and lasts for five years. 

and then there's the Paraguard IUD which is nonhormonal copper and lasts for ten years. 

Each have their pros and cons that you should discuss with your gynecologist to figure out which one works the best for you.
