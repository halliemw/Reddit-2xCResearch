Yeah, it's usually something small like volleyball, drinks after work and then bigger events on weekends. You find it in the facebook group, but there's nearly always something going on. And then there's the sub-groups. I'm in Irving, for example, and we try to meet once every week or so.

Edit: I went through your comments. I also see you live pretty close to me. You said you're about a mile away from the Mustangs. Are you in the FB group?
