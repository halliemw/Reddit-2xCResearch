Girl you did the right thing. Please, please, please, I implore you to not give him another chance, he already has had way more than he deserved. I have had women who are close to me get stuck in toxic relationships with notorious alcoholic cheaters. They have pushed away the family that cares about them, pushed away friends, until one day they finally realize everything they've lost, and finally finish the relationship. I wish this was less common.
