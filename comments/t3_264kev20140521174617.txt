Agreed, I changed schools several times as a kid and some schools had uniforms while others didn't, uniform definitely makes things a lot easier. Everyone is dressed the same, people don't get teased for what they wear, you can focus more on the studies instead of obsessing over what to wear and how you look. 

Some of my uniforms were nice, others not so much, but that's more of a problem with the implementation of policy rather than the policy itself.
