I'm sorry, I may be misunderstanding the situation, but that sounds more like aggressive and dominant behavior by an individual. Which can happen in any group that allows it. 

While testosterone may be commonly known to increase aggression in some men, that doesn't mean the situation would occur with any man. Certain aggressive people try to dominate any group they're in, especially if there is no one to challenge them. Some may not even be aware of it, but consider it part of who they are, calling themselves 'leaders' without realizing how they treat others. Passive people often defer to these so called 'leaders' instinctively without realizing it as well, because they seem, and act in charge.

Although it sounds like there could be more going on than what you describe, of people listening and deferring to this person, if you're talking about sexual harassment charges. If there are insults, demeaning comments, and unwanted sexual advances then the problem should be taken up with HR or management for inappropriate behavior.
