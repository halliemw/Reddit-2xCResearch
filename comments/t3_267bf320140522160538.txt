Wait.  I take back some of what I said about satire.  Apparently, "humorous" is not part of it.  Instead, the dictionary and thesaurus say it means "to hold up to ridicule, usually in a judgmental way" and synonyms are "ridicule" and "derision."

I find that fascinating (I thought it was a weaker term; satire is actually pret' damn mean).
