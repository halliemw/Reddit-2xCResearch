BC was the devil (for me). I thought I was pretty normal. Then as I got to mid twenties I noticed how irrational and emotional I was getting. Came out of no where really. I then stopped taking BC pills because my friend had mentioned how crazy it made her and I should give it a shot. 

Turns out she was right, what I had once thought was normal was nothing near the clarity I have in life right now. I feel positive, happy, and stable 100% of the time.
