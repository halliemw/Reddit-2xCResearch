Think about it: Disney princess hair is notorious for flowing, being long, and essentially feminine. Disney supports the notion of a classical, demure beauty by continually shaping their heroines' hair to be idyllic and unrealistic. When the heroine decides to "go rough" she chops off her hair (i.e. Rapunzel, Mulan) as a sign of innocence lost and the penetration into perfect feminine beauty. Yes, these heroines are still considered strong, but with the haircut, they are now flawed according to the movie.
