Van Houton herself actually just had a scene like that- although everything Melisandre does is tinged with "huh, sex", there was a scene with her just taking a bath and commenting to another female character, basically "hey it's nbd, you must have seen naked female bodies before, you've got one!"

But yeah a lot of the nudity is sex-related. Won't complain when it's Oberyn and Daario though :D
