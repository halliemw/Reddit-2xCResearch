I had the Mirena IUD for three years (only had it removed to start trying to conceive with my husband).  It was absolutely fantastic, and I am ovulating regularly/otherwise appear to have normal fertility since the removal a few months ago.

The insertion was painful, but over very quickly.  The removal was not really painful, just brief discomfort and a tugging sensation.

I will note that I switched to the Mirena IUD after I was on Nuvaring and it caused consistent elevated blood pressure - my OB/GYN advised me to avoid any birthcontrol/other medications containing synthetic estrogen in the future.
