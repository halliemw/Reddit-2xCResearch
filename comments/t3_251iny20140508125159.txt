There's saying hi to a friend or someone you see on the street or the mall, and then there's going on the internet to form connections with people for the sole purpose of flirtatious attention. It's obvious that's what happened with the snapchat thing in the very first post and it seems like you are being deliberately obtuse to prove a point, which is why you're being downvoted. It's a waste of everyone's time and doesn't add to the discussion as the information you're requesting is in the original post. Just read the OP. You may not agree that she should be upset about it, you would probably be cool with your SO texting attractive selfies of themselves to strangers, but the OP was not and her SO knew that. You're drawing a false comparison with normal interactions with other people which are quite obviously not at all an issue.
