Keep in mind only one thing has changed from when you were perfectly comfortable with the relationship; your knowledge of her feelings. Everyone else knew and things went on as normal.  You acted reasonably when she told you and there is no reason to not get right back into the old swing of things. 

Enjoy your friendship!
