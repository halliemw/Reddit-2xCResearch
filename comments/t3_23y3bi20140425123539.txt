>Do people believe every woman secretly hates herself?

Yup. I almost got into an argument once that literally every woman hates her own body because it grows body hair and societally we are expected to shave that off. Somehow they leapt from 'universally inherently being different from societal expectations' to 'hating yourself'. It was super weird and I'm still kind of blown away by it. I shave, like, once a month (tops) and I can safely say that this is not a body image issue I have. But perhaps I'm just in denial about how much self-loathing I have.
