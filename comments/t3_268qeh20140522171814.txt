Stop relaying messages from contacts. That is not your job. This would be a good first step toward letting go.

This concerns me whenever I hear someone say something like it:

> I worked an average of 65 hours a week and hardly took any days off. Even vacation days, they'd call me because something couldn't wait. 

No. This is not healthy work behavior. The occasional long week is one thing, but a routine thing is totally devaluing you and your worth. Looks at it this way. Assume you make $100 a week for an expected 40 hour work-week. You work 40 hours and you get your full $100. You work 50 hours, and your hourly rate just took a hit. Work 65 hours and you end up making considerably less. You still get that $100, but your time salary took a massive hit. You had 15 hours that you could have put toward a second job and had that much more money or a hobby and had that much more quality of life.
