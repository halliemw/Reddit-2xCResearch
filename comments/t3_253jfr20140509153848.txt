Don't give in and let this guy run you out of your job -- you are working within your company's guidelines and you are well-liked by the other lead -- so don't go down without a fight!  See if the other lead can join the meeting as a friendly face.  Then turn the tables on the use of this "data"-  make the discussion about whether the SLAs are the right timeline in light of his data, NOT whether you are performing your job correctly.  When he says, "it took you 5 days for xyz to happen and we lost the candidate," say, "Currently, the guideline is 7 days.  Perhaps we should revisit whether the SLA still reflects the needs of the modern candidate."  Make it about the system, not you, and sound like you are trying to find a good solution, not defend yourself.
I hope this helps. Good luck.
