Jesus Christ, is the article satire?

> She stopped responding to my email and when I called to inquire she blocked my number and emailed me to stop contacting her. Over a space of nine months, I wrote her two kind emails in the spirit of healing. Finally, she replied, “I do not want to see or hear from you ever again” and threatened to file an anti-harassment order against me. The open, thoughtful, communicative Emma I knew had vanished.

I can tell you what - no matter how broken hearted I was (and I have suffered a bad one, once), I would cease and desist had he blocked my phone number, asked me to go away and stopped replying to my emails. I certainly wouldn't carry on for nine months and then claim that the "thoughtful, communicative" guy I once knew was gone.

My boyfriend cut off his ex when they broke up and she didn't take it well. He had to stop replying to her because she wouldn't leave him alone and it was making him feel incredibly guilty. You are well within your rights to *not* have to deal with someone - that's why we call it harassment and sanction it when it happens. I can't believe this isn't some sort of joke.
