This reminds me of a time when I was on vacation and this huge drunk guy was trying to hit on me. I was on my laptop in the lobby and there was a girl sitting near me on her phone, but when she saw that he kept bugging me she moved between him and I and told him that she was my sister and that he needed to fuck off. It was so cool of her. Sticking up for other girls is so important in situations like this, and OP, you are a badass for having the guts to tell that dude off!
