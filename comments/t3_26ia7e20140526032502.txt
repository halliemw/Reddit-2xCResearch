I'm a 36D and I always wear a bra to work. I wear Calvin Klein T-Shirt bras because I find them very comfortable and reasonably priced.

I don't always wear a bra when I'm not at work, but when I do I wear specially made bullet bras from What Katie Did because I wear vintage dresses almost exclusively.

When I'm at home my bra is the first thing to come off.
