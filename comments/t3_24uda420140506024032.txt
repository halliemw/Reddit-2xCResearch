 I had a similar thing happen. I broke up with a guy and he broke into my home while I was sleeping. He attacked me and then when my dog started to attack him, I was finally able to get to the door and ask him to leave. He head butted me in the face nearly broke my nose and used the door to slam me and ripped my big toe nail off and gave me a big bruise on his forehead. 

Fast forward: he goes to jail for a bit and I run into one of his friend's gfs. She has me thrown out of the bar she managed because she said I was a liar. Her reasoning was it was summer and I was wearing boots. Well that was because it's not very attractive to wear shoes a couple weeks after your toenail falls off (especially not your big toe). 

It made me feel really bad because I was treated like I did something wrong and that I was a liar. It really hurt. 

She's a bitch and he's an asshole. He claimed I exaggerated it. He was charged with 6 felonies after the next time he broke in, stole my gun, and then shot it at me. Oh but before he did that he assaulted me again and head butted one of my male friends that was with me. Class act.

So I totally get what you are going through. This was probably 8 years ago and it really bothers me. Im seeing a therapist to get help for possible PTSD because now when someone yells at me (my husband) I have started hitting first. It's a reaction. Especially if he's yelling very close to me, it makes me lose it. I used to tolerate that kind of thing from Craig because I thought it would just keep the peace. Then it turned very physical very quickly. 

As far as all of our mutual friends go, yeah it hurt, but it hurts more now that I LET them devalue me because THEY were in denial. As someone who has been through this, let it go. Cut them out and don't give it a 2nd thought
