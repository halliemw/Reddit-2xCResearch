For future reference, you do have resources. Hospitals, especially in the US, are businesses and it's bad business to mistreat patients. Generally there's a customer service number you can call, or you can demand to speak to a supervisor. You can also threaten to speak to a lawyer over it, or bring it up with the attending doctor. There are better ways to manage incontinence than requiring a nurse to wipe him all the time, because they do have other patients. Developing bedsores is a sign of poor care and an excellent reason to speak to the nurses' supervisor. I'm sorry he was treated like that, and you shouldn't have to go up the ladder. Just know that you don't have to put up with this kind of sub-par care for you or your loved ones.
