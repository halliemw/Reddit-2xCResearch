That would certainly be less painful in some ways, but it would also have much less of an impact.  TwoX is a strong enough community that it's posts will hit the frontpage, exposing average Reddittors to those ideas. Furthermore, the benefit of making something like TwoX a default is that *you are exposed to what those groups want to talk about*, rather than being exposed *to what you want to ask them about* only.
