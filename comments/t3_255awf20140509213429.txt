My job is very similar to yours. My advice:

Definitely ask your HR what the guidelines are on this.

If that fails, come up with some canned responses. "Please refer to me as [my name]," might be good for the creepy nicknames, as someone else said.

When someone says something horrible, having them repeat it is good, as others have suggested. I always just say, "That's inappropriate," in a dead, flat voice. Then I pause. Then I go back to whatever we were talking about before that. I don't try to be chipper and syrupy. Being sweet about it might be a better tactic, as far as customer satisfaction goes but... fuck them. Honestly.
