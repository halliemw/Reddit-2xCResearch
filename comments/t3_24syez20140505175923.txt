Softcup never really did it for me either. But a serious game changer for me and getting the cup to sit properly was the angle of my cervix. Apparently the angle of your vaginal canal is different from person to person and the location/angle of your cervix/uterus is also different. Once I realized it, I started angling the cup and it really helped.
