Well, think about it this way - they may be right, and one could certainly make an argument to the effect that specifically female biological functions are regulated and affected in ways that male biological functions are not as a result of sexism etc etc.

Like, no one is bitching about stuff like vasectomies or Viagra being covered under Medicare, but bring up birth control around some parts of the US and suddenly it's all "WAAH MY TAX DOLLARS I'M NOT PAYING FOR DEM SLUTS" and double standards-a-go-go.

But Femen are still sensationalist dicks, with a racist streak a mile wide whether they admit it or not. Anything they might have to say, or any arguments they might have, are tossed right out the fucking window as a result - by feminists because of the aforementioned reasons above, and by everyone else because the whole "sensationalist dicks" angle makes it flat out impossible to take them seriously.
