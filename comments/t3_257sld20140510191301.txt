I'm 24 and I've been called ma'am since I was a teenager by a number of Southern gentlemen, usually in the "thank you ma'am," or "you're welcome ma'am," capacity. I don't mind it. Down here it's a sign of respect you give your parents. That said, it can be said in an insulting way, but so can the word "girl" or "woman" and etc. Tone and context matter!
