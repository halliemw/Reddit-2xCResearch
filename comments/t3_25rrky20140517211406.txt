Never text or use your phone while walking. Keep your head up and make the contact with people walking by (a study showed men who've committed rape and assault to be less likely to have done so had the woman looked them in the eye this making them more easily identifiable in a line up), get a dog, carry pepper Aleah and be ready to use it. 

These are things I've done living in the San Francisco Bay Area which can be pretty dangerous.
