...the personal anecdotes they shared reflect their opinions. Their opinions are that young women can't be truly friends because they can't support one another and only add conflict and competition to each other lives. It's a destructive opinion, and I don't see how there isn't 'conflict' here.

You're right, your personal experience wouldn't fit into my paper. Because it has nothing to do with my paper. My paper was only on relationships between women, so as a man you wouldn't fit into it. Obviously. 

Further, women make up 50% of the entire human population, so the likelihood that two women would be friends is pretty damn high, which is why they appear in movies more often, much more often than male-female twins. But if you're interested in movies like that, off the top of my head you could look into She's the Man and Eurotrip, which do feature those kinds of relationships, so your assumption that 'no movie has been made about you' seems unlikely. But once again, it has absolutely nothing to do with my paper, so I'm not sure what point you're trying to make at all.
