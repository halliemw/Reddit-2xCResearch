Part of my objection is that she shouldn't live in defensive fear that she has to protect herself legally or otherwise from any perceived threat. The path suggested would color her view of the situation before the problem is even addressed, and might as well color her view of trusting anyone intimately in the future. (Having to always keep a recording of someone's stupid actions handy and be reminded of it, on the chance it might be needed some far off day in the future.)

The other part is that it's more likely to turn out badly if she goes into a conversation thinking of him as her adversary and trying to weasel out a confession from him, rather than being honest about her motivations and trying to make him understand her point of view and how it hurt her.

I really doubt she could do both at the same time unless she's a professional spy. How could you have an honest and calm talk with someone who you're trying to deceive by plying a confession from them? Regular people's minds can't disconnect things that easily and just the stress of it might ruin everything if she lost control of the situation. 

Recording a confession is not the answer to all her problems in the first place. It will only help get back at him after the damage is already done. It's better to focus on understanding rather than preparing to get justice.
