I am a strong believer in the saying that good things take time. If I were in a situation where I could reciprocate a romantic interest, I would appreciate and be interested in a guy who either attempts to get to know me on a casual basis or invites me to hang out with an innocent approach.
i.e. "Hey, you seem like a pretty interesting person from what I gather. Want to  -insert activity- with me? It'd be cool to get to know you"

If you hang out with that person and there seems to be chemistry and compatibility then one of the parties should propose that the next meeting be a date.

That way there isn't any pressure to make a finalized decision on your romantic interest towards that person from one brief interaction.
