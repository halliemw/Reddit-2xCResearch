See I would consider you "normal" weight I'm 5'3 and about 195lbs so very overweight. I also realize that it can affect everyone differently but I guess I just wanted to hear real life stories than just the brochure. I don't think I'll change my mind regardless of what anyone says but I'm interested to hear what ladies had to say.
