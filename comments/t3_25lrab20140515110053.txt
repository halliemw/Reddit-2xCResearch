I don't even remember the last time to be honest. Some days I look in the mirror and think, "I look good." Lately though I have gained some weight and am not as happy as I used to be with how I look. I don't want people telling me I am fine how I am and giving me false compliments. I know I need to lose this weight. My SO has never been the type to compliment my looks. He really doesn't seem to care how I look which is hurtful sometimes. If I always look fine how do I ever look beautiful? I'd get dressed up and do my hair or makeup if he gave a damn about it but he never notices. I've been in a dark place with my self-esteem lately. Maybe because of the weight gain maybe because of getting a little older so I don't really fall onto anyone else's radar. I've hit that moment in my life where I go out with my little sister who is my best friend and she is now 19 and in her prime and everyone looks at her. I try to hold onto when I looked that pretty as well but it gets hard because the simple reality is that I just don't look the way I did when I was 18/19. I'm trying to accept that and move onto liking the way I look but with the weight I gained on our vacation...
