> I am not having a bridal party at my own wedding as I don't want my friends to have to pay for things, and I don't want to spend the money myself. 

There's always a middle ground, like asking your bridesmaids to wear black dresses - that way they can either wear one that they already have or can pick one up for cheap.  Most women who agree to be bridesmaids expect to pay SOMETHING, but I agree that it shouldn't be too much.  

In my case, I told my bridesmaids that I could afford to give them $100 towards their dresses and them let them pick them out - they each ended up paying an additional ~$30 towards the dresses because the ones that they liked the best were over $100, but there were other options under $100 they could have chosen if money were an issue.
