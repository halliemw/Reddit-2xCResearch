Yup. Correlations have been drawn between a comment's first few votes and its score hours later. 2x has hidden vote scores for a specific period of time, which slightly mitigates that, but if a (vote hidden) comment is under a couple other top level comments, you know it's not nearly as popular. And people are more likely to downvote a comment that's already got one or two. The only hope that comment really has is someone asking why it's been downvoted.
