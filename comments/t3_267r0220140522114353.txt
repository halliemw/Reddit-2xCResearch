They are, but it depends on the case - some people never get the rash, some people get it and never notice it.  Rarely does the rash get to be more than a few inches across, and it might not even be a bullseye pattern.  Since it doesn't really itch or swell, it can be hard to notice if it's in an awkward to see spot.
