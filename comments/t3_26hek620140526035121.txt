When I was a tween/early teenager, my mom used to pass off cardigans to me from Ann Taylor, and I thought they were "boring and drab." Now, as a college student, I wear regularly everything she picked out for me :) She always comments on how much I like her sense of style now versus when I was younger.

She also passed down to me a sundress she wore when she was younger, and I couldn't fit into it for awhile (when I was about 125ish lbs) but now that I've lost some weight naturally it fits me really well, and she loves that I'm getting some wear out of it :)
