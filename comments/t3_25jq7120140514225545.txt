I don't like assigning any label to myself, really. I was a lot more of a radical feminist when I was younger (I am now 32). I found that people put you up on a feminist pedestal when you identify too closely with this, and suddenly you are the moral gatekeeper for females everywhere (much like women have always been, ie., "the angel in the house). Suddenly you can't enjoy porn anymore or the degrading sex you want to enjoy. If I am a feminist that also means I should be able to have the kind of sex I want to have. I mean, if a guy enjoys being submissive in sex that is "okay" because he is a man and traditionally in a position of power. If a woman does it, oh she isn't respecting herself, she is degrading herself. For this reason, I don't want to be a feminist, I would rather be a humanist who cares about the rights of others, including women.
