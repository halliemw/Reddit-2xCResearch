1. Ogling is rude, objectifying, and obviously bad behaviour. She didn't call it harassment, you did. I guess you're the twit...

2. Yes, I agree. But the guy who assaulted her is still a fucking creeper.

3. The behaviour was not the same. The initial attempt, yes, but the x kept going knowing full well she didn't consent. New guy didn't.
I guess you think sex and rape are the same thing too?
