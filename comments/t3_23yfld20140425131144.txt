I'm in California, My cemetery actually offers green burials but I don't know too much about the process. From the website: "The intention of a green burial is to hasten the return of the body to the natural world and to integrate the remains within the cycles of nature. The body is not embalmed. Any wrap or container/casket is made of biodegradable material such as wood, wicker, or natural fiber." 

But I completely agree. I'm sure there are reasons for the traditional casket into a concrete vault kind of deal but it is strange that we feel the need to be separated from the earth by impermeable materials when it doesn't really matter anymore. It's a subject I wish I knew more about though
