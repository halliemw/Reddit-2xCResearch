There are lines called evaporation lines on pee stick pregnancy tests. They are the line that's treated with chemicals that would turn darker if you were pregnant. People see them and think they are pregnant all the time. 

Try posting a picture of your positive test to /r/tryingforababy. They are the masters of telling what is a real positive and what is an evap line. They can help.

Then take another test tomorrow morning.

Best of luck.
