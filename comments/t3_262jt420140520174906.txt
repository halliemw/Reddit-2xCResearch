Bit of advice. If your not absolutely certain 110% that you want to have an abortion then don't go through with it. I'm totally pro choice but I do think it's something you should only go through with if your certain. You may end up regretting it. You should definitely think long and hard about it and ask what your partner thinks you should do.
