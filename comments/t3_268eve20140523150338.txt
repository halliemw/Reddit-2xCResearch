If you're dating a new partner and you haven't yet established consent for drunken or drugged sex then what do you lose by waiting several hours for them to sober up? If your answer is "I might miss out on some sex" then your priorities are all kinds of fucked up. Your insistence that life is too short to get consent for sex is terrifying. 

That wasn't established her and OP's boyfriend fucked up by going ahead and having sex while she was blacked out and clearly out of her right mind. 

As a rape victim myself, it's more than feeling "uncomfortable" or regretful. You feel this sick sadness that doesn't go away no matter how much you try to stamp it out or ignore it. In fact until I admitted what happened to me was rape it kept growing. It wasn't until my rapist texted me years later and apologized *for raping me* that I was forced to call it what it was. 

In this situation OP was not in sound body or mind to consent. It's up to her to decide if this was rape or not but she has clear ground to stand on if she believes it was. Telling her to take responsibility for her boyfriends actions while she was out of it is *victim blaming*.
