If you ever feel like splurging, I highly recommend [REN's Moroccan Rose Otto oil](http://www.renskincare.com/p/3135/Moroccan+Rose+Otto+Bath+Oil). I use it only when I feel like I really need it, but a few drops goes a long way. It has such a soothing scent and though it's an oil, it's not at all greasy, it leaves you feeling moisturised and you get the subtle smell of rose petals on your skin. The whole rose otto collection has won tons of awards, if I had enough money I'd use them all every day but for now it's just an indulgent treat. :)
