I've never been yelled/catcalled at, but I had a water bottle thrown at my feet. I was just standing there talking to my friend at a bus stop on my university campus. I think it was probably racist, as my school is like 90% white and me and my friend were both asian. But it seemed like they were a bunch of drunk frat boys, so it could have just been them being stupid.
