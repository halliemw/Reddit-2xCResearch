Graduation ceremonies are not political the same way reproductive rights is and pretending they're on the same level is ridiculous. Ceremonies have been around since forever and their purpose (to give a public space to celebrate and reward hard work) hasn't changed much.

What ceremonies are *not* is a campaign space. I would say the same thing to someone wearing a campaign sticker on their cap. It has no business there. Controversial statements with express expectation of a fuss have no place in such spaces.

Acting like you can broadcast your political beliefs at all times regardless of context because of "freedom of self-expression" is *extremely* self centered. Would you be okay with someone wearing a pro-life shirt at a White House dinner? Or a gay rights shirt at a funeral? Or maybe Uncle Rickey starting to sound off on men's rights issues at the family get-together? No, because the phrase "a time and a place for everything" is old and well used *for a reason.*

The fact that you can't recognize what is not an appropriate setting for certain statements is honestly a little surprising.
