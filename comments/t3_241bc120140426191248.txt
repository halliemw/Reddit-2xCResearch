Thanks.

I think I'm going to send a snide email saying "never mind" and telling them that they sound like an ass for asking questions like those. 

I think that in some ways, guys luck out on the whole kids thing, less of "you'll change your mind!" etc., but I feel like they have other issues to deal with.
