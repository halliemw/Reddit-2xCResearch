This comes up in /r/relationships often. It can work, but it depends heavily on the people involved. My **ex** was a Christian; he converted to it at about 19-20. I was raised primarily as Christian, even confirmed as a Lutheran, but would say I always had doubts. As an adult I've sorted out my beliefs and would consider myself an Atheist with Agnostic sympathies.

During my eight year relationship with someone of differing religious beliefs I learned a lot about myself and my values. I learned that I cannot be with someone who is a Christian (or probably most any other religion short of [Buddhism](http://buddhism.about.com/od/basicbuddhistteachings/a/buddhaatheism.htm).) 

I have to be able to respect my partner and need him to respect me, and that extends to my personal beliefs and values. He doesn't have to share them, but he must respect them as valid and reasonable. I can respect someone that is a friend or an acquaintance and holds religious beliefs, but for my life partner I need to be more in sync with  that person. Especially if I consider what it'd be like to raise a child with the person.

It can work if both parties truly do not have interest in converting or changing the other person. It can work if both parties have full respect for one another's beliefs. If there is any doubt then it will not work. Respect will eventually erode and that leads to resentment.
