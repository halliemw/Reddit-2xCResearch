I want to start out with the disclaimer that I know and 100% agree that it's scumbag thing to do.

But at the same time I can imagine a state of mind where it wouldn't seem so. (Edit: the question is about what's on his mind, we may know it's a creepshot and bad, he may not have.) Especially given the context: just before he had had sex with her; to his mind, this might as well have been something fun and playful, something sexy that fuckbuddies do together.

It's especially easy for me to imagine a man failing to realize how large an impact creep shots could have on a woman's life. For him, leaked nudes would just be temporary embarrassment at worst. 

Now, obviously he could also easily been well aware that it's creepy, and done it anyways.

I'm not saying that /u/throwawaygggf should assume he's ignorant instead of malicious. I'm saying she should keep in mind that either possibility could explain things, instead of going in with preconceptions (and the same advice applies to most of the commenters here).

>When people act selfishly, they know what they're doing is objectively wrong, but they just don't care.

I earnestly counsel you to reconsider this opinion. Sociopaths are the exception, not the rule. Expecting otherwise would make it harder to empathize with people I disagree with, when it's too easy to reach for, "Oh, they just don't care about right and wrong," as an explanation.
