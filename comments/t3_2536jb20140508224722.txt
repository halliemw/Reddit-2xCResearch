Good to know about the fiber, thanks!

I take it within 30min of waking up...I get incredibly nauseous in the mornings so I don't know if I could keep it down.

sidenote: nauseous is one of the most obnoxious words to spell i swear to god it takes me 10min each time before chrome even recognizes what i was trying to spell
