I think /u/HappyonaShelf summarized the situation perfectly.

> There is an element of being a sexual target that we really never get over. Some of us learn to use it to our advantage, some of us are freaked out by the attention and make a habit to withdraw from scrutiny, some weather it with as much grace as we can muster and trudge along with dignity, eyes open until the attention inevitably wanes. 

You sound like you either learned to use it to your advantage, or you weathered it with grace and dignity (go you!). Personally, I got freaked out and withdrew, which is what it sounds like this girl is doing. I don't think that means there's something more insidious going on.
