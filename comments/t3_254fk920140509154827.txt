We don't need to get rid of gendered toys entirely, gender is a real notion that many identify with, just give the kid a good balance to find it for themselves.

I don't think all gendered toys are a bad thing, they have their place and kids start having preferences   pretty early. I think the issue is about parents who force certain things on their kid because of their personal preconceptions based on nothing more than the sex of the baby and societal expectations. If a little girl genuinely wants barbies and is into makeup and pink things, that's totally fine, it's when parents put that on them or forbids them from certain other toys against their will that it becomes an issue.

If a boy wants to play with a baby doll or play dressup with dolls, fine. If a girl wants to play with trucks, wrestle, and shoot nerf guns, fine.

We got our daughter everything from stuffed animals, to dolls to trucks to learning puzzles. Usually you can find her wearing a monster costume on top, a tootoo on bottom, drawing with markers while mumbling to her doll then playing with her trucks on my leg. All before rough housing with me pretending to "fly".

I love that kid, I want her to be well rounded.
