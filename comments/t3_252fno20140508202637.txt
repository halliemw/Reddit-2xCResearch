Are you trying to switch genders in order to demonstrate some sort of sexism? In a subreddit intended for men and a male perspective, this would be totally fine.

In a subreddit about something non-gender related (hobbies, science, reading, fitness), this would be inappropriate. (Note, however, that most reddit users DO assume that all other reddit users are male and use he/him/his pronouns.)
