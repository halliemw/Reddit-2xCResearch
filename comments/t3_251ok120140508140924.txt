I was actually thinking about it. I've been a long time lurker of the female community of reddit, but had never created my own account. However, with all this drama unfolding, I decided to sign up and see if anyone was up for it. I have some ideas, but I need partners.

I think it is easy to create a subreddit, but it's hard to really manage it.
