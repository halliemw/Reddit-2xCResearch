That may be true. But trying to convince a fifteen year old girl to keep a child based on your personal opinion towards abortion is misguided at best, dangerous at worst. Can a fifteen year old raise a child? Yes. Has it been done before, successfully? Yes. Do the children of teenage parents often grow up to lead relatively happy lives? Yes. Does it mean that it's still advisable? No. It's clear from her post she is leaning towards abortion or adoption. We owe it to her to give her accurate information about all of her options without injecting our judgements about abortion in it. Yes. She had sex. She got pregnant. Accidents happen. It's not fair that because of a heat of the moment mistake, she will have to suffer or sacrifice for 18 years when she is still a child herself.
