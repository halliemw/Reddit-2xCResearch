While I understand that this is a deal breaker for you, I think its petty and selfish. If its love then that should include respect and that means respecting someone else's beliefs. Love is not calling off a strong relationship because you don't get to have the same view as someone else. There are always going to be conflicting views in a relationship. Religion is no different than a political view. The issue arises when the view/belief changes someones behavior to the point where two people cannot interact with each other.
