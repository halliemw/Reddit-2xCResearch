What do you expect us to be attracted to, a sparkling personality we know nothing about?  As a man, when we see an attractive woman, ALL we have is looks to go by, since we know nothing about you.  Just like you know nothing about us.  
  
I understand attractive women get approached all the time.  I think you did the right thing by telling him you are taken, most women wouldn't bother, and anything else he says is on him.    


As far as asking him to be friends, for a guy that is interested in you, is like asking him to be instant friend-zoned, and that's not what he wants.  He should just leave.    


To a woman, being told you're beautiful time and time again eventually loses its flavor, and only finally means something from a man whom she has knowledge of and is attracted to. This is why you don't care anymore when someone calls you this, because you have no knowledge of the man.    


As an ending note....you want a guy to ask you about your personality/interests, did you ask him about his?
