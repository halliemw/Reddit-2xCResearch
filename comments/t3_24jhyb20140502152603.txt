It really was fantastic once the storms rolled out; I read earlier today that apparently, they were within 2 minutes of having to call the race due to weather when the radar finally gave an all-clear for us. I'm so glad it did, I would have been so grumpy to have to go home after 4 months of training and a 3:30 am wakeup call!
