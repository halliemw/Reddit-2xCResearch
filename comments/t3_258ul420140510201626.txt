Thank you. My family never gave me "the talk," until my mom tried to bring it up to me at fifteen. I've already exhausted every online resource in educating myself as much as possible, even though I don't see sex in the equation in the near future. 

I've already had to sign a permission slip to go through with the presentations. 

I could try to bring it up with my teacher, though I'm not sure how she would respond. She and the other Phys Ed teachers decide on the speakers they want to come in.
