Women don't need t be patronized, and treated as less capable of understanding what they are getting themselves into. They are equally capable to men to sign up for riskier work or decide for themselves it's a bad decision. This is a decision every individual woman has to make for herself not have the decision made for her simply for being female. This is what you do with children, not adults.

There is clearly a risk in a lot of things and women still do it (cashiers, doctors, paramedics, soldiers, journalists). And sometimes shit happens. And that's the fault of whoever caused shit. And the women knew it was a possibility and were brave enough to take it on. Life is risky period. 

Women should not be penalized for having bad stuff happen to them (see rape, traveling in exotic countries, walking home, being robbed etc). Men choose to do or not do risky stuff all the time and they are allowed to risk themselves.  They can get bruised, scraped, assaulted or die in the line of duty and nobody criticizes them for risking their lives and bodies. Women should be held to the same standard and not burdened with a higher expectation of staying safe and a higher expectation to insulate themselves from any risk. Because that kind of safe life would deprive them severely of experiences, opportunities and enjoyment of life.
