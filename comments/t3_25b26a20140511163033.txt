Was he trying to reach out by inviting you to lunch with his mom? You kind of shot him down? Why didn't you go? If you just wanted this to blow over then I would suggest you act normal ( would you have normally gone to lunch?).

But on another note its very strange that he would be so passive aggressive and upset about you going to a work event... or really any event.

"why didn't I come straight home to see him, why did I go to the event?"

Is there something you left out? Because that is very weird behavior from him... and not really how it should be. If you need to go to a work event you need to go... no matter if its mandatory or not. He is acting childish.
