Being made a default is a pretty big deal, and I think the discussion on that is not unreasonable. Things changed by being made a default, so one might argue that that is what is "clogging up the subreddit" and that posts like yours are the meta posts that are negative.

Give it a week or so, and I'm sure the meta posts will die down.
