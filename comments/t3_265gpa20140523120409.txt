You're right it isn't the most fair method - I won't dispute that. But on the other hand a comfortable living situation is very important for me since I just want to come home after a stressful work environment. My home is very important to me - its my resting place where i can pull myself together after falling apart during the day. So for me there's much more risk over reward in giving a shut in a chance due my past experiences. I would rather just eliminate future risk for someone I mesh well with right off the bat. 

Of course, automatically assuming that every quiet person is passive-aggressive or all the same is ridiculous, and I know all people are different. But at the end of the day, I'm really not going to settle with a questionable quiet stranger when I know there's a better living situation (for me) if I keep looking. My post simply describes the way that I do things, it's not a call to arms against shut-ins just like I'm not condemning hard partiers because I think they tend to be loud and inconsiderate (but no one has given me any flack for this).

In my eyes, it's just an incompatibility issue and not a people issue, and I really don't feel bad about being selfish and protective about my living situation. Have you never been utterly miserable in a mismatched roommate household? I have. It's truly awful, so I will do what I can to not put myself in the same environment, even if it's a little unfair.

I tried to explain it before in another reply, but if you think that I don't like shut ins or think they're terrible people or I can't be associated with them; you're wrong. I simply would prefer not to live with them, just like I prefer to not live with hard partiers, or the 420 friendly, or people with dogs.
