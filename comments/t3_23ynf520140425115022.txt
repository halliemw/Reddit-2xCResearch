I feel your pain, but the exact opposite. I'm 5"8 and 144...but with no hips or butt to speak of, and big boobs. I'd love to have your body type! Grass is greener, eh? Haha. 

You say you feel like you're forcing broccoli on him, but what about you? Why should you be frustrated, especially if your boobs can bring you to orgasm on their own?! Does he know they can do that? 

I know it's cliche, but communication. Your wants and needs and desires shouldn't go ignored. For what? Does he know how much you enjoy breast play? If he doesn't, maybe that's why he focuses on other areas; not because he doesn't like your boobs, but because he doesn't know that you do. Your boobies deserve love too! Go get it :)
