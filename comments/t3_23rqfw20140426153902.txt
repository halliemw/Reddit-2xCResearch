Sorry, I forgot to respond to this! I tried to pick out books that are fairly accessible & not loaded with anthropological jargon or the like. 

* If you want a really concise overview of Native American history, I recommend [North American Indians: A Very Short Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/North-American-Indians-Short-Introduction/dp/0195307542). Theda Purdue and Michael Green are/were (Green recently passed away) very important historians in Native American history. (Plus it's adorable that they're married.)

* One of my favorites is Tiya Miles's [Ties That Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom](http://www.amazon.com/Ties-That-Bind-Afro-Cherokee-Slavery/dp/0520250028). I like how it shows how race played out in the South in much more complicated ways if we include Native Americans. It reads like a story more than a history book.

* Tiya Miles also wrote [The House on Diamond Hill: A Cherokee Plantation Story](http://www.amazon.com/The-House-Diamond-Hill-Plantation/dp/0807872679). I haven't read it, but I've heard it's good.

* Nancy Shoemaker's [A Strange Likeness: Becoming Red and White in Eighteenth-Century North America](http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Likeness-Becoming-Eighteenth-Century-America/dp/0195307100/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398543382&sr=8-1&keywords=nancy+shoemaker+a+strange+likeness+becoming+red+and+white+in+18th-century+north+america) is an undergraduate-level analysis of the ways that both Europeans and Natives constructed their identities in opposition to each other. Each chapter covers a specific topic. 

* While I haven't read it, Daniel K. Richter's [Facing East From Indian Country: A Native History of Early America](http://www.amazon.com/Facing-East-Indian-Country-History/dp/0674011171) is a commonly assigned book in undergrad classes. It places Native Americans at the center of American history, rather than focusing on Europeans.

* Another commonly assigned book for undergrads that I haven't read: [Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee](http://www.amazon.com/Bury-My-Heart-Wounded-Knee/dp/0805086846).

* Linford D. Fisher's [The Indian Great Awakening: Religion and the SHaping of Native Cultures in Early America](http://www.amazon.com/The-Indian-Great-Awakening-Religion/dp/0199376441/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398543560&sr=8-1&keywords=linford+fisher+the+indian+great+awakening) is a bit more academic due to the topic, but I think it's still pretty accessible. If you're interested in learning about how Native American religions adapted & blended with Christianity, it's a good account. 

* A really important book is Kathleen DuVal's [The Native Ground:  Indians and Colonists in the Heart of the Continent](http://www.amazon.com/The-Native-Ground-Colonists-Continent/dp/0812219392). Like Fisher's book, it's a little more academic, but it talks about how Native Americans controlled interactions with Europeans in the Mississippi/Arkansas River Valley areas. Instead of Europeans destroying Native cultures, there was a period when Europeans had to adapt to Natives' demands. 

* I find the Red Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s fascinating, but the books & articles I've read are organizational histories and wouldn't be that appealing to a non-specialist. [Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee](http://www.amazon.com/Like-Hurricane-Movement-Alcatraz-Wounded/dp/1565844025/ref=pd_cp_b_2) is the most popular book about that movement, but I've never read it. 

Sorry for so many suggestions, but I thought I would give a bunch so that you can see what might appeal to you based on your own interests. All the above books are important because they help change our understandings of Native American and American history. Natives are not passive subjects in the books but are active in shaping their own lives.
