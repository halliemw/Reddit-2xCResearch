>Comparing a woman who just started working for a company to a man who has been in a position for 8 years is improper.

At the same time, Jill was perfectly allowed to hire a lawyer to investigate her discrimination claims. Just saying "seniority" is not an excuse, and your point of "management decides salaries, end of story" is totally false. Discrimination is real, it _is_ illegal in federal law, and she has a right to understand if they broke the law with her compensation.  This lawyer is what triggered their harsh and quick response, according to the stories. 

The fact she was fired for looking into the fairness of their actions speaks volumes about their motivations, to me. The fact that they have her contractually unable to speak about the context of the firing speaks even more. They're working hard to hide what's going on.
