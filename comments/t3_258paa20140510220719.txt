Do an experiment, and do a search through this subreddit for "breasts" "labia" "hips," whatever else.  MANY women are just as self conscious as you.

And I do not mean to belittle your fears here, but you are fine.  Look up pictures of malformed breasts (do you mean tubular?) and see that so many have them.  Look up actual labias, and you'll see that a lot of us have long dark ones (none of my boyfriends have minded mine).  As for the stretch marks and cellulite?  I weigh 120 lbs and my ass and hips are covered in stretch marks and cellulite.  It's called puberty, love, and it affected us in different ways.

I know you won't believe a stranger when she tells you that you are not ugly, but I'll tell you anyway: You're not ugly.  You're probably a lot prettier than you think, with clothes on or off.
