I'm sorry you had a bad relationship with your stepmom, but please don't reflect this on me. I'm not making anything a competition, and it never even crossed my mind to try and break up/lessen the bond between her and her father! I was the one suggesting they have more one on one time for the record.

By the way, diagnosis was in fact made by a professional (not me), but as said in the text, this isn't that big of a problem anymore.

I'm sorry your stepmom is so possisive over your father, but once again, not me.

Is there anything you come up with (if she wouldn't have been the way she was) that might have made you bond stronger?
