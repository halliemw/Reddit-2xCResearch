Thank you for this thread!  I'm in a marriage coming up on 7 years, we're going going through a difficult patch in life and our marriage is a bright spot in life!  I think our philosophy is that we'll be married for life, so we might as well find a way to be happy together.  Also, we're both enormous assholes so we feel lucky that we found someone to tolerate us.  ;-)
