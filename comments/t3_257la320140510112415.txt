Thank you. 

 If I had a choice I would re dye it pink at least this way it would be pink and not the reddish color it was on my unbleached hair. but not sure how well bright pink would go down at work :D 

I may redo the head and shoulders again an leave on for longer or something. and if no change get brown tomorrow.
