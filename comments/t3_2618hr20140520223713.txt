Never had anything like this happen. Sure, sometimes I've said something that got downvoted, and sometimes in those instances people say sort of mean things. But I've never experienced anything I'd consider harassment. I think this sub is a safe place, generally speaking. Any time I see the troll posts, they're outnumbered about 100:1 by nice, supportive, on-topic posts.
