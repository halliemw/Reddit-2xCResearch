Are any of those anti-inflammatories?  In my opinion, you should be seen tomorrow.  Don't bother emailing photos.  You *must* be seen.  Pus is usually a sign of infection, and you can never be too careful with this area.  Insist that they see you first thing in the morning, and if not, do not wait, go to the hospital.
