It's hard to explain, but the way in which my scar wraps around by abdomen and above my hip restricts movement and caused weird muscle tension on the right side of my body. I think it had to do with sleeping on my right side after I gained a few pounds following the surgery; as I used to wake up with numbness on that side some mornings (I have since relost the weight and the numbness is gone, however the chronic tension remains.)

I do some physical therapy to work on it, but it has been difficult to really fix the issue.
