Pregnant chick here. 

I'm still a human being, you know.  I still have actual thoughts and feelings, I still function.  I feel sick a lot right now.  ...so?   Goodbye sense of humor?  What the fuck ever, man.  I crack jokes maybe more often than I did before.  

I don't find stereotypical bullshit funny, though, and it wouldn't matter if I was pregnant.  Sexist bullshit isn't funny, either.  Rape culture isn't funny.  I wasn't aware it's being pregnant that caused me to find these things less than hilarious.  

I'm sorry I don't fit into some idiotic HuffPo bullshit box that Hollywood came up with, but this is a load of crap.  

And honestly, fuck whoever decided to say we're *lazy*.  Fuck them with something hard and sandpapery.

I guess the fact that I was **ordered by my doctor** to SLOW DOWN doesn't matter, right?  Nope.  I'm just lazy.  And obviously fatter because all I *ever* do is eat, and apparently I'll "eat his fucking face" if my husband doesn't shove some random food item in my hand?  

This 'article' is everything wrong with how people view pregnancy.  

Hi.  I'm a human being and I happen to be pregnant.  I'm still ME.  Pregnancy does not negate your standing as a human.
