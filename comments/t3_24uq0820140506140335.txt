Bodies are weird. It is possible to get pregnant every single day of the month, even when you are on your period. Its not very likely, some days its a super tiny percentage chance, but it could still happen. Sperm lives longer than average, you drop an egg at a weird time, the zygote is mightier than average and implants in a not-completely-prepped uterus, you're fertile more days than the average, etc, etc. The thing to remember when looking at data like what you found is that it is all based on averages, and for every average there are always outliers.
