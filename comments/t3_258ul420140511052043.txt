Current U.S. policy is that schools must teach comprehensive, evidence-based sex ed to get federal funding -- what you experienced would definitely not qualify as either of those things. However, many places simply opt to teach what they want and not receive federal funding. 

[Here](http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_SE.pdf) is a guide to state laws regarding sex education. You may also be able to find more information on your state's curriculum guidelines through the state education department's website or by googling it -- I've found curriculum info/guidelines on sex ed for several states this way, though the level of detail that I found varied state to state.
