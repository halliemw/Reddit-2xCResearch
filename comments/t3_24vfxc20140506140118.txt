I don't, but I grew up with a dad that was half cherokee who didn't really have body hair and the community was heavily cherokee so I don't remember ever really seeing chest hair or really hairy arms or legs until I moved away as an adult. So it's like this weird thing that men have only had for the last decade to me, and I just don't like it.
