It's not any more acceptable than abortion, even though it's creating life instead of taking it. According to the thinking, only God can create life; human beings are just the agency through which it is done. To circumvent what God has decreed for a person's life is considered usurping God's power, and is seen in the same light as the use of any birth control (which prevents the formation of God-granted life) or abortion (which terminates the "gift*" that God has bestowed upon humans). 

*I put gift in quotation marks because not all people view pregnancy in the same light, not as a flippant disrespect to anyone who views pregnancy this way.
