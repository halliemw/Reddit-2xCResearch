You have valid points, and asking girls for dating advice is like asking guys how to fix a period (Protip: cork), but you're still kinda acting like a jerk.  There's lots of girls that have problems in relationships too, and you're posting this in a women's sub.  And, you know, six people just got murdered.  It would have been better to make one post about the guy that murders people, and a completely different post about the issues of dating.
