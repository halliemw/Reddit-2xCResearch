I started on the pill (Yaz). It was easy, seemed the least invasive option and cleared up my acne. I liked knowing when my period was going to start - made planning trips and romantic evenings easy. I stayed on Yaz for 3 years. I stopped taking it 3 months ago. I kept on reading about the  blood clot potential on the pill, knowing that my chances were extremely low as a non-smoker, young, relatively active person but it still freaked me out to the point where I would have trouble sleeping the odd night because I was stressing about some phantom pain in my leg which may or may not have existed. So eventually I said screw it, I'll switch to an IUD so no more blood clot potential. 
I had Mirena inserted a week ago. I chose it for the no periods potential and five years coverage with no upkeep other than the annual checkup. I've never had a baby so insertion was pretty painful but worth it. Also, I'm just finishing up my degree and with my student med insurance Mirena was only $40 versus paying $60 every three months for the pill when I finish school (not sure if I'll have benefits when I find a job).
