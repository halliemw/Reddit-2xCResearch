> I would just hate for a woman to feel obligated to be totally hairless if it doesn't feel right for her, and then proceed to feel poorly about herself because of how she looks naturally.

Just wrote that in another comment, and I'm sticking with it! Don't do what you're uncomfortable doing! Break or follow whatever rules you want, as long as you feel fabulous while doing so :)

(ps thigh rashes from shaving totally suck omggg)
