I was on ortho tricycline for 9 years. I went off of it at 25 because I was worried about long term effects on my body. Going off of them I discovered that I wasn't as crazy as I thought I was! BC made me ride an emotional roller coaster 24/7 and it worsened some very mild OCD symptoms I have. Nothing that kept me from functioning normally, but for example, I stopped wearing rings in college b/c they set off my OCD of needing all fingers to feel the same. I can now wear my wedding rings no problem (though talking about it is making me feel itchy!) 

On the bad side, my skin went crazy. I have a long history of acne and it got worse than it had ever been after going off of BC. I have a lot of scars now, which sucks, but I did eventually get it under control.
I have used condoms since and have no plans on EVER using any type of hormonal BC again. Husband is getting snipped soon :)
