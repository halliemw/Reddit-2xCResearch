Maybe you could discuss her motivations and try to get her involved in something she would have control over and that would let her feel included and not weird. For example, my brother found like minded kids when volunteering at the animal shelter, and it was something he could pretty much do on his own and could determine by himself to some extent. She also might find more acceptance in certain communities. I know our marching band was full of misfits and weirdos but we all had each others' backs because we all didn't fit in anywhere else. Offering to support her if there's anything she wants to get involved in might be a good way to give her a sense of control and a sense of belonging and that might help her not feel like she should be having sex right now, especially if her motivations are all the wrong reasons.
