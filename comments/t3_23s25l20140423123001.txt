Look, abusive relationships are not as simple as people make them seem.  People want to act like they are a battle between good and evil, with one person being the monster and the other the victim. 

That's not what really happens in most cases.  In most cases, the parties still have strong feelings for each other, and the reason people stay in abusive relationships is that there is still a lot of "good" and the good oftentimes outweighs the bad, at least in their minds.  It seems like in your relationship there was still a lot of "good" that was irrationally clouding your emotions and making you ignore the bad.  That feeling of "love" is a powerful fucking drug. 

And your ex sounds like he's a guy going through some terrible mental problems.  He obviously has some serious issues but he also does seem to feel some remorse and care about you. 

But here's the thing: you need to just leave and not look back.  From an emotional standpoint, it makes sense for you to still long for it, but rationally you just can't have this person in your life.  It is wrecking your self esteem and inflicting physical damage on your body.  You need to cut all contact and move on.  This guy has problems and hopefully he will get them solved one day, but that's not your responsibility right now.  You can't waste your time trying to figure out what he's thinking because to be honest crazy people are complicated and you will never figure it out.
