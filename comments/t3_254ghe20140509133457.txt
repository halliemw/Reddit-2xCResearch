I would LOVE to! But PCOS :( Lately I've been using a stick epilator on chin and sideburns - hurts like a bitch, but it's so nice not having to shave in the shower every day! Hoping I eventually damage the follicle enough it quits growing :\

But yes! I did the sock bun a while back and it was uber cute.
