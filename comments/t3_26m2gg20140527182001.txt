(Ramble ahead. Read at your own risk.)

My mother ... she's not exactly a narcissist, she's not borderline, I don't know WTF she is except controlling and toxic. I just found a diary I kept when I was 19, and wow. So many memories. Ugh. She'd scream at me if I headed toward the bath at 9:01 instead of 9:00. She'd lunge at me if I was on the phone for five minutes, one second instead of five minutes. She'd berate me ad nauseam through the bathroom door (it takes as long as it takes, a'ight?) if I left a single spoon on the drainboard, but when I was able to come out she'd already put it away.

She'd insist I keep my bedroom door open, claiming that one one was going to invade my privacy ... except that's all she ever did. Barge in without knocking, demand use of my printer, then stand there and criticize my housekeeping while she waited. If I minimized a window as she came in, she accused me of behaving suspiciously, of acting like I had something to hide. Not that there was anything wrong with what I was looking at, but she **would** criticize at length and make me feel as though I was responsible for its existence and ought to feel terribly ashamed of it. (Not religious, by the way!)

Among other things as I was growing up, she barely let me do anything or go anywhere or have many friends. And she wonders why I'm not setting the world on fire with my amazing life skills. She was always verbally attacking me over inconsequential things: "Why are you doing it ***that*** way?" with such a disdainful sneer. As if it mattered. As if it affected her.

She nearly ruined my wedding by continually insisting that things go the way *she* wanted them.

I can't have a phone "conversation" with her without wanting to scream and strangle her. I can't get a word in edgewise, even after she asks me a question. The longer I go without contact from her, the better I feel. But inevitably she will contact me and want to take me to lunch, and how can I say no to free food I don't have to cook?

She's my mommy and I'm her baby and she loves me so much and she's my biggest fan and why can I never say "I love you" back to her when she says "I love you" to me? Could it be she always told me I was a terrible liar? I've had a really hard time saying "I love you" to anyone. I physically struggled with those words to my fianc√© and broke down into a sobbing wreck once they were out (didn't help that he used my name when he told me he loved me).

This is getting long and painful. I'ma stop now.
