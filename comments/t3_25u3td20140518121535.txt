The important thing with operating weed whackers is personal protective equipment. When I started using a gas one around 13 years old, I wore jeans, steel toed shoes or cleats depending on the weather, a long sleeve flannel shirt, safety glasses, and a hard hat with a screen that pulled down over my face and ear plugs. The weed whacker was strapped to a harness that meant the actual flying string part physically could not reach my body. We also lived on the steep side of a mountain and on a gravel road, so a lot of the yard was very steep and couldn't be mowed and we had to keep the sides of the road clear. I threw up a lot of rocks and got hit once or twice, but nothing got through the layer of fabric, and I did some sliding down hills and things like that but never managed to really get more than a small bruise here and there. Even flying glass isn't likely to be at the right angle to cut through loose-ish fabric and skin, so you're pretty safe if you're covered and it's nothing to be afraid of. Now that I'm a young adult and stupid, I often go without the hard hat and long sleeves, but the eye protection and pants are vital since your eyes don't always recover well and most of what gets thrown, especially heavy stuff like rocks, hits below the waist.
