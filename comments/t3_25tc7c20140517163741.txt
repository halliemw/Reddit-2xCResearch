There are smaller phones out there such as Moto X, Moto G, and Moto E that may fit in your pocket. The X is around the size of the S3 and they get smaller (and cheaper) from there. They're all high quality phones unlike many of the budget offerings by other manufacturers (the G and X both cost under $200 off contract). There are few Windows Phones that may be nicely small and all Windows Phones run nearly flawlessly due to much better optimization compared to Android or iOS. Just look for things around 4.5 inches or smaller. 

Although I'm a guy and have pockets big enough to fit a 7 inch tablets into, I still prefer the smaller phones because my hands aren't big enough to use huge phones comfortably the way I want to hold them.
