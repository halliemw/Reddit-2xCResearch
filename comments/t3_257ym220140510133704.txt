Years ago, my best friend and I had a running joke about how he was cursed when it came to the fan on northbridge chips (the memory controller) on computer motherboards -- they always died on him. Then one day, MY nb fan ate it, and we had a really good laugh about how he was ruining my shit from 2000 miles away. I replaced the fan with a heatsink and all was good. 

Weeks later, I was telling another friend (also a dude) about the whole fan joke and how I was laughing right up until I had to try to get the new heatsink installed with adult-sized ham-hands instead of the tiny toddler hands that the fucking screws in the set were clearly designed for. I thought it was funny. My best friend thought it was funny. The other guy? 

"I can't even tell you how cute it is that you know what a northbridge chip is."

Cue the biggest eyeroll of my life up to that point. Ugh.
