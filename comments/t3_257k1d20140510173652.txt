I would also add that there are different levels of hormones in pills. Some are the exact same dose every pill (monophasic),  some have 2 different levels over the course of a month (biphasic),  and some have 3 different levels usually each week is different (triphasic). Women react differently to these,  for example,  triphasic and biphasic pills make me emotionally crazy (I was seriously a raging mess when I tried ortho-tri-cyclen when it came out in the 90s),  but monophasic pills are great for me, no mood effects at all. 

So,  if you are trying different pills to find one that works for you,  be aware of this and be willing/ask to try a different formulation,  you may be pleasantly surprised.
