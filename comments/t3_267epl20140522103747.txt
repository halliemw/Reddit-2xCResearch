Girl who was pregnant who completed pre requisites and is currently going through to be a registered nurse here and i am saying congrats!! I was unsure if I would be able to complete my school with a full time 9 hour job. I will say this, the battle is hard after baby is born. Because you feel very compelled to stay at home instead of finishing school. I was enrolled even during my delivery as I submitted most of my work in advance; final exams were still due on my due date. But I managed. My baby drove me to be what I wanted to be and I wanted a better life than a mom who works at a dead end job. I commend you for doing what you can do with what you have and remember (I feel this to be true when I didnt have a whole lot of money coming in when I was on leave due to me not fulfilling STD correctly.) ((Which by the way if you have company insurance please upgrade STD for the few bucks a month that way your weekly payments wont be 600 but atleast a full paycheck a week)) things will come together, atleast they always have for me. My ends end up meeting together so dont lose hope. Youre a strong women!!
