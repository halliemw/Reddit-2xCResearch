Nope your fingers don't get bloody because all of the blood flows directly INSIDE the cup, so it doesn't actually touch the outside of the cup. When you remove it, you are only touching the outside of the cup. 


It lasts for up to 12 hours, but if you do happen to be out and need to empty it, you can simply empty it into the toilet and reinsert it. Then just clean it off the next time you empty it and you are home. You could also wet a napkin and bring it into the stall with you if you want to wipe it down, but you don't have to. Just make sure you wash your hands before you enter the stall.
