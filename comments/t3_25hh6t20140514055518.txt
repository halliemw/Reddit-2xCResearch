Well, it's not an absolute, it's a starting point and you should consider the sister sizes and different shapes of boobs too. Also, some companies are terribly inconsistent with their bras so you might randomly run across one that runs too big or small. 

I don't understand the hate for suggesting that someone might be wearing the wrong size bra when *so many* women really are doing just that. If you don't care, it's really easy to ignore which takes a lot less effort than getting mad at someone trying to help you.
