If you get the jet-typ of pepper spray it doesn't create a cloud, so you don't risk blinding yourself. It's also the self defense weapon that requires least training. The first time I used it was in a crisis situation and the guy was shocked (so he backed off) and was temporarily blinded.

The important thing when using pepper spray is that you HAVE to follow up with something - run away while the aggressor is still blinded/shocked, or attack him and make sure he doesn't pose a threat anymore. If it's more than one person, spray them and run.

A knife requires SERIOUS training to be more protection than danger, especially considering it's illegal to carry (at least where I live), you can stab someone without having immediate effect (if you don't cut the stomach open or something like that, it usually takes a while for a stab to cause serious trouble for the stabbed). Many times people who bring a knife to a fight end up stabbed themselves.

I recomend:

* Pepper spray, jet type (easy to use, immediate effect, probably won't cause you harm.)

* Self defense/martial arts, like the mentioned philipino styles, krav maga (self defense), muay thai (my favorite martial art) or regular boxing. If you practice boxing/muay thai two times a week you will soon be able to take out most people if you get the first hit. It can be just as effective, if not more, than advanced self defense technique.

Martial arts is also a great way to improve confidence and make your life more fun!

* Expendable baton, requires less training than a knife (allthough some), gives more pain than your average stab: more immediate reaction. Keep your distance, it's useless in close up combat.

* Brass knuckles, requires no special training like a baton or a knife, but you should only use it if you feel like you could, and would, throw a punch. If you don't want to practice martial arts on a regular basis, take boxing lessons for a month and get a brass knuckle. You will be able to take out anyone.

* And, if you really get serious about learning how to use it, a knife. But I don't recomend it if you want a simple and convenient way to be safer.

Also it's good to think about other items than just weapons. Get a beer/soda/whatever in a 33 cl glass bottle on your way home, keep a fist-size rock in your purse, etc.
