The Nuvaring made me feel suicidal! I only had it in for three days and I have never felt so depressed. The pill didn't make me feel like that. But I think he pill killed my libido.

Now I've had a copper iud for about a year and a half. I love not having something hormonal, though I've got almost constant cramps that drive me a little crazy. I still prefer the pain over the hormones though. And my libido is good!
