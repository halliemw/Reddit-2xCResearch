I've had 3 IUDs.  One expelled, one I had for 5 years, and my current one has been in for about 2 months.  The insertions weren't painful for very long.  It hurts, I won't lie, but it doesn't last.  They put a clamp on your cervix, and it only hurts as long as the clamp is on, which in my experience is about 30 seconds.  They'll measure your uterus, then put the insertion device in, insert the IUD, and remove everything.  You can even have them tell you what they're doing as you do it, so you know how close they are to being done.  You'll be okay.
