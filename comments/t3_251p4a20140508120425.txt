The onus of EVERYTHING, not just rape, is always on the perpetrator. I should be able to sleep naked on a sidewalk, or on a male friend's sofa, and not get raped. Nobody ever has a right to help themselves to someone else's body, including if they are a past sexual partner. If I'm blackout drunk, my loving live-in boyfriend does not have a right to have sex with me. I become incapable of consent.

Saying "What could we do better next time" is insulting to the victim. People should be free to make bad/uninformed decisions and learn from them without having people victimize them for it. The worst she should get from over drinking is feeling crappy the next morning, not getting raped.
