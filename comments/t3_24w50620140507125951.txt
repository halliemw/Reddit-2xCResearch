>I've literally never heard a pro-lifer say abortion is unsafe irl

I don't know if it's going out of style, but I used to hear the factoid about it making people infertile pretty often. Maybe it's just a rumor that runs in certain circles. I think if there's even one person who wants an abortion but won't do it out of fear, that makes a video like this worth it.
