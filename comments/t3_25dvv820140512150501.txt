When you're in an abusive relationship, it's hard to gain the perspective you need to see the abuse. If you've seen evidence of abuse, especially repeated abuse, you need to help. In my opinion, the best thing to do is contact social services for help at the very least. Contacting the police wouldn't hurt either.

 I dated a girl who had been abused physically and emotionally by her ex. She let it drag on for months before working up the courage to help herself. What made it even worse (if that's possible) is that because she took a long time to report the incidents, her case was dismissed by the authorities (something to do with waiting 6 months after the last attack and them having broken up in the interim).

The longer this goes on, the longer the healing process. I feel like there is nothing more inexcusable than abusing those who care about you.
