What *is* disrespectful to the other person is to tell them, or deliberately give them the impression, that you have feelings for them that you don't actually have, in order to justify having sex.

I think the idea that it's wrong or disrespectful to have casual sex stems from a confusion based on assuming that sex, inherently, communicates that you're in love or want a relationship.  If you make that assumption, then casual sex is inherently disrespectful because you're doing what I described in the first paragraph, merely through the act of having sex.

Ironically, though, it's this assumption that leads to people doing that very thing.  Because if you hold this view that sex is only legit if you have those feelings, you may try to fool yourself or the other person in this way, when actually all you want is sex and that's all they might want too.  If you were honest about it it could be done respectfully, but the idea that it cannot be done respectfully and legitimately becomes a cycle that causes itself.
