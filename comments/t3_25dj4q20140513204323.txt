I'm an older lass with a a homosexual horde. I've known me some babby gays to grown ass elderfags. This is my take on your situation. 

Sometimes (not all) some young gay males in the process of coming out and realizing themselves as adults think it's cute to break boundary lines. They do stupid shit like go after straight boys who are obviously straight (like your man), or they may think it's ok to grab a girl's tits (I've gotten that a lot since I'm well endowed). Or just be really outrageous in what they say and do. They think they're being cute and funny, and often it can be until they cross a boundary that they shouldn't, like trying to make out with your boyfriend. 

I just want to be crystal, this isn't a "gay culture" thing. This is a bullshit immature thing that just so happens runs rampant with gay boys. I've known young straight &amp; gay girls that do somewhat similar behavior in seeking attention, &amp; straight boys have their own methods. So, yes you should call him on his shit. He needs to learn that it's not ok to try to mouthbreathe with someone else's boyfriend, no matter what 'signals' he thinks he's getting. He owes you both an apology. If he makes excuses and doesn't give you any he's being a child and you should put some distance from him. You don't need that shit. Being gay is no excuse for being an ass. 

Edit: I just want to say I also know plenty of gay folk who are chill awesome folk that don't use being gay as an excuse to behave a certain way. Most grow out of it, I think if you approach your friend not with anger but more like 'hey dude, just wanted to say it's not cool what you did. I still like you as a friend and all but I just want to let you know that shit ain't cute.'  Reassuring but direct. He may be doggy now because he is afraid of losing your friendship or being punished or yelled at. People make mistakes, shit happens. Just talk it over calmly and hopefully it'll all work out.
