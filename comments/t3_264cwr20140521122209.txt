Dump this guy, he's going to cheat on you if he hasn't already. The problem is you seem to like him more than he likes you, so despite his "joking" and putting down women in general, you will stay with him because you falsely think you can correct this behavior. You can't change him, only he can change himself. If he's under the age of 25 there's a chance he will mature and behave like a man in the future, but who knows.
