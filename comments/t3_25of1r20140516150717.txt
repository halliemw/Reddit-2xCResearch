The best self-defense move for a woman is excellent cardiovascular fitness, and the ability to run fast for 6 city blocks.  Any weapons carried can be taken away by a determined attacker and used against the target.  

One very good takedown move--say a strong kick to the side of the knee--and then running like hell while screaming "Fire" or "Mad Dog" was what was recommended for me. (These will bring attention, whereas a call of "Rape" or "Murder" might be ignored as a prank or joke, sadly.) It is a misconception that a strike or kick to the genitals will disable a male attacker--an assailant on meth or adrenaline can and has been known to chase another male attacker for blocks for revenge.

And yes, for what it's worth, I am one of the "one out of four".  Unfortunately for me, I was four years old at the time, and there was a gang of six attackers, so I was gang raped. 

Another thing to consider is the life-altering decision of whether or not one is willing to kill to save one's own life.  Without going into a long story, I was enrolled by a police detective in a gun course: "Close Range Defensive Shotgunning" while living next door to a known meth cooker, dealer, and arsonist. The course, and the detective, made the situation very clear to me: killing this man was a strong possibility, and one recommended by the police should he come after me or the property with a gas can in hand. 

Watching fake violence on the screen, and being willing and able to use deadly force in person are two very different things.  If the situation calls for it, and the law allows it, sometimes pulling the trigger could be the difference between survival and death.  But that is a choice each of us has to make for herself/himself.
