> Women are taught that they primarily must be small/dainty/delicate/slim and otherwise physically more slight than males in order to be attractive

YES! This is her main issue! She's tall, very athletic, and strong. Damn near Amazonian. She will never be "dainty", but she wants to be. It pisses me off that she gets that kind of pressure at her age. I know it hits everyone...but still. It pisses me off. She should revel in what makes her unique....but she's 13.

She is heavily involved in sports that use her size to an advantage; horseback riding, volleyball, long distance running. She's expressed an interest in martial arts, but one of the other activities has to go before we add more. Family rule. 

>she's worried about finding a guy taller than her to date

I think this is a big part of it. It wasn't a huge deal until the past few years, and I think some of her crushes have been put off by her height. She hasn't said anything and shrugs it off if I ask....but I'm pretty sure that's a big part of it.

She's a smart kid...she knows that things will change as she ages and the boys catch up. But it still bothers her...I get that. It's normal and temporary...but seeing her upset about her own body upsets me.

Thanks for the advice.
