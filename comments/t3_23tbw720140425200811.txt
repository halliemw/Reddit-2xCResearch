I'm not sure. I watch some good TV, but I tend to allow it to accumulate, rather than watch it steadily. It's comforting in a weird way--like at least my life isn't this badly contrived, I guess?  

I have an internship over the summer, but it's at a small business so our work hours are sporadic at best, and there isn't a ton of growth opportunity. They make ice cream, so I get all my ice cream free!  If you're ever in Minnesota, I'll hook you up--potentially.  

Where are you moving? What do you do for work?
