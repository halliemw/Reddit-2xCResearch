Yes the internet held a meeting recently to discuss its stance on women and women's rights.  Sorry women, now the internet is against you too... Sarcasm aside, the internet is far too broad to make a statement like this. Are there people out there who will be misogynistic, sexist, racist, etc.? Yes absolutely, have you read youtube comments lately?  To act like women are the main culprits of the bad things on the internet is ridiculous.  When you have an avenue to share thoughts and ideas, there are going to be people who disagree with you (especially over controversial things) and since the internet has no consequences for saying whatever you want (i.e. people can hide behind their keyboards) then you will get sick and twisted responses from people.  However, there are also places like this sub that are fantastic places for people to share ideas, get advice, or just talk about things.
