I didn't have much PMS (I only got sad, not angry), but what I had went away with the pill. Also: I no longer have severe cramps (I still get pain, but they're mostly manageable with painkillers), and the bleeding is very much reduced, and I like being regular. (Never have been, without.) In any case, you can stop it any time if you don't like it, but definitely give it a try for a month or three.

Bonus: Reliable contraception, that's very important for me. I cannot fault your SO for not wanting to risk pregnancy. It's his choice, too.
