Who you're attracted to also changes with your natural hormones and as you age. I promise you, no girl has ever broken up with her boyfriend because birth control made her not attracted to them. Also, Scientific American is a sensationalist news source, not a medical journal. 

Birth control can lower your sex drive, but it doesn't make it go away completely. I've never, ever heard of birth control doing anything like that to your breasts, and me and all my female friends have been on many different birth controls for 10 years. We're all totally fine. And much better off for having been on birth control actually.
