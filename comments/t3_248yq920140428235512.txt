I've been feeling the same way recently. I'm in tip top condition physically, working a good job, have a loving man and have good friends. I still feel completely alone at times. I don't know if I'm at the brink of depression or it's some kind of hormonal fluctuation. What I do find helps is actually spending time alone and writing/ expressing myself. Also, focusing on others can take my mind off things - I'm a nurse, so I get paid to do this, which is awesome.

I hope you figure this out soon OP. Maybe seek help/ therapy before it gets worse?
