I am really happy that you had the courage to get out of that terrible situation, and I hope your life continues to improve now that you have been able to get away from it somewhat.  One of my coworkers comes into work with bruises on her face, more often than I would consider normal for a "clumsy person" which is how she explains it.  She says she hit herself with the car door, or some person randomly punched her at a party, which to me sounds suspicious.  I've talked to her, and have tried to let her know that she has friends and a place to stay if there is something happening, however she just smiles and says she would never be with someone who would do that to her.  I suppose it's possible that it really is all a misunderstanding, I just really don't know and something seems off to me.  I know there isn't much I can do until she is ready, I just wish there was.
