I was also molested by a woman. I'm a guy, though, if that's still relevant. Luckily it wasn't physically violent, and I was so young many of the details are fuzzy. I don't know about you, but it's never been taken seriously when I've told someone. I can't blame people- if it hadn't happened to me I might not think it was serious, either. It seems like a really unrecognized problem, even counselors haven't taken it seriously. 


But please don't blame yourself for what happened to your friend. The only people responsible for that are Tina and whoever messed her up like that.
