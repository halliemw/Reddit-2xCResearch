Mostly.  I sympathize to some degree because most colleges haven't done a very good job of defining what exactly rape is.  It's non-consensual sex, sure, but what exactly counts as non-consensual?  Under what circumstances is consent vitiated?  How drunk is too drunk, for example?  Where is the line on something like "coercion?"

Consent, in a sexual context, isn't particularly well defined, and that should be changed.  It seems like everyone has their own personal definition of terms like: consent, coercion, incapacitated, and the like.  It really muddies the waters and is supremely unhelpful from a sexual violence prevention perspective.
