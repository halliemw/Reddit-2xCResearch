I have tiny friends who feel bloated before they poo, too. I'm not tiny but if I hit a patch of constipation my pants feel tight/uncomfortable as well.
I was more taking umbrage with the phrasing that your tummy was so flat because you pooped so often, which implies people with a spare tire need to just poop more to get a flat stomach.

As far as the link goes, there are tons of resources on the web about how to get a flat stomach... I tend to take them with a grain of salt, especially if they don't have medical data to back up their claims.
