We're trying, trust me. Our current health minister is a creationist. I mean that literally, he believes that the world is 6000~ years old. He also believes gays aren't allowed to give blood incase they pass on the gay (blood donation here is illegal for any man that has ever had sex with another man, ever in their entire lives) even though half our blood supplies come from England where they aren't this strict. My country is a fucking disaster.
