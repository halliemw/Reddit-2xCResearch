Depending on where you are while deployed, uniform and appearance regs may not be well enforced at times. Kandahar Airfield? There's going to be a post exchange (think Walmart or Target for the military) and plenty of places to get your hair cut. Some patrol base out in the middle of wheretheeffarewe accessible only by chopper? Odds are no one cares unless your leadership is kinda dumb...
