well, i live in the American south and call everybody ma'am. my toddler nieces, the high-school checkout girls at my grocery store, coworkers, my mom... here, at least, it's more a blanket word you can use when addressing a female, and doesn't have anything at all to do with the age of the addressee. sometimes it feels more polite, sometimes it just slips out.  
if any of you don't like the term, what is it about being called ma'am that offends you?
