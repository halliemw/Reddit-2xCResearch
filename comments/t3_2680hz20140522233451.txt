I definitely feel you on that one. This especially became a problem for me when I started opening up to men and pursuing relationships with them. With women things felt very mutual and considerate, but as soon as I started being more open to the idea of dating guys I found myself constantly questioning "Why do I even bother?" 

People get so caught up in loneliness (or sometimes ego) that they project their desires onto someone else instead of accepting them for who they are. There will always be a struggle with this in  one way or another(hence my post), but rest assured that there are people out there willing to give you the consideration and sincerity that you offer them, they just present themselves when you least expect it. 

I didn't really even have an attraction to my current boyfriend when I first met him, but once we got to know each other, it became insatiable. It wasn't until I was comfortable with being alone and independent that I found a great relationship right in front of me. Just keep your head up, even when it's hard.

And for what it's worth, I'm interested in seeing your artwork and talking, if you feel like doing so. You should PM me:)
