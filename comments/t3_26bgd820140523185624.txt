I wish I could give you a hug darling, but there are days in everyone's lives that are harder than others, and yet you still need to go out and put on that smile in front of your coworkers and keep your shit together. Cry it out now, take a deep breath, splash some water on your face. You got this. You're strong. Just keep it together for today.
