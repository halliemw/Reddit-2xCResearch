I got mine inserted 6 months ago while on my period


It's been great, though. I got it for free at my local county health department.I didn't get any numbing because they were not allowed for some reason to numb it. I'm not going to lie, I almost cried when it got inserted, but it was 5 minutes of pain for 10 years of protection.

Ummm, cons would be that I get heavy periods with super bad cramps. For the first few days I was cramping, unhappy, and taking pain killers to help. After that, it was all good until my period. Holy Hell. I was overfilling my divacup to the point of it leaking... Every two hours. 

After that first period, my body had two normal periods (super light for me). And then I had another Hell period. So far it's worked out so that every third period is a killer. 

A second con would be that I wound up getting cervixitis, vaginitis, etc. My doctor said it's likely from the iud, since I'm STD free. Either way, meds cleared that up, and I'm fine.

Pros. All of them. 10 years of protection. No hormones. No having to worry about taking it on schedule. No weight gain. I get to keep my periods (I get paranoid and it's nice to get extra reassurance that everything is good). It's super effective! 

In general, I love it. No regrets
