Not saying that this is what I believe- but this seems to be what the guys over at r/mensrights are discussing:

Luke, a man, and Leia, a female, both have the same job- one that needs certain physical requirements, such as lifting *x* amount of weight. Both are making the same amount of money, but when Luke was hired, he needed to demonstrate that he could lift *x* amount of weight, while Leia had to lift *x - y* amount of weight.

This type or argument usually comes up with jobs like lifeguard or firefighters.

**I repeat** this is not my view. I don't have enough knowledge in this field to discuss it with any certainty. I'm just providing the "explainations" I have heard.
