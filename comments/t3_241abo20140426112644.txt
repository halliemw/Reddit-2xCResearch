You gotta learn to be selfish and start treating yourself like your own friend. It's not uncommon to have feelings of loneliness after a breakup, but rather than focus on the 'I feel so alone' part, focus on the 'I'm free to be me' part. Think about yourself--think about taking care of yourself. What do you want to improve about you? What good things can you do for you? What small activities or big hobbies or actions could you perform to treat yourself to some fun and kindness?

Every time you start thinking of other people, remind yourself that you're a person and you're there with you. Commit what you're doing to memory. Concentrate on the beauty of the landscape, or the taste of a meal, or the pleasure of reading a book. Acknowledge that it's quieter alone but nobody's threatening or scaring you either, and that there's a very comfortable sort of safety to be had when it's just you doing what you want.

Also, try not to do things you and your ex used to do. If you guys used to go to the beach, find a nature trail or a greenway you've never been to. Pick up a new hobby, anything from bird watching to working out, and make it all about yourself and what you enjoy. The truth of the matter is, we're all so infinitesimally small and fleeting that an experience shared or an experience taken alone matter nothing in the grand scheme of the universe. What really matters is becoming comfortable in your body living with yourself, because there's only one you and you have to live with her. Once you get to love and appreciate yourself, finding new friends and lovers who treat you the way you deserve will become much easier.
