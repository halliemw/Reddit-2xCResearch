it may seem kind of odd since I am not a White woman myself, but it just upsets me. I think it is just that western white women won't take their BS thus they harbor so much hatred towards them. Ugh, I wish my Asian sisters would soon follow suit. However, it doesn't help that these expats are seem as having high status because they are westerners.
