Sorry for your loss. I miss my dad too. From a post I read earlier today...  

>I've always been pretty fascinated with space.  
When I was a little girl, my dad would take his ladder and put it on our lawn every night and bring me outside to tell me he put the moon up for me. I believed him for years. He passed away a few years ago, and every night, when I see the moon I think of him.
