I got married 4 years ago, and we spent roughly 7500 on the whole thing, for 175 guests. My dress was $600, though I could have gotten a $99 if I needed to. I got my bridesmaid dresses at Deb for $70 each! And actually, I wanted to point out that we got a 15% discount because the dresses were for a wedding.. Just sayin.

My husbands ring is white gold to match mine, and he found one he liked for $300 at Kay, mine's from Shane Co. We spent $600 to rent our location, the food was $15 and DELICIOUS, and we had a cake bar. Our personal cake was $20 from Cub Foods (it was beautiful, simple and delicious) and we also got our flowers from Cub for about $700. We had a traditional ceremony in a church, and 

Like everyone else is saying, make it something that you will enjoy. Choose what is important to you:) I am happy to give you more numbers on what I had at mine, but I didn't want to ramble too much. There are a lot of things I could've cut out to save money and it would have been just as beautiful.
