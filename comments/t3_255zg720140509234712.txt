I was in a youtube coma one day and randomly came across Randy Pausch's Last Lecture. It wasn't what I thought it would be, but it was very inspiring. I bought the book shortly after and even though I'm not facing a huge health issue, it was still really inspiring.   
   
It made me want to make my life really count, even if it's only to a few people that I love. I recommend it as often as possible.
