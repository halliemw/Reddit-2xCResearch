You can't have a poster that almost literally says "look what these *men* are doing! They are stopping us from wearing what we want" and not expect, rightfully so, that you will alienate and turn the male demographic against you.


Also, "harder to accustom to". This doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So, you're arguing that it will be hard for kids with no dress code to become used to dress codes after school. Which means your school is *doing the correct thing*. 

>So all this strict junior high one does is make it more likely that we will dress even more scandalously with the lack of code for 3 years

This is foolish. Only kids with no self-control would do this. "You know, because of the law saying I had to be 21, I never drank before. I think I should become an alcoholic for a couple of years, just to kind of even it out, ya know?".

You need to start accepting some responsibility. The dress code might not be fair, but if you go through life thinking that everyone is going to treat you fairly, its going to be a system overload the moment you turn 18.
