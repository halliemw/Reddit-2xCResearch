Having different priorities is totally fine - yours are more centered around personal success, and OP's reach into the realm of helping other women. She has decided that's an important thing for her to do. Would you appreciate it if someone questioned things you find important as useless? What is your goal in doing that to OP? Do you want to dissuade her from her interests? Why?
