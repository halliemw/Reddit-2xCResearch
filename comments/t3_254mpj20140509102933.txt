So to the nurse and tech the blood was probably nothing much. Obviously this really sucked for you, but they deal with so much blood and pee, and shit and mucous and pus that I doubt this phased them.

But it was totally inappropriate that they didn't close the door or privacy curtain. I'd recommend writing or calling the hospital about this, because of the privacy issues.
