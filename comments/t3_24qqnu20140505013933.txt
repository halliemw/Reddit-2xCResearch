I worked part-time during undergrad, but it definitely didn't make enough to pay for rent. I'm still heavily dependent on my parents for financing my rent, food, and study. I've started taking loans out this year, but really only to cover tuition. Everything else is supported by my parents. 

The short term lease wouldn't have worked. A lot of this isn't about the money -- it's about the mental reasoning behind why I would do such a thing. Not going home during break doesn't make sense to my family, and would cause a LOT of unwanted drama. I often have to think about how my actions would influence the mood of the house. Even if I go home for one day and cause hell because I talked against my dad, it's usually my mom and my little sister (who only have one home to live in, whereas I have friends' apts, bf's apt, school apt, etc. to go to) who get the brunt of it. I don't want to cause stress where it's unneeded, and it really hurts me to see my dad yell at my mom for something I caused.

It's a sticky situation. But I'm glad you're a parent that sees the need for a child's independence. I've always been envious of my friends' parents who treat their children like that, and they have grown to be great people as a result. Sometimes I view them more as my mom and dad more than my own parents.
