The following is how I'd respond to your letter:

Dearest daughter,

Your letter speaks volumes in regard to your perception of yourself as independent adult without the desire or need of continued parental assistance or interference in your decision making processes.  

Of course, I respect your decision to be an independent adult, but, as you're aware, adults are financially responsible for themselves.  Naturally, I would loathe to condescend to you with my continued financial support, so I withdraw it - effective immediately.

As always, I love you, and too thank you for your gratitude and appreciation on Mother's Day.

Love Mom x
