WTG!  I lost 80 pounds in 2011-2012.  Then my Dad got sick and I was back and forth from my place to his (across the state), worrying about him and undoing all I had done.  Back on track now and 40 pounds down, but I've figured out I need Weight Watchers, if anything, for the accountability.  Not pushing WW, or ANY program, just what works for me.
