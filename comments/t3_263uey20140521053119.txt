If she was unable to give consent she was non verbal, too incoherent to form words. Was she comatose, no, but the analogy is fair. The only offense here is people (not all ) trying to undermine the OP, to invalidate her. Yup, this is why so many sub users wish this place was not a default. Women come here looking for a safe place to talk about complex issues and bitter vultures sweep in and try to derail the process. Sad and telling that you are probably enjoying this.
