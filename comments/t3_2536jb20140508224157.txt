This right here^ As someone who has seen various people taking welbutrin and studied it in school. Often people see side effects like this and some nausea for the first 7-10 days then they seem to diminish significantly. Hang in there a little while longer, if this feeling lasts or your still having trouble sleeping for more than 10 days, that's when it's time to talk to the doctor.
