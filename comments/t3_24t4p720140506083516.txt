> obese patients vastly underestimate the amount of calories they are eating 

The woman in this article is surely doing this if she says she is eating 1800 calories a day and is a US size 24.  I'm a guy, I'm 5'8'' and I weigh 155lbs. I need to eat ~2500 calories a day to maintain my current weight.  1800 calories is not a lot of calories.  This woman would be losing weight if she eats 1800 calories a day.  By looking at the photos she definitely weighs more than me, so the amount of calories she needs to eat to maintain her weight is going to be higher.
