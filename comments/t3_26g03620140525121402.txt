It may just be from personal experience, but I just have a hard time believing that someone who was let out and attacked another person two months later won't do it again, no matter how 'rehabilitated' he seems. Its good that he will have someone with him when he goes out, but how long will that last for? Are they going to keep paying for that and an ankle monitor for the rest of his life?
