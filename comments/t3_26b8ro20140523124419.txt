I think the idea of a petition where you put your username would be interesting. The mods have said, and fairly so, that a poll would get linked to from other reddit spots and it may be the same with petitions.

I don't think continued input is bad at all, I'm happy to sign or vote in any poll or comment on meta posts I see. I do think the sub will not switch back to default, I think the mods are seeing the stories of "I never would have found this place without default" and patting themselves on the back about that (to which I say I found twox years ago and it really wasn't that hard). 

Overall I think most users who are frustrated with the change would do better to find other subs they like instead of trying to revert this one
