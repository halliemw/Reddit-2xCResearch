Thank you for your compliments, and for expressing your concerns so thoughtfully.

The mod team was (and is still) concerned about the effect that the default decision would have on the community. One of the aspects we were MOST worried about is the effect that defaulting would have on Image Fest Friday.  I know there were quite a few negative/jerky comments on your post, and we're glad to hear you are ok and still feel like we've got your back.
