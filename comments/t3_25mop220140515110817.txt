I agree with the others who say therapy. Maybe he would be more amenable to group therapy - a lot of people whose anxiety is worsened by therapy focusing solely on THEIR issues do better when in a group, because it lets them deflect/turn attention away from themselves. They also get to see that their problems are universal, and by forgiving others in group for being imperfect, they help themselves.
