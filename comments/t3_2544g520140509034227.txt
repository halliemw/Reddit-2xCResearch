For months I thought I'd had a yeast infection or BV that I just couldn't get rid of. Cakey yellow discharge, the awful smell, no matter how many times I washed or used treatments, both prescribed and OTC. Itching that would keep me up at night to the point where the only relief I could get was sleeping with a cold wet towel between my labia. Only after seeing my gyno did she diagnose me properly with a case of trichomonaiasis that my GP had either missed or ignored even after two visits for the same problem, as he'd passed it off as recurring BV. A week of prescription meds later I was the happiest I'd been in months because everything was back to normal and holy shit, you can't even imagine how incredible it is to just have regular discharge that bleaches your panties instead :|
