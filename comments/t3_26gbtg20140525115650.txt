Guilting someone into having sex is an extremely immoral action. Other people's bodies are not fucktoys and must be respected!

Get angry at *him* and cut all ties with this POS. He doesn't respect your desires and boundaries, this can get dangerous. There are plenty of really pleasant guys (and gals!) around, no need to stick with somebody who makes you feel shitty and gross.
