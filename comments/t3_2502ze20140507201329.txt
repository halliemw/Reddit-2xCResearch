Ick, I take it you've been to /r/feminisms or its ilk? I think, because this isn't explicitly even a feminist sub (despite it tending to swing that way in general), let alone a radfem one, most TERFs don't bother trying to argue their shit here. They're never very welcome and I think they'd rather not bother. Which is nice!
