For me, knowing what I'm up against, even if it's my worst fears, is easier than not knowing. Once you know either way you can start processing it. 

Also I lost my period for almost a year when I started college. I was so stressed out and it just went away. I talked to a doctor and apparently it's *extremely* normal to happen at least a few times in a gal's life.
