I do not think that I've ever seen slut shaming.

Maybe we are talking about Catholic schools and not public schools?

But every school I've taught at has similar rules for both genders.  Both genders were expected to dress casually for work, not like they were hanging out in the streets being risque or with their homies.

Showing up looking like Miley Cyrus with tiny shorts and a bikini top isn't professional for girls.

Showing up shirtless like some beach stud isn't professional for boys.

That being said, the only time I've felt the need to enforce dress code is when boobs or breast are hanging out excessively (like why even bother covering it up like).  I wouldn't let a guy dangle half a ball sack out the front of his pants either...

When all the teen girl stores stock short shorts or thin see through fabric, and yoga pants that show back and front crack... that's society saying that it wants girls to dress to show of their body... not equal rights activism or feminism.   I just don't buy it being about empowerment, I buy into that being about corporate america wanting women to think that showing more of their female parts empowers them instead of a successful career.

That being said, my wife complains when my package is emphasized by a pair of pants because other women will look at it... goes both ways.
