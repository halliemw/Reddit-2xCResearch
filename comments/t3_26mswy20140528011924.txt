This attitude actually colored my young life in a very bad way. I asked a girl out to a dance, and she said no. First time I had ever asked anyone out. I was embarrassed, but let it go. Later, I see the girl at the dance with someone else, and she tells me she would have rather gone with me, but I didn't try hard enough.

It took me years to realize how unhealthy that kind of persistence was. Fortunately, in thinking I needed to "earn" a relationship, I went through a lot of self improvement. Self improvement that ultimately turned me normal. So I didn't ever really turn into anything like this guy, but I look back and realize how creepy I was to think I needed to "earn" a relationship.
