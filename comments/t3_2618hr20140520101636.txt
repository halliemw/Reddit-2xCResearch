I reported everything; all the inappropriate replies and all the inappropriate PMs. It's the fact that I'm getting them for a handful of posts made on this sub is what concerns me and makes me hesitant to participate.

For the most part the mods are doing a good job but it still doesn't feel 'safe' here. If somebody makes a post about being raped and suddenly their bombarded with PMs saying they deserved it, it's far beyond what the mods can do keep order and civility.
