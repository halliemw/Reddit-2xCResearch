First, just a somewhat relevent/funny story. My fiance wears nothing but leggings- she finds them to be the most comfortable things to wear. After ~4 years together, I made a passing remark one day when she dropped something on the floor.

"Oh, your wearing your purple lace underwear today for me ;)"
She never realized that when they stretched, they became super transparent.

I only mention this because i think the issue is that the few are ruining it for the majority. Ripped jeans are not allowed in most schools if the rips are above the knees for the same reason. There **are** girls wearing jeans with rips in the crotch, yoga pants/leggings that become see-through when they bend over/stretch. Seeing some leg isn't distracting, but what type of underwear **is** (not limited to women either- at my high school the boys were often getting disciplined for the 'low-hanging pants' look). Maybe I just have a skewed view due to the shitty city I grew up in, but I think it might be an issue with the school's "zero tolerance" view of the system and makes them think the only way to stop it is to cut it out entirely.
