Drunk sex ≠ rape. I have been saying this for years but I get a lot of push back from various feminists. In our present society, radical feminists have twisted the word rape so much that many people are now unsure of what constitutes it. When I was in college I would hook up with guys all the time. We would get drunk at a party, have sex, not a big deal. Now-a-days, in some feminist circles, that would have been considered rape, or if I regretted the sex the next day I could have claimed I was drunk and therefore could not consent. I've had girl friends get drunk at a party and hookup, the next day they would ask if they were raped because they regretted it. I have to remind them that if you have sex while drunk and regret it the next day that doesn't necessarily constitute rape. You willingly had sex, you cannot go and ruin someone else's life because you changed your mind the next day. You weren't passed out, you were still able to make decisions, force wasn't used to make you consent. The word rape has been diluted from overuse. We need public awareness campaigns to let people know that drunk sex ≠ rape and that regretting having sex ≠ rape. There is too much public confusion about the topic.
