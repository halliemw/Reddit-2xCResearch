I have a fat coworker. She's pretty, she does everything any other girl does, curl her hair, wear clothes that fits her body, put on make up and smile to the boys. 

she said she'll never get a bf, even though she flirts, I just told her to be more straight forward and she'll find a guy. It works for me! Now I realize it might not that she's asking, because she's giving social cues that she is, but because boys are saying no. 

A boy saying no doesn't exist in my skinny body world. And I didn't know how weird that is until now.
