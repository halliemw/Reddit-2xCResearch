Does it really matter? Use he. Use she. No one really cares. I posted once that I owned a horse and the replies all came in referring to me as "she" or "her". I'm a man, it doesn't bother me. I regularly hear "she" or "her" being used as "gender neutral" (for example, when referring to an unknown or hypothetical child). I don't see that it's important.
