Yeah I get that it was set up to give teenagers and young college or university students a decent enough wage, but due to the economy going down the toilet and rising population numbers there are a lot of people who need work wherever they can get it. The minimum wage act wasn't set up to provide a healthy wage for a family of 4 but times change and the government should be able to cope with that and adjust their legislation to meet the needs of their people.
