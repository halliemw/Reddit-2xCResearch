She was at full four year old ridiculousness yesterday she was apparently going to fight through bad guys to rescue Vinnie the talking lizard (that is green and perfect ["**Not** green and purple, *Mommy*"])who dances only in the shade and not in the sun, because he'll dry up. Unfortunately I'm mean and she didn't get the chance to go fight bad guys because I wouldn't let her rip the wheels off her toy cars so she could build herself a new car to drive there... wherever 'there' was.
