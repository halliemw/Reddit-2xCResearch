GPA is a very narrow measure of academic success. GPA is not that important, but academic success is very important; the skills it requires are some of the most valuable.

Any job that's going to require well-articulated, timely analysis of technical material is going to be able to take advantage of someone with a good GPA, because that's what a good GPA is supposed to require.
