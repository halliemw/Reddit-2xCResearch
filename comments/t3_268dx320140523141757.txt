It seems that people have downvoted you because they disagree with you. I disagree with their decision, since you very much contributed an answer directly related to my question. Thank you for that.

I think people may have reacted to "people who are insignificant to me." Can I assume that people you place in this category are people who act negatively towards you? Or is this category more broad? (e.g. all strangers)
