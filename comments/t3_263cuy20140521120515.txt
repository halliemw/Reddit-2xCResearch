Ugh that's the worst, I've definitely been in the vicious cycle of "Hey, we need to hang out and catch up!" "Oh my gosh yes! Let me know when you're free." but then you never end up doing anything. Maybe try to approach things with "Hey, what are you doing (insert specific day)?" Because I'm sure you're a wonderful friend that they would love to get to know better.
