It is clear emotional abuse. Someine who cares for you will only want you to do things that make you feel better about yourself in the long run. He is using you. Best way I've seen it put for guys: "Consent is a very low bar to aim for - if you're not getting enthusiasm she's not the right lady for you, move the fuck on."

My advice, don't hang out with this guy at all, he's getting in the way of you finding someone better and giving you emotional shit to deal with you don't need.
