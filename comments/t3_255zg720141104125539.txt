I know this is a long time after the original posting, so I don't expect you to really respond, plus life is most likely shit right now, but I love that you are taking the time to think about these kinds of things. I lost my father to cancer two years ago, and it was a much swifter process than yours. My seemingly healthy father was diagnosed one day with what looked to be mild lymphoma and then four months later he was gone, killed by a cancer the doctors could neither diagnose nor treat. I had just turned 18, but my siblings were so young, 12 and 7, that I wish he'd had time to think about and prepare memories for them like you're doing, because I wonder sometimes how much memories of their own they have of him. If there's one thing I would suggest, it's make sure you have a recording, whether video or just audio, of your voice. It's been over two years since I've heard my dad's voice and I've begun to forget the sound of it. Do that for your children, especially with how little they are. It might make them sad to hear it after you're gone, but it is better to remember the happy things and feel a twinge of sadness than to forget and be overwhelmed. You sound so brave, I wish you as much happiness and joy as you can pack in to your time left with them.
