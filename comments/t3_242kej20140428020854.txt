I'm in a completely different boat, so let me paddle over to yours and tell you all about it. Sometimes I feel like I don't know how to *not* be alone. I'm in college now and I want to make friends and start dating, but I don't know where to start. I've never been in a relationship, I've never even been kissed romantically. It's foreign to me. After moving to a new town, I'm only really close with my parents and my parrots. I don't make friends easily. This is what I do to fill my days: I play video games, I garden, I cook, I read, I clean, I do schoolwork (and procrastinate), I watch television, I go to the gym so I can unleash the badass within. I've found that by spending a lot of time with me and my thoughts, I've come to know myself a little better. (But there are still times when I feel so lonely it hurts.) I think you should explore new activities and make an adventure out of it. Learn something new. :)
