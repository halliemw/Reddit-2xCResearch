Thank you for sharing and I'm so happy for you that you found that baby book. 

I lost my mother when she was 50 (I was 20).  It's so hard going through each milestone without her. At first I was insanely envious of friends doing something as simple as hugging their mother or nagging her on the phone. These days I usually always think of her with a smile and I'm thankful for the memories I have and the time I got to spend with her. 

However, on mother's day, I still stay away from social media... it's too painful for me.
