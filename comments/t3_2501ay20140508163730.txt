The litmus test I use for irony is "there is an inherent contradiction", which I don't see here.

You could maybe say there's "an interesting parallel" in recording someone without consent each time. But since that's not really the salient feature in either case, it's at best an academic point. You have to recognize that OP isn't angry about having a random photograph of her taken without her noticing, she's concerned and frightened about the possibility of her own personal private nudity being released to public knowledge and access forever.
