Like bluntbangs I used to be a lazy ass. Worthless. I was so lazy I wouldn't even do homework that was as simple as have my mom sign this and bring it back. It got worse as I got older, hitting max at about...17-18? 

Now at 25, like you, my boss thinks I'm amazing (if only she knew I'm redditing right now:P), my boyfriend thinks of me as a clean and motivated individual, and my little sisters have a great role model on the surface. However, none of them know that I only do what I do so I don't get in trouble, lose my job, lose my house, etc. Fear of negative consequences is second only to guilt in motivational power in my reality bubble. 

If the girls ever ask me for life advice I don't really know what I'll say. "um, I don't know, I just do this stuff because society has put enough pressure on me that I feel obligated?" Thank goodness they're all sub 11 y/o and I've got a few years before these questions really fly at me.
