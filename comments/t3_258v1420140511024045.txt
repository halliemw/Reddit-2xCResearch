Oh! We were horrified at the thought of bleeding uncontrollably for a week. Our teacher made a point to say the flow varied but when she said heavy we assumed the worst. Niagara Falls worst. We were convinced we would have to spend days on the toilet, flushing sporadically. I can remember we compared our ages to that of the average age- only three more years until I'm 12, gotta live it up now! It was a popular topic on the playground that week.
