Does she have anyone to talk to besides the grandmother, about the changes that her body will go through?  Is there some type of sexual education at her school?  Maybe some form of counseling or just talking to a school nurse or teacher could help.  The grandmother is great too, but I feel that with some counseling she could probably open up more.  Sometimes is easier (in the mind of the teenager, less embarrassing) to talk to a someone outside the home.

The advice I wish someone had given me is that this was not my fault. That I wasn't doing anything wrong to deserve that attention and there was no reason to feel ashamed about the changes in my body and that it is their problem if they can't interact with girls. And to always feel comfortable and safe to ask questions or help of any kind should she ever need or want to talk about any of the things that bother her.  I would also tell her that she does not have to prove anything to anyone and to not give in to peer pressure or bullying, under any circumstance.  She must know that family and school are there to provide a safe environment for her.  

I also want to add to this is a tough one and you're doing a great job going out of your way to help both your mother and her.  Good luck to you all.
