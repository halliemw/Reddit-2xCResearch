That's awesome! You should totally carry goodies around! I dated a guy who volunteered at a sex ed organization and he was always giving me big boxes of condoms and dental dams. It was great, I had some left over well after we broke up. I felt ready for anything.

And yea, I was thinking she was sleeping with guys who didn't wear condoms too. I think vaginal condoms need to be easier to come by for that reason. Plus it seems like people forget about what else you can get from sex besides pregnant, and if she's a homeless sex worker she *really* should be using a condom of sorts. An STD/STI is the last thing anyone needs, especially in such a vulnerable situation.
