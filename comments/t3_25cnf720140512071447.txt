Yep - looks do matter in this world, and it would be silly to pretend otherwise (do you think uniforms just 'happened'?).

The problem is when you get caught thinking they are ALL that matters.

I would suggest affirmations, or just deliberate thinking, about other parts of what makes someone valuable; reminding yourself about the other things that are admirable  about yourself, coming up with something positive about every person you see go past when people watching (do they look relaxed? comfortable? focused? happy? like they have an interesting job? confident? calm? smart?  funny? like good company? in love?)
