Thanks for the response! 

Hm. Ugh. You're totally right, but maybe I'm just boring? I feel like the things I have in common with most people are so, well, common that it'd be silly to point them out. I like food, going out, books, tv. What else do I even like? Those things don't seem like enough to start a friendship over. What else is there? I feel like I don't have very high expectation of friends, just people I can hang out with and do things together, and talk about our thoughts. I feel like the best way to find those people is to be forced to hang out with a bunch of people for a long period of time (community living of some sort, a social, frequent meeting club, high school, etc) but I kinda missed out on a lot of those opportunities.


I'm also pretty into my field, but that goes back to the professional acquaintance thing.
