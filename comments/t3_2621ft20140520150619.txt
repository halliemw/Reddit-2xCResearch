According to [here](http://gotopless.org/topless-laws) and [here](http://www.munknee.com/going-topless-is-legal-in-these-u-s-states-canadian-provinces/) it is legal to be topless in Kansas. Your local city/county might have passed their own ordinance to make it "unlawful" but that's something you need to petition on the local level.

Also, the right for men to be "topless" only became legal in 1936 [source](http://www.munknee.com/going-topless-is-legal-in-these-u-s-states-canadian-provinces/) so its not exactly a founding principle of our country.
