I am older, and lived through the feminist movement of the 1970's. 

I struggled with the same issues other women did, of receiving a lower hourly rate than a guy hired at the same time, with the same (lack of) skills and less education than me, because "He'll be supporting a family someday."(!!!) Please note, we were both unmarried and living at our respective homes at the time, and that was the actual explanation offered when I asked about the disparity in our pay.

Fast forward to this century, and I naively thought everyone understood that feminism was about gender equality, and not about elevating one gender above the other. I've since learned my mistake on reddit and other forums.

I'm really sorry young people are raised with such a distorted view. I'm especially sorry that a small, vocal subset of radical feminism has become it's public face.

Gender equality is about each person, male or female, being respected for the human being they are. My dad was a feminist, and didn't even know the term.
