I said this in reply to someone else too-  In films like Road Trip where its about a bunch of guys going to win back one guy's girlfriend they don't *only* talk about women the whole film. In the 40 year old virgin they don't *only* talk about women.

I wouldn't be surprised if they were talking about men 99% of the time, but I am surprised that they don't *ever* talk about anything else.
