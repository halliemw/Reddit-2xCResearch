Dear reckless, 
I've heard several stories like this before. There's always a guy who says he can't live without you, who's desperate for your affection. If you stay with him, you will eventually find yourself in grave danger. I don't care how sweet and beautiful your relationship has been the last 3 years, although I'm sure it hasn't been the most picturesque relationship to begin with. Sometimes, in life, we have to be a little selfish. I think it would be beneficial for you to think really deeply and make a ONE-WAY decision. And remember.. he is a sociopath. He's proud of it. He doesn't find it in himself to give you what he wants. He wants you to engage in HIS kinky desires. You deserve better.
Take some time away from him, no matter what he says, bring yourself to a safe place so he can't threaten you (not saying he will but just in case), make a decision, and stick with it. And remember, don't regret your decisions. If you leave, that's it. Don't let him back into your life.
