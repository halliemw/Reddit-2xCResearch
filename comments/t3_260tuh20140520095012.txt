Male here and I too am in the same boat. I was always the opposite I had "girlfriends" when I was really young but that was just kid stuff. I have had serious long term relationships a few times and a couple years ago I almost had a child but we lost it. 

Since then I haven't been able to find interest in any women. I find them attractive but the thought of dating again honestly does not interest me and I've really ignored a lot of women I could have had a good relationship with. I'm starting to think that maybe I started a little young (lost my virginity at 13) and maybe losing my kid messed me up more than I know? 

Anyways it probably doesn't help you at all but I just wanted to share that. Some of us just don't have that interest and there's a million different reasons for it. Maybe when we both find out why we're really holding back we'll be able to find that person that made the wait worth while.
