Thanks for the insight. Unfortunately I will still get a period with Skyla (one of the differences from Mirena), but it is definitely still worth it. Plus I got premenstrual cramps with the Paragard so I can live with that. But it's good to hear (although sucky to experience, as you know) that my current experience is not unique.
