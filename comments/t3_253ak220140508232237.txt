It's really not fair at all, you feel unsafe because people have made your world unsafe. "Scary girls" aren't impervious to fear and your aggression isn't out of pleasure it's out of putting your own safety first and foremost. I don't really know what I'm saying but I'm really sorry that you aren't being treated like a human being, you deserve so much better.
