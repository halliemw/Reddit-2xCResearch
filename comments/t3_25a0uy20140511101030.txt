Sorry I've not got anything more constructive to say, just wanted to let you know you're not alone - ever since I started my period (10 years ago) almost every time I do cardio I get really bad period pains! It's gotten much better as I've left the murky realms of puberty behind, but it's definitely still there most of the time when I run. Just assumed it was to do with core muscles being stimulated/me being pretty unfit, but I've never found any real answers. I try to drink lots of water and take an ibuprofen before I do sport, then if I run through the pain it usually gets better after a few minutes. Hope it gets better for you!
