I am on Ovranette. When I skip my period with Ovranette, I find it greatly improves my moods and I'm like a whole new non-moody person. Currently having breakthrough bleeding and I've been fighting with my SO over nothing for the past two days. 

I wish I could offer advice but I can tell you that you're not alone and perhaps you might consider not having a period if Ovranette works well in every other way.
