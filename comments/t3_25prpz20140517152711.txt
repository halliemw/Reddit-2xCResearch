Awesome, all awesome! The best advice I can give is crawl before you walk. By that, I mean learn to shoot prone. The marksmanship principles are easiest learned while prone, and more obviously displayed there aswell. It's because you fatigue a lot less when lying down simply because you don't have to burden the entire weight of the rifle. I looked up the weight of the Mauser too, it's lighter then the rifle I had to use in the army (which is made from plastics instead of wood, and is bullpup so it's shorter) so I'm even more jealous of that gorgeous rifle. 


Scratch that, that was the second best advice I can give you at the moment, the BEST advice I can give you is follow the marksmanship principles. They're two hundred years old and still used in the army today - because they're perfect. Because they work. Do not deviate from the 4 principles. Don't worry if it seems like a lot to remember, once you figure them out they make absolutely perfect sense and seem mostly obvious (the last one is the only one that seems mystical) and you'll find yourself doing them. I wish I had someone to teach this to, it's all really fun (now that it isn't a job anymore) and I do love teaching.
