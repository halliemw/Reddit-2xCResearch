We watched a very dear friend's wife die of cancer. One of the more striking moments after was coming home after the funeral and him going into the bathroom and seeing her robe hanging on the back of the door. He was prepared to sit at the lake wishing she was there, or to look at their wedding photos and cry, but he wasn't prepared for her clothes to still be hanging in their room or her shampoo in the shower. People think they are prepared for the big moments, your kids weddings without you, etc. But I think it's really the little moments they might not be ready for.
