Aww, thanks internet stranger :) Honestly I'm not super concerned with financing law school at the moment...I know I can always take out loans and apply for scholarships for that. The thing I'm mostly worried about at this moment regarding law school is the fact that this whole scenario has distracted me from studying for the LSAT, when I've already put off taking it by almost a year. I just want to get it done and not have to worry about this bullshit. But on the bright side, I guess this whole situation might make a pretty interesting personal-statement topic...?
