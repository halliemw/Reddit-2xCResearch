A good friend of mine told me tonight that I'm a very pretty woman, in those words. Lately I seem to have been receiving compliments left and right on my beauty, which is funny, considering that my gynecologist just told me I gained 20 pounds in the past year. It's all about how you present yourself, I suppose.

Oddly enough, I was just having a conversation with another friend of mine about how I don't understand why so many women get offended by men telling them they're beautiful. As long as the context isn't creepy or weird, I love receiving compliments on my looks. It gives me an ego boost for the rest of the day. Just because a man appreciates my looks doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate other aspects of who I am.
