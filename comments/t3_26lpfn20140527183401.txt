This might seem sort of silly, and our situations are pretty different, but recently I was feeling like my life lacked rhythm and routine. I pressed snooze way too often, stayed at work way too late because I had no reason to come home, and I didn't keep up with house work very well. I was feeling depressed because I didn't feel like I did much outside of my professional life.

Then I got a dog. It has been one of the best decisions I have ever made as far as increasing my own happiness and self-worth. He gets me up in the morning, and I HAVE to go outside to walk him as soon as we wake up. This forces me to be outside in nature and bond with him first thing, every day. By the time my day gets rolling, I have already been outside a few times with him. I have to get home at a regular hour everyday to feed him, and he is SO happy to see me. We go on walks together every night, and it is the perfect way to wind down my day. I never have days anymore where I never leave the apartment, because he HAS to go outside - there's no avoiding it! I can't tell you enough how much having a pet has enriched my life.
