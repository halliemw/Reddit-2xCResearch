Generics are medicinally the same as the name brand. The only differences may be drug delivery systems (things like how the controlled release is achieved in drugs where that's an issue) or in fillers and packaging. Call your doctor and discuss it with them. The generic should be completely fine for you, but it's not a bad idea to talk to your doctor about it. You might react slightly differently to the generic at first even though the active ingredients are the same, just because of the new vehicle, but it should be fine once you adjust.
