This used to happen to me all the time. I would pee before AND after even sometimes showering, I did everything and still got them! Talk to your doctor. I had a friend tell me that she got a medicine from her doctor that you can take to prevent getting one and I got mine to do the same and I havent had one since! The prescription says to take it 30mins before intercourse ( but really, we dont always plan life that way) so I always took it after. Even sometimes when I would forget or not have it on me...taking it several hours later still prevented it. It will change your life and you wont have to worry! GL!
