Its very hard to decode what are actual heartfelt changes or not. It could be that she's trying to make an effort to know the actual you and not just her "head you" by giving in to you and going a little over the top with her concessions in an attempt to get you to trust her and open up to her a little more? I'm not positive but that's sort of what it seems like to me.
