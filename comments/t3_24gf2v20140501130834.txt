Come over to r/babybumps. Lots of women have these feelings, but it seems like you might need some help from a doctor with yours, which is completely fine. There are antidepressants that are safe for pregnancy that can help with your anxiety, or maybe therapy will work better. Bottom line, you should call your doctor and explain your feelings because there is help available. I hope you have a good rest of the day, and hang on there.
