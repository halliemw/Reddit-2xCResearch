I'm confused. Was this supposed to be insulting to women in their 20s or 30s, perhaps both? Or to the guy hiding behind the pseudonym Anne Gus, because... this was far from funny or even remotely intelligent.

So the (fictional) writer supposedly does Womans studies but has not learned anything during class since she so uncritically lumps women in old-ugly-therefore-useless and young-attractive-valuable. She also seems incredibly shallow and rude. And regarding 30 something women.. apparently shouldn't do anything remotely fun or visible. Perhaps just play a few rounds of bingo and die.
