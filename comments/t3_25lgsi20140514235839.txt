I am absolutely over the moon for you. Things like this give me such great hope--my boyfriend of 2 years and I are going to be long distance for 2 years, beginning in August, while I get my Master's degree in NYC. The idea of being long distance for the amount of time that we've already been together is scary for me right now, and while I'm so excited for the opportunities ahead of me, it's also hard to think about being apart from him for half of our relationship. 

Do you have any advice on how to get through this tough period? We do have a concrete plan in place for him to move to NYC to be with me after I finish my degree, but two years is starting to feel really long to me.
