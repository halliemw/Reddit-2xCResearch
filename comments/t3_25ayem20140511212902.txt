My mom had me when she was 29, but she waited another 9 and 12 years to have my brother and sister, with my sister being born to my mom at age 40. Although I know my mom had a slightly higher risk of bearing a child with birth defects, I can see first hand how much better my parents are now, financially and emotionally, than when they raised me. If they had waited until they were more secure to have me, then I'm sure I would have had a better childhood. I'm definitely planning on waiting to have kids, so I can be as loving and responsible of a mother as possible.
