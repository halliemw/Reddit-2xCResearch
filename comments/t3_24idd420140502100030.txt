I always forget about the traditional European May Day. Probably because it's not really celebrated here in the same way and it's not a public holiday.

If you used IWD around here, I am not sure most people would know what you are talking about! For as long as I can remember (and even before that since it's been around since 1886!), in North America, May Day has been synonymous with the labor movement, and there have been big rallies and marches. I suppose the name was shortened to May Day because it is much easier to remember and say plus it makes the date pretty clear.

Whatever you call the day, the Lucy Parsons story is an interesting one. She was a fascinating person. And she is often overlooked in the labor movement history.
