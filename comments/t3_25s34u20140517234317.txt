/u/PrettyWithDreads (love the name btw) is absolutely right. If a dog is going to help ease your anxiety and help you with your depression, go ahead and see if you can get a Mental Health Service Dog or a Support Dog. This is exactly they're job, and (in the majority of cases) your landlord cannot deny your right to have one if you quality (and usually can't charge you an extra deposit for the animal).

Any defending that your companion might do is just an added bonus. Talk to your psychiatrist about it, and (once you're given the okay, and a note) request an accommodation from your landlord. 

Here is [a link](http://sfappeal.com/2012/05/tenant-troubles-can-my-landlord-refuse-to-allow-me-a-service-animal/) with information about your rights to service animals and how to obtain one.
