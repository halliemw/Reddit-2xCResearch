It's more an issue of representation. Cis people constantly play trans roles and, through this, speak for us instead of allowing us to speak for ourselves. It provides society with an idea of what we are, and because representation of trans women specifically is overwhelmingly done through the acting of cis men, we end up misrepresented and issues of misrepresentation and erroneous education come into play. There's a lack of investment in knowing and understanding trans people, and without that, our roles generally are not done justice. 

I would love to watch a film where trans actors(plural) play cis people, just to see the kind of social firestorm that happens afterward. But ultimately, that's not as fruitful of a wish as wanting trans people to play trans roles, because it's too rare(Laverne Cox, Candis Cayne...can't think of many others without diving into tiny bit-roles). And trans people playing cis roles just...well, it doesn't really happen. It's hard enough getting trans people to represent themselves in media, so that's a much better goal right now than pushing for trans people playing cis roles. They're just as capable of it, just like cis people can play trans roles, but letting cis people monopolize trans roles sends a bad message. It twists even worse when the directors and actors aren't knowledgeable enough to make those roles remotely decent.
