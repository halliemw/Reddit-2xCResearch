Mildly interesting trivia fact:  In Old English or Anglo-Saxon, I can't remember which, "man" just meant "person" or "adult person."  "Wifman" meant "female adult person," which has now become "woman."   A different word, "wer" or "were," was used to denote male adults.  That word has been lost over the centuries except in terms like "werewolf."  

But the meaning of "man" in the sense of all adults survives.  If you read a lot of 19th century and earlier literature, using the word that way seems quite natural.  In some ways, I think reacting like it only means male people has lately robbed the word of its gender-inclusiveness.  "Human" will be next, it literally means "pertaining to man." :-)

I'm all for taking back the original meaning of the word "man."  And I wish we could revive "wer" for situations when we mean a male person.
