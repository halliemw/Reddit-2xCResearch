I wonder if you could run with that "no explicit content" rule in a different way: OP suggests to M about limiting graphic stuff to specific meetings noted well in advance so you basically force D to show up with his art only at certain times and nobody has to attend if they're uncomfortable with D and D's work or anything along those lines.

I would also just confront D like you suggest too, at least once. If that doesn't work, I would probably show up all the time but leave without saying a word every time D shows up.
