That's exactly the way to handle it! I did the same thing in my situation, which is why his initial "Ey yo!" carried on into further elaboration. Because apparently, in Yelling Dude's world, it was specificity that his yelling was lacking and not his yelling overall that was off-putting to me. When I kept shopping as if I hasn't heard him, dude piped down. I don't care if you LIKE MAH BUTT, my butt is not on display here. Produce is. Get out of the way of the produce aisle. 

There was another time, same grocery store (I always get the most awkward hit-upons when grocery shopping) where I was walking towards a dude who was approaching from the opposite end of the aisle; he looked about my age, well-built, and I remember he was carrying a baby doll in a pink package. As we passed each other, he leaned in and mumbled "howYOUdoin" directly into my ear AND JUST KEPT WALKING. Didn't even break stride! I immediately stopped dead and looked over my shoulder and he was just walking away with his baby doll; hadn't even looked back once. And in full earshot of him, I started full-on belly-laughing and went back to my shopping, because all I could think was, "well how do you ever expect to know how I'm doing if you're gonna walk off so fast?" I'm guessing his lady and the mother of whoever was getting that baby doll was in the store, so he was limited to covert hit-and-run flirtation. Easily the funniest of the weird hit-upons I've experienced.
