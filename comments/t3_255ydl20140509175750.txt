That's what I've been thinking I need to do more of. But when you're never around girls your own age who like to go out and have fun, it makes it super hard. I'll ask girls to hang out, they'll be busy, so I'll ask again a few weeks later, same story. When they never do the asking, it makes me feel too needy and I just give up.
