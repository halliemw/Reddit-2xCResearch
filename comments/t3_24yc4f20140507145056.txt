I agree. Two reasons - 

1. A person should have the right to their body [eg: [1](http://37.media.tumblr.com/3e2da6ffcad3b81a184102d758ca1e83/tumblr_mpugxxZzDQ1qbowlfo1_r1_1280.jpg)]

2. Pro-life people are usually not pro-life, they are just pro-birth. [eg: [1](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/29/79/57/297957c33ea5497298e106ef8c316892.jpg), [2](http://i.imgur.com/vpqOI1f.jpg), [3](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZTa0Y0iEGHo/UbCgs0gZBiI/AAAAAAAAvak/KbU5A8YCxTo/w506-h750/942570_532900033412347_1086241666_n.jpg)]
