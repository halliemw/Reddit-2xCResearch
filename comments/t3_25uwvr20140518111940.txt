Well for one, getting the link karma for your photo is nice, although obviously not that important. 

Mostly, though, I just feel like Fridays would be a lot less fun if all the IFF posts all got relegated to one thread. Then Fridays on TwoX wouldn't be any different than any other day of the week, so what would be the point of having IFF? Also, because IFF posts can really be about anything, I think it would be hard to keep the mega-thread organized and browse-able.
