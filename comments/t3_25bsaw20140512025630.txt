I've tried so many times to explain this to people. Even to myself, to be able to feel all of this and not feel terrible and a burden for feeling it because you "should just be able to get through it" I tell myself that. Get over it. Just get up and do it.  Everything you said is so exactly how it feels. When you are in the middle of it, it's hard to talk and rationalize in any way. It's hard to explain and ask for the help. For me, it was embarrassment. Feeling so hopeless that the hurt will never stop. Wanting to make it stop and needing help wasn't legitimate, wasn't valid and people wouldn't hear me and help me. That they would laugh and dismiss me, honestly I feared worse than suicide. If only more people understood all of the things you just said. I think more people could and would get some help. It's hard to ask or show you need it when you think, this is it, my last chance. Will they hear me? Will they help me? You should know they will, just like if you walked into that ER with the gunshot wound. You know they will help you.
