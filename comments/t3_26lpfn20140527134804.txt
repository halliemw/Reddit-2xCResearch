Regarding the family issue, aren't you attending classes part time? Aren't you trying to reach the heights they expect of you by attending school, its not like you are sitting at home doing nothing at all. 
Also, you would need to understand this sooner than later, that sometimes what people expect of us doesn't matter. What matters is if we are happy, as individuals. 
And when we are happy about ourselves, somewhere down the road, parents and family realise that what you were doing was absolutely right. 
So now i want you to do one thing, whenever you are at home, and feeling like you don't contribute enough, pick up your books, study material etc and study, top(score high, first rank) most of the classes and show your family of over achievers, how awesome you are. 
Source: my sister lived with her girlfriend, who paid for everything, felt the same way as you, told her to study real good, now she has her dream job and her girlfriend has left job , got into college for masters degree in her field. Now my sister pays for everything. 
When there's love, you don't need to worry. :*
