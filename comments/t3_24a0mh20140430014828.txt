I know not all nurses are awful. But I still can't trust them anymore, not without an individual nurse *proving* that he or she isn't awful. We just dealt with so many lazy, incompetent, and outright cruel nurses in a short amount of time that the entire prospect of having to put my life in strangers' hands is unimaginably terrifying.
