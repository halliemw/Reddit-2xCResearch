I have since been given more information (in a much less insulting way than your own comment) and understand more about male circumcision.

Though I still feel it necessary to point out that I **never ever** said one was less important than the other. What I *did* say is that they need to be tackled and solved seperately. This is not downplaying one or the other. This is not saying that one is less important tnat the other. This is simply saying that I do not believe there is one catch-all solution that will cater to both issues, and I believe we need to look at them as separate but equally horrific problem.
