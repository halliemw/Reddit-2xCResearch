This is one of the reasons I love Gaga so much. She's naked pretty much all of the time, but it's never really around her being sexy or available, it's about her being in control of herself and her image. She looks downright hideous half and that what's she's going for. 

With Miley*, I think it's a case of people aren't used to women confidently own their sexualities, and it's only okay or acceptable when it's for or about men. 

Think about the fact that we always see guys masturbating on tv/shows  - even fucking pies! - but female masturbation or even orgasms are strictly taboo and R rated.
