I'd disagree honestly. The point isn't to win them to your side, but to prevent them swaying others to their views. You can try the kindness approach, but open hostility to their ridiculous views would be much more affective. It is however important to make well-spoken points and not be reactionary. In terms of manipulating people, hostility is a very useful tool.

Some of the research I'm currently working in psychology centers around how people can start at one side of a spectrum of views and be pulled to the other side by the sheer abundance and ridiculousness of it.

Example:

Say you have some politically debatable point. On one side are some moderate liberals and the other some extremist conservatives. The liberals trying to be reasonable don't make as extreme statements as the conservatives. What ends up happening is someone who started in the middle, or even left of the middle will end up shifting their views to the right, without even knowing it's happening. In terms of analogy, it would be like averaging the distance between the two points on the spectrum, which would cause the new point of view to fall more right of center due to the "weight" of the extreme conservative view.
