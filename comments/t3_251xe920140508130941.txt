>trying to convince him to do so just won't work

Who says that's true? Usually any marital decision is a negotiation and a compromise. 

>Also making him go into the session with a preconceived negative opinion about it will put him there closed minded and I doubt he'd get any benefit from it anyway.

You're flat out wrong about that too. I have seen this same situation with literally dozens of my friends. The guy resists counseling, they go anyway, guy ends up liking it more than the girl. 

She's just asking him to try it. If he hates it, I wouldn't advocate continuing forcing him to go, but asking him to try it is not like asking him to swallow poison like you're making it out to be.
