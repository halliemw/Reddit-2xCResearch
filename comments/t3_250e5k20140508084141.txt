The woman who decided what hairstyles were compatible with the headgear including the beret, was a black woman.

Twists don't properly allow for the wear of the beret with the class A uniform, and therefore are banned from wear while in uniform.

As for the "my hair is naturally kinky" deal with it.  My beard hair is naturally coarse and dark and my skin is light and fair.  If I was going to be dealing with high ranking individuals I had to sometimes shave twice a day.

Wearing the uniform is a privilege, not a constitutional right.  Don't be an advocate for people who have not asked for your advocacy.  Really what this is doing is saying that black female soldiers want the rules changed to accommodate them and their culture instead of being part of the army culture.  This is for the most part not the case.  

Most soldiers know that wearing the uniform is a privilege not to be taken lightly and "my hair is naturally kinky" isn't an excuse to wear a hairstyle that makes a chemical protective mask, a kevlar combat helmet, or a wool dress beret unwearable as intended any more than I should have been exempted from the same because hair naturally grows from my face and has to be shaved at least daily.
