Really? I admit I'm terribly blind to the flaws of loved ones so I haven't thought about that. I do often feel like she's critical of me in subtle ways but the one time I mentioned that to her, she went into a whole "how dare you" spiel so that was the first and last time I brought it up. I just try not to think about it now.
