Not really. But then, I probably grew up in a different environment than you. My grandmother was 28 when she got married, my mom was 38 when I was born, and my one cousin got married "young" at 24. There's never been any emphasis on youthful appearances or biological clocks in our family, which probably helped mold my  concept of youth and an appropriate timeline for my life.
