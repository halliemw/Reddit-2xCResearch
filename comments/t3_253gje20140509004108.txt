Wait, how does that relate to what I said? Are you trying to compare me saying *"I feel unsafe in my workspace because the people I work with are making jokes about something terrible that happened to me and people I cared about"*, with you saying *"Your skirt gives me a boner, please don't dress 'suggestively'"*? You can control your dang boners, you are a self aware human being. I can't control if those 'jokes' get to me because it evokes something I wish I could forget.
