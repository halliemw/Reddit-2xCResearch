For me, I can't shake the mental image of menstrual blood getting near them. Or discharge. Boobs don't leak (most of the time... I'm actually pregnant right now and hell yes they DO leak..) and swimsuits generally get wet over and over again... but undies? Blech. I wouldn't give anyone but my best friend(s) my undies to wear, so why would I buy a stranger's and wear them myself??

It's not a hard and fast rule -- I'd buy a "used" undie/bra set that the seller said never fit and was never worn.
