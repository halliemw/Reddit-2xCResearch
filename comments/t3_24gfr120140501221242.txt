A joke is using language that is meant to be interpreted as humor. If you say something and your intention is to make others laugh, then it is a joke. That is all a joke is. It is entirely a misogynistic sentence. I'm not disagreeing with you there. I also don't think it was meant to be satirical and that is probably how he actually feels. That women should be quiet. I'm not arguing the point that he said something and it was ignorant. I will argue that it was absolutely a joke. Just because it was a joke does not take away your right to be offended by it though. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just plain wrong. 

Furthermore, murder and genocide can be comedy. There are many successful comedians with jokes about murder and genocide.
