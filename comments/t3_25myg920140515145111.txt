I met my husband when I was on birth control at 17. We are 30 and I've been on and off various hormonal and non hormonal bc since then. It has never affected how I feel about him. I did have some side affects but it was better than the issues I was having without the bc. 

Buy some nice lube like pre-seed if you are worried about how it affects that part of your life. 

Depending on why you are seeking bc, what about an IUD? There is a hormonal and on hormonal option.
