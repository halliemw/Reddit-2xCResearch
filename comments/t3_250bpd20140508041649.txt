As someone who works in a school I don't entirely believe a 15 yo who says "but this other group always gets away with x"... She may not be noticed the boys being picked up on their inappropriate attire because it isn't happening to her. (Just like the teenage boy may not notice how the girls in his class are being objectified.)
