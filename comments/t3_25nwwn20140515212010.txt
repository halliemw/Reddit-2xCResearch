You're not over reacting. I have one of those metabolisms that gains weight moderately and loses weight quickly. Although I consider myself lucky in this aspect, if I choose to work out more, and cut certain things out of my diet (not on purpose sometimes) I will lose a noticeable amount of weight. This for some reason gives people the notion that's it's ok to  every single god damn month if I'm losing or gaining. I don't really care about the opinions. I eat what I want and THAT makes me happy. It's only when people comment that it makes me unhappy with my body. 
Fuck them. Be blond. Be brunette or whatever you were or want to be. You sound exactly like me, never touch a scale and happy with the way I look. Next time someone comments, say you don't know what their talking about. And not in the "oh... Please DO go on with these flattering comments boys *bats eyes*"type of way...
