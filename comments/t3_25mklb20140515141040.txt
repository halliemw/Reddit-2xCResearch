OK, fair enough. I concede that the paper's management had the *right* to pay her whatever they wanted. But at the very least, I think it's clear that both in general and in this case, salary is determined by a lot of circumstances independent of what you "deserve." Doesn't leading the paper to multiple successes in reporting and increasing revenue while withstanding the extra pressures of being the first woman executive editor constitute merit? Not the kind of merit that measures up to a certain salary level according to the usual metrics, but some form of perceptible value that doesn't correspond to the size of her paycheck.
