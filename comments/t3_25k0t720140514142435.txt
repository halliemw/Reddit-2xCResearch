Thanks for noticing my correct use of terminology!!  I'm quite firm when I'm teaching about this distinction, so it's good to know someone cares!  You're right that progestin is manufactured and progesterone is what our body makes naturally.  Some women are okay with this, and feel progestin-based therapy is very helpful.  Other women don't like the idea of anything 'manmade', and that's okay too.

I also completely agree with you - it's important to address a woman's entire situation, not just one body part.  

It's hard to draw conclusions from just one study, so here's a meta-analysis of 8 studies look at the risk of the thromboembolic risk in women using progestin-only contraception, if you're interested!

It's quite long, but here's their conclusion:
"the use of progestin-only contraception was not associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared with non-users of hormonal contraception. The potential association between injectable progestins and thrombosis requires further study."
