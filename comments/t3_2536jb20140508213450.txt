That's actually an on-label use of the drug. It's excellent for smoking cessation and mood stabilization and a low dose of it has been combined with nalprexone (sp?) which is used to treat narcotics addiction to treat obesity. It's expected to become FDA approved next month. I honestly don't think it should be because to me the risks outweigh the benefits, but then I'm just a student and not yet a doctor, so my opinion means nothing and a worse drug was approved recently for the same indications, so chances are this will be, too.
