I got mine at 21. To me early twenties seems like one of the most valid times to get it. Most women have a general idea of when they want to have kids, and if you know it's your mid to late twenties, why wouldn't you get a something long term, which often ends up being more cost effective in the end? I would have serious issues if my doctor if that was the case!
