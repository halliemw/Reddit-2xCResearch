My step mom is going with me for exactly that reason.

With reconstruction I'm worried about them requiring upkeep I can't afford. Plus depending on the type of risk reduction surgery, nipples may or may not be lost, and that kinda weirds me out. I also have fairly large breasts and wouldn't want to change that. Just a lot of different things that concern me. 

I'm not on birth control. My doctor told me it was less of a risk to get pregnant than it was to go on birth control because even though it reduces the risk of ovarian cancer it can increase the risk of breast cancer. I don't really care for my doctor and didn't like that she wouldn't prescribe it even though I'd researched it myself, but I'm not having frequent enough sex to fight that one because condoms aren't much of an inconvenience, and I've been dealing with other things with my OB so it oddly hasn't come up. I'd certainly like to go on birth control for the period regulation alone, but it's not been an issue worth pursuing.
