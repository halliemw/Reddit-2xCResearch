I don't think you're overreacting at all. I had a similar-ish thing happen to me, and I still have bad dreams and angry thoughts about it.

When I was a senior in high school a twenty-something teacher from the school district next to us took an interest in me after meeting on a political campaign. He was ultra-awkward and from what I hear his students absolutely loathed him. He added me on Facebook and latched onto me because I talked to him a few times. 

He got super clingy to the point where he was sending me "I love you, beautiful :)" texts to me on a daily basis. One night he graphically described to me his masturbation habits--he had absolutely no sense of boundaries between us. I talked to him about his inappropriate behavior and he stopped for a while, but started up again after a few months. I finally cut off contact from him after he got really creepy one night and then laughed at me when I asked him to apologize.

So I guess I know a little bit what you're feeling, even though the dynamics were different because of ages and distances and it not being as sever as your experience. That must have been horrible to go through that during middle school, which is tough enough without all that :( It can really affect you when someone who is supposed to be there for you turns around and manipulates you like that. That would be traumatizing to anybody and you're not overreacting at all.
