I agree 100% as well. Thanks for those words.

I know what you mean, I shouldn't agonize & try to spend day after day trying to figure out what happened and why. Picking it apart and spending time living in the past.

On the other hand though, I just thought it would be a little comforting to have other people weigh in on this and give their own point of view. See if anyone can give me some things to think about and throw around in my head.

Believe me, hes not in my life. He hasn't been since I pressed charges and I plan on keeping it that way. We have a no-contact order which is practically a court-issued PPO. The only contact we have is the couple times we make eye contact in court. I have no plans of interacting with him for the rest of my life. Like I said, he is dead to me, and I think it should stay that way. 

It IS sad to think about the good times we had. How high he made me in the beginning. The times I felt happy and loved and complete, sharing my life with another person. Its hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember. But yes, I am moving on & forward with my life and have been taking as many steps as it takes to heal.
