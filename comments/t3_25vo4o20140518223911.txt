The number of times Stacy is used to demonstrate something bad a woman does that isn't to a man is vanishingly small. Steve does bad things to everyone. There really isn't a guy version of the meme that only does bad things to women. The issue isn't who is worse. The issue is that one is just a bad person, and the other is bad woman. 

I'd like you to explain where I said that *everything* was sexist or misogynistic. 

Again, what I'm seeing is someone who doesn't actually see stuff that doesn't affect them personally. Makes it kind of hard to see what the point is of continuing to discuss this with you.
