> When it comes to reserving a venue or getting a photographer, be prepared for everything to cost crazy amounts (make a reasonable guesstimate then double it). I'd recommend having a friend do the photography (if you want any) and doing the whole justice of the peace for the ceremony, and someone's house for a reception thing instead of using a church or actual location for either thing.

Though if I spent money on anything, I would spend it on the photographer -- the beautiful photos will be treasured souvenirs / memories, and there is a real difference in the quality of photos taken by a good photographer.

(That said, there are a lot of mediocre 'professional' photographers, so it's worth some research / investigation if you go that route.)
