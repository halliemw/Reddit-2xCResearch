>I know that it'll hurt more when I get married and a LOT more when I get pregnant, but I know that I will have my sisters, mother-in-law, and stepmom to rely on for stories and memories of their own.

Honestly, I often wonder how much of my desire not to have children stems from my mom not being here.  She was very involved in my sister's first pregnancy (first grandbaby!), and she genuinely loved children.  I do not think I would be as good a mother without her as I would have been if she were here, and I think I would resent that my children would not get to know her.  There are other, practical reasons as well, but I can't help but think I'd be more eager to have children if she were still around.

And yes, there are always silver linings.  I remember, shortly after I became engaged, looking at my life and realizing that I would not be the person I was (nor have met my now-husband) were it not for my mother's death.  It was terrible, but it was not the most terrible thing that could happen.  As I get older, my peers begin to have their own horrible traumas and tragedies, and I realize that there are so many worse things out there than losing one's mother as a teenager.
