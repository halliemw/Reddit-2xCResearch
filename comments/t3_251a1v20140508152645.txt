Well even still. If two people were on minimum wage, then they would be making $42000 equal to just less than Â£25000. That doesn't seem like a lot when you factor in food (probably about 3 or 400 dollars a month depending on family size), rent/ mortgage payments, utilities, fuel and car insurance and probably several other things that aren't springing to mind at the moment.
