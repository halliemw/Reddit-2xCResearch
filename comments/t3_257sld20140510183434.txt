What's your suggestion for a replacement? This is an honest question. I only use it when I don't know someone's name and I'm trying to get their attention ("Ma'am, you dropped this"). So probably 2-3 times a year, when I'm trying to address a stranger. "Miss" feels condescending to me. With a guy it's either sir or hey buddy, depending on the situation. I always took it as "miss" was a young girl and ma'am was an adult/adultish woman (not necessarily old). Certainly never meant as an insult- I don't make fun of people for their age (except my wife, who is 10 days older than me).
