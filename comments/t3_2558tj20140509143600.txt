I moved my underwear drawer into the bathroom when I was in my 30s, as my period tried to make a bloody vile mess of my life. If I noticed an "oops! Nature!!" it was easy to quickly change.

Learned WAY too late that sex when my period is supposed to start can sometimes help get it underway at a reasonably consistent pace, instead of having to deal with spotting for several days before a 3 day long waterfall. Husband never minded if there was an "oops Nature!" situation with that, and I used dark bath towels liberally on the bed during those occasions!

I don't care what anyone says, a nice glass of wine makes any period day just a little bit easier to deal with.
