I'm sorry you had to go through that. I agree with everything you said. The victim blaming was something I had to deal with when coming forward too. Even though my rapist got off with a slap on the wrist, it torpedoed my social life. Everyone sided with him and whispered nasty things at me when I passed them, calling me a bitch and all sorts of awful things, up until the day I graduated. I feel like people on reddit get so up in arms at how rape accusations "destroy" someone's life, nevermind the person who was actually raped and has to deal with that trauma, on top of the trauma of everyone around them discrediting them.  
My post above is the first time I've really shared my story on reddit, and already I'm getting nasty replies. I thought TwoX was supposed to be a safe space, but I guess it really isn't. :-/
