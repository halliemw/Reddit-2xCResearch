Yeah, but there's a difference between sharing a passion and instantly quizzing someone.

I'd have no problem if his first question was 'what's your favourite horror film?' or even a 'did you know...' - I would've started nerding out too - but prefacing something with 'if you're really a horror fan then answer this...' is a whole different ball game. 

There's nothing better than meeting another horror fan and spending the next hour talking to each other non-stop about films.

And you know what? This dude didn't even known that Quarantine was a remake! Pft! ;)
