Think about it, think about it lots. But don't have them, until you're certain that that is what you want to do with your life, and that it is what you want to do at the time you're doing it.

It's better to regret not having had kids, than to regret having had them.

And if ultimately what you want is to care for children, there are other ways. Including being foster parents.
