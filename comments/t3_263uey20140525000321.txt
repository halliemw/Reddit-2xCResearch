I personally believe that ur vision of the future is optimistic. I think, within the next 50 years this wont happen. We can see active brain regions n shit, but we cant really see what ppl think. Given the brain's complexitiy, we may not be able to do so for 100s of years... thisi even more true for past things, as the brain alters memory over time... so it could NEVER be said how exactly a past event happened... the method u suppose will never work.
