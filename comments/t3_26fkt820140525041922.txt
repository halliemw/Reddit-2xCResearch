At work?

"I'm sorry sir you can't monopolize my time any further as i have work to do, if you insist on persisting I'll have to contact security/my superiors and have you escorted from the store."

On the street, in escalation mildest to the worst:

"Thanks, my boyfriend likes my [bodypart] too!"

"I'm sure your mom thinks your cool!"

"Can you repeat that? I don't speak 'Bullshit/asshole' very well."

[With sympathy] "I'm sure your shitty personality compensates for your micro-penis."

"I can't hear when idiots talk" [Then go on with your day]
