In any workplace the mantra is CYA. Cover Your Ass. Religiously log and record everything you do. Cc supervisors on all communications. Save all emails. Note times of completion of all your tasks. Keep your game tight as a drum with evidence to back it up. If anyone confronts you about your performance you drop the whole pile on them and show your work and how you spend your time. The most you ever need to say about anyone else is "I don't know how they spend their time," Make yourself bulletproof and proceed without concern.
