When I was fifteen, I was waiting for a bus in the dark and a fancy white Cadillac pulled up. The guy rolled down the window and, I kid you not, was wearing a pimp coat with the fur and everything. After turning him down for a ride the first time he started with the "aww, c'mon baby, it's cold outside". Thankfully my bus pulled up right then and I got away. I found out later that night there was an amber alert out looking for a white Cadillac. Coincidence?
