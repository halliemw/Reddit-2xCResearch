It was NOT your fault. I hope you can find a support group to help you heal and that you've sought out a counselor. Your relationship does not sound like it's currently in your best interest. If he finds it hard to support you, you need to do yourself a favor and find people who can do so willingly. Again, it was NOT your fault. It was NOT your fault. He is WRONG, and cruel for voicing such thoughts out loud. Good luck and remember it was NOT your fault. I'm so sorry.
