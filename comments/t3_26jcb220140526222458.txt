What about partnering with clinics to offer a "fund" for transportation costs for their clients.  We could divvy up general donations for all clinics, and each clinic could have their own donation page.  Only the clinics would be the ones who have access to the funds and approve them for their own clients' use.

No fear of having people freeload off of the money, since it's the provider who is approving it's use. And we can give the clinic discretion in the use of transit/room-and-board rebates.

It could be like DonorsChoose.org but for women seeking family planning.

Thoughts?
