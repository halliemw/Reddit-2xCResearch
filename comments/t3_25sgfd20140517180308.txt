I disagree with you, he's the perfect example of a real life villain, he's just not one YOU find sympathetic because he's evil personified to the Western world but to others he was a heroic general leading a war.  He was well educated, intelligent and methodical in his plans and others thought so highly of him that they zealously followed his evil plan even though it resulted in the end of their life.  Please note that I am not saying that I find him sympathetic.  He was a evil man that created violence and I'm a not a person who admires that type of behavior.  

Hitler, also, was a male villain that was sympathetic (and still is to some people.)  He killed so many people in an effort to make his country better in his eyes and in his name others committed atrocities that will be in the history books for generations.  My point here is that sympathetic male villains do exist in real life.  They also exist on the screen.  In House of Cards the main guy is a villain.  In Revenge, the Greysons are a whole nest of villains.  There's a ton of male villains and I didn't even go back very far. 

All over the world throughout history we can find male villains, most of which were sympathetic to someone at some point in time..  Maybe you will enjoy one of these: Nero, Ned Kelly, King George, Ganges Kahn, Gan Ning, Dong Zhuo or even his foster son Lu Bu.  Actually, Lu Bu is way more sympathetic than Dong Zhuo to me but that's just my opinion.  I'm not going to compile a complete list, those are just a few of my historical favorites. 

Edit:  I forgot Hannibal with his glorious elephants!
