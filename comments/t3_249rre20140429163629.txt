>I don't know. I don't see what's so creepy about a father and daughter having a nice night out and showing her how it feels to be loved and treated well.

You describe the faux-wedding ceremony as a nice night out.

The balls focus around a father valuing his daughter for her sexual purity, and you said that wasn't weird or bad, suggesting you think it's to some extent normal and healthy.
