Even if you aren't a rape survivor, it sounds to me you are a rape escapee, so to speak. There's no telling what might have happened had your parents not supported you and had you not managed to get out of that office. The situation you were in to me seems utterly terrifying, especially because of the position of power this fucktard was in. 



I know something about unwanted intimacy at school. I was 17 and the janitor (60+ male) was so friendly with me it made me really uncomfortable, but I didn't think much of it. Then suddenly he had my picture in his wallet which seriously freaked me out and I started to avoid him, but wherever I went he was staring at me. I told my best friend and she convinced me to tell my parents. I was so glad when my parents talked to the principal and he wasn't asked to come back for the next year. I was pretty darn scared, I can't even imagine what it must have been like for you... So no, you are not overreacting. 



I can't give advice on how to deal with it though, other than maybe try to find a good therapist. Your experience is so much more severe than mine, you were much younger and the harassment was much, MUCH more severe, also because in a way you were the one punished for his bad behaviour. And then there's the bullying from your classmates too...



TL;DR: No you are not overreacting.



PS: I'd actually forgotten about my incident, only remembered because some of this seemed to ring a bell. X)
