Because I don't believe in "separate but equal". Because the same way I believe that women shouldn't be banned from the rest of reddit because "it's mostly men and men's experiences anyway". Because I fundamentally don't believe in a place where the top comment on a thread trying to explain that feminists don't hate men is "I don't want to hear men talking no matter how insightful their opinion". Because I don't think closing ourselves off to anyone is the way to do it.  Because I think that closing ourselves off will only be more harmful in the future. Because this place is already such an echo chamber I don't think it needs more fearfulness of different opinions. Because I don't think the response to "women's are always told to be quiet" is an eye for an eye. And last of all, because I care about this community and want it to return to it's legitimate discussions instead of bitching and moaning because like it or not this sub is now the poster child for women on this site. And right now the only side we are showing them is the one they want to see, the one they feed off of and make stereotypes about. The one that hates everything and all things male and can only talk about how to eliminate their input.

There are lots of reasons I'm against telling men to shut the fuck up on a public forum. Choose one.
