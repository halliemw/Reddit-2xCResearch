Man here who beat deprsssion after for 17 years:  it sounds like your boyfriend might have some depressive cognitive mind patterns; he's harder on himself than he is on others. Also,  this is not what I'd call an "inferiority complex" -- It sounds like just good old fashioned low self esteem.  He seems to lack compassion for himself.   One thing about your story stuck out for me : the psychiatrist.   You said that that he said this was the "cause" of problems for him.   Chances are is that it's more like this:  his sessions with the psychologist brought up very uncomfortable feelings and now he's blaming the psychiatrist for "making him feel bad." I'm not saying that psychotherapy is for everyone,  but he might be throwing the baby out with the bath water on this one.   Maybe he ought to try again... Or perhaps more like,  blaming the messenger.   The key might simply be having someone who isn't in his life,  whom he can talk to. So it could be a priest or a Buddhist monk or a bartender (if he doesn't like psychologists/psychiatrists).  In the meantime,  just keep loving him and maybe do what you loved seeing him do for others: cheer him up!
