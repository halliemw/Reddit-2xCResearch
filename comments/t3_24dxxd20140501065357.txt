Also, considering [femcooper.com was registered 2 weeks ago](http://domain-kb.com/www/femcooper.com) I'm a bit wary of the endorsement from pattylover and bugaboo444 (who became users within a day of one another and have very limited user history).

But maybe I'm just being skeptical. Though, I clearly take my redditing seriously :P
