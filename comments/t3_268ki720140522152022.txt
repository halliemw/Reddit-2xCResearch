First of all, you should start keeping track of all of your periods for the future. Second, you should go see your doctor. I say this because for anyone else this may indicate pregnancy, however, with an abortion being in the last couple of months you may have complications. 

Please see an OB/Gyn and get on some kind of birth control or talk about options for you as condoms alone are not working well for you since you've been pregnant twice already. This is critical as things like abortion or the morning after pill are very harsh on the body and can be detrimental if used frequently.
