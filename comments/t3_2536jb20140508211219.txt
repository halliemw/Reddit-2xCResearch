I happen to LOVE that drug.  BUT everyone's brain chemistry is different so each individual will react differently to it.  But my personal experience is that wellbutrin is awesome.  It makes me want to get out of bed and get shit done.   I dont react well to SNRIs or SSRIs (although many people find them to be excellent).  THey make me feel.....emotionally dulled and zombie like.
