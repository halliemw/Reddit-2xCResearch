Well at first I thought he was venting, but it doesn't seem that way anymore... Its mostly just advice he gives to other people using me as the example. "My ex said this exact same thing and she was crazy...dump the girl" 
That kind of thing only a lot meaner and more detail... It's scary to think that he is giving relationship advice after everything he did to me....

I ignore most of it, but there was something I found a few weeks ago tht just finally pushed me over the edge with his lying ass. My friends pretty much agreed that he had made up an entirely different relationship in his head, one that made me out to be the bad guy so he could justify his actions. They think he seriously mental and I have been instructed that if I ever see him out in town at the bars that I need to be prepared to call the cops.
