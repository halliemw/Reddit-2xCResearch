Your mother is mostly wrong -- some have a grain of truth.

Irregular bleeding can be a problem for some on Depo. IUDs aren't effective forever -- they need replacing after 3, 5, or 10 years, depending.

> Any tips?

Yes. You're probably emancipated (can receive healthcare without your parents knowing about it) on the subject of sexual health (depends on your region). Make an appointment with a different ob/gyn (your doctor's opinion is out of date) and say before coming in that you need to have a long talk about contraception and you need to be sure your mother won't know about it.

In the meantime, bedsides.org is great. So is Scarleteen.
