Ok.  Please don't be offended by any of this, it's just that there are some things here that may not occur to you.  Since you asked, here's my take on your post:  

* You want to gauge the atmosphere about the recent changes, but you want to create a new post to do it, when there is already tons of discussion going on about it.  I think this strikes people the wrong way because 1) There are a lot of people upset about the changes, and the way you've worded your post rubs salt in the wound, so to speak. 2) It seems that you're uninterested in reading the other discussions and finding out what's going on for yourself.
* You want to put the spotlight on men.  This is not bad just in itself, but because there have been so many recent similar discussions and problems related to that in a subreddit supposedly dedicated to women's issues, it's probably not coming across the way you intended it to.
* You say you want to start a serious discussion, but you phrase things in a non-serious way.  I'm not sure how old you are or who you are or anything, but your whole writing style seems insincere and white knight-ish.  You come across as viewing men as needing to save women from trolls or some non-sense.  It comes across as insulting.
* When you say that you want to discuss things calmly and rationally, you imply that the opposite is normal and that comes off as insulting.
* My overall take away is that you are contributing to the problem, while trying to figure it out, and you will probably leave here thinking that this is subreddit of hysterical crazed women who can't even have a rational discussion without flipping out like a bunch of bitches.  It's my impression that you've walked by a an angry hornet's nest and stuck your stick in to have a poke rather than observing from a distance.
