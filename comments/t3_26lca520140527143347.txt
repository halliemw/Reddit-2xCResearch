You are being rude and aggressively defensive at the expense of others. You sit there and try to tell me (and others) what I (or they) think. You don't know what I think, all you know is what I say, and I have not said nearly enough for you to draw any conclusions.

So perhaps you are the one jumping to conclusions to fit the reality you want.
