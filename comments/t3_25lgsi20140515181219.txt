This is beautiful!
 I'm in a relatively new LDR to some extent (160 miles, it's been 4 months) and it's working out really well- he comes to stay/I go to stay Friday - Monday most weeks, or whenever we can work it around our schedules.

I think with my past relationships being as they are that I really need my space. I love my time with him but I'm with the mantra that no one completes you, they only compliment you, as the whole person you are.

Small rant, but congratulations to you both!
