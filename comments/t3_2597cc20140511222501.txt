I use to wear thongs then got in a bad yeast infection cycle and decided to stop wearing them.  I've been mostly underwear free at home and when I wear sweats out and about.  Jeans and leggings require some coverage though.  Might try thongs again if I can find the right style and the boy shorts options don't work.
