I also said that he tells me those things when I don't think I am pretty at all. So when I've just finished working out, so I'm sweaty or when I've been working in the yard, so I'm grimy and dirty. What girl is going to believe someone who only tells her shes pretty when she has dirt and mud and sweat all over her, but forgets how to form words when I actually look good?
