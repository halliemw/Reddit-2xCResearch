>If they cared about men's rights, they would be trying to work with feminists. The people that actually care about men's rights either work very closely with feminists or just identify as feminists themselves.

I disagree.  While you're right in that they should be working WITH feminists, there are quite a few individuals over there who object to the blind war on feminism some of the r/mensrights guys are pushing.  I would advise anyone who had seen it once keep an eye on its development, as I believe a more mature movement with much more sincere ideation is slowly, slowly brewing....
