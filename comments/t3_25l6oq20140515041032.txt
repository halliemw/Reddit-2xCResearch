Just seen the update - glad everything worked out. I skipped a whole month during exams and it was terrifying. Sounds like you have a lot on your plate at the moment, sometimes when you're stressed it can just happen.

If you're not happy with how the pill is working out at the moment, definitely have a chat to your doctor and see if something else would suit you better :)
