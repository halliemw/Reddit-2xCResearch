I trust him with her alone. Nothing about him makes me feel like he is a danger to her. He just seems so apathetic towards her. He acts like he's a free babysitter and he's doing me a favor rather than seeing it as, he is her father and is responsible for caring for her. We have a child support case open, but we don't have a visitation scheduled. I've never tried to keep him from her, so neither of us felt the need to nail down an official visitation schedule. We both agreed to just talk and use our discretion as things come up. So I think that technically means I can legally keep her from him, and if he tries to fight it, he will be arrested for non-payment.
