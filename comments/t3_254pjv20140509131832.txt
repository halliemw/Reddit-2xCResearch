I'm 29 and my Mom is 62. She's a total wild card and always has been.

When I was a kid a lot of her behaviors were vaguely embarrassing. She was always very sexually liberal and had no shame at all discussing bodily functions. This was great when it came to getting my first period and stuff, but if she ever randomly remarked on my boobs or wanted to have a serious/cautionary sexual talk with me when I was a teenager it just made me feel self-conscious.

As I got older and my own views changed our relationship changed. When my parents split up she basically had to restart her life, which she not only did but she embraced. She had become more than just my Mom, she had become my friend and my role model. When I had to leave home and go out on my own, she was strong for me and proud of me. 

I love my Mom so much more now that I'm an adult. She's an amazing woman and I'm so glad that I've been able to have her as an influence in my life.

(I'm sorry if this reads like sentimental claptrap, but I can't think of any other way to say how much I appreciate her.)
