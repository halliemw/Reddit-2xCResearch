I've used "pushy" to describe a woman several times.  Every. Single. Time. It was in regards to an overbearing mother who was being completely unreasonable regarding her child either misbehaving or trying to force us as employees (i work in retail) into getting her child's way.  

I've seen dads do the same thing and usually I just refer to them as "assholes."
