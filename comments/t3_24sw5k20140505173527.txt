Agreed, it is NOT YOUR FAULT. Please consider getting a copy of [Shirley Glass's "Not Just Friends"] (http://www.amazon.com/Not-Just-Friends-Rebuilding-Recovering/dp/0743225503).  It's an old book, but I found it incredibly helpful for regaining my own sanity. Learning how to trust my gut, and accepting that affairs happen to good people who were good partners. It talks about gas-lighting, too, which IMO is one of the cruelest things a cheating partner does to his/her partner. It makes you feel like you're going crazy and can't trust yourself, when exactly the opposite is true.
