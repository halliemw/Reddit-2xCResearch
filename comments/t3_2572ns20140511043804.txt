I just saved your post.

It reminded of an article I read once about racism and how to be a good ally to non-white people as a white person. I found it an interesting exercise to also examine my own privilege and be aware of both sides of the fence so to speak. So anyway, the main point was "shut up and listen" with an emphasis on the "shut up" part. It explained that it's important to realize that there are some issues or spaces where your opinion is neither wanted nor relevant - and can even be counter-productive to what you're trying to achieve, even if it's in good faith.

It was quite the lesson in humility, and I'm not sure I'm even able to apply it yet. But you can. So I saved your post to remind me of that important lesson, and as a masterclass on how to apply it.
