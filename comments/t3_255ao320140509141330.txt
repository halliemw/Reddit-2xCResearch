I agree with some other posters; in my experience, it seems to be a primarily downtown experience. My worst ones were right outside my small college, and I have no proof of this, but I suspect the guys in question were from the enormous state school in the same general vicinity, just because I didn't recognize the truck or the dudes (which I probably would have if they went to my school of ~2000 people), but they had a very... "frat-house" mentality and style of dress.
