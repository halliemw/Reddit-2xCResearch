It's not about denying you a choice. It's about covering their own asses and protecting your health. If you don't want kids that's fine, but any doctor that would sterilize you at a perfectly healthy 23 then becomes liable should you change your mind at 24, or 28, or 35, or whatever. It then becomes something you can sue them over and will likely win because they caused you to not be able to fulfill your motherly duties as God intended This has happened many times, and is ridiculous. Get on the pill, or the shot, or whatever. Then put on your big girl panties like the rest of us and deal with the hormonal bullshit like a grown woman.
