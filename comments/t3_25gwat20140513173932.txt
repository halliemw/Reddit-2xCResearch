What happened to you was wrong and unfair.  None of it was your fault. None of it.  You should always feel safe and protected with the people you trust and that was violated.  I know all those feelings are so overwhelming right now.  You are obviously strong, you are taking steps in the right direction.  With time and some help you will sort out those feelings and in time be able to move past this.
