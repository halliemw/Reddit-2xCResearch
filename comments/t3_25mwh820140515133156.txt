It thought my dog was a fool-proof cat-call repellent. Every guy who said something to me from the car or porches either asked what breed he was, or just told he was a good-lookin' dog. It was glorious. 

The first day I wore shorts while walking the dog, I was yelled at/honked/whistled at *least* 7 times in 30 minutes. My shorts aren't even particularly sexy: they're old cut-offs that I need a belt to keep up, and they're a modest length (in the world of cut-offs). After a whole winter of people speaking clearly and politely, even when driving by, I can't even convince myself that I misconstrued the intent. It's a bummer. I don't understand how bare knees drive people to make whatever garbled sound they're capable of. 

But I have a good-looking dog, so at least I got that going for me.
