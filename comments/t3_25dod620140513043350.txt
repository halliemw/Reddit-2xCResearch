Exercise is good for you, and it's a good idea to do some exercise regardless of whether you want to lose weight or not. When you are under a lot of stress and don't have a lot of energy because of overwork, this is even more the case. 

That said, you can lose weight without exercise as long as you watch what you eat. It's a little harder for some people, but it's easier than trying to lose weight by exercising but not watching what you eat. 

Also, if there is an end in sight, perhaps think about leaving your weightloss efforts until you've finished your thesis?
