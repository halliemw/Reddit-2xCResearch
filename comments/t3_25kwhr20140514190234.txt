The voting has a weird emotional/mental weight to it for some. It's a symbol that others agree with you. Or they find you funny. Or they think your comment is thought provoking. As such, down votes can do the opposite. Negative numbers indicate that, of all of the people who came across your post, not a single one believes or supports what you have to say. I suppose it can be demoralizing for those who already feel too shy to give their opinions, or who question whether their opinions are worth reading.
