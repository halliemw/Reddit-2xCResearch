Have a general itinerary and give it to someone you know, make sure to keep in regular contact with someone as well, e.g. once every two days, so they know you are safe, and can contact the relevant authorities if you go missing. 
I don't know if you are booking your accomodation/camping, but if you know the general areas you are going to, have a hostels address kept somewhere.
Pack light! Microfibre towels are small and light.
Look up local laws that may catch you out.
