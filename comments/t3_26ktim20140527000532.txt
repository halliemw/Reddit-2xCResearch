Hmm... that's definitely a good suggestion! 

Unfortunately, the one that's the least distant isn't part of the group anymore. =( The only other person I can think of where I could do one on one, is also weirdly the one that I'm feeling the most disconnected from. The others will be hard, because I know they'll just end up inviting the others and honestly, I'm not comfortable with them yet to hang out one on one. I just feel like it's been over 6 months now and if it's not working, then maybe it's time to expand my social circle. Which isn't a bad thing. I don't know, I'll figure it out but your advice is definitely something I'll keep in mind!
