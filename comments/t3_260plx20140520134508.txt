I have a story much like your own: was very close to my friend, she moved away, we always maintained conversation about being each other's bridesmaids, spoke often via text and phone conversations, etc. She even called me the night she got engaged to tell me about it before posting it to Facebook. Then, I heard nothing else about the wedding. I was suddenly out. I got invited and assumed I didn't make the bridal party due to distance. But upon arrival I saw that another girl from the same distant area was in the bridal party. I was really hurt and felt I deserved an explanation on this decision. I never got one. 

Since then, I have been a bridesmaid for someone I would never have considered to include in my bridal party and it made more sense. Friend 1 sees close friendship as hanging out in person while I saw it as having close conversation. Friend 2 considers it touching base often, even if we never have deep conversations. 

I understand why you were hurt and have been there. You just have to remember she loves you but categorizes levels of friendships differently than you or anyone else does.
