Call your dad and ask him.  Let him know that you really like her and would like to do something nice for her, as she is your stepmother.

To those saying that she might be a 'childfree' type -- she married someone with a daughter, so, like it or not, she isn't exactly 'childfree' anymore, even if she isn't actually a caretaker for that daughter.

I would say a card and flowers would be just fine -- and rather than making a big point of calling her "mother", just write her a nice note explaining that because it was "Mother's Day", and because she had married your dad, you wanted to take the opportunity to tell her how great you think they are together and that you really like her.
