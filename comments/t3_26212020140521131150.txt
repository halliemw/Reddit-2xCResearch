Sorry to reply to a day-old post, but have you thought of something like MUA or creepyPMs constructive criticism tags?  In MUA it's CCW, and the mods are really on top of make sure everything is constructive.  In creepyPMs, it's CAW (constructive advice welcome), and the mods stay on top of that one too.  It might be way too much work for you guys, but I know it works in those subreddits.
