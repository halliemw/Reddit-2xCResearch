Then don't respond to my posts that are not directed at you?

Please copy and past the exact sentence of mine that assigns blame to OP. Oh wait, you can't. Because you're just making it up.  And sociopaths can understand emotions better than most people...

Keep stalking my post history some more though, let me know how jealous you are of my condo.
