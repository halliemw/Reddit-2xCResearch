No arguments on accepting each other's differences but I guess I'm trying to explore the idea of intersetionality here.  A woman of color knows what it is to experience racism and also sexism, overlapping into a unique experience.  I guess what I'm suggesting is that fat women experience something very different than the "normal" skinny experience.  There is an "extra" kind of discrimination going on there beyond sexism.
