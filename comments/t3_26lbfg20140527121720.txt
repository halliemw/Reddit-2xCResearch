Good news is, if this is going to be a long term thing, now is the best time to tell him! Yeah maybe when he said you're easy to get off would have been a good time, but oh well, it's not like continuing this way will bring up a more opportune time. Get it out of your systems now, and then you can have guilt free sex! Maybe just emphasize to him that it isn't that you dont enjoy yourself, just that there isn't any climax. My SO eventually was okay with the idea that there doesn't have to be an end goal for me and it's still great
