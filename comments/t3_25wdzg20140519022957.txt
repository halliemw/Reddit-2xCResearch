Or they can just accept that forcing yourself on somebody is wrong, vile and dehumanizing.  And that there are consequences for that - no matter who it is you're raping. I think it's even more despicable that a man would do that to someone he married and ergo promised to provide for and protect. That's all fine and good except who's going to protect the wife in this situation from him? And what kind of life can a person have in a situation where they are forced to live with and have children for their tormentor? I'd say it's sad, but I don't think I have a word for it.
