There is no assumption of a magical inherent boy property. There is evidence. For example, boys with cloacal exstrophy (born without a penis) who are then castrated and raised as girls will still develop typical male attitudes and interests. Hormones are known to play a major role in this even in utero (girls with overproduction of male hormones in utero develop into tomboys with more interest in trucks than dolls, for example).

This is on top of the theoretical prediction from evolutionary psychology that women (who have superior verbal ability and empathy)  would be drawn to the more *social* sciences (sociology, anthropology, psychology) and men (who have superior mental rotation) would be drawn to the more *analytical* sciences (physics, computer science). These are all statistical patterns only, of course. We are all individuals.
