I think you should appreciate some of what you said instead of worrying about it. For example, you said your boyfriend is genuinely attracted to you and enjoys whatever "good" traits his partners have. So you know he doesn't think you're not good enough. He doesn't wish for you to look differently. He's attracted to you. 

If you want to have him appreciate your beasts, you might have to ask him. You don't have to say it that way if it makes you feel unsexy. Just tell him it turns you on if he grabs them or sucks them during sex. Also, try wearing some nice spring dresses. Find a dress that fits nicely in the waist and pillows out from there. It will kind of hide your hips & butt, and you can find a dress that's low cut in the front. I bet with the emphasis on your breasts, your boyfriend will do what you've already said he does: Appreciates whatever you bring to the table.
