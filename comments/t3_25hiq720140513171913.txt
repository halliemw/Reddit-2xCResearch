if you're using two forms of bc there's no need to worry. even if you're just using the pills for protection there's no need to worry, as long as you're taking them regularly and around the same time every day. the condoms are probably a great idea anyways because of the STI protection. who knows who this guy has been with between then and now, and if he used any protection.
