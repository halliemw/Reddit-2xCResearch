Yeah, I hear ya.  It took me a while to find a place I was willing to work with where I didn't feel like I was part of a human trafficking ring.  I also had a great person I just found by putting an ad on Craig's List. The place I use now uses all organic products and the people seem very cool and happy.  I have a regular person who comes now and we have good working relationship.
