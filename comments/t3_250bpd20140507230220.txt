I agree that the skirt is indeed questionable, but I still thought she was spot on in the way she addressed the gender disparity in the enforcement of the dress code.  She's not lying when she says boys get away with much worse.  I know a guy who would consistently wear hawaiian shirts completely unbuttoned, or maybe with one or two buttons at the bottom, with nothing underneath.  He was never reprimanded.
