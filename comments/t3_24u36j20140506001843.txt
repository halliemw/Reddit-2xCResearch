If the men you want to date are PUAs and/or RPs, yeah.

If not... you'll be fine. I've turned 30. So how is my love life? I'm getting married (and I never even looked for stable relationships or even planned to get married in the first place). Random male encounters still flirt with me. I've been asked out totally randomly on my way to work by some guy who thought I was cute. And I do not look younger than my age and my hair is super short, so...

My friend is 35 and a mum of three and she gets so much atenttion. Recently divorced she just met a guy 6 years younger who is crazy about her. She also gets asked out every once in a while when out and about. Even when she's with her kids. (Supposedly women with kids is another turn-off...)
