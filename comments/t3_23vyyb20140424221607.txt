This is some bullshit. School shave shown, again and again, that they are not capably of adequately handling cases of sexual assault on campus. 

Unfortunately, in certain communities the police often aren't much better. 

In a Florida State University case there were delays of months and even years in doing easy follow-ups on critical details that could have given a clear picture of what happened the night three football players took an underage drunk girl home from a bar. There were video cameras at the bar, student ID swipes in a cab, one of the men even filmed it. But the police took so long to follow up that by the time they finally did, the evidence was gone- tapes wiped, videos deleted. Disgusting.
