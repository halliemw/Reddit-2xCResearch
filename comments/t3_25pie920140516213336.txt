Wow, sounds like a rough situation.  She is very lucky to have you in her life.  I would recommend continuing to support her and don't try to manipulate her or force her to do anything.  Ultimately she is the one who needs to get herself out of that situation and it won't happen until she's ready.  She probably needs a lot of empathy (which is not the same as sympathy).  Something I've found very useful in my life is Non-Violent Communication.  You can google it.  You can learn it first and practice with her.  If she wants to learn it will give her some tools to be able to see and articulate her own needs.  When she knows what her needs are she will be able to act accordingly to get them met.  I have to leave now to meet some friends, but if you want me to expand on the NVC thing and why I am recommending it feel free to re here or pm me.  Best to you.
