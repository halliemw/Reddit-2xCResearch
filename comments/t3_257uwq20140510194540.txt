I'm torn here. On the one hand, I fully support strict dress codes. (though not uniforms) While it's true, dress alone does not tend to affect test scores, it does effect behavior. Fights become much more rare at a high school near mine when thy instituted uniforms. When everyone around you looks professional, you tend to act more professional. 

I'm glad tees students are standing up for what they believe in, and I do think administrators tend to target girls when it comes to dress codes. At my own school, sagging pants are a common occurrence, but the boys rarely get in any trouble for it. But there's a girl in the office for for the dress code every other day. It's especially uncomfortable, because most of our administrators are men.. You often get the feeling of being stated at. It's gross. I think the best solution would be to just institute a business casual dress code. Everyone wins.
