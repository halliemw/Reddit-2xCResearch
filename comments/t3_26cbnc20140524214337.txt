I got mine done and it hurt a lot. Not the most pain I've ever experienced, but when he turned the top curve of the heart to he flat part (dragging the curve through my freshly pierced ear!) THAT hurt. 

Now occasionally when I'm QTiping my ears I'll move it back to the first position and then I have to move it back. :(
