Totally second the advice here.  Don't think about it in terms of the store, look ahead to when school is done and behind you, and you are sitting in your first interview post graduation or just prior to it, going through your resume with a hiring manager at your dream job.  Saying that you took this job at a new company for the experience is key, underscoring the fact that you are a self-starter always ready for a challenge - when others say no and shy away, you say yes and jump in, not waiting for life to pick you out of a line up and hand you a perfect opportunity (which rarely, if ever, happens).  Also, don't look as taking Pam up on the referral a bad thing, it isn't a one and done type relationship I hope.  Say you take this new gig, graduate from school, and you both move on in your paths, but still keep in contact, who knows what might happen.  The world is a big place, networking is something to be approached with an abundance mentality.  People who help you want to see you succeed, so take the leap, do a great job, you'll make Pam look like a genius for recommending you in the first place, which will help her in her role.
