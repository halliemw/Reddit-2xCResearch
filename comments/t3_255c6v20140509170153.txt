You really can disagree and not invalidate.  Acknowledging the persons experience and then telling your take on things is a good start.  Please notice the hot topics that have already been posted on this thread.  IE: "you should be flattered when a stranger whistles at you."  "You ask men to assault you when you wear a skirt that short."  etc., etc..

We often get men "playing devils advocate" and seemingly "trying to have a conversation" when they are actually trying to tell us how right they are and make us defend our own words that they've twisted. *That* is invalidation.

We each only get one life and that automatically makes us equals.  Let's respect each other as equals.
