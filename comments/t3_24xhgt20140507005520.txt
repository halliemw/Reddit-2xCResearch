Hi! I'm not going to put my hand up for penpalling because I'm atrocious at responding to people in a timely manner, but penpals as an idea is great and I hope you're able to find some people to write to and hear from!

Alternatively, have you considered maybe setting up a blog? That way you can keep track of your life and you can get to know other bloggers who have similar interests to you. I made many internet friends that way over the years through blogging.
