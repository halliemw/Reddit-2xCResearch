Exactly! Just because I want to friends doesn't mean I automatically want to sleep with you...    
  
I hate it when guys talk about how girls friend-zone guys. My best friend is a guy and I **know** he would never think of me like that and vice versa, but we often get told that we'll probably end up together. Ummm...no thanks - we're *both* perfectly happy **just** being friends.   
  
I'm more than just my gender...
