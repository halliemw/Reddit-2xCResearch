The net is, and always should be, a place where you can have anonymity if you choose.  That being said, there are always going to be the sour apples.  For example, we can launch campaigns about tolerance and punish those with prejudice but racism has existed for thousands of years and continues to permeate.  It's possible that as time goes on we can reduce racism, but to do so we would also have to eradicate social stereotypes and circumstance like gang activity and poverty.  With gender roles, I think it's a much more complicated issue.  On both sides, men and women, you can see sweeping generalizations, prejudice, intolerance, ignorance, and an inability to see things from the other side, rationally debate, or compromise.
