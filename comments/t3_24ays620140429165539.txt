I don't at all mean to be insensitive but telling you what to say to be comforting is like telling you what to say to be romantic. What I would think is sweet and encouraging could be outrageously offensive to a different girl. I'm into black humor.

If she's "struggling" and "distraught" call the clinic with her and ask how to set up some extra time to talk to a councelor/social worker to make sure she feels okay before, during and after her choice. Call Option Line (800.712.HELP). Do some reasearch and learn about what she's about to go through and what she might be feeling and see what matches up with your actual girlfriend and what doesn't.
