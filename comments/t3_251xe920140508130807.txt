Regardless of whether he outright refused he still downplayed her decision and told her it was "overboard". Whatever his reasons he is not accepting the idea and trying to convince him to do so just won't work. Telling someone to "communicate" with someone they are having communication problems with isn't really great advice and if she shifts the focus on herself instead of on him I think she'll have a better outcome.  
Also making him go into the session with a preconceived negative opinion about it will put him there closed minded and I doubt he'd get any benefit from it anyway.
