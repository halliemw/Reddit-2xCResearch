I however clicked on a gross pornographic link today somebody posted here  on  twox to troll (claimed it was something else) and now it's  0:30 and I still can't sleep (thanks to issues I have with certain types of images) . Whoever did this, you suck and I hope you'll suffer from insomnia for at least a month. Or a year. 

In theory there are good sides to being default, I agree. But if this continues, I don't know if I even want to read anything on twox anymore.
