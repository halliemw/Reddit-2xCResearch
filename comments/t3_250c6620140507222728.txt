I'd say take the direct route. Talk to her. Don't place blame, but find out if she really wants to do it, or if she doesn't want to be a part of it but hasn't been able to find a way to (nicely) tell you. If she does, and seems sincere, then don't kick her out. If she doesn't, you've given her a graceful way to bow out.

Also, depending on her job, taking off for your bridal shower (which isn't actually mandatory for the bridesmaids to attend btw) may have put her employment at risk, *especially* since she took the previous weekend off for a family matter. 

Really. Just talk to her. At the worst, you find out she doesn't want to do it, and at the best, you can (gently) let her know that you'd like her to be a more active part of the wedding planning and goings on!
