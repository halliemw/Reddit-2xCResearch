When I was in high school I always thought college was some sort of magic place. I'd finally be independent, away from my parents, find tons of friends away from all the idiots from my small home town.. Yeah, turns out other towns have idiots too and they also go to college somewhere. Independence actually is hard. I didn't like the city, didn't like the university, started to hate learning the things I used to love when I still was in school. This got somewhat better when I changed majors and moved, but my college years definitely weren't as wonderful as I imagined them to be. 

TL;DR: you're not weird.
