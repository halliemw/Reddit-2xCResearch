I know a couple people, one in particular, who got lyme's disease and it went untreated because all she got was a tiny little tick bite and no noticeable bulls eye. It attempted to destroy her life and she's still recovering (five years later).

Just go get checked just in case. It's notoriously untreated and undiagnosed.
