For the office with people I am with daily: mention the SO repeatedly, in everyday conversation (not the "don't hit on me I have a boyfriend" obvious way). Everyone knows who he is and the level of commitment. For random clients and people I won't see again I have worn a ring on the left hand. It is like and invisible shield. If flirting is attempted I switch the topic and use my 'serious' voice. As a younger female I also attempt to dress more conservatively (still working on this).
