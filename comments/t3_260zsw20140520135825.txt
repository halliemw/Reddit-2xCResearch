I have a question. I think this about all Christians with an atheist spouse, actually; how does your mother reconcile the idea that she believes your father will go to hell? You may not have the answer, or not care to share it, which is fine. I'm just curious how a person could keep themselves from constantly trying to save their loved ones from what they truly believe will be eternal suffering.

Regardless of how what your mom thinks, I have to say that it's awesome she and your dad are so respectful towards each other on this subject.
