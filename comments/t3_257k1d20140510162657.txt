I hope nobody minds if I ask this here :) I never knew blurred vision was a bad sign - I've had very blurred vision for quite a while. I thought it was a sign of low blood pressure (which I have) but should I be more worried? Id feel stupid brining it up at the docs, I'm worried that they'd just brush it off and tell me to get an eye test. Also, I started the mini pill in February. Last month my period was normal (3 weeks after my last one, lasted 6 days). But it is suddenly two weeks late with no signs of it happening anytime soon :/ I'm worried I haven't been taking my pill right, I was told I have a 12 hour gap for Zelleta but I usually take it within 5 hours and I haven't missed a pill.
