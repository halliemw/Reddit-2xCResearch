I am pro-choice, I don't take any great umbrage to the opposite point of view, because at this stage in my life I am not changing my mind. It seems to many not all pro-life advocates love the fetus more than they love children, they love the symbolism of being pro-life. We live in a society that isn't very family friendly for working parents, we have terrible parental leave policies compared to many other countries. Because of that I am pretty dubious about the intentions behind some pro-life arguments.
