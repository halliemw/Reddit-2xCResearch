This is what kills me the most. Redditors act like the entire justice system is skewed against them, which most definitely is not the case. Women are so brow-beaten and discouraged from pressing charges that most rapists are never brought in for questioning, let alone charged with anything or brought to trial.  
In my case, when I was raped in college, the school put such enormous pressure on me to not even go to the police, saying they were corrupt, that because the college was in a bad neighborhood that this wouldn't even be a priority, that townies were prejudiced against the college students. So I instead went through the "college judicial system," where I was told they wouldn't suspend him or expel him because it would "ruin his life". Even though the standard they're supposed to make decisions off of is "preponderance of evidence" (meaning more likely than not) and he had ADMITTED to doing it in front of the head of residential life (he was an RA - thus, employed by the college), nothing happened. He even continued to be an RA in the dorm for the rest of the year, and I had to sit there, terrified in my room, as he did rounds every day.  
I didn't mean to hijack your story, but I just wanted to re-affirm that your take on things is completely consistent with my own experiences and the experiences of every girl that I've met who's been through something like this. Victims are routinely shamed into silence and discredited. It is a terrifying and powerless place to be in and I feel so sick and ashamed that he was never brought to justice.
