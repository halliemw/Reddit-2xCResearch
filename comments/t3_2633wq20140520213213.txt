Sucks about your friend, and your mom is totally wrong. A full, like, 3/4 of my friends are male. Some of them have girlfriends, and... awesome, the more the merrier. Hell, sometimes it prefer it, because I know it means they aren't just friends with me in the hopes that one day their kindness points will rack up enough that I sleep with them. And I don't drop my male friends just because I get in a relationship!

Did you want advice on the friend situation, too? Otherwise, just... yeah, your mother is wrong, cross-gender platonic friendships are rad and totally okay, even in relationships.
