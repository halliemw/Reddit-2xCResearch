That sounds extremely frustrating.  I haven't gone through that yet, but I get frustrated just contemplating some aspects of pregnancy - like, if I was pregnant and drank half a glass of wine, and got berated for it by a stranger, which of those actions would actually harm the baby?  Probably the stress of being berated by the stranger, but not the half glass of wine.

It seems like we expect pregnant women to become this idolized perfection and judge them harshly if they don't live up to it.  I hope I'm just over thinking things and they don't turn out that way.  But for you, I hope that in the end you realize that stress and being upset causes your baby more harm than the food/drink/massage/whatever, so telling the world to go to hell and enjoying the food/drink/massage/whatever (when you can) isn't you being a bad person, it's you taking care of yourself and the thing growing in you.

I don't know if that came out right but I'm wishing you the best!
