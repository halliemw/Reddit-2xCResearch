Calling someone cute in this context relies upon the assumption that based on their gender they shouldn't be doing said activity, and they should leave the activity to a person of the opposite gender. Between SO's it is fine as already there is a male-female relationship whereby each recognizes the other gender. Sex is a primitive thing where you succumb to your gender role, so between SOs it is intimate and fun. I call my girlfriend cute when she punches me, and we laugh about it as she enjoys being the feminine gender, I enjoy being the manly gender, who gets punched/bitten a lot by his domineering girlfriend. We laugh every day about this. However, outside of a relationship it is rude. In a professional setting, on the street, strangers we don't know..  we want to treat everyone equally, regardless of gender. Anything else is belittling, unprofessional and completely rude.
