Hey that girl was just a very rude person, don't let that sort of thing get to you! I'm not a woman, and I've never been in a relationship, but I have a friend who has a pretty good-looking girlfriend. Sometimes people hit on her in front of him. I've asked him if it bothers him, and what he said is what I think you need to hear.

"She chose **me**. At the end of the day, she'll be coming home with **me**, sleeping next to **me**, not some random guy that was hitting on her."

Maybe just repeat this to yourself whenever you feel a bout of low self-esteem? Remember that he was the one that asked you out. He chose **you**. He probably knows he's good looking, and still bats away all those women because he wants **you**.
