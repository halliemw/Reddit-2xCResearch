> He's afraid of what corresponds with poverty, and this happens in low income schools of ANY race.
> Look up any list of the most violent or dangerous high schools, spoiler alert, every single one of them is in the inner city. You're going to find philadelphia, chicago, the bronx, LA, etc.
> Of the thousands of suburban highschools, every few years a kid gets bullied too hard and goes nuts. You can avoid these schools, but you might as well avoid driving since its far more dangerous.
> The dangerous inner-city schools have weapons and drugs being seized on a daily basis. People get hurt REGULARLY. Seriously, don't take my word for it, google this shit.
> And to reiterate one more point to make it extra clear, this happens in the low income areas of hispanic, black, and white students. It's not about race. Impoverished inner city schools are more dangerous, that fact isn't even debatable.
