People who post here are sometimes just venting about bad experiences and want comfort or help. If we were all having horrible things happen to all of us all the time, the front page of this subreddit would change a hundred times a day! Being female definitely has its ups and downs, just like any other gender. The fact that you are concerned now already means you're going to raise your daughter nicely :)
