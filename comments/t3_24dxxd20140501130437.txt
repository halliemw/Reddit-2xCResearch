Just as an FYI, your not allowed to get that information because of HIPAA. Your wife can sign a release form that gives you access to her medical information. I couldn't find one specifically for Alabama BlueCross/Blue Shield, but here is a general one: http://www.healthcare-information-guide.com/support-files/basic-hipaa-release-form.pdf

Here is the information on the privacy office: 

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama

Privacy Office

P. O. Box 2643

Birmingham, Alabama 35202-2643

Telephone: 1 800 292-8868

I would call them and ask them where to send it. I would assume you would just mail it to them, but ask them if they have a specific form they want you to fill out. 

I got that info from this: https://www.bcbsal.org/pdfs/HIPAA-ENR-467.pdf
