It sounds like you work where there's actually other people?  Even if you're just making small talk while standing in the doorway of someone's office, chatting with the receptionist, sharing lunch with whoever happens to be in the breakroom, that's all little slices of interaction.  It's nice and it's non-committal, and it doesn't mean you have to be BFF's or join a sports league you're not interested in, but just see it as a little way to get in some kind of interaction, with no expectations, just exchange of words and sharing some things, no matter how superficial it may be.

I work in an office of 2 and I usually only see my boss when he comes around every other week to drop off my paycheck.  I am literally the only one there.  Most of our clients don't even know I exist and honestly I prefer it that way.
