I think the question is how old is your underbody and where it came from. You see, certain makers use different materials and that can affect how much its corrosion resistance. 

Now, another question is what sort of a climate your underbody is exposed to. If it's frigid, then the chemicals used to unfreeze it can cause corrosion.  They recommend washing it regularly, either by yourself if you have the tools or have it done professionally. I've taken mine out in the harshest of winters, never washed it down afterwards, and things turned out fine for me. If it's in a high humidity environment, that can also lead to corrosion.  This is trickier to avoid, as you can't just "air" it out. 

If the underbody is prone to ground collisions from outdoor activities or low ground clearance, that could rub away any protective coating that could be applied. You should make sure there's always lubrication on any parts that slide or move against something as well, as the friction could increase the risk of corrosion. You don't want it getting stuck in an awkward position while trying to use it (trust me, had that happen).  It's a personal choice, and I think overall it's only required for the harshest of environments.

TL;DR Keep it clean, lube the right areas, and unless it's frigid or a jungle you should be fine without it.
