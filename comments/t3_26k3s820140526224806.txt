I think the "not all men" issue is the result of a messaging problem that the feminist movement has had from day 1: that it's difficult to show the problems that women face in society without something causing those problems, and men often feel like they're being blamed. The fact that it's some men (and in some cases, some men and some women) causing the problem doesn't mean that all men are responsible nor that they should take the blame. The vast majority of feminists do not ask that men as a group take on the blame--in fact, most feminists would be fine with things changing for the better and nobody taking the blame--but men tend to hear the bad things that *some* men are doing and want to make sure that they're not being blamed and that it's clear that they're not part of it. That's human nature.

So that would be my proposal: we need to work on our messaging such that men feel less like they're being accused and more like they're a vital part of the solution.
