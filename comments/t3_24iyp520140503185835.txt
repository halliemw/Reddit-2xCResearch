Kudos for your wise and strong attitude!  I'm glad you've discussed this with your parents.  I don't think you are "fuller" either. I think you should go to the administration and explain the situation.  Ask to be backed up in that you meet school dress codes and are not required to comply with dress appropriate to China.
