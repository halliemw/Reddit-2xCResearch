That's an interesting and complex question: where does mental illness give way to cultural differences.  I'd suggest that some cultures (especially smaller internal subcultures) are "mentally ill", but I'm afraid that is simply my privileged position within this specific popular modern culture that colors my opinion.  

I may find other cultures and ways of life distasteful and/or abhorrent, but does that make them somehow an "illness"?  Or is that just my opinion casting judgement?

Regardless, it is a shame that the many warnings that he was deeply and dangerously disturbed slipped through multiple safety nets.  You're entirely correct in that we're all to blame when someone like this lashes out, we've all failed to build a more healthy community to live within.
