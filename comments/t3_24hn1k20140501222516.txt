I've seen changing stations in men's rooms in big stores like Wal-Mart and Meijer's. I've seen them in college campus men's rooms - usually with the C scratched off so it says "Baby _hanging Station" haha so funny guys. 

Can't recall seeing them in smaller places (gas station bathrooms, grocery store, etc.), but I also can't remember the last time I used those restrooms.
