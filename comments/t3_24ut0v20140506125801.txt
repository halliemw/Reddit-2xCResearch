Relevant xkcd [comic](http://www.xkcd.com/1357/)

I really appreciate a community where I know I won't come across rape jokes. It's not even about being against them, as some comedians have made some I find funny. But knowing that content here can't make light of rape and discussions about assault are tagged as having TWs is really comforting. I don't want to come across people talking about sexual assault casually like they do in other subs all the time.
