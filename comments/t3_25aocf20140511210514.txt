I use the keeper (reusable, made by the same company as the moon cup) and I'll try to answer your questions based on my experiences! 

The cup doesn't go that far in, at least at the time I insert it. It seems to travel further into my vagina when I sleep for example. It isn't hard to bear down to move it further towards the opening. As long as it is correctly inserted you won't be able to feel it.

The stem will probably be uncomfortable if it is sticking out of your vagina. My cup came with a long stem but I cut it off because I didn't feel like I needed it for removal. 

There are many different techniques for inserting a cup. Since the Keeper is fairly stiff, I felt like I needed a very small insertion point when I was first trying. Occasionally if I'm not doing a good job with the insertion, the cup won't unfold once I've inserted it, and then you need to redo it. On the other hand, occasionally the cup will snap open before I get it inserted, which can smack against my labia for example. It doesn't really hurt but it's kind of annoying. Don't be scared of it.

The first 2 or 3 cycles I used the cup, I had a pretty hard time removing it. It would either be hard to find it in my vagina if it was too far up, or I couldn't get a good enough grip to release the seal. It was scary at the time, but it actually just takes practice to get used to the process. My motivation was: I just paid $35 for this thing and I'm going to use it, damn it!

It's probably a good idea to wear panty liners at first, until you are sure that you are inserting the cup correctly. I don't anymore; I have only leaked once wearing my cup and that was because it wasn't inserted properly.

Good luck and enjoy!
