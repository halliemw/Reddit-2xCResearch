When I was 21, I was pretty much in the same boat as you -- crushes on fictional people, none on real people. Then, at about age 25, the guys in my social circle suddenly seemed to mature or blossom or something: They went from being overgrown teenagers to sexy, adult men with skills and complex inner lives and 5-o'clock shadows. 

I'm not sure if the change was in my perception, or if the guys I know really did just grow up right then (maybe a little of both?), but I wanted to offer a little anecdata that this issue might spontaneously resolve itself.
