If you can't feel any indentations around the walls of your cup and you're able to twist back and forth fairly easily it's probably open, sealed and in correctly. 

The problem is sometimes your tired, rushing or whatever and not paying attention, thus an improper insert. If you take your time you should be okay, but it does take practice. Now I rarely have any issues, and it's purely my own fault if I do.

It really sounds more complicated and weird then it actually is, haha, I promise.
