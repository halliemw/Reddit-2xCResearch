Yeah, we've gotten into some pretty serious arguments about it.  But, honestly, its not his fault, and he didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't have to come. But he never strongly opposes or supports my decisions.   Also he's kind of an introvert so he's okay with coming home after work and playing the guitar.  I asked him to go running with me and he was excited about it, but he's only done it once, and has not really offered to go again.  He's supportive, but not active about it, which makes me crazy sometimes.  Yesterday he actually admitted to me that he could be more supportive and that was surprising to hear.  I need him to be an active partner but I feel guilty because I am worried about stressing him out when this is his time to further his career and put out papers.
