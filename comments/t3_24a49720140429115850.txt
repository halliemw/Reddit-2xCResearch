Be careful with these statements... I statements are good, but it is easy to use the formula and still end up using you statements.  For instance, telling her she is disregarding your feelings is a you statement.  You are assigning motive to her behavior.  If I was putting this together I would say something like, "When you do ____, I think you are disregarding my feelings and I feel insignificant." 

Sorry to nit pick, but it really can change the way the the conversation goes!!
