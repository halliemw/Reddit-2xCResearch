I don't think it would be - the cups essentially suction themselves to the walls of your vagina to catch the blood flow, so I don't think cervical or uterus position really affects it. I could be completely wrong though, and if so someone should definitely correct me. I know there are women out there who can't get menstrual cups to work for them even with "normal" uteruses (uterii?), but you could always give it a shot! Maybe buy a cup and try it out when your period is in a lighter stage, and wear a panty liner just in case it doesn't work for you.
