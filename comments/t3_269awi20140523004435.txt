Hey, when your doctor is saying years it's because you are on your way to cirrhosis of the liver.  Please get immediate help for the alcoholism.  Everything you are saying is very familiar to me.  Not eating or eating sparsely or poorly is a classic symptom.  You are likely to the point where you are replacing meals with alcohol.  I have PTSD as well, and I know what it's like to self medicate.  You don't want to die this way, ok?  It takes years, and it is agonizing.  Please get help for this, and it will make it so much easier to get help for everything else.  My dad died at 32.... it can and will happen if you don't get help.
