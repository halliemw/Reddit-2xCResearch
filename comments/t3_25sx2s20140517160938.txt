I didn't know if many men cry themselves to sleep at night because everyones saying he's a womanizer. 

 Slut carries a lot of weight with it. You regularly see women questioning their own actions once 'slut has been applied to them' maybe they felt fine about the sexual encounters before but I believe it is a term used mostly to degrade women.

Im fairly sure when most people have casual sex, their main priority is their own sexual pleasure. What you seem to be referring to is what casually called gold digging. Which I think is more about creating an entire relationship/attachment. not the act of sex itself. 

For a lot of people relationships are like a free pass on slut shaming. What we're talking about usually refers to a woman hooking up with a guy, and having no lasting relationship or connection (and hence not asking for money/gifts" and being shamed for that. 

Its a different world for men and women. Reddit is full of guys posting about going to clubs , looking to pick up guys to take home. That kind of casual hookup attitude just doesn't see to be allowed for women. If a girls horny and wants to pick up a hot guy, and never see him again, everyone seems to immediately have a very low opinion of her. 

Oh, except if your the one guy she hooked up with. Apparently every guy thinks the the girl they hooked up with was awesome, its the girls hooking up with ether guys who are sluts.
