Once, a dude said something vulgar to me on the street, and when he realized I was with my boyfriend (a few steps behind me), apologized *to him.* I realized then that I'm not ever street harassed when I'm with a man (but definitely have when I'm with other women) - and I was suddenly really pissed that all these guys respect my boyfriends' and male friends' ownership of me, but not my ownership of myself. Some people really do think women are property and men are people. I agree with the article - I do have a boyfriend, but I don't see any reason to validate anyone's worldview by suggesting it would be okay to harass me if I wasn't "claimed" by a man.

By contrast, this past summer we were out a pub with some friends and a young man approached and asked if I wanted to dance. I told him that was a sweet offer and I would, but I had come with this guy (my boyfriend was sitting next to me). I really appreciated that he then addressed *me* first to apologize (which I said was not necessary), and then wished us both a nice night. So simple! Anything that encourages guys to treat women they're hitting on like people rather than like public property up for grabs unless a person (=man) already owns them is good in my book.
