If both parties are over eighteen, I don't think it should be banned by law. Institution rules and professional ethics standards should generally ban it over the *massive* conflict of interest, but I'm disinclined to say that a case like a college student dating a professor she had the previous semester (so grades are no longer in question) is inherently bad.
