As a gay man, I can safely say you have every right to be livid.

Gay or not, he sexually assaulted your partner KNOWING that he was both:

* a) Not gay
* b) Not single

I think you should talk to your friends. Ask them how they would feel if a mutual friend of either gender approached them and kissed them without their consent. I'm pretty sure they'd rethink things a little.

(Sexual assault **does** include forced kissing.)
