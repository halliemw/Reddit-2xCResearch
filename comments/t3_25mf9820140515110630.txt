I've never had mine pierced. It's not that I'm afraid of the pain of doing it or anything, I just honestly don't really care about earrings, so I don't have any desire to get them pierced and never have. I remember when I was younger my mom asked about getting them pierced a couple times, like it was just something that was expected of girls so she assumed I'd want them pierced, but my response was always basically just "meh". Not interested.
