I have posted this somewhere around here on reddit but I was 5 when i was raped by my step uncle. I was called a liar and was pushed out of the family because of it. No one believed me. I told adults and they all dismissed it as being a kid. I don't really have a point to this but it has been one of those days when I am really affected by it.
