Wow. BPD is *incredibly* hard to deal with. I have a very tough time dealing with a best friend who has it; I could not image being married to someone dealing with it. The success rate for relationships for those suffering from BPD is almost non-existent. 

The best thing you can do is get into some therapy together, and she certainly needs to be in therapy independently. This is *not* something random people on the internet can offer you advice about. This is an incredibly serious and difficult disorder that only a professional can help you with. Even then, the outlook ain't good.

Personally, all I can say is if you truly love this girl even with her illness (with BPD there is no "in spite of her illness." A personality disorder *is* who she is.), then buckle yourself in for a completely irrational roller coaster because that's just what life is going to be. She will love you (and everything. and everyone in her life) more intensely than you can imagine, but the pitfalls of that are huge. She will fear you are betraying her at the slightest sign of disagreement. She will do everything she can to push you away. These likely aren't fights you're ever going to resolve or issues that are ever going to go away. You just have to be there and love her no matter what and accept that that's who you've chosen to marry.

Please, please, please make an appointment with a counselor immediately. And good luck.
