> women flashing their breasts in a sexualized manner, often showing more skin, everywhere

That I think is the root of the cultural problem with breast feeding in public: Breasts are sexualized, and seeing a bare breast in any context is supposed to be a sexual thing. Breastfeeding in public is counter-cultural, in the literal sense that it runs counter to our cultural expectations of the nature and purpose of breasts. This can create a kind of 'cultural dissonance' which can be uncomfortable or confusing to people. Not knowing how to react they fall back on culturally approved scripts.
