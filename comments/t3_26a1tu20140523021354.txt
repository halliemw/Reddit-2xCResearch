Perhaps, but the statistics could be skewered(Like in Chicago. Every murder became "death by misadventure".) and murders aren't dropping that much.

Also, statistics aside, if this woman was in the US, she wouldn't have to worry about being gang-raped after she found out they are out there.

The gun is the great equalizer. Which is a great and a *terrible* thing.

Regardless, whats your advice for our friend OP?
