I agree. I've already been working on getting back in shape. It's something I've struggled with my whole life. It's just been worse lately. It's funny though, I was organizing old photos the other day and it's come to my realization that no matter how big or small I've ever been, ive still felt hugely fat and disgusting. 

My weight directly correlates with all that's wrong with my head/emotions. That's why I guess it bothered me to have it pointed out. The eating part directly correlates with everything bad that I feel. So I guess when it's pointed out so directly that I've gotten heavier, it feels the same as pointing out all my mental and emotional failings. Obviously he didn't know any of that, and how could he be expected to? I guess it just brought up all the feelings of shame I always feel anyway.
