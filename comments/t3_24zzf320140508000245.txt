What gladdit says, but modify a bit. You can get away with being soft spoken, but you have to learn to look hard. Watch Hannibal Lecter, or Frank Underwood in "House of Cards" : these are people that do not have to raise their voice to have the entire rooms attention. Practice that look, the blank eyed stare that says I will eat your fucking soul. Be nice, be attentive, but whenever someone decides to play with that "fresh meat" you give them that glare, speak slow and steady, never taking your eyes off them. It may be hard at first, but you'll get used to it. It's sure to keep them on their toes. 
       Even if you mess up, don't apologize. You are the boss, not them. There is a reason you are being promoted over them. Say "I will deal with it", and do so no matter how late you have to stay. You'll have a reputation as someone not to be crossed very quickly.
