It wasn't rude!! I was happy for you, and I'm sorry if it came across as sarcastic!! I LOVE big ang! It's great that you have people to help you out and support you!! :) 

I'm not bitter at all! It's FANTASTIC that your relatives are ability to help out. Money problems are the absolute worst and knowing that you aren't gonna owe back a bazillion dollars in interest must be one of the best feelings there is.
