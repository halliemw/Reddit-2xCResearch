I never carry a purse, I hate having to hold onto it. I manage to avoid purses by keeping my phone in my butt pocket if I'm wearing jeans. If I'm wearing a dress or skirt I keep my phone in my bra under my armpit. This works great if you aren't a super tiny person because your rib cage will be wide enough to allow it to fit. I'm 6' so even though I'm thin it works. Wouldn't work for my 5'2" roommate who is 95 lbs on a good day. Her phone also happens to be the biggest smartphone on existence (and she keeps it in an otterbox to boot). She just brings a small cross body bag.
