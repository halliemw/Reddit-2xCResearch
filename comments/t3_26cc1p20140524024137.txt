This so much. I just read a post about a woman being.embarrassed because she has been cat called and almost sexually assaulted. Bottom comment was someone giving her 'advice' to not go into 'urban' areas and to wear pants and take a man with her as an escort. When did victim blaming become ok here? Ugh.
