Why not discuss a timeline? He doesn't have to sign up for proposing on June 3rd 2014 but he can say something like: I see us getting engaged around end 2014/spring 2015, with maybe a year or two of engagement. Or if he isn't that sure about it something more vague : it will happen at the very least in the next two years.

You can also decide for yourself what you would like to happen and what you are okay with, for example: I would be okay if it happened this year, but I don't see myself waiting for more than 3. 

You both need to do this because if there is a chance your plans don't match up and you want the benefits of marriage you are wasting your time in a relationship that won't get you that. It's okay if he doesn't want to but it's not okay to allow you to think it might happen when it either definitely won't or most likely won't or won't happen in a reasonable timeline.

By having this conversation you will feel relaxed since you are not waiting indefinitely (stressful), he will realize this is an issue he needs to think seriously on and not just in a "one day" and in case your plans are incompatible you can really reconsider the relationship or your expectations. 

And it still allows for the surprise of the question.
