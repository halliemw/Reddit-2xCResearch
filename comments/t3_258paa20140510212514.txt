Imagine there was a guy you reeeeeally liked like so much that your whole body exploded with phantasmagoria every time the pinky of his hand brushed against the skin of your arm accidentally.

Now imagine that guy has some funky ass problem with his nipples, or some weird scar all over is abdomen, or stretch marks ('cause guys have 'em too!) I mean. Would you really give that much of a shit, if you liked this guy, and he was sexy to you and made you feel good?

I wouldn't. I'd just saddle up.

Sex is meant to be FUN! It's like dancing, if you're self conscious you're going to have less fun and you're definitely not going to dance any better when you're doing the modest hip-sway in place. So, you know. Fuck like no one's watching.
