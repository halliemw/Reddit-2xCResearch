Maybe not initially but I can imagine many women eventually reaching a point that they're proud of their survival and at the same time still want to feel sexy. Plus it doesn't call attention to the scar so much as reveal it, but the shape of the suits pull the eye away so that you often don't even notice it and notice the suit instead. 

 Also, I got to watch a breast reconstruction surgery once and the doctor was awesome about explaining things during it, and mentioned that so many women may feel totally OK about their bodies 90% of the time but if they ever want to go swimming, there is no suit that will fit properly on a woman who has had a mastectomy and that is a driving force behind the decision to get the reconstruction for many women. So suits like these, though maybe slightly less "runway'd" would be hugely beneficial for them.
