One aspect of this article struck me

"Imagine turning on the television, going to the movies, switching on a video game, opening a magazine or a book or an anything, and never being able to see anyone who looks like you and isnâ€™t some kind of two-dimensional, tropey caricature of the entire demographic of people you happen to belong to."

It is true that this is an issue for the demographic the author is talking about, but if the reverse were put in place in all of our media, then millions of straight, cis gendered, non minorities would now feel this way when they went to the same media. And if that is the fair thing to do, so be it, but those consumers would not consume that media, and it would fail.

I don't say it would fail because it is morally or ethically right, just that media is a product, plain and simple. The producers want money, and they go with the route they feel is most likely to get them money. 

But all is not lost, the world doesn't change overnight. Shows like Ru-Pauls drag race and Orange is the new black are slowly changing the types of media that the majority will consume. 

I think the author should be a little more patient and not expect the world to change overnight.
