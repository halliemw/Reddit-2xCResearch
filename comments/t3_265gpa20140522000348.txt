Research the price range of type of rentals in the area similar to the Craigslist listings and see if the listing is within that range. Also take someone with you to the rental. My city as an website for the county appraisal district and I've used the site to verify ownership of properties I've checked out on Craigslist. The site has an option for name as well as address lookup. You should also call be able to call or visit in person if there is no website. Go at different times of the day to check out the neighborhood and see what the vibe is like. Never, never sign a lease until you see the place in person. Always keep receipts and records, and get everything in writing. I wouldn't even put in a security deposit until you're 100% sure you want the place as many landlords won't give it back if you change your mind and live somewhere else (doesn't matter if you signed a lease or not).

For roommates I don't know how else to really know what they're like other than hanging out or actually live with them. Maybe meet them for coffee/lunch and talk with them before signing a lease.

Look for other sites that offer more "secure" dealing, like a realtor association.
