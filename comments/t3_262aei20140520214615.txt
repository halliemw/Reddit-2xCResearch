I completely support comprehensive sex-ed and open access to non abortifacient contraception. These views are not irreconcilable with being pro life.

I also support non-profit services for women who choose not to get abortions, like the Positive Alternatives program, so long as they provide factually accurate medical consultation. In addition I'm completely supportive of welfare programs that support a woman's decision to keep her child.
