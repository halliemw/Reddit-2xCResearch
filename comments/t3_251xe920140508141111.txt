> Go against his objections. Make him go

I don't think you know how counseling works.  In order for it to be effective in any way you have to want to go there and you have to want to get better.  Being forced or threatened to go wont put anyone in a frame of mind they need to be in to actually make improvements.  All it will do is being someone to therapy who is hostile and defensive, good luck getting any improvement out of that.
