I've never seen someone downvoted for providing options. That's what pro-CHOICE is about -- having the ability to choose.

I disagree with pro-life(/anti-abortion) positions, not because I think abortions are good, but because I think women should be able to choose. I think that someone trying to take options away from women is doing a bad thing. For that reason, I personally have no problem with downvoting a post that tries to convince women not to abort by telling them that it is morally the wrong thing to do. I think that these comments are hurtful.
