I'm glad you wrote this. Ex-fat girl here whose entire life and all relationships in it have been deeply effected by those years. It's jncredible when you notice that newfound respect you mentioned. It's a rough world out there for overweight women and in a very different way than for men, BUT that doesn't have to belittle the experience of men who go through the same thing. You still have emotions, feelings, insecurities, whatever, you're just told by society that they aren't allowed and are somehow wrong. Just wanted to tell you I'm happy to see a man speak up in a respectful way, a way that doesn't negate the experience of females while shedding light on the fact that body image issues dont show mercy to men. Good for you.
