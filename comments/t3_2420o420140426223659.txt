How can you not like Willow!?  She's just so adorable and nerdy and if you stick with it, she has a bit of a transformation.  

Of all the characters on the show she's one of the most well developed, totally believable and relate-able, and has the hugest arc with the most satisfying ending.  Xander coming in a very close second.  He's well worth sticking around for as well.

Edit:  Also, the entire first season and half of the second season is extremely campy and kitchy.  It gets better after that big thing happens.  It really hits it's stride after that.
