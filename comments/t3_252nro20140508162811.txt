I've gone no-make-up (except for special occasions or when I'm bored). I look just fine without make-up, it's great for my skin, and I save time in the mornings. It's changed my perception of me for the better, too - I feel like I look normal with no make-up, instead of feeling like I "have to put my face on" before I go out in the morning.
