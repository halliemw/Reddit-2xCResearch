I can't really remember anything that might have happened to me, though I'm pretty young so I have plenty of time. The closest thing I can think of is this one guy who was on the fringes of our group of friends who would turn most anything I said into a sexual joke. I've never really considered that sexism as much as him just being the creepy fucker he is to everyone.
