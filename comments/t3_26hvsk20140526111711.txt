As someone who's backpacked alone for five weeks in the Dominican Republic ...

A lot of it is just finding ways to stay safe. I had pepper spray, which I never used. I made friends. I talked to women my own age. 

I wore a fake wedding ring because ...

1. It shows I don't want to date.
1. I have someone waiting for me.
1. I can pay a ransom.

I do wish SOMEONE had told me how dangerous it was to travel as a women when I was 19 and studying abroad. All the information I got was sugarcoated, and showing up to an environment of street harassment was a huge shock.
