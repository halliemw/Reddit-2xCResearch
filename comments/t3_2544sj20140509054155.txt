You know, I've always felt that Australians are much more socially conservative than we view ourselves as being. The legal and political position of abortion in Australia was never really satisfying. Abortion has been available, but access to abortion is not protected as a right, and there has never been a satisfying debate about it.

Everybody hates the culture wars, and I suspect that this is the reason that there hasn't been a strong movement to make sure that the current easy access to abortion in Australia receives some sort of relatively permanent legal protection. Now, a Prime Minister who is a shameless conservative ideologue has been elected and it is too late to pass laws protecting access to abortion. I fully expect it to be much harder to get an abortion in many places in Australia before Abbott is ousted.
