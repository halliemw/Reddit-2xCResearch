I didn't know about this community before but, from reading a few posts and comments since it became a default sub, I think it's a place I'll be frequenting more often.

Just for a bit of background about me, in case you were wondering: I'm a man; I'd call myself a born feminist in as much as it never occurred to me that feminism should have to exist, having grown up in a house full of women. I was lucky enough to grow up in a household where gender wasn't made into an issue by my parents. I've been much more vocal about gender issues since I've become an adult, for obvious reasons.

I love what I've seen of this sub's content so far and will be intrigued to see its development, now that's open to all. I sincerely hope that it's a good move by powers that be of reddit.
