I got mine while lunch monitoring in grade 6 (10 I think?). I knew what was coming because some friends and I had discovered Judy Blume the year before and my mom gave me a puberty and you style book when I developed boobs which was a few months before my period came. I remember having a dentist appointment that day, my dad came to pick me up early from school for the appointment and I knew I needed a pad so I went through my mom's things and thought a pantyliner would be fine. I told my mom when I got home from the dentist's office and she gave me some real pads. She also called my grandmothers and we went for a lady's night out to celebrate my womanhood.
