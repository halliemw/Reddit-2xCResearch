>I work with family members too and it IS a nightmare but for other reasons (thank god they get their work done but they DO make asses of themselves at company functions).

Technically isn't it just family being silly around family? Or is this not a family owned business? I can see how difficult it would be working with family, when people assume that they are free from,criticism because of relation. 


We don't have HR, but my supervisor is in a touchy situation. They do the bare minimum of work, so they can't be fired without either them screaming discrimination against a pregnant women...
