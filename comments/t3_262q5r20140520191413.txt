Okay.... I have a feeling you don't want to be a parent right now...... So I'm guessing you've already made plans. Which is good and responsible of you. Just realize that if you tell him... you are going to make him feel hugely responsible for your situation. And... you lied... and that isn't fair to him. 
  So... tell him what you're going through, don't be a chicken shit now....at least, since you told all of us... And tell him what you really feel about the situation. He will respect you for your honesty. Honesty is the best policy....I believe it will work for you.
