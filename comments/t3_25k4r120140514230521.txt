I know it's a really bad time, but if you feel sick, I imagine you regretting this later on in life. My aunt regretted it and even 15 years later, a husband, and two kids she wishes she could have changed her decision. 

My cousin is 17 and just had a baby. The father isn't involved, but she loves her little guy! 

I hope you're okay. :)
