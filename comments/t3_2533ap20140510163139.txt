Seems fair, I guess for me there wasn't any emotional attachment, so it wasn't a big deal. It did mean giving up my childhood dream to be Rapunzel though :). But I guess there is a very strong media component. Maybe it could be compared to breasts?  As in; they are way overemphasized in the media even when they aren't even related to what they are selling. Similarly, in many commercials and shows, the woman every man wants rarely has anything less than spectacular, usually long, hair. Perhaps also it is seen as a sign of femininity?
