Religion doesn't have a monopoly on playing off of emotions.

The guy is open to discussing it, just on his terms, I'm saying don't play the game his way, if they really care about change there is no easy non-manipulative route; come up with a better customized plan for side stepping the useless rhetoric the cult builds into the mind (of course logic isn't going to work but careful manipulation might).
