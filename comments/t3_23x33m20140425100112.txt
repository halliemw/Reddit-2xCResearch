I'm just going to speak to your insurance situation since I know something about it.

They can not arbitrarily drop you from health insurance. There must be a qualifying event to allow this. Thus could be something like proving they are no longer your guardian, but I believe they would have to go through some paperwork for that. The other would be turning 26. The other time they can drop you is during open enrollment. Typically most heath insurance open enrollment starts the plan year at January 1. My employer is different in our plan year behind July 1. 

If they do drop you, you would have coverage through the end of the month of whatever the qualifying event date is. Due to new health care law, if they do drop you, you will receive information to sign up for COBRA. (www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/cobra.htm) You should contact the health insurance company to see if you can update your address, however the employer may be the one responsible for sending out cobra paperwork in which case it will still go to your parents address.

Hope this helps.
