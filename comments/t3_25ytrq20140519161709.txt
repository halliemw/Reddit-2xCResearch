Someone disagreeing with you = troll. You can't be serious. Tragedy is a regular part of life. It is up to you to choose how to mentally deal with it. You can either come to terms with it and move on or forever play the victim. Feminism keeps teaching women to forever play the victim, that women are fragile little flowers. Stop trying to push this narrative. We are not fragile little flowers. We can overcome anything and control our state of mind. We all have suffered some tragedy, we all only have about 80 years to live on this planet, don't let a bad 15 minute experience ruin all of the remainder of those 80 years. Feminist need to quit trying to encourage us to be weak and emotional, instead we should be working to help people to own up a situation and grow thicker skins. Our ancestors had to overcome much worse and they managed, we've gone soft and are coddling each other like little infants and thus our state of mind reflects this infantile frail mentality.
