This website is by women for women. They make cute self defense items that are practical and deadly. I just got a lovely purple "stun gun" from them. I believe it's 7million Volts. If you feel you need a method of self defense please get one. You can never be too safe. All of their gear is affordable and comes in cute colors. 
Personally I'd rather have a stun gun and never have to use it than be in a situation without it where I'd need it. Your life comes first and if you feel it's ever threatened you have the right to defend yourself.
