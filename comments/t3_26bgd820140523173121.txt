Let this moment motivate you to be even stronger. Hang out with friends and try and meet someone new every week. By someone new, I don't mean a replacement boyfriend. Let your ex see that you're not only still standing, but you're thriving and believe me he'll regret breaking up with you. Whatever you end up doing over the next couple of days, weeks, months know that you always have a place here to vent and talk to people. A big internet hug is being sent your way from Cali.
