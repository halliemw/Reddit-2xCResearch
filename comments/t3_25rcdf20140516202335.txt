You two are such supercuties! I like your tattoo, but I LOVE this picture.

I'm considering getting a memorial tatto for my dad (fuckin' cancer, eh?) in the future, what is the experience of having one, both the process of being tattooed and having the image on you permanently?

Thank you for your time, and for sharing! She was adorable, and you both look so happy there.
