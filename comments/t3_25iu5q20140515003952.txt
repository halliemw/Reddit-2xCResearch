Well yeah.  She WAS the only one kicked out for her outfit.   Of course she felt that way.  Is this apologist missing something?  What really gets me is that she follows the prearranged rules, but gets kicked out anyway.  Now I won't lie.  I'm a straight, married, mid forties male myself.  I saw a picture of this girl and thought, "She's a stunner."  But would I think that its her fault I'm thinking that?  No. Anybody who wants to blame a 17 year old for wanting to be as beautiful as possible for her prom while following the dress code is a moron.  Actually, that isn't fair to morons.  They are emotionally unstable children, playing like they are adults while refusing to take responsibility for their own thoughts and actions.  Their behavior for the stage of life they are in is unforgivable.  If I lived in that community I would never let them be in charge of anything that required mature judgement again.
