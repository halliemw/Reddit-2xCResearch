Is it laziness or is it depression? Are you postponing things just because you can't be bothered, or do you have an anxiety disorder?

Sometimes it helps to treat your problem as an actual medical issue rather than simply a laziness issue, because maybe, just maybe, it actually is. There are many different ways to treat depression, up to and including medication. You might one day discover that medication is the only thing that helps you, and then wonder why you pissed away so many years of your life doing nothing because you didn't think to get treatment.

The answer to your question, as I see it, is "yes" ... because people who are depressed have gotten treatment and recovered.
