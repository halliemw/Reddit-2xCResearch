I've thought about going to talk to someone about it, but I'm not insured or anything right now and I have a feeling it would be quite expensive. 

I posted on the diabetes subreddit awhile ago and a lot of people there were blaming me, as I'm the one that does the grocery shopping and the cooking. I buy mostly healthy food, but she still will ask me to pick up chips and chocolate when I go to the drug store or she'll eat snacks I bought for myself. It's frustrating and it feels so silly to deny my mother what she is choosing to eat.
