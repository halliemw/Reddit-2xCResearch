When I was 16 and still learning to drive, My mom and I took her periwinkle blue minivan to the shop. She went inside, and I sat out in the car waiting for her. A very old man (75? or thereabouts) came up to me and started chatting to me in a thick Spanish accent (I grew up in a predominantly Hispanic part of the country). He asked if I was in school, regular stuff, and I smiled and spoke to him, thinking he was a cute little old man who was lonely and wanted to talk to someone who reminded him of his grand daughter or some such. Then he asks "are you compromised?" I'm like, "excuse me?" He asks again, and again I say "I don't know what you mean, sir" Then he says, "I would like to take you out to dinner, do you have a boyfriend?" I stammered something like "Uhhmghay I uh magerkol YES" and he goes "Oh too bad, maybe another time, let me know if you break up." and hands me his card. Just. What? PS. My mom later explained to me that Comprometida in Spanish can be used to mean boyfriend
