As an adopted child myself, I understand that sometimes women can't or shouldn't have children of their own. My mom raised me like I was her own. I love her to this day even though she passed away when I was 16. She was and will always be the only mom I have ever known. I feel the same way towards my dad. I call them my mom and my dad because they are the only people in the world I will call mom and dad. I think as an adopted child, I would encourage you to do it. I didn't have a chance when I was born (pre-mature and my birth mom was 14 when she gave birth to me) and I was introduced into a loving, caring home to two amazing people that I couldn't thank enough for giving me the opportunity to live a life that people take for granted these days. I'm not going to sugar coat it for you because as a child I always questioned my place in the family since my parents are caucasian and I am korean and I'm not going to lie and tell you I wasn't bullied by other children from grade school to high school because of my race and because of being adopted but I will tell you that I am still externally grateful to my parents and I'm sure the child you decide to adopt (if you decide to adopt) will love you all the same. I hope this is encouraging to you and I wish you and your husband the best of luck in the future, regardless of what you do.
