I am naturally a very reserved person. However, they are the ones that sometimes ask me questions and I don't want to be rude or seem hard to talk to, so I answer. I also always go around asking if anyone wants lunch when I'm the one getting it, but they usually say no. I'm guessing that you're right, though, seems i just don't fit in.
