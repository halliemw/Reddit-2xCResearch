Don't sell yourself short. I regret not taking AP and college classes in HS, because now I realize college would be easier if I had gotten a step ahead. Don't make my mistake of not believing in your ability to do things because they might be 'challenging' or fear that you might fail. Also, teach yourself how to study efficiently and find clubs/groups you enjoy being in. I suggest one school affiliated group and one non school affiliated. That way you not only get to know people from your school, but also people in the community who have similar interests as you. I hope my advice helps you make your way through high school.
