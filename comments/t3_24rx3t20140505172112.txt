I was not in geek culture but went to an engineering college long before Big Bang. Some nerd guys thought extensively about gender, but they were the exception. Rape, groping and dismissing women's opinion were par for the course, so much so that it was part of my opting out of engineering. Sexual assault rates nationally have declined significantly since then, so maybe there was some magical age as rape declined in the real world and new online anonymous rage hadn't taken its place.
