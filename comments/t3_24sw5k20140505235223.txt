I think it is more that I always thought he did. I certainly made excuses for him- that he doesn't like to celebrate birthdays, that anniversaries mean nothing to him so I can't expect too much, and so on. But for the most part I never thought he was capable of doing this to me because I thought he loved me, cared about me and valued me.  That's why this was such a shock.  I defended his actions and intentions to the end of the world. I was so completely wrong.
