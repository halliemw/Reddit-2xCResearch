> just alpha enough to enjoy myself but not be an egotistical ass

So in other words not alpha at all. 

Serious answer for the OP. Go over to /r/fitness and ask about fixing posture. You likely have rounded shoulders from sitting too much. You could probably also add a little muscle and lose a little fat which will probably make your breasts a little firmer (not sure why but it seems to happen).
