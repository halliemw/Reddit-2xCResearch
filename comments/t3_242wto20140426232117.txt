I just don't acknowledge them. Or if I do,I'm a mega bitch to the guys.
I used to work at a fancy restaurant downtown,and my car was parked blocks away,and I often didn't get off of work until 11:00pm.
Drunk guys would yell at me,hit on me and once,a guy even grabbed at my arm.
I always just continued my stride,and pretended they didn't exist.
Once a guy was like "baby girl,you're so fine,I could show you a good time tonight", and my mega-bitchy response was "are you fucking kidding me?Do you think a girl with a body and face like mine wants anything to do with a loser like you?" 
He didn't have much to say after that.
Street harassment isn't worth the energy that some women devote to it. It's annoying,rude,sexist and unacceptable,but I'm not going to get bent outta shape over some obnoxious comments from lame guys whose opinions do NOT matter at all.
