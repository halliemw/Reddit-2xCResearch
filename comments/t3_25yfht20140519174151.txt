Although Secret of Mana's first main character is a boy he is accompanied by two really tough girls with their own fully fledged story arcs and motivations (this is the first appearance of the princess: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7xbGWGnaiY). When I played the game I always preferred them, because the girls could nearly fight as well as the boy and additionally do magic. I really recommend this game especially for coop, I loved to play it as a child and replayed it at several times in my life. My wife and I have very fond memories of our play-through at the beginning of our relationship (it supports local coop). To play it you can use an emulator (for PC I recommend ZSNES), an old SNES or a Wii with Virtual Console.

PS: Oh I just saw the sprite is a male character in the English version and maybe also in the original version of the game, in the German version it is definitely a girl... Since there is a lot of confusion regarding the gender of the sprite (see https://www.google.de/search?q=sprite+secret+of+mana+female) you might consider her/him/them/it as a transgender character.
