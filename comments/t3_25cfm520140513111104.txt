Yeah, my school claimed to be feminist, but it was bordering in misandrist honestly. 

They would also bastardize the fact that girls mature faster than guys every way they could. They would repeated tell us that girls were smarter than guys. It didn't help that they pit us against each other academically every time the girls scored higher than the guys to reinforce that "girls were smarter than guys". One of the teachers got caught doing this, she would only hold the competitions after the fact and would not if the guys ever won. One very brave parent brought this up at a PTA meeting, which again was almost all mothers anyways, and the teachers defended themselves by quoting the 70 cents on the dollar statistic and would say they are just trying to boost the girls confidence, totally ignoring the fact that they were destroying the boys'. The parent ended up getting a lot of threats and hate male over it too (it was my friend's mom). They constantly preached how the oppressive male patriarchy was responsible for things like the plight of the Native Americans and how that never would have happened if women were in charge. 

They gave feminism a bad name, but I honestly believed all of their bullshit until my current SO started pointing out how absurd a lot of this was. I still consider myself a feminist, or at least an egalitarian, but I occasionally get very resentful over the array of insecurities I have developed as a result of that school. 

But I don't blame them entirely, the fathers in my town in general were a bit to absent from all of the kids' lives. They rarely went to the PTA meetings where a lot of the mothers were resentful divorcees. It was just a clusterfuck of spurned women and absentee fathers.
