Yup.  I always like to chime in on this type of thing because some folks fixate on rules they hear from friends and the Internet, and get all freaked out about something in their life that fits one of the rules because obviously that must mean doom.  But there are lots of shades of gray.  

I wouldn't have married me in my 20s when I wasn't as good at being a completely separate individual from my folks either.  I'm in my 30s, they're still effed up, but I'm a much better marriage prospect now.  :)
