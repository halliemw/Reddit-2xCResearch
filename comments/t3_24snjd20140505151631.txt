It seemed like he was likely on drugs of some sort.  Then you brought up bipolar disorder, so that might explain it.  I get that he's 'trying to fix his life' and you're afraid to ruin his momentum, but what's happening isn't okay for you.  He's failing to care about your end of things.  So you have a right to be upset about it.  From the outside it seems you should just tell him that something has to change or a divorce or separation will happen.  But I know it's often more complicated from inside a situation.
