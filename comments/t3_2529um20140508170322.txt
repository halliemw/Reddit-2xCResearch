>Unfortunately you came across someone who felt that their idea of beauty was more important to them in a partner than the person in the body.

I disagree. He tried to put himself over the fact that she didn't look like he expected her to look. He tried to focus on the person in the body, rather than how she confirmed to the image he expected of her. After admitting that he was not attracted to her, he tried to stay friends with her. He tried the best that he could.
