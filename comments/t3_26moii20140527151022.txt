The sex drive may come back in time. In the mean time communicate about your concerns with your partner. Try play sex games or change things up more foreplay and physical affection generally during the day. And if you need to stop during let him know you need to stop.  And explain before that you may have to and if you need to stop reassure him after that its just that you can't force it and try again later / tomorrow. Move with what your comfortable with and don't be pressured into things you don't want to. 
This relationship is not as important as your mental health and if he can't deal with the change then its best it ends.
