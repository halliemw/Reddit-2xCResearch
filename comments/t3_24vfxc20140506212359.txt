Honestly, no, but I don't really care at all about natural body hair on guys. I don't think having hair or lacking hair makes a guy's body significantly more or less attractive.

Hell, my boyfriend is nearly hairless on his upper body, yet has a bunch of thick hairs growing out his buttcheeks. It's odd, I guess, but it doesn't phase me at all.
