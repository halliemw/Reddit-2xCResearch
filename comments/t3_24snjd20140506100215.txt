This is my perspective, too. I wish marriage counseling alone would work, but it honestly could just aggregate/provoke him if he needs meds and is unmediated. Certainly it will be a much more difficult process if he needs medication. Cognitive therapy is an invaluable asset, but if someone needs to be on drugs, talking wont fix anything.
