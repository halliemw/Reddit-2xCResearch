I never experienced that big of a jump, so I'd run that by your doctor just to be sure there's nothing going on with your health. I always used super plus for the heavy days but now that I am older I find that I have an 8-12 hour span during my period when it kind of goes into hyperdrive. That's when I started having to buy ultras and get up to change them once at night, etc. And every few periods is extra heavy. Annoying crap like that. I'm pretty sure it has to do with ovulating less frequently and when I finally do my uterus has more lining to shed. Being a woman is so awesome.  /sarcasm
