If you check my post history, you'll notice that generally I try to look at the other person's perspective, which often times gets me downvoted for not going along with the status quo in this sub.

THAT SAID: Report him to the Dean of Students, or some similar authority.  This is not acceptable behavior, especially at a university level.  The jokes are fine; they're jokes. Taking a picture of a hot chick you pass on the street, fine.  But getting someone to get another person to bend over so that you can take a photo? Not fine.

She wouldn't have normally been in that stance, and therefore wouldn't have been subjected to that camera angle, and was tricked into it.  To me, that's the defining difference that makes this wrong.
