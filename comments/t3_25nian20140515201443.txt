I hate to be a jerk, but I'm not quite sure what you're saying. 

I can't speak for anyone else, but I don't think the point of instilling good values is to appreciate different circumstances and perspectives. 

Personally, I try to instill the values in my children that I think contribute to success. I'd have to say that alcoholism and general sluttiness don't fit my definition of success.  

I think that they generally believe that it's not so much what you tell children; it's more about giving them suitable examples of people to emulate.  I wouldn't want my acceptance of people whom I wouldn't want my children to become to be viewed as tacit approval.
