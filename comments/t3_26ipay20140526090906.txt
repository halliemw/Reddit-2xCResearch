I only used tampons of a brief period (lol pun intended) and I found that I am a dumbass who can't use them, plus they hurt. (Dear always infinite, never change).

But I get maaad period shits because I have other digestive problems too. So I did pretty much what you're describing - use a couple squares to wraps around the string and bring it forward and hold on to it while wiping the butt area, definitely a two hand operation.

That being said I also remember that pulling out a tampon directly before letting out mad shits is like the most disgustingly pleasurable sensation on earth. Ahhh sweet release now I am fully empty.
