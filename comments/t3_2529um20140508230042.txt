Even though when you look at magazine covers all of the Women look the same, but in truth every man has different tastes.  Tall, short, Skinny, chubby, big tits, small tits, make up, no make up, on and on and on.

There are plenty of guys out there that will find you attractive.  I know that you will not make the same mistakes again.  When I use online dating, I usually make one "quick getaway" date.  Just for coffee of something.  If there is no emotional and physical connection we can both go our separate ways without investing to much of our time.

Good luck to you  :)
