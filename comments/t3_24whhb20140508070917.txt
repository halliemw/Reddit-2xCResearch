I don't get what you're trying to argue, here. Emotions are important, and you should generally consider the emotional response you and those you love will have when you make a big decision. This decision doesn't have anything to do with how body, though. That's not arguable. It will, however, make some pretty big changes to hers. And then she will have a kid. One that she doesn't want.
