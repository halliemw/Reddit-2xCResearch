>I'm the one with his genitals hanging out of his body to be easily injured, why the fuck would I want that bar there?

LOL. I've always thought the same thing about boys riding "boy's" bikes.

Anyway, the top tube, as it's called, adds structural integrity to the bicycle. But that's really only a concern if you're riding a lightweight road racing bike or a cyclocross or trail bike where there is extreme stress put on the frame.

As people say here, there are pros to the step-through frame. But I think what OP is most upset about is feeling that her father could only fathom that she would want a bike based on his understanding of what bikes are and how people use them, rather than what his daughter wanted and how she would use it, and when confronted with a cognitive dissonance (i.e., "Girl bikes are for girls; my daughter is a girl, but she wants a 'boy' bike"), he chose to cling to his sexist misconception about bikes rather than support his daughter and realize that there are no "girl" bikes or "boy" bikes.
