This. A lot of problems with us men are caused by what the media, and our own families feed to us. Shit, my mother taught me that if I wasn't persistent enough with a woman, that I would never get a girlfriend. What kind of shit is that?

As stupid as it may sound, I learned a lot about relationships through games. Not just love, but friendship, friendly rivalry, and respect. I am very happy to have an amazing woman at my side right now, and I did not become her boyfriend by constantly pushing towards it. But again, society doesn't teach that. Both men and women are very misinformed about this stuff, because the misinformation starts from a very young age. 

And it also doesn't help when women enforce that sort of thought, either. My mother and a previous girlfriend were of the "keep pushing it, or you don't deserve it" mentality. It makes things very confusing for us.
