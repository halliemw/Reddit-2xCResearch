Maybe I am biased because I am a high school teacher, but I agree that a dress code is important for school.  Girls and boys need to learn that some outfits are simply not appropriate for certain settings, like the workplace or school.  For example, every other Friday we have staff dress-down at my school (for charity).  We wear jeans, T-shirts, running shoes, etc.  We do not wear tops that have spaghetti straps (showing our bra straps), or cut-off tops that show our bellies, or short-shorts.  Those would be inappropriate for the workplace (which in this case happens to be a school).
