I absolutely agree and disagree with you. 

You are right that having absolutely normal feelings of anxiety, frustration, fear, and grief should be dealt with in an organic way in the long term. 

I am not a doctor, but I've visited with many in my many years here. Only two of them were shrinks. I have been in the place as OP with helpless grief. It went on for days. It's really hard to describe, but I felt like my brain was stuck in a loop that I couldn't escape from. Like a hamster wheel. I was prescribed clonazepam. It stopped the hamster wheel. I could actually think.

I didn't take it for long, but I think it really allowed my brain to think without all of that completely overwhelming emotion. I still felt grief. Love. Humor.
