Usually (at least with my experience) you have to wait to start taking the pill until you start your period anyway, so that doesn't really help her situation.  And in the beginning your body would still be getting used to the hormones and might still spot heavily during the time when you would supposed to be having it.  I know all BC is different, but that's what happened with mine.  It would still be a good idea for the future if long trips like that were frequent enough.
