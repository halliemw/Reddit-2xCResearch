I'm sorry about the weird downvotes, we are still getting brigaded and trolled/harassed since we went default, so all normal posts in the new section are getting the worst of it!

I totally feel you about the introvert thing! And shit your schedule is insane, I can't imagine how much you really need to recharge after all of that. I think you're really brave for still putting yourself out there and being involved even though you'd rather be doing your own thing!

Crazy drunk people are the worst, sorry that you had to deal with that. Can people just not call the cops on someone like that? He's definitely harassing people, is drunk in a public space, etc.
