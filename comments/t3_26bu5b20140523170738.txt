If this sub is no longer the place for support like that then maybe its time we made a new sub specifically for that purpose. /r/2xsupportgroup or something. 

I wasnt happy with the sub going default at first but whats done is done and going back would just make the misogynistic asshats on this website think they won by pushing us back into the shadows. Reddit needs to have a women's based sub on the default and this was the one they chose. 

This place can flourish as a more public subreddit and allow other niche subreddits that werent active (or even created) before to grow as well. 

All default subreddits, not just this one, get their fair share of trolls on a daily basis. thats just how it's gonna be. it's gonna suck for a while but hopefully the mods will step up their game a bit more so this place is usable again.
