> I think he should know the reason I changed my mind!

I think he would be so surprised that someone is suddenly calling out on his bullshit. I bet his mother thinks he is just the cutest little boy.

He should really know that his words do not exist in a vacuum and that he cannot compartmentalize his sexist views away from his social circle 'onto the internet' where he can finally 'speak his mind' without all the women/colleagues/fellow students realizing he is not actually a decent human. 

I bet it will be fun to tell him.
