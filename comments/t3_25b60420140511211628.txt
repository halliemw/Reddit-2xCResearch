This comment strikes me as odd - it's not as though breastfeeding is like turning on a fountain and gets everywhere. 

I agree that people have the 'right' to think what they want, but that's not going to stop me from calling it out and pointing out that most of society's hangups with it come from viewing breasts as solely sexual parts of women's bodies.
