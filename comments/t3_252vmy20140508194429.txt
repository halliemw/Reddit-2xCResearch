I've dated a couple of driven people.  Their drive and enthusiasm drew me in, in part because I didn't have a similar drive for something in my own life.  Part of me felt empty in comparison.  I haven't dated in four years and I feel a bit lonely sometimes these days, but I'm also driven to finish a project that I started this year and I've never taken better care of myself.  I don't know that I can add any helpful insight but I'm betting that you're going to be ok.
