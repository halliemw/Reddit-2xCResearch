You're confusing self-worth with social standing.   
   
I attend Harvard, my sister attended Dartmouth; my little brother, however, attends a Community college and throughout his time in high school had drug problems. I ask you: is he worthless? Or is he...worth less? Or perhaps he's fought off more demons than I could conceptualize that, in turn, had made him much stronger than I could ever be? He can literally fix anything that's broken in a house, yet I have trouble using a plunger. He can instinctively navigate and remember any address, location, intersection, etc from home...and find places with pure instinct. Me on the other hand? If my GPS fails I have to load up Google maps on my phone, type a nearby location, and navigate there with so much difficulty it's as if I'm solving some unsolved problem in  quantum physics.   
   
The point is, your ***worth*** is not dependent upon other people. This Elliot Rodgers was not some downtrodden geek with no options in life. He grew up in a wealthy family, drove a BMW, and wasn't bad looking. His problem was his sense of entitlement grew so large that he literally believed he was *owed* a relationship.   
   
People like Elliot, without the entitlement of course, need to stop looking at the world to determine their self-worth. Losing your virginity is not an accomplishment. Having a relationship doesn't mean you're "winning". Having no friends is an issue that can be solved with hard work, not some woe-is-me attitude. That being said, your Mark Twain quote was speaking more about moral courage than emotional courage, so I'm not sure it applies here.
