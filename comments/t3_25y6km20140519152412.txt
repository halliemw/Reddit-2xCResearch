Just remember that this is what it looks like when we allow the natural function of our bodies to be outlawed. Zygotes and embryos have a 2/3rds fail rate, naturally. Banning all abortion is fucking ridiculous, our bodies do that shit all the time, mostly without it even being noticed, and mostly right after conception. Shit, some zygotes just skid right off the uterine lining. So what, is my uterus just a mass murderer?

Oh and FYI: we are ONE SCOTUS appointee from this happening in the US.
