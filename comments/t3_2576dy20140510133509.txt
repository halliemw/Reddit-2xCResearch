I haven't watched your documentary yet but there is absolutely no way that FGM is more common than MGM in the UK.  The vast majority of muslim and jewish boys are cut . FGM is very culture dependant you will find it in a few african tribes and muslim countries (Somalia/Ethiopia most importantly) but it is ILLEGAL already in the UK (meaning people can go to jail for it) when MGM is not and can be carried out by the first idiot you meet in the street ( which is illegal practice of medicine too, but I digress)

Like I've said above I don't think that these issues need to be treated separately, they should be approached under the umbrella of bodily integrity and respect/care for vulnerable people instead of chopping off the bits your culture/god doesn't like. **I do not see what would be wrong with that**- could you tell me?

 I don't think you should downplay ( like you just did,unfortunately) the ordeal anyone is going through when a knife is taken to their genitalia regardless of their gender. There are several forms of genital mutilation for each sex, even the ones that don't remove any living tissue are illegal for girls. And rightfully so, it's sexual abuse, what experience do you have of the trauma on the other side? Do you know that a lot of AFrican women do not feel bad about what has been done to them? We only have this objective approach to FGM because it's so foreign and "exotic", but women are the ones insisting on cutting their little girls and also the ones carrying out the operation most of the time. So from an insider point of view they don't see the problem with it  because they have PTSD and they want to repeat the damage that has been done to them to others, even to their own children.
