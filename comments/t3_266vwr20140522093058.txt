The thing to remember is that your future is decided by you, not your parents. You get to choose your career and education, who you want to date or marry, when or if you'll have kids. They don't get to choose that stuff. You'll find a partner that fits your bill. Hopefully, of course, it's someone they can appreciate and get along with as well. But you're under no obligation to worry about that.

Should the issue come up again simply say "I appreciate the concern but my relationship is really not something I feel is a good discussion for family time." Then, change the subject. If they bring it up, you may have to remind them again, or possibly just leave.
