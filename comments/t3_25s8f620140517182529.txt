Don't worry, I'm with you on fighting patriarchy. 
But I've been trying to combat it for 10 years now, by redirecting my attention, watching a lot more women in non image obsessed roles (documentaries, talk shows basically) and it hasn't helped much. For example, when a woman appeared on the daily show to talk about Ukraine. I was interested in what she had to say, but couldn't stop thinking about how appropriate her clothes were, her wrinkles and lipstick choice. Now I don't even remember what she's said. And I won't turn into my mother, I promise :)
