Same here! One of the problems I didn't expect to crop up was the one that [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26g2yd/the_power_of_the_slow_blink/chr051h) is addressing. Other than that, the sub has handled the other problems well. It seems the at topic under discussion in that link is being handled well too. I like this sub and it handled the transition well. Lets hope we as a community can keep it together in the future too, as those who have subscribed to this just as part of signing up to reddit come pouring in.
