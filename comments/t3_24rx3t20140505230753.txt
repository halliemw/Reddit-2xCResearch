> For words that reference political aims that's what a dictionary entry aims at, yes.

I've got to ask. Are you American? Because, there is a slight difference between the english and american_english definitions at oxford dictionaries.

>One of the two main US political parties (the other being the Democratic Party), favoring a conservative stance, limited central government, and a strong national defense.

So, since this says Republicans favor a limited central government, Republicans should be against the federal government limiting abortion rights, should be against federal laws against marijuana, and should be in favor of using our military to defend our country rather than invading other countries.

I had better not hear you ever say that the Republicans believe anything different than that.

And according to the oxford dictionary, the [mens rights movement doesn't even exist](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/spellcheck/american_english/?q=men%27s+rights+movement) so I had better not hear any complaining about that either.

>What's your position here? That in recent times the conventional meaning of "feminism" has changed from the conventional meaning of feminism that it has had throughout the bulk of its history? If so what meaning has "feminism" changed from, if not something like the one from the oxford dictionary?

Feminism used to be about ending the differences in rights (achieving equality) between the sexes. This is laudable and is a subset of egalitarianism. Feminism has become about achieving greater rights and privileges both from a legal stand point and from a cultural standpoint.

>Or in pointing to loud voices are you claiming that the loud voices represent a meaning of feminism that is different from the current contemporary conventional meaning? If so, what's the current contemporary conventional meaning that is different from that represented by the loud voices?

Loud voices carry the meaning of any movement or group unless met with denouncement. This is in the same way Rush Limbaugh and Todd Akin affect the perception of Conservatism and the Republican party (and also the reason I left the Republican party).

Here are some loud voices. As a man, how can I associate with a group who has mainstream personalities and leaders who say these things?

 that 'man-hating' is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.
