I've just now come to terms with the fact that I have one, but it begs the question- how the hell would I get treatment for something thats completely mental? I have roughly 50 dollars a month for food so all I can buy is boxed mac and cheese and the like. I'd love to get on the keto diet but I literally cannot afford anything other than boxed starches/carbs. Its not that I'm eating unhealthily by choice, and because my food is so.. limited, I have another fear of running out of food. its awful. :(
