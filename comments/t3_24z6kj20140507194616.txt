I recently responded to a "reverse racism" comment a friend made on facebook (I have since become de-friended). This article was very helpful to understand what happened.

Her reason for defending herself was that she worked hard, her ancestors didn't own slaves, and expected everyone to be treated equally -- so "reverse racism" was just as bad as racism. She did not want to consider that institutional racism colors every aspect of people's lives, while "reverse racism" is outrage against racism, and mostly just hurts people's feelings.

This article was a really good explanation of what institutional racism is, and what it means to be part of that secret club. I think it should be required reading.
