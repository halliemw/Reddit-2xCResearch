Sorry to hear that OP.  Sounds like he's been a real twat about it and not felt the need to communicate with you in an adult way about his feelings.  Long distance is a fucking nightmare for the most committed of couples.  Also it sounded like he was giving horribly mixed signals when he was here.  It'll get easier.  It will.  And your move to the Netherlands will probably be the most amazing experience regardless of whether you two are together or not.  

How long are you going to be there?  Maybe you need to get signed up to some meet-ups or something.  If you do decide to ring him, make sure you have a plan for what happens if the conversation doesn't go the way you want it to.
