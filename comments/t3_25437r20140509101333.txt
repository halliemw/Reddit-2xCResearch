Congradulations. I'm actually going through the same process now. I went to school for 3 years and dropped out when I realised I didn't want what I was working towards. I've changed degrees now and I just finished my first year back. It's been really difficult learning to push through all the crap and just keep moving forward, but I'm learning from the experience. It's encouraging to see others who have gone through the same thing and come out the other side successful.
