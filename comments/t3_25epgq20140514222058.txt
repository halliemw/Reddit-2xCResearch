When he said that, he was definitely getting weird. That's when he started overdoing the compliments and pressuring me to kiss him. Also, that's not the kind of joke you make when you first meet someone if you don't want to come off as crazy. Like someone said, it sounds like he's done this in the past and uses his image to get away with it. In his mindset, he believes women owe him something for being so charming and hot (again, in HIS mind). I wouldn't be surprised if other women have kissed him under pressure and because they thought he was attractive only to feel gross and used afterwards. I wouldn't be surprised if he preys on women with low-self esteem or have just been through a bad situation like a recent break up by playing the 'nice guy' card. He's that type of douche.
