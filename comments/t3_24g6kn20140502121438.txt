When you start equating the potential for life to actual life that's when all logic goes down the drain.  If that were true, no one could ever give or receive heated eye contact or have sexual tension without acting on it, because they are thwarting the potentiality if creating a life if they acted on those urges.  Men could not masturbate and ejaculate outside of a woman because they are causing that potential life to be wasted.  It makes no fucking sense.  And I feel like you've lost sight of your argument or point because I don't really know what the point of this whole exchange is.
