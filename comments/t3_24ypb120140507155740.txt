Here a few other things to keep in mind:

License - The rules on this vary depending on what country (and even state) you live in. Where I live (TN - US), the license is $99 (but less if you do pre-marital counseling). You have to have the license for 3 days before you can use it, and it expires after 30 days - so you have a 27 day window in which to get married.

Officiant - You have to have someone marry you. Again, the rules on this vary depending on where you live, but some places allow officiants to get ordained online. This way you could have a friend or family member do it for free. If that's not possible, you will have to pay an officiant to marry you (where I live, it's normally a $200 "gratuity").

Food - If you're going to be hosting people during any mealtime, you have to feed them a meal. You need to feed them something no matter what time it is. But if you do an afternoon affair, for instance, you could do just cake and punch.

Rings - yeah, those are kind of a big deal to most people. They don't have to match. Mine and my husband's do match, but my best friends' don't. That's up to each couple. I had a white gold band custom made to fit my engagement ring for under $100 (it is super thing, and my ring size is a 4). My husband's 6mm white gold band, however, cost about $500.

dress - You can get a beautiful dress at any department store. They even sell "real" wedding dresses at more affordable prices. David's Bridal usually has a $99 gown sale a couple times a year as well.


As for how to make it special cheaply? Make the decorations yourself and make it personal. Only have around you people you both truly, deeply love.


But you may want to wait more than 2 months. There are just soooooooooooo many choices out there for what/how you want your wedding to be. There's no reason not to wait and make sure you're having the wedding you both truly want.

Good luck!
