I think I got my period when I was 12 or 13. I went on BC when I was 14 or 15. I was on Seasonique, which is the 3-month pill (you only get your period every 12 weeks) I'm 24 now, so I was on it for ten years (whoa) and I had a Skyla IUD (lower dosage hormones than Mirena) put in on April 3rd, which was during my period. I did not get a new pack of pills after that, so I've been off the pill for almost 2 months now. I haven't gotten my period back yet, and my IUD is pretty great.

I did Skyla because I wanted something that wasn't hormonal due to blod clot fears and kind of just wanting to know what it was like to not be on hormones, since I've been on them basically my entire pubescent life. The only things I don't like about the Skyla is I got this weird brown discharge for like 2 weeks after getting it placed, it hurt quite a lot to get it put in, and I'm afraid to use my Diva cup. Also I miss knowing when my period is gonna come, it was so nice never having ruined panties. Mine is now three full weeks late. Supposedly some women get super light periods or none at all on Mirena or Skyla, I'm hoping I'll be one of them.

Edit: also, have way more interest in sex, yay! Did not experience any weight loss or boob shrinkage yet though.
