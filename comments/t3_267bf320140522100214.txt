I get the feeling that many feminists only ideas about men come from Reddit and the media.

edit: The satire in the above statement is clearly not being picked up, or, at least, the point is lost. If you came to a thread about not assuming that a group you belong to should be represented by the radical sub-group, it seems counter-productive to try to do the same to another group (particularly in the case of "redditors", which you all belong to.)
