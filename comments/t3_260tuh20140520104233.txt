I'm 37 and have never really had a "crush" on anyone. I'm married and have a loving relationship with my husband. I've been attracted to the odd celebrity and fictional character but attractions in life have been very few and far between. Mostly I've just enjoyed regular human connection and physical intimacy followed from that. 

The thing is, I think sexuality isn't something you necessarily have to put a pin on, although it can be rewarding and important for some people to learn about the wide varieties of sexuality to gain some self insight.

I won't suggest that you're anything in particular or that you should take any particular action. But if you're curious, why not look into all the possible definitions of things, just to get some context? 

Thank you for sharing. It helps me personally to know that there are more people like me than it seemed when I was growing up and everyone seemed to have a "normal" phase of being boy- or girl-crazy but me.
