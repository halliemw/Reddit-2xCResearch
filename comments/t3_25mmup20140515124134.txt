Title IX has some really strange requirements, where basically colleges are forced to investigate sexual assault like a violation of school rules.

This leads to all sorts of awful things. Rapists are protected if they are important to the school (football players, anyone), while others who are innocent or at least couldn't possibly be proven guilty in a court of law are expelled and possibly even deported (if they are on a student visa).

Title IX should be changed to put justice back in the hands of the judicial system.
