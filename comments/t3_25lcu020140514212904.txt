That's not really a new thing, male/female bikes have been around for like... ever. Never made much sense to me for the lower bar design to be for women, since wouldn't you want the bar as far away as possible from your crotch if you have exposed and vulnerable genitals, and not neatly tucked-in ones? In a crash, had I testicles, I'd rather do all I could to minimize chances of trauma to them. But whatever. 

It is still super ridiculous that he cares either way about which style of bike you have, since as far as I've heard, they're functionally identical. On the other hand, I don't think riding a women's bike is particularly some sign of weakness, since... they're functionally identical. I have a women's style bike, it's not a huge deal either way. Though I think if someone were trying to *force* me to ride that type of bike vs. the men's ones, I'd pick the men's one out of spite.
