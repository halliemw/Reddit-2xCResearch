I wish this was the attitude back when I had my boys. I tried with both of my children, but with my first I had zero let down, and he was starving. Six weeks of chapped, raw nipples because he was CONSTANTLY on the breast trying to get something out, I gave him a bottle of formula and just sobbed. It really exacerbated my post-partum depression.
With my second son, I actually felt something like let down (tingly feeling) but it still wasn't enough. Eight weeks with him before I switched. It was less devastating because I had already made the decision with my oldest. 
Breast is best, but a healthy happy mommy is ultimate.
