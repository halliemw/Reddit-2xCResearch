* Burritos with my OH for lunch because he's on a course for work near where I work :)
* A good hard 5k effort on the treadmill in the gym today after the weather turned and we didn't want to risk taking our road bikes out
* Schnuggling on the couch with a nice cup of tea while watching football later :)
