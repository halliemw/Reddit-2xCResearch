Ugh, that restaurant sounds awful.  I'd settle for a normal steakhouse that didn't undermine me when I'm taking clients out for dinner.

Why yes, I would actually like the sommelier to let me order wine for my guests without a super-weird "pass the wine list to everyone else at the table except me", followed by explaining they have an appletini for "the spouses who came along" so I don't have to choke down a decent red wine.

"Treating me like a normal person who is at a steakhouse" would be quite "woman-friendly" enough.
