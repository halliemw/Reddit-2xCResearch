Thanks.  I talked to her about it and she flipped out, she thinks I'm totally in the wrong.. and while I apologized for hurting her feelings, I ultimately have been friends with this guy much longer than I've been friends with her. And I think it's kind of mean of her to begrudge me of being happy with someone!
