Well I like it! You look lovely in it - it really shows off your body (in a tasteful, classy way). It's not overly puffy or princess-y while still being feminine and elegant.

But it doesn't matter what I think, or whether I like it. As much as I'd like to say it doesn't matter what your friend thinks, I've been in a similar situation (though about a totally different topic) and trust me... as much as I wanted to brush off my friend's opinion, it still hurts. It still has weight. But try to minimize it as much as possible.

If there was one universal standard for dresses, it'd be a whole lot more boring. There are plenty of dresses out there I think are awful, but others love them. Same with any area of fashion. Our differences as a species are what keeps things interesting!
