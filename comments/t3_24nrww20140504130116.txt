The base problem here is not her appearance, it's about her emotional state. She doesn't have a good sense of self right now, she's clearly unhappy and she's trying to hide herself. The best thing you can do is listen to her. No matter what she's talking about. Listen to the drama from school, listen to her talk about her favorite band. You don't have to offer advice, and definitely don't offer judgement. You can't give her a sense of self, new clothes won't do that. That all takes time, hopefully less time if she has a competent therapist. Be supportive and encouraging of hobbies she has, even just doodling. Clothes are a surface problem, she will work on that when she's feeling better about herself.
