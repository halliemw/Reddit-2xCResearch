Sometimes friends suddenly have other priorities. They can either be legitimate or excuses. I currently have two women I'm trying to become friends with, and tonight is the second time they have both cancelled on me.
But I've also been asked to see them at work tomorrow, and one of them does text me sometimes. So I would say that you should try talking to them about it the next time you see them in person. For all you know, life really is happening in a way that makes a social life impossible.
