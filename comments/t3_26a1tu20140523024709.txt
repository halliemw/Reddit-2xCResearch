Is there anyone you can phone while you're walking home, or text them your location every so often? There are also some apps out there that will message an emergency contact for you if you don't get home for a certain time and things like that. Get a loud 'rape alarm' keyring too. I'm also in the UK so any other form of weapon didn't even occur to me to be honest.
