Yup, I started getting these about 5 years ago. Stopping hormonal birth control helped immensely, but I was still having 2 or 3 migraines every period. After finding some studies on [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=magnesium+menstrual), I decided to try taking a magnesium supplement. That's largely stopped the remaining headaches (along with my other PMS symptoms).
