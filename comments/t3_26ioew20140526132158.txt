1. Abuse rarely starts with overt, obvious signs. If someone you care about starts routinely suggesting ways you could "enhance" your looks or "look prettier" take a long hard look at their motives. Maybe they're being helpful, or maybe they're starting the process of wearing down your self-esteem.

2. Start moisturizing your face AND neck now. Get a gentle, oil free moisturizer and moisturize daily. You will appreciate it when you're thirty.

3. If you aren't doing it already, start eating healthy and exercise regularly. Nothing serious or crazy, just get some veggies in and take a walk around the block.

4. If you aren't sure if you want to go to college, or aren't sure what you want to do, no sweat. Taking a year off to work is not going to hurt you, no matter what they scare you with in high school (Ivy League universities at be different). And if you want to start but don't know what you want, go to a local community college. Get your general education credits while taking a few exploratory courses. You'll be exposed to lots of things and hopefully find your passion without spending a ton of money.

5. Go easy on the daily makeup. It should enhance. It can be hard on your skin, so try not to overdo it.

6. Don't be scared of turning 25, 30, 35, etc. This will obviously be different for everyone, but life has gotten a lot more fun as I've grown older. I love being in my thirties, and so should you!
