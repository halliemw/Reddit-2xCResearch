I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and one of my triggers is big change. I just have to accept that it'll take about a month for me to feel normal again and I try to cope the best I can for that time. If you have an anxiety attack, don't try to fight it, just let it happen and tell yourself it will happen until you adjust. In the meantime, try to do things that are familiar and will take your mind off things, like going to a movie at a theatre you've been to.
