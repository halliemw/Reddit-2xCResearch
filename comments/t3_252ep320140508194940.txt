I remember my sex education teacher telling us pre-pubescent girls that periods don't hurt. So when I got my first one aged 12, and it hurt like hell, I freaked out because I thought that there was something wrong. I was also freaked out by how much blood there was. I went crying to my dad, who was the only one home at the time, and he calmed me down and explained that it was normal... oh, and this was all on Christmas Eve too!
