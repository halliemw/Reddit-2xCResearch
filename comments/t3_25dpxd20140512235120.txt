The pain is kind of shocking, isn't it? I was astonished. But you can do it! The painkillers will help, I'm sure. There is also a cervix softening injection they sometimes do, although in my research on the subject it didn't seem like it actually helped much.

My experience was the similar to another posters: 5 minutes of real pain, 10 minutes of heavy cramping and nausea (I actually vomited, apparently that's a rare but normal reaction), a couple hours of cramps and just feeling really tired, and then two days later I was totally fine. 


Tl;dr: it sucks but it's short and worth
 it.
