I used to have butt length hair. Waiting at a bus stop and one of the seasonal fishermen took a handful of it and ran his fingers down it saying softly, "My mother had beautiful hair like this." 

Also on the bus some dude asked if he could kiss me, and when I said I didn't kiss men I wasn't dating, asked if he could date me. I declined as politely as possible.
