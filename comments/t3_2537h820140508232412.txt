Rwanda is an interesting case for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is... The political reality following the 1994 genocide. As we're all aware here, sexual violence is a weapon of war, particular in cases of ethnic violence-- rape is a weapon which harms women and also runs the risk of impregnating them, furthering the shame associated with both sexual violence and "spoiling ethnic purity." This happened a lot in Bosnia, where female survivors greatly outnumbered male ones, but nearly all had been repeatedly raped so that the resulting children would be a different race than they are.

It's a horrible, and often overlooked, consequence of war and ethnic violence in particular.

While it is horrific, victims of this directed sexual violence tend to survive more often than victims of other weapons of war. Men and children are shot and cut up with machetes; women of child-bearing age are raped. What this means in the Rwandan case is that the gender demographics in Rwanda, paired with the number of eligible men who are not obviously tied to the genocide, have led to a heavily female parliament.

Do those women deserve their jobs? Of course. Have they worked hard from their vantage point? Most assuredly. But it's important to remember that this 65% anomaly is *not* a consequence of more dedicated women's lobbying than in other countries (although it is undoubtedly a very dedicated group of women!), but rather a terrible human rights tragedy.
