I think it's a valid point as well, and I dislike generalizations about any gender. On the whole, I definitely think this is something we can do better.

I can't speak for the people who gave you flak, but IMO using the "not all men" argument shifts the discussion away from the general subject (sexism, rape, discrimination) and onto the speaker as an individual. Regardless of its intention, it can come across as "well, I don't do this so your complaint isn't valid." 

It can also be an argument that people jump to a bit too quickly. For example, someone may be quick to say that he as an individual does not benefit from male-privilege (and this may be his genuine view), but if he were willing to engage in the discussion he may discover that he does benefit in ways he didn't realize. Or his belief may be reaffirmed -- but at least a sincere discussion happened.

The linked article sums it up well: "The Not-All-Man hero and his minions are paralyzingly obsessed with protecting their own self-concept, to a degree that prevents them from engaging in sincere discussion."

Hope that helps.
