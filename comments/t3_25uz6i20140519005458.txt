Polyurethane is somewhat less stretchy than latex, so some find it less comfortable. There's also speculation that they may be slightly more prone to tearing than latex for that reason as well, but I'm not sure if that's been proven in a study. They're also more expensive than latex condoms, so unless a person has a latex allergy or has a specific need to use oil-based lube, they might not be worth the extra price. So there are definitely some reasons why they're not as commonly used.
