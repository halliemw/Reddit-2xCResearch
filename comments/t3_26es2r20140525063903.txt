Hi there, we have a subreddit over at /r/reduction that you can look through.  
I had mine done 3 months ago and I've never looked back or questioned my decision. I had my stitches bust open at the bottom of my right breast and one point but some local anaesthetic and 3 stitches later, I was all fixed. I am a completely different person now, so much more confident and happy. I can play sport, buy cheap bras, WEAR NICE AND AFFORDABLE CLOTHING, and people aren't always staring at my breasts or pointing out how big they are.  
For reference I was a 8J and went down to a DD. I'm Australian so the system works a bit differently, but all up it cost about $10K.  
If you have any more questions feel free to shoot me a message!    

Edit: My scars are now flat and pink, they aren't horrible and they're apart of me now. They're just like stretch marks and will fade to white eventually. They're not horrible or off putting if thats what you're concerned about.
