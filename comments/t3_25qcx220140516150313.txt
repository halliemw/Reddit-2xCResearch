As a man, I am really glad TwoX is a default. A lot of times when discussing issues of gender with my female friends it is hard to see where they are coming from, either because they don't have negative gender-related personal experiences or because they don't feel comfortable sharing them (I suspect the latter), but here I can see real stories without generalities, which really helps me see the female viewpoint. Without becoming a default I never would have been exposed to this community, and I hope the trolls will stay far enough away that people can continue to share their experiences.
