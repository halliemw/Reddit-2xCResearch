> I personally feel like its almost selfish to bring a baby into this world when you aren't ready for it.

Yes. I know people say adoption is a choice, but the bond between mother and child grows during pregnancy, and it can be incredibly hard to give that baby up after you've spent 9 months growing it. Especially if you're a kid yourself. Plus everything you go through when pregnant? There are so many factors involved when it comes to bringing a baby into the world, wanted or not. Sometimes, abortion is the best option. And that is okay.
