> Does she have anyone to talk to besides the grandmother, about the changes that her body will go through? Is there some type of sexual education at her school? Maybe some form of counseling or just talking to a school nurse or teacher could help. The grandmother is great too, but I feel that with some counseling she could probably open up more. Sometimes is easier (in the mind of the teenager, less embarrassing) to talk to a someone outside the home.

Thanks for this, never thought about the school. Her school does have a Sex Ed program. I will explore these options.
