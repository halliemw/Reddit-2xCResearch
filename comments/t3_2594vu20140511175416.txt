I have one pair of black bottoms that fit my ass, and I just pair all my bikini tops with it.  I would dig around some of the department stores, they have quite a lot of neutrals so it didn't take me too long to find a good one.  Boy shorts are also a good option, but since my legs are big along with my butt I find they look terrible on me.  I dunno, good luck!
