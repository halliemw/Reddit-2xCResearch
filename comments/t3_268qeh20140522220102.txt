For real? Of course it sounds like I'm complaining now - I returned after 3 days off thinking we were having a meeting about the previous weekend's event and suddenly I have no job? Even if it is business, there's still a right way and wrong way to treat people.  Running a business doesn't automatically mean you get to treat people like crap. You don't have to coddle, but you certainly don't have to be a jerk.
