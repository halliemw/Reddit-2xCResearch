you admit there are already laws, but also that such laws cannot be created to eliminate the majority of bullying without restricting
legitimate criticism. can you point to a concrete example where using these specific cyber harassment laws (provided in link below) led to a genuine restriction of an individual's legitimate criticism?

So far, you've established a vague concern of the possibility of harm based on type kind of law, instead of any evidence of actual harm in reality related to these specific laws that exist. 

The goal of a given law is not 100% elimination of a given behavior, which we agree is not possible. Some laws are passed to present social norms, others to reduce problems/discourage behavior,
others to give individuals a platform to pursue justice where no such platform existed before. but a law isn't a bad law just because it can't prevent all the legitimate harassers each and every time or bring back suicidal daughters who were harassed online. 

Here are the experiences of one woman who filed a cyber harassment suit:

Paragraphs suggesting why the laws may not in and of themselves be sufficient include:

"During all of this time, I had lawyers telling me they didnâ€™t know anything about Internet harassment and judges telling me I 
was wasting their time." 

So, the problem is not entirely in the lack of law, but in their really crappy enforcement, which wouldn't eliminate any bullying at all. Wonder again why a harassed individual might not bother going to law enforcement in the first place?
