In early May of this year, the news reported on 55 colleges being investigated for mishandling sexual violence and harassment complaints. This Onion article satires some of the problems with how some of the colleges currently or previously handled those complaints.
A few news examples: [1](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-23/four-colleges-hit-with-federal-sexual-assault-policy-complaints.html) [2](http://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/northeastern-university-allows-rapist-to-transfer) 

The way some colleges handle these cases also could affect the accused: ["Advocates for people brought up on charges tend to agree that campus disciplinary systems are amateurish, but they contend that the result is inadequate protection for the rights of the accused."](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/education/activists-at-colleges-network-to-fight-sexual-assault.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0&utm_content=buffer9c7de&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer)

The college I'm attending in the fall is one of the 55 colleges. They sent out an e-mail stating how they will better handle complaints from male and female students in the future.  I hope they will follow through.
