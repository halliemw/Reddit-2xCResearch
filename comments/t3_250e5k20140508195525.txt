Not really.  Captains and specialists are the biggest dirtbags.  From a brand new LT or PVT's point of view this may be true but it's not true.

Also saying "the military" is a useless thing.  Cultures in the Air Force and Navy are much different than the Army and Marines, and the Coast Guard are on their own planet.  Then you have the reserve components and the national guard who are essentially civilians.
