If there are parents of young children in your audience, you could do something very family friendly like kids craft packs, tickets to a local zoo or aquarium, a gift certificate for one of those horrifying places full of games and bouncy houses and slides, etc. Those went over very well with that crowd, ime. Museum passes for cool exhibits. Local artisan foods. Once we had a basket that was all jerky related products from our city and it went over very well. People love food : )
