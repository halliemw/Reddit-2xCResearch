I have an HTC One M8 (in an Otterbox commuter case), so it's a pretty sizable phone. I refuse to carry a purse. I also refuse to buy pants with useless pockets (sucks, it's a pain to find them). My current go-to jeans are Old Navy Rockstars, many of them do actually have pockets big enough (just) to hold my phone. But beware, you HAVE to check them, some have the ridiculous chapstick sized pocket. I'm so over this tiny pocket craze. I also carry a mens wallet (slim frontpocket style), always have, due to my hatred of carrying a purse.

My next step is to go to a tailor and have normal sized pockets sewn into my jeans if I get desperate enough, should be a fairly cheap option.
