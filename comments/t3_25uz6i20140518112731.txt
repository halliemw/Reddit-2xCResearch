Laugh, have some wine and don't expect much. It's takes a while to figure out what works for you. Talk about what you want to try and have fun with it. Being comfortable with your own body and your partner will be the foundation for a great sex life. Also prep yourself in whatever way makes you feel sexy and confident.  Shave, shower, or don't.  Just make sure YOU feel good about yourself. Also be sure to ask for what you want from him.  Sex is a two way street.
