This really made me tear up.  I am so sorry for your loss.  But what a wonderful gift she left for you, a way to have a look into a bit of her life and love for you.  I never finished my daughter's baby book...life just always seemed to get in the way.  I had actually started a journal too, but that didn't last very long either.  I'm not much of a writer and it just never made it to the top of the to-do list.

I lost my mom almost 12 years ago at the age of 42 and mother's day still is very hard for me.  Even now, I kind of stay away from social media because I just can't handle all the 'happy mother's day' wishes everyone posts.  But it is really the every day things though...when something happens I still get the thought of, 'oh, I need to call mom and tell her about that'.  I think no matter how young or old we are, a mom is someone no one else can be to us.

I hope your day is filled with happy thoughts of the memories you have of your mom.  Thank you for sharing this story.
