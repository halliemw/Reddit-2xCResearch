You will need evidence (trust me). My abusive ex hated it when I took pics of the injuries he caused. He tried all he could to delete them from my phone. I backed them up externally, which he didn't know about. Also sent them to close friends for safe keeping. 

Please leave when you can and get yourself to a safe place.
