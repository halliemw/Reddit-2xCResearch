i have the mind boggling combo of being skinny/amateur weightlifter strong... i once had a sheet of plywood cut into a size i could easily carry that still was ok for my project dimensions. then i carried it a few km home bc i don't have a car. oh, the the look i received from the guy who told me i couldn't possibly be able to put it on the cart myself as we both rolled out of the parking lot at the same time, him in a truck and lil' ol' me on foot with the pieces of wood tucked under my arm.
