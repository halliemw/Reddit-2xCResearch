I like the way you think. I've always known I'd be in an open relationship, but my husband only realized that was a thing when I explained it to him. We have both agreed to go through with it, but haven't started yet. I would like to talk to someone like you to know what to expect and what sort of issues might arise, just so I can be well prepared and handle the situation properly.
