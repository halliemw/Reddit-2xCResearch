Oh, I gotcha! I was gonna say, how much money do some of these people have that they can just totally destroy a $5,000 dress?? Haha. That gets me thinking about picutres for my own wedding dress though! I'm an artist and it'd be really cool to have like a squadron of paintball warriors muck up the dress with a barrage of different colors and take pics like that. :D
