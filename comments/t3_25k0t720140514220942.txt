I had a patient on my ob rotation try to argue with me that IUDs caused cervical cancer. It was wrong on so many levels that I couldn't handle it. I ended up telling her that there was no studies showing that (aka you are sooooo wrong) as nicely as I could (fyi, it has been linked with lower rates of cervical cancer just because women who get IUDs also tend to be women who get routine pap smears). She kept on arguing with me on every damn thing I could think of so I just suggested a tubal.

Also, on the provider side, I think some gyns are not aware that nulliparous women can get IUDs.
