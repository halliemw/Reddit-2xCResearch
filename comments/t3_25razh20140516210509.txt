I disagree. The attachment formed and the emotion are not entirely choices, but our behavior and how we operate on a daily basis is always a choice. The situations that arise that produce certain emotions (those of intimacy and a feeling of connectedness) are also often choices, as well. The commitments we make are a choice, as is the act of straying beyond that commitment. Relationships are a choice. Our emotions are more transient, which is why we make choices to protect them and encourage them in our relationships and withhold parts of ourselves from others.
