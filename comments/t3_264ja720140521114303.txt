I've lost a lot of money on doctors, which is the reason I don't have any left to treat myself. They've rummaged in my intestines and checked out that it shouldn't be candida overgrowth. No other comments were made, but I believe I'm just prone to the nasty fungus.

Hopefully you get your candida in check, it is absolute hell to live like this and it's hindering my recovery.
