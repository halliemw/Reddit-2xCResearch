In my opinion a negotiation and a compromise is much different than trying to change someone's mind who dismisses your idea which it sounded like op's husband was doing. The way I read it, she already tried to bring it up and he was not receptive. A negotiation would be  (in very simple terms for an example) "hey I have this idea what do you think?"..."hmm I'm not too sure if that's something we need. Are we really at that point?"..."I think so, I'm unhappy and don't know how to fix it"..."you're right, if you think this isn't working than we can give a few sessions a try".  

Her situation sounded like she brought it up and he shot it down. If she's unable to have an open dialogue with him about it then I think she should go alone and focus on herself. That's all.
