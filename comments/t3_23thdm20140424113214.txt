The majority of us work meaningless tasks that offer no mental stimulation for businesses that prioritizes profit over the well being of the individual, you're a human resource and are likely to be replaced by automation very soon.  Unless you're an educator, a scientist, a doctor, or a farmer, your work isn't important enough to warrant a 40 hour weekly schedule.  Life is short, spend it doing the things that make you happy, not for some short sighted goal of obtaining a few imaginary numbers to your bank account.
