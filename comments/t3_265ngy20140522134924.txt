"Triggerite". Cute.

I can certainly identify with frustration when people attempt to shut down discussion of X or Y subject because "it's triggering" - and I say that as someone who, setting PTSD aside, has a whole host of phobias that mean there are things I'd prefer not to see represented from...I dunno. Spiders to sponges. 

Taking that as a model, I'm certainly not going to shriek oppression if I stumble onto a thread called "Fluffy Kittens" and it's full of spiders - much less so if I click on a thread called "Huge Spiders" and it's full of spiders. Nor am I going to lose my shit if I attend a university where they advertise a course called "Spider Snogging 101" (gag). I just won't sign up for it. However, in the first case at least, I don't see how it's imposing on anyone or censoring anyone to ask if they wouldn't mind naming the thread "Fluffy Kittens (TW: It's actually huge spiders) so I can refrain from clicking in the first place rather than clicking and then doing the spider dance for twenty minutes.

Now, surely this should be extended to the scenario we're discussing. In a women's studies course, you can sensibly expect there to be discussion of rape, and in a law course about violent crime, you can sensibly expect there to be discussion of assault and murder, in the same way I'd expect pictures of spiders on the Huge Spiders thread. In a literature course, it might be kind (which I realise is not the same thing as necessary, but I don't think it's a bad goal) to offer a trigger warning for a text that involved a graphic description of sexual assault, warfare or other common PTSD triggers.
