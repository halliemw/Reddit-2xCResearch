> What about the prejudices do you need help understanding?

The two corollaries I mentioned.

> Were you trying to start a discussion on prejudices to better understand them?

Leave open the possibility for others to contest them, expand upon, point to other (perhaps more fundamental) prejudices, spark some further tangent on the issue ... any of the possibilities available to people having an honest discussion.

> Or do they logically not make sense to you?

The two prejudices are logically coherent. But they are usually deployed without evidence (which makes them prejudices). Pointing to the laws of physics as a means of justifying the corollaries is invalid.

>  Or do you think there's more to it than the ones you originally brought up and you want to know more about them? 

While I can't see any I leave upon the strong possibility that others might, yes.

Beyond this, even if Original Parent Poster has no interest in removing these prejudices about fat from others in society (some of whom might be browsing this very sub), I, and many others, do have such an interest (or have others prove me wrong: that the corollaries I mention are well supported by evidence).
