What kind of problems did your anxiety cause in relationships, if you don't mind my asking? I've been in a relationship with someone who did have diagnosed issues with anxiety, but he was very deeply in denial about it, and honestly, that caused more problems than the anxiety ever did. Good for you for admitting it's a problem.

Maybe I can offer some kind of perspective from the other side?
