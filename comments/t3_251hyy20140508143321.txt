Confused, if you pay taxes in NI, the NHS part goes to the NHS in NI. If you live in England currently, you can get an abortion. The title is really misleading, it's more women who live in NI have to pay for abortions.

I need braces, I would get them in Scotland if I lived there, I have to pay in England, even for really serious cases like mine, it affects my health and mental well being. I'm paying a lot of money to help fix my health issues. 

Less complaining, and more campaigning the NI parliament who banned abortion in the first place, it wasn't the UK parliament that banned it, it was mentally challenged Christians.
