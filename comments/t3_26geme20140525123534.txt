You're right. I guess I should bring it up cause it is going to bother me otherwise. 

I can totally see how people develop eating disorders. I had what was probably a classifiable one in college. My eating is obviously still disordered. I just wish sometimes I could step outside of it, that I could spend one day not thinking about food. How much or how little to eat, don't eat this or don't eat that. Have I lost anything this week, gained anything. Ugh this doesn't fit the way I want. 

Changing is hard. I would like just once to feel really comfortable in my own skin.
