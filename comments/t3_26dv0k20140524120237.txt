I really think that since there is only one day for postings photos on this subreddit, that it is controlled very well. I know looks may seem superficial, but if a woman is posting a photo because she feels confident in herself, her looks, her makeup technique, or maybe it's just a photo of her accomplishing something (I suppose weight loss counts!), then I really don't think we can consider it superficial. To those women who post the photos, there's a huge chance that it isn't!

I absolutely agree that photos should not be the focus here, but that is probably why there is only one day allotted for posting photos. In that regard, I thinks the mods have done an excellent job.
