And this is why I never reported my rape. Wouldn't want to be treated by some asshole in a uniform like I was guilty of what happened to me, to be denigrated, humiliated and possibly verbally assaulted. The people who screech "But it was your dutyyyyy to stop the rapist from raping other people!" can go fuck themselves in the ear with a starched apron.
