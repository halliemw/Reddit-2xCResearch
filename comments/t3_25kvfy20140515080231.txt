This is in response to both you and /u/_Ab_Aeterno

I definitely want to read a lot of those, but I also think that it could be worthwhile to read the occasional male-centric book by a male author, and critique the ways in which they handle gender in a problematic way, or ways in which we appreciate parts of their presentation of female characters.

Mostly, I think I want it to be a book club that is a safe place for women to talk about their perspectives on books, where we can introduce both men and women to female characters they can really identify with and find a new favorite book, or rant about books we take issue with (in a respectful way). There are limits to how well we can pull this off, but hopefully we can create something special.
