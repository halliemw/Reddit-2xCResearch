i agree, he shouldn't have touched you while you were sleeping. what you chose to do after that is what you chose to do after that. but its probably not a good thing that you in effect rewarded his creepy behavior. i am not blaming you, as you said you were drunk and were not thinking very clearly, so its not really your fault. 

maybe you should tell him that although you aren't very angry at the sex, that you don't agree with how he initiated it. tell him that you feel like he took advantage of you, and that he shouldn't do that. 

as for the sex. there is no good reason you should feel ashamed of liking sex while drinking. that is pretty normal. be aware that this happens a lot more than people like to admit, and that you also don't have to admit it if you feel like it might harm your social reputation or have negative impacts. it is what it is. you know what happened, you know that you are not a bad person. but there isn't a good reason that anyone else should have the right to know about your personal life.
