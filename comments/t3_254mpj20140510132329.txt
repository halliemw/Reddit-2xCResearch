Sure! It's really a fecal transplant, or fecal bacteriotherapy. Basically, when you have a C. diff infection, all the friendly flora in your intestines are displaced by the hateful ones, and sometimes even repeated antibiotic therapy can't kill them. So you take a healthy person's poop, put it in a blender with a bunch of saline, then enema the poop soup into the sick person's colon. The healthy person's flora then colonize the sick person's gut, and knock out the C. diff infection somewhat more effectively than antibiotics. 

Although it's super gross, this is an amazing therapy -- it is very inexpensive, especially compared with the pricey antibiotic Vancomycin; it's enormously effective (studies very, but it cures like 90% of people with recurrent C. diff, vs. like 30% with antibiotics alone), and it's effective much faster than antibiotics. Yay poop transplants!
