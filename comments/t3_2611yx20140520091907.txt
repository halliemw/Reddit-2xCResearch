I've been in this situation with a job before.  The other girls had established their clique, and I was new and strange and didn't quite fit in.  I didn't mesh.  They tested the waters with me once and when they found I was a little different from them, I was pretty much cast out.  


They even tried to get me fired once. 

So I worked my butt off and made friends with my managers.  My managers came to know me as a reliable employee and I received job security and validation through that.
