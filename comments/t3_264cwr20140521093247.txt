Your bf is acting like a jerk. Maybe he DOES want an open relationship, but this is not the way to go about broaching the subject with your SO.  Maybe you guys ought to have a talk about this, because it sounds like an open relationship would be a dealbreaker for you and he may not be right for you if that is the case.

As for the "jokes"...they aren't funny.  And I doubt he's 100% kidding, especially based on the way he's treating you WRT the sleeping with other women thing.
