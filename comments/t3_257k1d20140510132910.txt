Also for girls in the US - because of Obamacare a lot of insurance providers are now covering the entire cost of IUDs and implants - less an insertion charge (usually the cost of seeing a specialist - $50 or $80). I'm currently waiting for my doctors office to be approved to carry the Nexplanon implant so I can get it! I'd been looking into implants a few years ago but couldn't stomach the $800 out of pocket cost. I'm ecstatic that implants and IUDs are now an affordable option for women.
