It ain't as simple as that, as nice as it would be. The trouble with social science studies is even if they're excellent and widely accepted in their field, they are generally based on qualitative data moreso than STEM studies. There's no mathematical proof like there is for gravity to "prove" racism exists. Much of it is subjective, based on individual experiences, and/or subject to interpretation. Not to mention the fact that being qualified to understand a biological paper doesn't qualify you to understand a historical one as adequately. 

Sociologists can spend all their days linking people on the internet to the academic definition of whatever, but 
people will still make up bullshit as to why it isn't 'valid' ("that was debunked by <poorly done/understood study>", 'the people who wrote that are dumb and part of the conspiracy"). 

Just as with creationists, if you're debating against people who don't even accept that your fundamental argument is valid, there's little 'proof' you can provide to change their minds.
