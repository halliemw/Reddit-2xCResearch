Holy BRD this thread is full of shit atm. Even the "poor bronies!!!!" excuse is cropping up.

Like Jesus Christ if I'm uncomfortable being at a convention by myself for fear of not being able to shake off adult men talking to me when I'm obviously a high schooler then SOMETHING is wrong. And the argument that I must be imagining the hostility directed at me is also crap because I spent two days dressed as Asuka from Evangelion (i.e. cute schoolgirl anime poster child) and there was a massive difference on the third day as James from Pokemon and was read as male, or at least more masculine.
