That pic made me smile! 

I have tried the Mirena and metformin and had the opposite results. The Mirena was ook, I guess, but the metformin really worked well for me. I had a good doc for this until my insurance changed. Long story, but no gyn even believed me when I begged for them to do a sono to test me. Said that since I had a child and a period there was no way I had it. Thankfully a family friend who is a doc was more knowledgeable and tested me.

I will definitely have to look into that koji soap. How well has it worked for you? I have started on a 40% carb 30/30% protein/fat diet now. We will see how it does. Did you start out small and gradually reduce your carbs, or just went down overnight?
