Bingo. This law would actually allow women to be charged with aggravated assault for attempts to self-induce abortions. 

law nerdery ahoy...

Tennessee is a state where abortion is considered a crime, and legal abortion is an exception to that crime (that's some OG shit). That means that procuring a miscarriage is an unlawful act. If it results in a pregnancy loss at any stage, that can be prosecuted as an assaultive offense. 

And if you don't think that drug war laws are part of a larger attempt to treat fertilized eggs as totally separate humans, just check out what [LifeSite News has to say] (http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/alabama-supreme-court-doubles-down-on-pro-personhood-ruling/) about an Alabama Supreme Court ruling upholding a child endangerment conviction of a woman who did cocaine and gave birth to a healthy baby. But, fortunately, [not everyone agrees](http://www.ncregister.com/blog/simcha-fisher/this-law-is-not-pro-life) [that locking up pregnant women](http://www.allourlives.org/proposed-tennesse-law-is-meant-to-foster-life-but-does-it/) and separating mothers and babies is "pro life." 

More importantly, the idea that women owe "the People" a healthy baby is scary and incompatible with women as full constitutional persons.
