I am sorry for all your troubles. You definitely sound like you need time to get your ducks in a row. 

It seems like you don't know how a baby would fit into your life, but you definitely need to respect your emotional concerns. Are you close to anyone other then your boyfriend? Family perhaps? The decision should definitely be your own, but it sounds like you really need that support system. 

Also planned parenthood might provide free counseling for those on the fence. 

Not very helpful I know :(

Edit: I missed an option on a reread. It really sounds like you may want the baby and the only thing holding you back is you thinking a loving relationship or a father is necessary. It's definitely ideal, but there is no reason why you can't raise a child on your own. It can be difficult, but people have done it before. Being a single parent is not a rarity and role models can be found everywhere. 

If being a mother is something you want to be, then be it. You can find love with a better partner down the road, till then your love is enough.

Good luck
