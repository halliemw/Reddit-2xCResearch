I'm sorry but my mother is a nurse and would be absolutely livid at the lack of care your grandfather received. She has had numerous letters and cards of thanks for her caring nature and she takes her job very seriously. Please don't discredit all nurses because of some negligent bitchy ones. There are lots of them who want to help and heal, and there are a few who are complete scumbags.
