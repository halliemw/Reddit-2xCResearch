> So for one, why is this that big of an issue for him when he doesn't go to church and (I'm assuming, since you said you may never get married) doesn't care about "no sex before marriage?" Why is this a dealbreaker when he picks and chooses from his faith? It's tricky to frame that in a non-judgemental way, and without offending his faith, but it needs to be asked. Why is this the thing he cares about when everything else is fine?

This. I was reading the OP and wondering why it seems to matter to him that his partner share his faith, but yet he is picking and choosing what to believe and how to follow it...
