Sounds like you might have folliculitis instead of acne. Folliculitis is when bacertia, fungi, yeast, or some other bug gets into a hair follicle and causes inflammation.  It can look a lot like acne but is often treated differently. Friction against clothing can lead to folliculitis which would explain why it's in some unusual areas like your thighs. Tights and jeans rubbing against the hairs on your thighs can irritate hair follicles and introduce bacteria into them and then rewearing the same pants can spread the bacteria and infect new follicles. Usually you want to keep your hands off the inflamed follicle and don't pick at it or try to pop it, use gentle cleansers, don't scrub the spot, always use a clean towel on the area, and it usually goes away on it's own in a couple days. A warm compress can be helpful to ease inflammation and draw pus to the surface.

If it's really bothering you should go see a dermatologist to rule out any other problems and find a good strategy for treating it. A dermatologist can figure out if the cause is bacterial, fungal, or even mites and help you figure out which treatment to use.
