No!!  Definitely not sarcastic, sincere congrats.  I have a niece who just graduated with a degree in Theology and is completely in debt with a useless degree.  I have another who is graduating with an Art History degree, no jobs at all in her future, also full debt.  I just get frustrated when people don't choose wisely.  But you chose wisely, you should be proud!!
