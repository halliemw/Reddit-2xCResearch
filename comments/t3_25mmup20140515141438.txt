The consequences vary by university.  University proceedings do not go on criminal records though.  You have to file a report with the police to start any criminal proceedings.  

And I agree that the campuses who try to cover up sexual assaults are awful.  I am lucky to work on a campus that values transparency and honesty in reporting sexual violence.  I would much rather send my children to a school that is open about sexual violence and has many reports each year, because that shows that students are willing to come forward and report and the school takes it seriously.  Slowly but surely, though, campuses are coming around to this line of thinking.  Mostly by force.
