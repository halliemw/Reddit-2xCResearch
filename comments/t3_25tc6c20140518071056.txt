They have to take any harassment complaint seriously, but I doubt they'd find that you created a hostile environment for him based on that one incident (the legal standard for sexual harassment).

Groping someone even once is harassment (because of its severity), but when it comes to speech the law generally requires multiple incidents over time that eventually create an overall hostile environment.
