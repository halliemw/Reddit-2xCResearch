I shaved off all my hair (donated too) and didn't regret it once. The ladies at the barber shop kept asking if it was okay and eventually agreed to do it but still don't sue them if I hate it. (I think they were only half joking) I love the bald look on women and find it sexy, myself. I don't find it unattractive in the least and would take it off all the time however I think it's a waste of perfectly good donor hair. It's been a few years and I've almost got enough for another round. 

I felt very feminine while rocking this hairstyle and received many compliments.
