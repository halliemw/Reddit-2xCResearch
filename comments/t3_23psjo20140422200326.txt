As a former clinic escort, may I say that you are making the choice that is right for you. If there are protesters at your clinic tomorrow, do not make eye contact, do not stop for them, remember that they thrive on messing with your head, and if you yell at them or argue with them, you are giving them ammunition. Just what they want. Should be few on a Wednesday. Good luck, feel better soon. And grieving IS ok.
