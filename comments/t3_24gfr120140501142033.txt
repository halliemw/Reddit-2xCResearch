Then they're not the audience the host is after. Radio hosts get away with saying a lot of offensive things; sometimes when they say something and the right people are listening at just the right time - that's when they get in trouble. Nowadays the "right time" can be any time due to the internet. Remember Rush Limbaugh's slut comment? He's been saying the same shit for years, but that was the one that got him in trouble. And it was *glorious* how badly he got burned. Then people forgot about it, and he's still on the air, still making the same comments.
