Hi, I'm sure you are just trying to help but we'd prefer not to direct users to those sites for help. They are either biased or unknown. If you want to direct people to sites /u/rosesnrubies linked exhaleprovoice.org which is unbiased and linked in our [wiki, we also have a couple others linked there as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/related_links_and_discussions#wiki_abortion_support)

thank you.
