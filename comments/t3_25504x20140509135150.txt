Good to know about the blurring! Seems like the 210s come with a "close up lens", so I'll have to do some experimenting. I was thinking of getting a plain guestbook or a scrapbook and getting either double stick photo mounting squares so the guests can decide how they want to stick the photo, or some of those adhesive photo corners and sticking them onto the pages ahead of time. Gonna provide the guests with a bunch of different colored markers, so that they can write messages/doodle along with their pictures. I figure it will be a good activity for them while they wait for us to finish up with the group photos. :) I'm so jazzed about it! How long does it take for the photos to develop, on average?
