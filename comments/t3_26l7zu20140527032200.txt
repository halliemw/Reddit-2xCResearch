Personally confront her *in private.* Do not excuse any offenders, focus instead on helping her realize that *she* is an offender.

Sexual aggression of any kind is *not* an acceptable practice; everyone is welcome to his or her own sexual practices and preferences, as long as it doesn't harm anyone else, and victimizing someone for this (shaming someone with photographs, physically/emotionally abusing women for refusing to take an interest in you) is wrong. Explain to your attacker how you feel: Try to make her understand what her actions have done to you, and help her see the parallels. Explain why you perceive her current actions as hypocritical, and how it makes you feel today.

Also, if this is an event from some time ago and it's still causing you some emotional distress, I strongly recommend seeking professional help in understanding and managing your feelings so that you're able to put this in your past and live the life you want to.
