Coming from a Catholic country, this is mostly because abortion is illegal. Nobody wants to report having had an abortion because you can risk going to jail. Also because it's hard and expensive to get an abortion especially if you are lower or middle class and don't know where to look, so you end up having an unwanted baby anyway.
