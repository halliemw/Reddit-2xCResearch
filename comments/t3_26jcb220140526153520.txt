Any women in the Toronto area who need support in dealing with hard decisions (such as abortions), I am more than willing to help (if you want to talk, or need someone to come with you), so feel free to PM me. :)

I know what it's like to make that hard decision, and no one should ever have to go through something like that alone.

On another note, I was thinking that maybe for safety reasons, some women on this sub can volunteer for specific areas (cities/towns) and their reddit username would be on a seperate post. That way if women need help, whether just needing to talk, or a couch to crash on, they could PM the user. This would keep people's identities safe. If meeting in person is required, meeting in a public place would work well, and would give time for all parties involved to at least get to know each other. Furthermore, because the individual needing support would be PM'ing the volunteer, no other individuals outside the circle would be aware of it.

My biggest concern would be the outside public. With topics, such as abortion, that are sensitive and tend to be seen as controversal, it would be awful to have the outside public interfering. People are quick to judge, and with a subject like abortion, have this strong urge to tell people their two cents. It's hard enough to walk through a crowd of picketing pro-lifers while going to a clinic, I think it would be in the best interest to keep unwelcome individuals out of the mix as best as possible.
