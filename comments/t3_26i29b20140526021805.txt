I always say it last, I'm shit at saying I love you. Sometimes I think it but i just can't express it... I suck with emotions. My current SO said it three months in and I still haven't said it(five months). He even told me he didn't want to freak me out so held off as long as he could.

I know I feel it I just freak out when I go to say it :/
