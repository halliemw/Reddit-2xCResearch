I can definitely get my insurance to cover it/get it for free but sometimes it is hard to schedule one since you can't have sex, use tampons 24-48 hours beforehand and then you can't do it on your period obviously...they aren't good excuses, I know, but it's just hard to schedule/commit to an appointment when there are so many factors to consider as far as what day it should be, etc. Also, it really effin' hurt when I got mine so I'm not exactly looking forward to it, either, haha. I'll see what they say at my appointment this week and take action from there because I know they are important.
