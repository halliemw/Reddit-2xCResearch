I think it's just harder for some people than others. People who have a messy house don't get stigmatized as much as people who eat too much food, even though both things are usually a result of a lack of will power. Also some people for whatever reason crave certain foods. I was raised to eat nutritious food and fried/greasy foods don't appeal to me, so I am thin. Many fat people are raised by parents who do not eat healthy food themselves, so it becomes passed on to the next generation.
