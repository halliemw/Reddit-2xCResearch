Wait for the wedding to be over. Grit your teeth and be happy for her.

Then, after the dust has settled, ask her.

It's a whirlwind affair that escalated pretty quickly. She may be in a completely different thought process to get everything done ASAP without inconveniencing too many people. Who knows why, but ask her *after* the wedding.

Your feelings are completely valid. Until you know the reason, however, think good thoughts for her, support her, and make the best of the situation. She's getting married!!
