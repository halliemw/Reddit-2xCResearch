According to the study in cause, you don't even need to be raped to have been raped since the 1 in 5 number includes, amongst many other things, *attempted* raped. Also rape can be sex while drunk or high. 

So anyone who tried to have sex with you while you were drunk or on some herb, but didn't, raped you.

completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, and completed alcohol or drug
