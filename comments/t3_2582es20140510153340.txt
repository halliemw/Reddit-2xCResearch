I had symptoms similar to this that escalated for months. I was having extremely heavy nonstop bleeding (saturated 15 overnight pads in a day- gave up on tampons for futility) and horrible cramps. Long story short, the docs did a trans-vaginal ultrasound and found a mass in my uterus. It ended up being benign, but it took up almost my entire uterus. After a D&C procedure, I stopped bleeding two weeks ago- I haven't stopped since late last year. I know how awful these symptoms are and I hope that whatever is going on with you is something minor that can be easily corrected. If your issue is anything like mine, you'll feel right as rain after you get it taken care of. Good luck and feel better!
