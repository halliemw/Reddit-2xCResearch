Awwww doll! Don't feel bad. Though maybe shed a tear for your neon yellow papers :)

I was constipated once, and took a lady laxative (not sure how they differ from dude laxatives but I digress) thinking it would help the situation. I was in graduate school at the time working in my studio when I made the horrible mistake of trusting a laxative induced fart…BIG MISTAKE!!

I, too, made the duck-walk of shame alllll the way down the suddenly interminably long hallway to the bathroom. I grabbed a giant forest-killing wad of paper towels when I got to the restroom, wet them, and managed to clean up. Luckily it was all trapped in my undies. I had to teach in 20 minutes and I'd walked to school that day so I couldn't pop home and change. 

Soooo I cleaned my bum and left my grossly soiled undergarments in the pad-box. I too was terribly embarrassed…but I recovered! And now it's kind of a funny story. Laugh or cry, I say. I choose to laugh!
