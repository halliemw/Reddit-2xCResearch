Sexism, harassment, assault. I know that there are women out there who haven't experienced these things (yet/if ever), but I think the fact that so many of us HAVE has a lot to do with why we are here talking about it. On here, it may seem like a disproportionate amount of us have experienced sexism/sexual assault/sexual harassment because we may be more open to talking about it/more vocal.
