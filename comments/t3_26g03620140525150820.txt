I understand the rage over the many crimes, but I feel like most of the rage comments on this post are done so with the lack of understanding about how a locked mental health facility works, and how the release program works.  This guy is not going free.  He is going to be monitored all day, everyday in an unlocked environment where he will continue to receive treatment under court supervision and constant contact with mental health professionals.  Too many people are confusing the mental health system with the prison system.  They are VERY different in their approach and follow up.

EDIT:  Source-  I was a social worker in the mental health system for 10 years.
