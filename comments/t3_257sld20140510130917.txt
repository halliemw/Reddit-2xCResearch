Eh. Don't stress it.  I started doing that in my early 20s at a customer service position.  Over time I kept it up,  even with a few 'eegh, I'm not old' lectures. These days (late 20s), I don't get much gruff anymore. I don't know if I just have the right tone,  my age makes it better or I just learned intuitively when NOT to use it,  but it's my thing. 

Although these days, I've started calling people by name if they have it displayed instead of using generic titles. I don't know if it's more or less annoying,  but no one has spoke against it yet. 

Note: I live in the Southwest, where ma'am and sir aren't a common thing.
