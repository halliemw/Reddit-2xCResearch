So the man spent 8 years in jail, another ~6 years in jail after he broke parole, and then ~18 years in a mental health facility? I have some questions:

1. Isn't parole only available after they have done half their time? So how did he got 16 years for 40 counts of rape? That seems really low to me unless it was some plea deal?

2. What happened in those 6 years of him serving his remaining sentence that had him transferred to state mental hospital? The article has no information about this.

3. I get that people are upset about his release, but I don't see what they expect to achieve. The man served his sentence, right? It seems that the state is taking every precaution by having a superrvisor "accompany" the guy whenever he goes out in public and that he must go to therapy 2x a week. If the issue is with the length of the sentence, shouldn't that have come up when the trial *occured*?
