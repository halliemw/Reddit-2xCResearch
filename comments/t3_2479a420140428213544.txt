I really fail to see what's wrong with protesting when someone makes a generalization about you.

Forget political stuff for a moment.  For some reason [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7VmU8aHAtw) trailer for the movie "Think Like a Man" comes to mind, in which one of the characters says "what's the problem with men of this generation?" and it goes on to depict men as generally being jerks and women as the hapless victims of those pigs who only want one thing.  It's based on a Steve Harvey book, and I don't think most people here would agree with his views on gender issues (or his views on atheists, among other things).

Anyway, if someone said that sort of thing to me I'd have no problem protesting.  The only question seems to come in when the thing being said is of a political character, like it's about rape or sexual harassment or something.  Now I have no problem protesting in that situation either, but that aside, I hope everyone can agree that I have the right to protest when that sort of "men are pigs"/"boys are stupid, throw rocks at them" type sexism is on display.
