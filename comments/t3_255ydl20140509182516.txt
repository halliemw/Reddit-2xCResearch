I think it's hard as an adult in general! We don't have the easy-in of school or family friends, we participate in fewer hobbies and clubs, we think for ourselves better so we don't get suckered into being friends with people we don't actually like. 

Hobbies and clubs is probably the easiest way. Volunteer, go to the gym, join an intermural league, go to art shows, take a class. Not only do you expose yourself to people, but you are bettering yourself and getting more and more interesting. Work can be a good way, but it depends on what kind of job you have. In any scenario, just making eye contact and smiling then cracking a little joke of making an observation can break the ice. I had a friend meet a friend in the line for a bar bathroom, and now they're inseparable! 

Always be safe, but keep an open mind. You never know what your new friend will look like, so don't disregard someone because they don't look like other friends you've had. I firmly believe that men and women can be friends, but ease on in there, be open and communicative with your boyfriend and new friend.

Lastly, have fun wit' yo bad self! Relax, be yourself and get a little crazy sometimes. Do weird things. Don't put a lot of weight in what others think of you. Put the real 'you' out there, and you'll attract people who want to be around the real you! Good luck!
