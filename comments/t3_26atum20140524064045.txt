Pretty sure it's the same in Naples Italy! I wasn't once scared of walking around on my own as people like to get into your business and especially your drama as soon as they sniff it out.
A whole bus erupted into shouts, gossip and drama just because there where too many street traders on it.

Italy does not do passive aggressive behaviour in my experience.
