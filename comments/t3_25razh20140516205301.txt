It's a choice for some people, it is not for others. There are different ways that people form attachments when they feel love. For some love is a choice and they make conscious decisions to avoid temptation and to progress the relationship. For others there is no outside temptation. It simply does not exist. Everyone else in the world becomes androgynous to them. Neither is a superior form of attachment, but it is better to be with someone who forms the same sort of attachments because the anxiety created by mismatch is awful.
