It does. I wish I could just be myself and be accepted for what I am- a player- instead of a "fake gamer girl" OR a "ugly gamer girl" because those are the two categories that women seemed to be lumped in. I was trying to get into raiding and really geared up last year, but the harassment was too much. As soon as people realized I was a girl it went downhill.

After a screen name change and a reroll into a male tauren and no more vent/skype chatting I find it easier to play the game. I hate that I can't have that feeling of friendship that others get to have.
