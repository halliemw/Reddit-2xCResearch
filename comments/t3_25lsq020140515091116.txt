I've been on the pill for 8 years. 

I've never missed a pill and if I did I stopped my pack all together and had a period and started again. 

I've never been pregnant.  I take my pill the same time every day.  

You need to consider the "shit happens" factor where you end up pregnant on the pill. 

If you decide another method is needed I would maybe pick either pulling out or a condom. Personally.
