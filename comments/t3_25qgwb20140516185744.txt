Hair everywhere. On everything, in every orifice. Whenever I cook anything, hair is always the surprise ingredient. On a related note: Some old female roommates and I started leaving messages made out of hair in our shower.  It was pretty impressive and always got a laugh. My new roommate is male.... he just doesn't seem to get it. :(
