Or you could read the post that its about science not some bullshit about children acting like adults.  

>Learn to take responsibility for their own emotions and for the consequences of their actions. Girls and even young women now I hear speak of their rage at one person or another, with no understanding that they make their own anger.

Because no age group does this ever..

>But these young women now act like they are their own movie stars and their own biggest fan with the eternal picture taking and posing and attention seeking. They should learn what narcissism means and how need for attention is the well without a bottom, never leading to happiness.

Don't bring attention to yourself or have self confidence! Or have fun with your friends and photograph the enjoyment being had.
