Diets pills, aside being a huge scam, are tricky. At the age of 25 I stated to take diet pills to "control" my wight and I became addicted to them pretty quickly. I'm not an expert, just talking from my experience, but diet pills as well as any other chemical substance aren't good for the body, not at least if they aren't prescribed by a doctor and monitored time to time. I developed an ED from just taking diet pills, I know this is also by virtue of my particular situation but man, tell your girlfriend there are betters ways to stay healthy and happy (a good nutritionist would help A LOT). Don't change that for weight loss, ever.
