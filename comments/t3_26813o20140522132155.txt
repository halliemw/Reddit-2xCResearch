I said this already, but Showtime's Shameless has more male nudity than GoT. It has female nudity too (Emmy Rossom is gorgeous like wow), but it's never a social issue or even gratuitous. 

GoT had Littlefinger making two girls play with each other's asses buck naked, and we are complaining that a little male nudity is a social issue. In the brothel, Oberyn and Ellaria checked out like nine naked ladies, and that hot blonde guy didn't even get full naked. Come on.
