Couldn't there be two things going on there?: on the one hand, a preference for a same-sex health pro because of what one's comfortable telling members of the opposite sex, which isn't really sexism because it's about personal boundaries rather than sex-based competence; and on the other, a refusal to be treated by women because of the belief that women-in-general are less competent than men-in-general? Not that that *can't* happen to men, but I would be astonished to learn that it happens to male doctors anything like as often as to female doctors.

The thing with disrespecting male nurses doesn't seem to me to be quite the same as disrespecting female doctors. I expect with the doctors it mostly comes from a "women-in-general suck" attitude, whereas with the nurses it would be more of a "you-in-particular are a failure as a man" attitude. In my mind the female doctor one is sexist because the problem isn't the "doctor" part, it's the "female" part. The male nurse one is shitty but not really sexist; the "male" part is fine, or would be if it weren't for the "nurse" part. The male nurse could redeem himself by quitting the woman's-work nurse job to go wrestle alligators or whatever. The female doctor is hopeless. She can never be good enough to be a doctor, and presuming to try to be a doctor has made her suspect as a woman. The nurse hasn't (yet) earned respect; whereas the doctor has already earned disrespect. Female nurses are women who know their place, male nurses are men who haven't claimed theirs yet, and female doctors are women with hubris who deserve to be taken down a few notches. Am I making sense?
