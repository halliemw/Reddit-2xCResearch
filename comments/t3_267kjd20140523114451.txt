I don't have anything more than anecdotal evidence that it was the BC making my hair straighter. I was telling a hair stylist about how my hair got a lot curlier all of a sudden. She asked me if I'd had a baby because apparently pregnancy can change your hair texture in a similar way. I haven't had any kids but a few weeks later I was reading that BC pills work by making your body think it's pregnant. Put 2&2 together...
