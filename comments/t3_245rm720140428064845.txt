People need to mind their own damn business. This happened the MOMENT my husband and I got married... "So, how about babies?? Wink wink" etc. Ugh. And it went on for years! For all they knew I could have been dealing with crushing infertility and miscarriages. It's a really personal thing to ask somebody unless you know them very well. FWIW once we started trying it did take us about 8 months to get pregnant, because I stopped ovulating (perfect timing, troll ovaries!) but many women have been through much worse.

Anyway. Rant over. Next time someone asks you just stare at them blankly, and if they persist say "I really don't want to talk about it..." They'll be all WTF but hopefully they will stop asking.
