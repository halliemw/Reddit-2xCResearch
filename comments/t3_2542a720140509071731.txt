Jesus christ....what a horrendously stressful and unnecessary experience to have to go through.  I saddens me so much that there are many countries in the world that still put women in this position.  I was lucky.  I was living in the UK when I got pregnant and it was such an easy process.  I had one appointment with a doctor and then I was referred to a clinic where I had an appointment to establish roughly what the date of conception was and to book in for the procedure.  On the day it was quick and easy and they gave you tea and biscuits afterwards while you recovered.  The cramping for days after was horrible, but nothing like what you experienced.  I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
