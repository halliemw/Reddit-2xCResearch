I know, and I hate to say it, but in the months when it did work, I *totally* was a follower of the almighty cup. I recommended it from here to there! Alas.

I actually don't mind the dumping out blood part (I think it's cool haha) but yeah, the bloody/brown fingers, the bearing down, the peeing... ugh, no thanks!
