Valid argumentation technique:: selecting chunks of sentences your opponent has written and creating a Frankenstein argument that does not at all encapsulate what they're saying.

He is allowed to have emotions. He is allowed to share those emotions and act on them. It *is* emotionally manipulative, however, to deal an ultimatum. Perhaps there is a chance that he will need to leave her in order to be happy if she goes through with the abortion. What is his goal in sharing that with her, if not to try to change her mind? *HE* should own the fact that he may need to leave her because of a decision she makes, while *she* needs to own her own decisions *about her body*. Is this really that difficult for you people to get? There is a difference between::

>If you get an abortion, I don't think I can stay with you.

and

>I know we agreed that abortion was our best option previously, but I'm finding the idea of you getting an abortion really difficult. Can we talk about other options? If we can't agree on an alternative, we need to talk about how I am dealing with this, emotionally.

One is honest and supporting (hint: option 2) the other is emotional manipulation. There is a big. fucking. difference.
