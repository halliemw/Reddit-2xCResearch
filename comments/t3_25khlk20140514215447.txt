I must be somewhat masculine then, because I never have any problems with strength or need help lol.

On a more serious note, I have noticed what you said about conversations. Some men don't think women know about things that are not exclusively for women. Finances, for example. On the flip side, when it is a group of women talking with one man, they spend more time talking to the man than to each other. It's as if all conversations hinge on the male's presence.
