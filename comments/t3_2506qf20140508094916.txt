My high school did have a required financial literacy class.  They made it a graduation requirement two years before I graduated, so I didn't have to take it, but I heard nothing but bad things about it.  Essentially, with the students they had, it wound up teaching them things that you can learn by a twenty minute google search, and for the kids that already had a decent financial background, the motivation to do that google search before they made a decision.  The kids whose parents didn't teach them those things (also) thought the class was a colossal waste of time.  

AP Macroeconomics was an elective, but it taught me tons about the stock market and is a large part of what my investment strategy is based on.
