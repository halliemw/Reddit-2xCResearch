I just switched to a new gynecologist, in part because I moved and in part because my other one was terrible and I felt like she was never listening to me.

I spoke with him recently regarding the dermoid cyst...he said because I had the one ruptured cyst and now have this one, that it might be a better choice for me to be on hormonal birth control to stop ovulation and thus stop the cysts. He said it's ultimately up to me if I want to get it removed.

He doesn't suggest the copper IUD...and I'm not too keen on it either. Terrible cramps and non-stop bleeding? I think condoms would be better in that match up, tbh.

I have not been tested for lymes disease. I don't know how likely that would be...as I've lived in a major city for the past year and I'm also a pretty notorious indoor kid. I guess it's worth checking for that, too.
