I have always been of the more short and squat variety myself but I think one thing you could try is to find her some good role models who are tall. I mean, obviously some supermodels are tall, but I'm sure you can also find athletes, scientists, artists, world leaders etc who are strong, beautiful, happy women that are also very tall. Just showing her that you can be whatever you want, no matter how tall you are, might be helpful. And I totally agree with PP that say finding her some clothes that are made just for tall girls might also make her feel better. If you're a weird size, shopping for normal clothes can just be depressing.
