Actually one of the things I loved about Portal was the fact that GLADOS as the villain body shamed Chell, it felt authentic, it showed that it was a bad thing to do, and I actually heard from men that were touched by it.

I heard men say that it got to them, made them feel self conscious  and they were like "Fuck you GLADOS I'm not fat", made them think about those words.
