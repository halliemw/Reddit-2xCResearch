This cherry picking quote stuff really irritates me because it is an uninformed way to dismiss something without understanding it. Do you know the context for any of those quotes or did you just google "feminism sucks quotes" and pick up a bunch from an anti-feminism website?

Robin Morgan

> I feel that 'man-hating' is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.

 - This has "man-hating" in quotes because she is quoting people that call feminism "man-hating". She isn't saying she is a man-hater, she is highlighting the ridiculousness of calling feminism man-hating. 

Robin Morgan

> I claim that rape exists any time sexual intercourse occurs when it has not been initiated by the woman, out of her own genuine affection and desire.

 - She is saying women should enthusiastically consent to sex. This is clearer in the context of the chapter it appears in.

Valerie Solanas 

> To call a man an animal is to flatter him; he's a machine, a walking dildo.

 - The SCUM Manifesto is satire. Solanas herself called it a "literary device". Did Jonathan Swift really think the Irish should eat babies? No.

Jilly Cooper

> The male is a domestic animal which, if treated with firmness...can be trained to do most things.

 - I cannot fathom why this is attributed to SCUM. Jilly Cooper has nothing to do with Valerie Solanas. Cooper writes romance novels. On the SAME PAGE this quote comes from (Men and Super Men, 1972) Cooper defends men from the "Women's Lib" movement which she calls a *storm in a B-Cup, and the biggest bore of the century, only rivalled by the Common Market*

Andrea Dworkin 

> I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig.

 - From a work of fiction (Mercy), not a feminist academic work. 

Andrea Dworkin 

> Q: People think you are very hostile to men. A: I am.

 - From the same interview: *Q: Are there men you admire? A: Yes.* Cherry picking.

Ti-Grace Atkinson 

> The institution of sexual intercourse is anti-feminist.

 - I don't know anything about this one apart from it was written in 1974.

Catherine MacKinnon 

> All sex, even consensual sex between a married couple, is an act of violence perpetrated against a woman.

 - This comes from a Playboy magazine in 1986 and is fabricated. MacKinnon herself says she never said it. Why someone would bother I don't understand because her views aren't a million miles away from it.

Sharon Stone

> The more famous and powerful I get the more power I have to hurt men.

 - There is no source for this. And Sharon Stone has never been a feminist leader or spokesperson and has never said she was. Why would this be in a list of quotes from famous feminist leaders?

David Angier 

> If anyone is prosecuted for filing a false report, then victims of real attacks will be less likely to report them.

 - This man isn't a feminist activist, he's a Massachusetts assistant district attorney. Also, he's talking about a specific case, this is not a general statement.

Marilyn French 

> All men are rapists and that's all they are.

 - This is from a fictional novel, The Women's Room, 1977.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton 

> We are, as a sex, infinitely superior to men.

 - written in a diary in 1890!


Ireen von Wachenfeldt 

> Men are animals. Don't you think so?

 - Wachenfeldt says this quote was taken entirely out of context. She says: *Time after time Rubar asked: It says in your magazine that men are animals. Is that what ROKS thinks? Time after time I replied: No, we don't think so. But if you've been the victim of repeated sexual assaults by men, I can understand why you might think that. Rubar chose not to include these answers in her programme.*

Only one of these quotes is from the past 25 years. One! And nearly all of them are twisted out of context. There is plenty to criticise about the modern feminist movement, but first you have to understand the modern feminist movement. I'm tired of seeing these easily refutable quotes trotted out as a criticism. It shows a lack of knowledge and familiarity with feminism.
