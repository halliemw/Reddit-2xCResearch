I was only on the pill for about three months, nine years ago, so I have a lot of experience with condoms. I've been sexually active for over ten years and condoms have been my main form of birth control.

Pros: 
*You know if it failed - Twice they have gotten lost in me. The first time I didn't realize until the next day when it fell in the toilet, clearly I had some really wasted sex the night before. The other time my partner just went in there and pulled it out. I used Plan B right away. Three times I've had condoms break, and again, took plan B. Considering how many times I've had sex - hundreds of times - I don't think that's too bad.
* They are are easy to use and obtain.
* Your partner can probably go a lot longer wearing one.
 
Cons:
* You have to remember them or buy more.
* They can be more expensive than the pill, depending on your condom preference and health insurance plan. Personally, I think you should be able to write off the cost of condoms on your taxes.
* You'll probably want to have some lube on hand. I don't find them particularly drying, but sometimes I do.
* I replace them after 15 minutes of fucking.

My partner and I get down on some good foreplay before penetration, so the actual fucking doesn't take a super long time. I like condoms. They're easy to use, obtain, and get rid of. They're easy to transport and unlike the pill, if you forget them you can just go into the nearest gas station and get some more. My partner and I like the non-latex, Lifestyles, Skyn brand, not because of a latex allergy, but because they are really thin and hold up extremely well - I've never had this type break on my.

Last (kind of) con - if you want to go from vaginal penetration back to 69 or something else, you will probably want him (and you) to hop in the shower for a quick rinse, but I don't find that this spoils the mood.
