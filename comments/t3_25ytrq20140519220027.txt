I can't decide where I stand on trigger warnings as a formal thing.  I teach high school.  My kids are watching a film right now called "War Dance."  It has some frank discussion by kids of their own experience being abducted and pressed into military service by Ugandan rebels.  Today we got to a part that's a little hard to watch and I said, "This part's a little hard to watch, but it's subtitled, so if you'd prefer to simply look away you can avoid knowing what it's talking about."  I think that generally people are pretty considerate about those kinds of things...or I'd like to think they are.  But as a formal thing...I don't know.
