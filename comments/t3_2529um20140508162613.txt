The thing about online dating/meeting someone online is that there are an overwhelming amount of risks and things to consider. Every situation is worlds different from the rest of them because it's such a unique thing to put yourself through.

Another thing that I think a lot of people do these days is really throw the L word around. They might think they truly mean it when they say it, but in all honesty that should be something that's said after two people meet in person. As you experienced yourself, things can change and unfortunately they can fast sometimes.

I met my girlfriend online through social media and we talked online for almost a full year before I ever met her in person and yes, things were way different even though we skyped almost daily, saw each other's facebook photos, etc. It was way different and that's because the "in-person" factor is a factor that overwhelms the rest of everything else built up to that moment. For us, it was very different but still great. There wasn't anything (from my side at least!) that put me off about her or anything too crucial. I would have been devastated if it turned out there was something she was hiding and didn't have the confidence to tell me but we were both 100% up front with each other and it worked out. We have been dating for 4 years and I couldn't be happier.

But like I said, every situation is way different just because there is too much to consider. I'm sorry your experience sucked and that it makes you feel bad to this day, but it shouldn't. Everyone has some relationship story where they cringe/feel horrible when they think back on it; they're lying if they say they don't have one. Keep your chin up, you'll find someone that appreciates you.
