Maybe women are more often being pushy/bossy than men are?  And why is it so taboo to talk about this?

Gender dynamics are *complicated*, and part of the struggle that women face, one of the problems that feminism addresses, is that women are taught from a young age that men are the ones in charge.

This is patriarchy.

So young girls aren't taught how to properly assert authority.  They've been taught since they were kids that they aren't in charge, and when they enter the world and find out that they *can* be in charge, they haven't learned how to properly use that.

So they end up coming across pushy/bossy instead of simply coming across like people who should be listened to.

THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM!  Instead of looking at studies like this, and saying "stop calling girls bossy!", we should be looking at young girls and teaching them how *not to be pushy/bossy*.
