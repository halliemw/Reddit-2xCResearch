I played a lot of sport in high school, and ended up breaking many bones, including my nose.  It was ok, but it healed crooked and I had a lot of trouble breathing through it, and I was getting chronic sinus infection.

So I saved up and had it fixed when I turned 18.  Best decision I made.  My confidence level shot up, and I was able to breathe through my nose again lol The chronic sinus infections also disappeared, at least for me.

If it's something you really want then I say do it.  You only get one life, so enjoy it.  I don't regret my surgery at tall, and I love the results.
