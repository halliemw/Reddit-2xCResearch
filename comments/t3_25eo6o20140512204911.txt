UTI. That's the only symptom I get. Get to a drugstore or WalMart and get Azo or Uricalm or another product containing phenazopyridine. It might dull the side pain, but it will definitely help with the need to pee all the time. It will turn your pee bright Gatorade orange, so don't let that freak you out and wear old underwear while you're on it. And of course do go see the doctor tomorrow. You don't want to let this go any longer.
