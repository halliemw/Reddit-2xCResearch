Same here. I don't know what kind of fucker downvoted this. It's the exact reason that since coming to terms with what actually happened to me I've been talking about it more. I realized that it was torturing me to bury it, and why should I have to keep this painful secret when it wasn't my fault? It also shows people how bad this shit is, which I think is important in a society that still treats abuse victims like shit.
