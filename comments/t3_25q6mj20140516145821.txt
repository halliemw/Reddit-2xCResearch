Farewell Kitty, Mistress of Mice.  While we may have complained of the steel paw of unconscionable malice used to inflict the reign of malevolent terror on our pathetic lives, we know it was for our own good, and we will miss the daily beatings.  In your absence, a power vacuum has formed and infighting consumes the land, making us wish for the simple days when your beautiful countenance would grace our beatific faces with claws, blood, and vomit.  You're a pretty kitty, aren't you, my gods you are a pretty kitty.  Ear scritches for the scritches god, and may you walk forever in the wailing of your loved ones.
