Well thank you for appreciating my input. I'm not trying to say that being a shut-in is wrong. Like I said before its just a difference in lifestyles. If I recognize that that we're not going to be compatible then I really have no interest in signing a lease with that person. Ultimately, I want to come home to a stress free and comforting environment and a harmonious roommate relationship is part of the package. 

I've been in enough living situations to recognize what works for me and what doesn't. I prefer to live with someone where we connect and mesh really well versus someone that takes a lot of effort just to talk to. I am also a pretty big introvert and I recognize that repeat rejections aren't to be taken personally, but for me those are roommate bonding experiences.
I know not every person becomes great friends wih their roommate or even relishes the idea. But it's a friendship that I've found that I really cherish.
I wouldn't say any of my experiences were bad - just learning ones. And a living situation is something that I can easily control for what best suits me. 

I can easily be friends with an massive introvert - grab a coffee and hangout, but coffee mates are much different than roommates.

Avoiding a shut-in for me is really no different than avoiding a hard partier. I don't mind party girls; they're fun to be around every now and then. But sharing a home with them is pretty draining, so it's not something I willingly choose.
