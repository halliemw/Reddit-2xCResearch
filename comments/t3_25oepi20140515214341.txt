There is no genetic test required to post here. I would say the 'two x' is not a literal reference but a metaphorical one - you feel you are a woman in all but chromosomes? Then you are, and are just as entitled to be in the gang as the genetically aligned of us.

I get that you're talking about the name not the content, and it must suck to feel excluded and reminded of how you are different when you see it - but it is not directed at you personally; it is a reference to the topics not the posters. In other words, it is a place for topics and discussions about things related to the world of girls and women.
