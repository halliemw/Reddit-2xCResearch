Again, just because your offended doesn't make it not funny. In this case, its just not funny all on its own. And there are many jokes from comedians that are considered the best that have punched down. George Carlin, Louis CK, Richard Pryor, etc. Just because you laugh at a joke, doesn't mean you agree with the underlyong principles behind it. It just means it was funny.
