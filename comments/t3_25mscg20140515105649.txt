I have Mirena, and I haven't had a period in a year and a half. That being said, for the first month and a half I bled continuously as if I was just on my period the whole time. I believe I heard a statistic somewhere that said 70% of women get a lighter/non-existent period, but you should look up the possible scenarios and if a heavier period beforehand is likely to affect it. Hope that helped!
