I don't remember a single high school test score. No one test will ruin your life. At the same time learning good study habits is very important, if you really want to push yourself try writing down after each test what you think you could have done better to prepare for it and then make sure to read that list before you start studying for the next test.

Also life is much easier (and more interesting) if you make it a point to be nice and inclusive to a new person everyday.
