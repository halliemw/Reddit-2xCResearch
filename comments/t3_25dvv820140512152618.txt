Do you know what would happen if I call in to report something that happened yesterday and isn't currently ongoing?  My parents could have cleaned off the blood on their sheets, they could have made a pact to lie vehemently to the police, and that would just leave my sister as a witness.  Might be stupid to think this way, but I was assuming since I've already waited this long that it was already too late to be taking seriously by authorities.
