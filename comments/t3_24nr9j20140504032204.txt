Yeah. I was really shitty about the break up process until recently. Boyfriend said "I can't deal with a relationship. I'm too fragile" my response was "I'm not" and I gave him his stuff. I was angry, but only said it to my friends, not him. I got out the poison, and he and I are fine now. Sincerely I think I dodged a bullet. I learned some wonderful things from him, but I'm glad it's done. 

Grieving takes time, just don't be shitty about it. Behave in a way that, if you decide to reconstruct a friendship at some point, you feel no need to apologize for your actions or behaviors.
