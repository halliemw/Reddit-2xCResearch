I don't understand how this woman is deriding the education system for being set up to encourage abortions or some other made up bullshit when she is describing the commission system and deceit used at *her own chain of clinics.* 

Also, and I know I can't speak for every school, but I've lived my whole life in Texas and never recieved any sort of sex-ed until fifth grade, and even then it was only teaching us about the reproductive system and not anything to do with intercourse. At the most, it was a mention of "sex makes babies," and that's all we got until high school (for the record, of the two I went to, one taught "sex makes babies and you don't have to do it but if you do please be careful and here's how" while the other one told us "sex RUINS YOUR LIFE and makes babies so DON'T DO IT because you'll never amount to anything!!!").
I'm sorry if this is long, but wilful ignorance like this always gets me heated up...!
