I was reading your post to my husband and we both started to get more than a bit teary eyed talking about what you and your family must be going through.  It certainly puts the petty struggles in our life into perspective.  I think you have given us a new outlook on the mood swings and sullenness our daughter has started to display.  We try to keep a sense of humour about it, but you are right, we are extremely lucky that we get to experience this stage of her life with her.  Thank you for this new perspective.


>...but I am much more in the dark about what to tell my daughter when.

Here is some advice for your daughter.  Everything I suggested for your son you could do for your daughter (maybe not the shaving bit).  She is still too young to understand and meaningfully process any advice you may give her about relationships right now so it might be a good idea to write or record some of your thoughts for her to read later.  You can provide your daughter with advice on dating and relationships from a man's perspective.  

From your comments, you seem like a good man and a devoted father and husband.  Sharing with your daughter how much you love, respect and value her mother may teach her to look for a similarly loving and respectful relationship when she is older.  

Maybe prepare something for her to get before her wedding.  Not having you there to walk her down the aisle will probably be difficult and having a message from you for that day may help.

> Do me a favor and give them both a hug out of nowhere today, and tell them you love them.

Oh you bet I did.  Just now.  My son hugged me back and told me he 'loved me too' and my daughter rolled her eyes and reluctantly hugged me back.  I held her extra long.
