Honestly, the downvote button has become a way to deal with a negative emotional response to a post.  

"Oh, I didn't like reading that.  Downvote."  

"Ugh, I can't come up with counterpoint to show that you're wrong.  I'll downvote instead to show how wrong you are."

"You just disproved what I said.  You're probably going to downvote me so I will preemptively downvote you now."
