I actually disagree with "diets" but I do agree with calorie counting. Technically eating in itself is a diet. Calorie counting is a proven way to lose weight just by reducing what you're eating. You don't need to cut things out, but you do have a cap on how much you're allowed to eat per day. If you choose to have a 200 calorie chocolate bar, that's fine, you just can't eat as much "real" food for the rest of the day. Later on once you've shed some pounds you could think about eating healthier. One step at a time. I think losing actual pounds would make you feel more successful, rather than eating healthy but still eating the same number of calories as you do now.

I've never been overweight, but I did gain 15 unwanted pounds and this did it for me. Now three years later I'm eating healthier and less, since I trained myself to eat less three years ago (I did not necessarily eat healthy, just less at the time). It really works. I think restriction diets can be very hard and depressing. I still eating chocolates and alcohol but then you have to counteract by not eating a full sandwich, just a half, etc. Good luck.
