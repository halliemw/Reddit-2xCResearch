I have a Lumia 920. Fits in my back pockets or in the front pocket of my purse.
I have a cross body small purse and I have a tiny purse that only holds my phone, ID, credit card and some cash. Nothing else will fit. It is meant to be a hand bag but I keep it around my shoulder and tucked under my arm. It's comfortable there and I often forget it's there. Otherwise,I hate purses.
