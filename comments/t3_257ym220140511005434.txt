>Calling someone cute in this context relies upon the assumption that based on their gender they shouldn't be doing said activity, and they should leave the activity to a person of the opposite gender.

I agree. 

>I call my girlfriend cute when she punches me, and we laugh about it as she enjoys being the feminine gender, I enjoy being the manly gender, who gets punched/bitten a lot by his domineering girlfriend.

If you're happy with that aspect of your relationship, that's great, but I don't think it's cute to be punched/bit by one's SO *simply* because she is a girl. Unless it's consensual play, hitting isn't cute regardless of gender.
