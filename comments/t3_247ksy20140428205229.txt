Thank you.  Reading your reply and the opinions of others who have made posts I've decided that it would be best to show my appreciation for her on a different day.  While she and my father are both a little immature and know how to take a joke (my older brother calls her 'mom' as a joke even though they are the same age) I repect her enough to pick less controversial day.
