Unfortunately, a lot of insurance companies will just deny, deny, deny on anything more expensive than a normal office visit - their reasoning is that if you genuinely need the treatment, you'll fight them on it. If that gets them out of paying for a certain chunk of claims they'd otherwise be on the hook for, they're happy.

Source: could barely walk due to barely herniated disc, insurance company told me "you're a 22 year old female with lower back pain, that's not a good enough reason to need epidural steroid injections". For every injection, my doctor had to spend at least a month arguing with them even though they had my MRI showing an obliterated disc. Somehow insurance thought I wanted needles inserted into my spine for shits and giggles?
