People hate fat people because it makes them feel better about themselves.  But having fat people who are comfortable being fat, and happy, breaks that.  So any fat person who is not working on losing weight, and thus being a good fattie, deserves to be put down.

Reddit has a real issue with this.  I find it especially depressing in /r/science where you post anything about weight and health, it gets downvoted to hell unless it summarizes to "being fat is bad, and you should feel bad."
