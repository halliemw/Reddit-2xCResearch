Even then, it's supposed to filter out content that fits these criteria. Since Twox became a default sub, people are downvoting mostly because they do not agree/don't want to hear about it/aren't interested in the topics being posted here. Some of the viewpoints posted here are in the first stages of development and need to be subject to open and welcome discussion. Now, there will be no discussion because of the overwhelming amount of thoughtless downvotes and thus, there will be no post.

There's too many people now for us to trust everyone to be open and tolerant.
