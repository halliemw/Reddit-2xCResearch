It looks like there is a lot of good advice in this thread, but there is one big thing that is lacking that I want to point out: Desire and "performance" do not always correlate. 

Especially as you get used to one another's sex drives, there are probably going to be times where he wants to have sex and you don't or you want to have sex and he doesn't. THIS IS COMPLETELY NORMAL. Don't take it personally, and try to talk through things with him regarding this. Feeling rejected by your partner is terrible, but it does not necessarily mean that he thinks you're ugly naked or something like that. If it comes up a lot that one of you wants to have sex and the other doesn't, don't freak out, but it is something you should sit down and talk about. Unequal sex drives can cause a lot of strain on a relationship, but they don't have to.

Hope this addition helps!
