I find it troubling because it is a way of thinking that is no longer relevant to contemporary living. Its one thing to live a certain way and make yourself a model of a particular way of life. If you are the model, people can see how your life is rewarding to you and choose to go down that path as well. However, when you push your opinions on people, that bothers me. He's always been a "you should do this" type of person.
