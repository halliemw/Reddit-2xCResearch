Eh I had size 10 feet and was 5'4" by age 12, all my doctors said I was going to grow so much taller because of my big hands and feet...I ended up gaining one more inch before I stopped growing at age 13.  So I wouldn't put a lot of stock into foot size as a predictor of height...but if you are a tall family then that's a different thing, of course!
