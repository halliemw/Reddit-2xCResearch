My now husband said it first, I was planning to say it that same night after I got home from work but he beat me to it. (: I don't remember how long into our relationship it was said, but it was early. Considering I am now 5 months pregnant (planned) and we got married on our 6th month together, May 8th. Seems too fast but when you know, you know.
