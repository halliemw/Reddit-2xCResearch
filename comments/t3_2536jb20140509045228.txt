After a week or so using Wellbutrin, I developed tics.  One night, I had full-on wringing of fingers, twisting my head/neck, forced blinking etc. for hours.  I immediately stopped taking it that night, reported to the doctor, and only had the forced blinking bit for a few weeks afterward.  I've been told this isn't even considered on the list of side-effects, though, but that's what happened to me.
