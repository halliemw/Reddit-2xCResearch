I'm male and I'm just as scared of gangs of teenagers as you are. However, I think it's easier on the whole - there's no catcalling*, sexual harrassment, or Schrodinger's rapists.

*Almost none. I was catcalled once recently by a group of women - they called me a "wee hottie" or something. But it's different than male-female catcalling because I just felt a bit embarrassed, not threatened, and also because it's super-rare.
