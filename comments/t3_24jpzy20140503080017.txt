I wish my grandmother cooked. After her children left the house she put her feet up and stopped cooking for others. You're lucky if she makes you a cup of tea. 

However I suppose if I had to cook for 5 people in QLDs prior to the invention of home fridges and air conditioning I would stop cooking.
