You should wear slacks or khakis, and a blouse or button-down shirt as well as closed-toe shoes. (no sneakers).

They'll ask if you have any experience and why you think you are qualified for the job. They may ask about your school schedule and if you participate in any extra-curricular activities. (This is mostly to figure out if you will have scheduling conflicts.)

Make eye contact, answer truthfully, and be sure to mention any experience that would help you in this job. That could mean previous babysitting experience, paper routes, lawn work, etc. Absolutely anything you've done before that helped you learn a skill is what you'll need to get across for a first time job. Those sorts of things help you to be responsible, learn to clean and take care of a work space, deal with other people, and taught you to multi-task, etc.

Good luck! Make sure you ask them any questions you have as well. Think of it more as you interviewing each other.
