Because with the exception of this ONE COMMENTER, I have never met a woman who hasn't been harassed in this fashion on the Internet.

Both my sisters, my girlfriend, my friends, all of them take shit just for not being men.

I actually agree with the OP, when I see that shit online, I act like an ass. If I make it shitty for them on the Internet (like they do) maybe one day they'll leave. I really don't care about changing the hearts and minds of reddit. Waste of time.
