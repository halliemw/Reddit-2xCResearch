This is great advice and absolutely true in my experience. Somewhat related advice I got from a friend, becoming a regular at a bar or a coffee shop can be a good way to meet new people without having to just like, walk up to total strangers. The staff and other regular customers will get to know you and eventually conversations will happen, maybe you'll discover shared interests and find new friends who have their own friends, etc.
