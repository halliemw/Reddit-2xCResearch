I never forced her. She has an older sister with aspergers and saw how much therapy helped her sister's social skills and general anxiety. 

The first few sessions, my daughter got angry and numerous times told me therapy was useless, but went back to humor me, and because I make our therapy days into little events out together, so we'll stop in a park for a picnic after our session, or grab a cup of coffee and chit-chat before we go in, or occasionally take the entire afternoon to go window shopping after we're through (usually after a tougher session).

Now that she sees the benefits, my daughter can go by herself if something happens that I can't make it, but she prefers me to go along, since it's turned into our special time.

I'd give therapy another chance. It took a few months to really see some changes, and there have been times where I feel like it's hit a plateau, or she's sliding back a little, but the overall progress has been amazing.
