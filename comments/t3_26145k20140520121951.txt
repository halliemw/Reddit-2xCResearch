I usually try to ignore people who do this to me and they just keep walking.  However, recently my room mate and I were walking home from a bar and I was a little tipsy so when a guy with his friends passed us and yelled "damn", I stopped mid-step and screamed it back at him.  He looked super uncomfortable and quickly walked away while telling me to calm down because it was just a joke.  It was stupid on my part because it could have been a dangerous situation if we had been anywhere else (the bar is approx 200 yards from my apartment), but it felt great to give him a taste of his own medicine.  Maybe next time he will think twice before making someone else feel like that.
