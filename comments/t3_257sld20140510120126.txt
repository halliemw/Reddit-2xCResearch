Have you moved at all? Because I grew up mostly in the north, and while I know sir/ma'am is a thing in other places in the country, I've literally never heard it used in real life. So here, if you're calling a woman "ma'am," it implies that she's "old." Here, it isn't a sign of politeness or respect--it's almost the opposite, if the woman isn't really "old."
