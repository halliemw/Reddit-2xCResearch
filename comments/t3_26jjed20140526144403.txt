Pepper spray or OC spray is not a great idea. It generally blinds/chokes the sprayer as much as the sprayee. And some people just keep fighting while they're being sprayed. A taser is a better choice and there are lots of options. Contact a nearby security guard training school and ask about taser/oc spray and self defense classes. 

Generally cameras are a very good deterrant. Putting one up facing the window (even if it doesn't actually work) would probably chase off all but the most dedicated of criminals. 

On to those dedicated criminals, the ones you need to worry about. Read up on what to do in case of a home invasion/rapist/attacker in the home. You may want to start training yourself to be a lighter sleeper. In the future you want to be up and alert when you hear someone breaking in to your home. A home defense weapon like a shotgun is not a bad thing to have. You can't just buy a gun though. You need someone to teach you how to use it so that you can operate it effectively and safely!
