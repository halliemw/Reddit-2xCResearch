I'm so sorry that you've gone through all of this. It's bullshit. You do not deserve any of this. It doesn't matter what you look like or what you're wearing--other people should never touch you without your permission, or make comments, or anything. Don't sell your stuff. Go to therapy. Get comfortable with confronting assholes. Be your awesome self.
