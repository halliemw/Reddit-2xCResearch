>Anyway - like I said, ten years of this...at the end of ten years I was an overweight smoker with no energy. Now I'm a much healthier weight, no longer smoke, and work in a job that requires both physical and mental agility and work. I am a lot happier.

Good on you! That's fabulous.

It's a slightly toxic environment,,but nothing as extreme as you have listed, if only  briefly and quickly,  I can imagine the kind if insanity that you had to endure, and the mental strength necessary to prevail.

I am just becoming more and more fed up with this babbling bimbos. I dislike how they reach for the sympathy card of,"I'm a single unwed mother" and then turn around and talk about their boyfriends who don't give two shits about them or their potential children. I can't speak my mind, because it would make my environment more hostile.

I take the diplomatic route and do my work, make small talk, and make as many excuses to be alone as I can. My mind just can't handle the telenovela story line these two are living. 

But thank you for the heart to heart and I wish you all success in staying healthy-mentally and physically!
