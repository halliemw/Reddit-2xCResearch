You realize that if you all incite panic and abandon the community, the reason the sub will fail is because of good members leaving rather than trolls invading? The mods here have been increasingly on top of things when it comes to cutting back on trolling/invasions. I don't know why suddenly "the sky is falling."

Yes it's true being a default increases shitty traffic. But most default subs also have very "anything goes" policies or mods who aren't invested in moderating comments, and flatly, 2XC doesn't.

You're free to leave but how long can we expect the dramatized theatrics last? I'd like to take hiatus from here until then.
