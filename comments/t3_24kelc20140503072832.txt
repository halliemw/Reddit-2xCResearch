It is an important thing to keep in mind in general when discussing other cultures, and I think especially when it comes to the Middle East. Having lived in the ME, it annoys me that a lot of Americans seem to think that well-off urban college students speak for everyone there. For example, before they came to power in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood had a huge base of support. A lot of Americans seem to think that they were some fringe group that most of the population opposed, but the fact is that the Egyptian population is more conservative than those Americans would like to think. Not, like, Saudi Arabia conservative, but most favor some Islamic influence in government.

When it comes to Iran, I think a lot of Americans get a really biased view because the Iranians who fled to the US are in no way a representative sample of Iranians as a whole. They were much more educated and privileged, so their memories and photographs of the pre-revolution days are very different from most of the population.
