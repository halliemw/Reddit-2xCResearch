Yes. It's everything. Once I had a lovely Chinese lady slap me on my ass and said "done! Looks good" 
My first time I was rather apprehensive and was told to hold my ankles while my legs were bent at the knees near my chest. She goes for her first rip... I nearly kicked the bitch in the face. So not prepared. 
There's this stuff called doctor numb or something for the skin for before you get tattoos. I'd recommend that.
