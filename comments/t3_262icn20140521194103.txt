This isn't so different from working in a lab that does research on a topic you aren't at all interested in as an undergrad. I honestly didn't give a shit about visual working memory in babies (who the hell does??). I don't even like babies. BUT I needed an internship. Charmed and made vague politically correct statements to get it.
