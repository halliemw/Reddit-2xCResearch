The difference is that many clinics here (referring to Ireland as a whole, I am in NI whereas this clinic is in the south) do not have enough understanding of this issue or the culture surrounding it. They have no experience with it, they are not involved in the culture, and women can find it hard to talk to them about this for these reasons. A lot of victims also believe that a 'regular' GP would not be able to help in any way, so a specific clinic will hopefully encourage them to visit.
