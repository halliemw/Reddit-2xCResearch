i have been rolling that phrase in my head since the post (there is actually a post on topic in /r/writing right now). but it also made me think about the news that came out recently that drugs need to be tested on both male and female mice, because just testing them on male mice does not uncover the side-effects female mice will experience. thus, once the drug hits the market women are more likely to suffer from extended side-effects. 

now where was i going with this, we still view the male as a default 'human', even in science, and women as a variation on the default. so i don't know if 'men in music' just not carry as much baggage as 'women in music', or if we are just not used to hear it.
