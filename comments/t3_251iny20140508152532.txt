Yep, I totally agree. I find it's somewhat easier to say "boundaries have been crossed and I won't put up with it again" when it comes to cheating or lying.


But what if your SO is neglecting your need for physical touch? Or what if they stop, for a time, trying to meet your emotional needs? What if they are unsuppportive during a hard time? What if they stop communicating or stop coming out to events? 


It's a lot harder to say this crossed the boundary into unacceptable because both people's needs change according to moods, emotions and circumstance but one partner is still left feeling hurt and unfulfilled. You can't expect your partner to respond to your every whim, but what happens if they figuratively abandon you and your needs for a time; it breaks trust and makes you question whether they are actually committed. 


I guess that's another facet of this building trust and granting forgiveness issue, at least for me.
