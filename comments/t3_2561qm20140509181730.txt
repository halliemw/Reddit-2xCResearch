I think you glazed over a serious issue, and that is that women in highly educated fields make less than their male peers. This is especially true in advanced medicine, like surgeons. Female surgeons tend to make less than 60% than what their male peers make. 

The discrepancy in pay is also true in upper management positions, like CEOs. Again, in those fields, women make significantly less than their male peers.

So, when you vaguely throw out the idea that men and women pretty much make the same, you're pretty much wrong when it comes to careers that involve a lot of education or a lot of authority. Women who are just as educated and have just as much as experience (or more) than their male counterparts make less. You cannot fix that by paying "caregivers" more money.
