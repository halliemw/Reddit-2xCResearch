So you don't think we should help out fellow members of our society because it doesn't affect you in any way? I don't really see your logic. I'm not handicapped but that doesn't mean I think handicapped stalls and parking are stupid or that we should get rid of them. 

I mean men's homeless shelters don't help me so I think they should all be shut down.
Or even better, I think all men should have to wear shirts all the time because the nude upper body of man is offensive to me /s

Sex is entirely different than a mostly covered breast being used to nourish a child. And sex is not related to breast feeding in anyway. I don't think that comparison can be used. Breast feeding to that baby is like eating lunch to you. That is a fair comparison.

And what if you have no money for a babysitter and you have to go out? What are you supposed to do? Seriously? Just let your child go hungry because someone might be a tad bit offended? What kind of world do we live in where a mother can't feed her child in public because she might "offend" someone. This construct is entirely new, women have been breastfeeding in public for literally thousands of years, it just seems to stupid to me to even worry about it. It's not like shitting or pissing, its not unsanitary. And it's not like sex, there is nothing sexy about it to a regular person. It's just feeding a child. That's all. Are people also offended by cows udders? I mean they're the same thing really. 

Sorry got off on a tangent but yeah. Hope that sorta get's my point across. Basically, I think it's really limiting telling mothers where they can and can't feed their children. In my opinion, babies shouldn't be denied access to nourishment, even temporarily. And I would also rather have a nice quite full baby in public than a screaming hungry one. But that's just me.
