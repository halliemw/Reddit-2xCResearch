Aww, I'm sorry it sucked so much.  On the other hand, someone you barely know is shoving a foreign object up your cervix! (Holy crap!)  What else would you expect?  I describe my experience as, "If I had any state secrets and was being interrogated, I'd have told them everything immediately!"

I hope it gets better for you.  It definitely did for me.  May the 5 or 10 years you never have to think about it again will be totally worth it!  Unless you want to conceive.  Then you'll have to get it removed, and I hear that's not nearly as bad, but please let me know.  I'm seriously considering just leaving mine in for the rest of my life since I'll almost definitely be post-menopausal by the time it stops working.
