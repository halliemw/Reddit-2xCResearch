Although I am a male, I only had 2 close friends that I wanted to ask when I got married.  My wife had ten (!) bridesmaids.

Of course I asked my brothers in law and the wife's close male relatives, but that left three spots.  

Over the course of our engagement I met many of my wife's friends and their husbands.  I became close with a few of the husbands and asked them to be in the wedding.  Still friends to this day!
