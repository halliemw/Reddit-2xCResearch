Sooo ... if he asks you out for a date will you tell him what an ass he is and that he can forget any more contact with you? 

(I know, risky move. If he knows your full name/address he could retaliate. But on the other hand you could be the first person to actually tell this sucker off. I bet it would feel gooood!)
