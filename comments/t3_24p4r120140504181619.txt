That's so awesome to hear! I wish I could get my mom eating better. She definitely sees that it's helping me, but it's hard for her to change her habits. She's made some steps in the right direction, though. It's really been incredible for me. I just assumed that I'd end up with all these health issues like her and others in my family -- that is was "genetics". Now at family events the topic invariably comes up, "What's she doing differently?" It's still hard to get people to try it, though. They think it is going to be ascetic and difficult. The truth is, I thought it would be. Then I actually went vegan as an experiment that my husband and I were doing and it was *way* easier than we thought. We didn't start off whole foods, so it was really easy, but whole foods came rather naturally just as we learned to cook more and avoid stuff in boxes. And we've become such foodies! Definitely NOT deprived, though we do vary in how strict we are about whole foods (strictly vegan, but I do like olive oil over steamed veggies and real sugar in my coffee and the occasional cupcake or non-dairy ice cream). And I eat lots. No grumbling tummies here! I could never do those diets where I had to eat less and then feel all light headed and crappy for the rest of the day while I waited longingly for the next meal.
