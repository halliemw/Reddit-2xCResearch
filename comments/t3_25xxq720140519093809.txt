The amount you plan to spend on it will determine a lot of what you do.

Some ideas: 

* movie night (popcorn, DVDs or Netflix/Amazon Prime vouchers, beer, sodas, etc)

* board games (games and appropriate snacks)

* maybe a Monte Carlo one with martini ingredients, poker or baccarat set?

* beach basket (sunscreen, a nice blanket/towel, sandcastle equipment)?

* home baking kit (ingredients and some funky muffin pans or other accessories)
