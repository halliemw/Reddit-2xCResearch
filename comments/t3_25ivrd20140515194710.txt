>  As a man especially, it's probably often hard to find this kind of emotional support.

So much this, and perhaps this is the biggest take away for women from this thread. Many men lack a support network with respect to this stuff, and we have no one to help us sinking into the black hole. 

> I sympathize with the pain. I just think it's unhealthy that he thinks he deserves that kind of emotional support from the person who broke up with him. That's not where he should be looking for support.

That's fair. For the guy, it may be the only "tool in his toolbag" he had. Now it is gone, and he has nothing else to use. So he trying to reclaim it rather than finding a potential new resource. Very good.
