Try volunteering! I've found that it's one of the best ways to meet good people, and make yourself feel better. Everyone has a skill that can be of help. You might feel better, because you're proud of yourself for helping someone else or because you'll see how much worse off you could be.

Since you can't have a dog of your own, go to an animal shelter and see if they need someone to walk the dogs, or brush the cats, or whatever. Or, go to a women's shelter. They use volunteers to check women in, do small maintenance, help women study for GED programs or apply to jobs and colleges. Maybe volunteer at a charity kitchen if you can cook (or just serve). If you know how, you could give haircuts or interview makeovers at a homeless shelter.
