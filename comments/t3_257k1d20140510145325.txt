I suppose you have to be vague when there are so many different types and different instructions! 

Since 2011 the Royal College of Obs and Gyn have said it's ok to take any antibiotic except rifampicin or rifabutin with combined contraceptive pill. Just be careful if your antibiotics make you vomit or give you diarrhoea. Extra precautions are a recommendation that has been hammered in for quite a while, so some clinicians may still advise it erring on caution or it's just stuck in their memory.
