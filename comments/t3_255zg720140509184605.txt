I love the idea of a tree!  Perhaps I can find somewhere in the mountains to plant it, so they can move out of our house without feeling bad. 

I recently told my kids about how I'm going to be cremated - they were asking about death again, and I wanted to tell them about it so they wouldn't be surprised/freaked out.  I told them I wanted them to be able to take some of me with them to where we camp every year - to know that, in some way, I am there with them.  My daughter asked if she could have some of me to keep with her.  This morning she brought down a small box and she said "This box is where I will keep you, it's fuzzy inside, like your cheeks."  It broke my fucking heart.

As far as my wife and I, I have told her that I want her to find happiness after this, that while I absolutely hate not being the one who will sit next to her in a cabin by a lake and watch children and grandchildren play, the thing I want most for her is happiness and a long and wonderful life.  (those conversations suck by the way, and we both cried a ton)

To be fair, I *also* told her that I just want a (small) golden statue of me in the bedroom with a motion-sensitive recording that plays my voice saying "you will never measure up" to any prospective suitors.
