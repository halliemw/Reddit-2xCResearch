> If we start fawning over kids, making a big deal over their struggles, they will perceive these struggles as a bigger deal than they might actually be.

Isn't "big deal" very subjective? Who's anybody to tell anybody else how much they are suffering? I think that's a very difficult decision to make, and I would absolutely err on the side of caution by taking any emotional problems seriously - even if they are completely normal and not at all pathological. I think in many cases, problems could perhaps  be deescalated *before* they become long-term, difficult to treat mental health issues. I think there's no need to "fawn" over kids with problems, it would be enough to listen to them and  take them seriously. If a kid says they can't stand it any more in school, I think it's much better to give them some time off, have them see a counselor, and make a decision with parents, teachers and the child together as to what to do now, rather then just say "oh, they'll get over it." Even if many do in fact get over it - I think it's just cruel to make this decision for them. I don't think adolescence *has* to be depressing, if people were more willing to listen, and less likely to just shrug teens' suffering off as normal.
