This is sort of jumbled "advice", but maybe it will help some?
You say that you "have everything anyone could seemingly want", but that doesn't mean that those are the things that you want, personally. Just because some people find these things fulfilling, it doesn't mean you will. Perhaps your expectations that these things should make you happy are exactly why they are not doing that, if they never quite seem to be everything you imagined they would be. 

If anything you listed is making you unhappy, that's one matter, and a possible solution would be to change that part of your life. However, if the things you listed just aren't as fulfilling as you expected them to be, then perhaps you're putting too much pressure on those things to fulfill you. It seems like you may need to figure out what you do want, what you enjoy doing, what things make you happy, etc. if what you have now isn't doing that for you. Of course, that's not an easy thing to determine, and will likely take a lot of time, and some trial and error.
