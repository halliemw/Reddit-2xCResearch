My parents have VERY different religious beliefs, my Mom's an Anglican priest and my Dad is an atheist. They've been married for 28 years and raised 3 kids who all figured out where they stand on religion at a fairly early age. There were arguments about how to raise the kids and on their beliefs. When it really comes down to it they respect each other and neither tries to convert the other.

It seems like you really respect your SO and his beliefs, but he doesn't extend that courtesy to you. Different religions doesn't have to be a dealbreaker but it does require an understanding of the fact that faith is extremely personal.
