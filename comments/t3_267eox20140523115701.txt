I'm sure there are people out there like that, but I just haven't encountered it. One of the women I work with tells a story about how, at her first job interview, they had her carry a monitor to see if she were strong enough for the burly world of IT.

I personally have faced the same thing you mentioned: "my contributions ignored and then accepted when a male coworker rephrased them". This happens a lot to me, although its male vs. male so not a sexism issue. It may be that its not your X chromosome but that the other guy just explained it better, or that hearing it a second time allowed the listeners to process what was being said. I'm not super eloquent and often when I try to explain things it goes right by the audience. Sometimes my boss will understand what I am saying, rephrase it and then suddenly everyone agrees. You could look at it as your idea was so brilliant that few people could grasp it until was explained to them in different ways.

I guess I was a little disingenuous when I said that the only thing is technical competence and price. When I hire those are important but I also try to find someone that will fit in with the group and who has a track record of staying with a company for more than a year or two. At the end of the day though they have to be competent.

I have found that there are two paths to success in the world. By success I mean promotions and money. The first is technical competence. If you are like Dr. House, you can be a complete ass and still be successful. The second is to be well liked. You can be quite incompetent and still successful if everyone likes you. It took me a while to realize this, as I was more of the technical type. As it turns out its actually a lot easier to be the likeable type.
