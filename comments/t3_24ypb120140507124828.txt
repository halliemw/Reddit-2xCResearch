I performed a wedding many years ago, which was held  in the back yard of a friend of the groom.  The catering was done by the parents of the bride and groom, simple home cooking.  Two friends of the bride sang, accompanied by a single fiddler.  It was beautiful.

Weddings don't have to be expensive to be memorable and special.
