Mine got to me because I just moved to another country (from a poorer to a 'richer ' one), and had a lot of doubt in my knowledge of English,  plus lots of self doubt regarding social situation - like a village girl in a big city,  heh. 


I would say that my self esteem was really low at that point :/

Also,  really agree with your points about socialization - give the benefit of the doubt, be a nice girl etc. Note that there's no middle ground between a 'nice girl ' and a 'bitch' in this socialization paradigm,  and who wants to be a bitch? I could talk for longer,  but need to get back to work :)
