Yeah, same here. I'm mostly a lurker, and just by observing I've noticed there is definitely a different vibe here. And it's not a good vibe. I have a feeling there are going to be several more /r/askwomen related posts from young guys that'll be up voted by the new male populace.

I really don't feel like policing this subreddit. I didn't sub to this place to police it. I'm probably going to jump ship as well, not in a threatening way. I didn't really participate much. But if I do want to participate or have a question woman-related, it definitely won't be here at this time. Good luck to 2XC.
