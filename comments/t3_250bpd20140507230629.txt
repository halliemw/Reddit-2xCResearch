Yea I think there is definitely a line between preparing kids for professional dress and policing self-expression.

I just have a hard time reconciling how to fairly enforce this.  If a tall girl wants to wear a skirt that would come down to a short girl's knees, is it fair for her not to just own it?  I probably would have opted for leggings if it was me in the skirt but what right does that give me to say she can't wear it?  Young women definitely have a right to wear what they find comfortable and what makes them feel confident!
