I am also on the Mirena, and do not get periods too! I honestly love the Mirena, I have had it about 3 years now (got it at age 22). I hear that a lot of doctors actually try and persuade young women from IUDs, but in my case, hormones from birth control pills really messed with me and left me pretty emotionally unstable (my body doesn't like being messed with). My doctor used the Mirena as a last resort tool after the different types and dosages of birth control that I had tried. I have not had any problems, and have really enjoyed the perks of having a Mirena. I would highly recommend it! It is painful when first inserted, and on-off abdominal cramping for the first couple of weeks/light spotting, but after that -- pure bliss. Good luck!
