The Gift of Fear (Gavin de Becker) - about learning to trust your instincts in order to be safe.

Half the Sky (Nicholas Kristof) - about oppression of women worldwide; follows the personal stories of women in different countries.

I actually own both of these books so I can lend them to other women.
