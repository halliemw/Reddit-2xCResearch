I have been on the pill for over 10 years. I started on the pill because I was below weight and had really irregular periods. The doctors hoped the pill would help that. Also, I was 16, so starting out with anything else wasn't really an option.

I started with a very high-estrogen combo pill and stayed on the same thing for almost 10 years. I never changed because... well, why change something that was working perfectly fine? I've never had a problem taking my pills on time at the same time every day. I liked what it did for my skin and in shortening my periods. I never had any negative side effects (that I knew of). It also never affected my weight.

About a year ago, I started having weird headaches and vision changes while on my period. Then my husband read that it is dangerous to be on a combo pill if you have migraines with aura. So I went to my doctor and told her what was going on. She immediately recommended a progesterin-only pill. I started that and love it. No periods!!!! I did have a bit of a breakout after I changed over, but that's cleared up now. I also realized that the combo pill had been lowering my libido, though I hadn't noticed it before. 

I'd rather be on the pill than anything else. The implants and IUDs scare me because they just seem too new. I'm afraid there will be problems with them years from now that we didn't forsee (I feel this about everything new - cars, phones, medicines, etc). The patch? That just seems so 70s. I didn't know people still used that. Nuva Ring, etc? To me, it's much easier to remember something every day that every 3 or 4 weeks. Plus, the whole take it out when you have sex thing... eh just seems troublesome. The shot? From people I personally know, I have heard nothing but horror stories about it. I have known many people who have had horrible experiences with it and none who have liked it.
