A bunch of dudes with a [history of murder and rape](http://www.aworldatschool.org/news/entry/nigeria-abductions-a-call-to-action) who believe women are subservient to men and education is evil kidnap 300 juvenile girls from school. I'm sure they're all fine and nobody has done anything bad besides, you know, the kidnapping. And the slavery. And the forced marriages. But definitely no rape. Nope, not that, not this time. I'm sure they're quite done with that, they got it out of their system all the other times they attacked schools and killed kids.
