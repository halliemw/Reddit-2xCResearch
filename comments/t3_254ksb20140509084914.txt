My quote for the day, distills the article if you don't have time: 

>  Each time a child opens a book and reads a womanless history, he or she learns that girls and women are worth less. It’s an ethical and moral failure that we suppress these histories and don’t teach feminism in our schools. It’s also an economic drag and politically dangerous.

> These erasures undermine the purpose and intent of public education because we fail to prepare children for citizenship, we actively make them culturally illiterate, we undermine racial, sexual and gender equality, we degrade our ability to create an effective workforce and an economy that provides equal opportunity and leverages the talents of all people, and, lastly, we fail to grow adults who can think critically about the world around them. It’s a societal failure because every time we choose to teach a child a distorted past, we create a distorted future.
