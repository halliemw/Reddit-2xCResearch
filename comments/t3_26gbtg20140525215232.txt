I kinda feel like it's... almost taking advantage of the fact that he knows I still have feelings for him (thus me wanting to not have sex anymore full stop ever period because it screws with my emotions) because whenever he starts pressuring me into having sex he basically talks all sweet like he did when we were together.. then I resist because I know he isn't interested in that, but it's super hard to resist after being asked 20 times.
