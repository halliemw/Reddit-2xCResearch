We're a really casual retail store that caters to a young nerdy demographic. We were all hired for being friendly, upbeat, and having a sense of humor (and product knowledge). At work I am ALWAYS smiling and starting conversations with customers. We tell them about the company, the products, special events, etc. We have long conversations with customers about related hobbies when they're looking for something specific we don't have, and joke around a lot. I think that probably leads to some guys thinking it is okay.  

While I don't ever reciprocate the flirting, a "fuck off" would get me fired! I'm trying to come up with something to say during the non-threatening / awkward encounters that lets them know it isn't up for discussion but no hard feelings, as opposed to the really creepy / power trip encounters where I intend to say something like "That's a little too personal" and then "you're making me uncomfortable", then getting a manager involved.
