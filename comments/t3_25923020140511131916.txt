Amen! The only make-up I use is concealer for razor burn from shaving my upper lip and chin. It finally got warm enough that I've resumed shaving my feet so that I can wear sandals and plucking the band of hair around my upper arms for t-shirts. Soon, I'll start shaving my chest so that I can wear shirts that don't come up to my neck.

And even with shaving all that, there are areas that I just won't touch. Some are for comfort, since hair helps prevent abrasion. Some are because it honestly looks worse to shave -- boob hair grows dark and deep, and I find that it looks creepier to have it be purely subdermal. Some I just don't care about, like my stomach.

Honestly, though, the only hair I shave for my *own* benefit is my chin, because otherwise I have a habit of tugging on those hairs while I'm thinking. Everything else has been because of someone else's comments -- making fun of my sideburns, asking about my mustache, taking me aside to gently explain that it's more ladylike to shave one's underarms. Societal pressure isn't a reason that anyone else should have to shave, and I wish it weren't mine.

I wish that I didn't even notice if other women were hairy. It makes me feel bad to even think about it, even though I don't think any less of them for it. The best I can think of to do about it is literally nothing -- not say anything, not make anyone feel like I notice or care. It doesn't show any particular bravery, but at least I hope it's not actively hurting anyone by making them self-conscious.
