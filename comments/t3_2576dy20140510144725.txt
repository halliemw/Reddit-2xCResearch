What part of my comment was insulting? o_O

There was a real issue with what you said in your 4th paragraph, I understand how you may not see it without any insight on this practice but some babies die, some lose their genitalia completely, and the ability to feel pleasure afterwards really depends on how much the person who carried out the procedure decided to remove. It makes guys [4.5 x more prone](http://www.yourlifechoices.com.au/news/circumcision-may-cause-erectile-dysfunction) to use erectile dysfunction drugs.

So I disagree that they should be treated separately except if you are on the ground in Africa talking to women about it, but then again when you find yourself in this situation, you have a 100% chance of being in a community where men are cut as well. The first one enables the other. Western cultural superiority is not the good way to approach this problem IMHO. Bodily integrity for children/vulnerable people is and it encompasses both practices which is why I asked you what would be wrong with this approach. "Don't chop off your children's body parts, they might want them in the future..." - something along those lines...I guess it will take time to get there though.
