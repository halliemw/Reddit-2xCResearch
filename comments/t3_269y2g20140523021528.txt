from a medical standpoint, i don't think a plastic surgeon will have a problem with it as long as you have a good EKG and a clearance from your pcp.  it may very well help out with your back pain.  if you have good insurance, physical therapy is also probably a good option to try as long as exercise doesn't exacerbate your joint and back pain
