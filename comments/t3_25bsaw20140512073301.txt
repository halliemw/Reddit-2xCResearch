I emailed my priest-confessor this morning. He's married and has two kids, so maybe he knows what the other side of the story is (?); plus my husband is on the church council, so maybe Fr. has talked to hubs and heard more about his issues. I'm hoping, since he'll understand my opposition to divorce he'll be unlikely to say "leave the bum", etc. It was all I could think to do, since it's over a year now, and it's just getting so hard.
