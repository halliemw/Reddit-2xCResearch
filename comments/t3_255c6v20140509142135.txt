> Don't white knight

How do you mean? I don't quite follow if you are refering to just mansplaining, which I can understand as being wrong or sticking up for someone who has a valid point [is that what white Knighting is? Men sticking up for women when they have a valid point?] in which case it would be fine [right?], because I would stick up for them regardless of their gender. Sorry, but as a newcomer to this sub, I wanna clear up any potential misunderstandings early on so I can be a positive part of this community.
