I don't have one.  I get that they don't usually mean to be patronizing, and I don't generally go for snark because it tends to shut people down to input and get them on the defensive rather than keeping them open to what I have to say, so it's always been difficult to point out that a comment is insulting without coming across as someone irrational, oversensitive, or much too "politically correct" (and these are often what someone willing to use "cute" in this scenario would label me as).  The truly withering look usually gets a, "What?  I meant that as a compliment!" which is sort of a lead-in to a friendly discussion of why it's a really backhanded compliment and utterly patronizing.  Asking whether or not he'd make the same comment to another dude (I have never once had "cute" used this way at me by another woman) usually helps to get the point across.
