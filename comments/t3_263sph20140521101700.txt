Have you ever had an ultrasound and been to a urologist? It worries me that you have had so many UTIs before you became sexually active. If not, go to a doctor and ask about it. There could be nothing wrong, but sometimes chronic UTIs can be caused by structural abnormalities.

1) ALWAYS PEE AFTER SEX. This is SO important! Keep yourself well-hydrated, because if you do, then you should be able to go before and after sex. If you try, and you absolutely can't go, then hop in the shower and wash your vulva with soap and water. DO NOT douche. 

2) When you use the bathroom, always wipe front to back. If you wipe back to front, you're dragging bacteria into your urinary tract. Make sure you only wipe front to back.

3) General hygiene. Wash your vuvla with soap and water every day. Once again, this does NOT involve douching. Just make sure you're keeping those outer surfaces clean.

4) You can take cranberry pills. They help prevent UTIs, and some people find them helpful.

5) SEE A DOCTOR. Sometimes a helpful option is to go on low-dose antibiotics for a few months to prevent UTIs. I know you had a bad experience with some other antibiotic you were on, but there are a few options here. If you talk to a doctor about it, they can put you on a different antibiotic. Also, this is a *low dose* that you can take every day, or every time you have sex. The lower dose should cause fewer side effects. Some people stop having UTIs altogether after they finish this months-long course of antibiotics.

Good luck!
