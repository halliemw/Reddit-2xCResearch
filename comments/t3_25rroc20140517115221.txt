People rape uteruses?

I think the context is pretty clear, even if you didn't know anything about the recent abortion battles in Texas. Anyone remotely familiar with America in general and the South in particular (and Texas specifically) would probably get that "Come and Take It" isn't actually an invitation, especially when it occurs under a big "#StandWithTexasWomen" hashtag.
