>But each time I feel really reluctant/uncomfortable/gross afterward.

Honestly, I don't see that consent is the issue here and if it was it's ambiguous at best. You don't need to define someone as a rapist in order to end the relationship including further contact with him. If you do, you have other problems that you absolutely need to deal with that have nothing to do with his behavior (even though you're using it as a catalyst) and everything to do with why you're uncomfortable asserting yourself.

Why would you keep doing this when it makes you feel bad about yourself? In this case I don't think it's about what he's doing (which is pretty fucked up), it's about how you're responding to it. This almost has to be affecting you in other aspects of your life.
