Huh, that explains why my department was nearly all married couples! And of the few who weren't married to a fellow CS professor, a bunch were married to professors in other departments. I always thought it was strange they had so many couples considering how hard tenure-track positions are to find. (And I know at least a few of them married in grad school, so it wasn't like they met through work.)
