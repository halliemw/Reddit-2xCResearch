I know right?? It seems like we either have to accept their unwanted advances or we are somehow undesirable. I am still a female character simply because I don't want to let harassment (again, would like to state I do not believe all men do this) scare me away from my right to be a woman. You go girl for being a happily married woman! A nerd is a badge of honor in my book.
