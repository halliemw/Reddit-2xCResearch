> I don't mean to come off like a man-hater or anything.

Then please don't generalize. You're dealing with a self-selecting sample of men here. There are lots of good guys out there. But they don't walk up to a woman they don't know, in a store, and strike up a conversation.

> I know that society suppresses men within their sexuality in a similar way that in suppresses women in the confirmation of their abilities. It's hard to blame guys completely for their conditioning, but it doesn't make the issue any easier to deal with.

I blame them. The men you are dealing with are playing a numbers game. They don't care how many women they offend, as long as they are successful with one (and they don't care whether they offend her, either). Some people call these guys "the seduction community". I call them jerks. Go right ahead and blame them; your frustration is certainly justified. Just don't blame *all* men for the asshole behavior of a few.
