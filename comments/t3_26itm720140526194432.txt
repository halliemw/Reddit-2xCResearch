It's really embarrassing, I basically got up one morning and looked at myself in the mirror and noticed a little bit of a bump on my stomach that was not there before. I am really paranoid, so whenever I think I could be pregnant, I take a test. So I went out and bought a few tests, all came up positive. The doctor confirmed it afterwards.
