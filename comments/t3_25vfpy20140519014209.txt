>after the baby is born, it's not like you get to go critique their parenting. 

you can actually, in a case in my state the surrogate sued to get back custody of the child after she determined that the adoptive parents were batshit crazy and she won. 

in Washington state if you give birth to it, it's yours. we treat surrogates the same as any mother giving her child up for adoption.
