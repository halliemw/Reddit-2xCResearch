Now this I agree with. Making it equally acceptable for both parents to take time off would be beneficial for everyone. That said, the article talks about the need for more doctors to be hired and that those already employed need to work more hours. The last thing I want as a patient is to have anything but a well-rested doctor. The author does insinuate that that solution to our doctor shortage lies in the gender of the doctors hired, which is what angers me.
