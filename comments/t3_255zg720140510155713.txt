Sorry about the wait - chemo messes with me a bunch, unfortunately.  

Again, I think you have some great advice - especially about the connection between how I feel about my wife, and what that can mean to her.   It makes all the sense in the world, but is just something that I hadn't thought of. :)

Thank you so much for telling me about hugging your kids.  I loved the description of your daughters reaction!
