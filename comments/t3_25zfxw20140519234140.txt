My friend gave me a book when we were 16 because even though I had had my period for two years at that point there were so many unanswered questions that I just couldn't bring myself to ask my mom. I can't remember the book, but I remember that it was SO helpful being able to sit in my room late at night and find answers to questions I had had for years. This book gets great reviews, so many it will help a bit?
