The hymen can break whenever it goddamned pleases, it seems. I didn't bleed from sex until years after I had my first (penetrative) experience. And one day, bam, blood. I thought it was my period, but it was way off in the cycle, and the bleeding stopped after a day. I can only assume it was the hymen.
