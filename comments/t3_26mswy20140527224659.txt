I think you're right, but I've also heard enough stories from guys about being scared by constant, violent and dark impulses in high school/college that it seems grappling with these impulses is a normal-ish rite of passage. I mean, I didn't go through it, but I knew enough guys that kept "lists" in high school that I don't think it's uncommon. I imagine these impulses only start to get dangerous when you're actually crazy.
