I'm so sorry. I lost my father when I was 10, so I know how it feels to have this permanent sense of loss and longing. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend "The loss that is forever", a book about the lifelong impact of the early loss of a parent. We are in good company, many very famous and accomplished people share our circumstance. Best wishes to you on this Mother's Day.
