When they said 2-4 instances, the admins were referring specifically to reports sent as a message to /r/reddit.com  Reports sent by pressing "report" underneath the PM don't trace back as clearly to a specific subreddit, so they were addressing specifically complaints relating to /r/twoxchromosomes-related activity.

The mod team takes part of the blame here.  We weren't aware that the admins preferred reports to be sent as modmail to /r/reddit.com, and encouraged people to just hit report.  When that comment came out, we initially weren't sure what they meant and what they were counting. We did know that there have definitely been more than 4 legitimate and distinct reports if you include all reporting methods, as the mod team alone has reported easily triple that many via the "report" button in the past 2 weeks.
