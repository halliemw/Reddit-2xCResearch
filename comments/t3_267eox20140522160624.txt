There are such things as toys that boys are more likely to want to play with and toys that girls are more likely to play with. That doesn't mean that those are the toys they're "supposed to" play with or "ought" to play with, but it does mean that boys and girls are not identical. (Also, every individual child is different anyway and an individual child shouldn't be constrained by the average properties of their gender.)

That said, there is good reason to think that there will never be nearly as many women in programming as there are men. The difference will always be very large. Here's an overview of why: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hb3oe7-PJ8&t=18m43s

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be doing everything we can to ensure equal opportunity and encourage people to pursue their interests whatever they may be, it just means that even after you do that there will still be a large gender gap because men and women are statistically different.
