I went through two or three generic pills over the last 8 years. Switched to progesterone pills after I started developing migraines. After 5 months I've had zero sex drive, painful acne on my chest and back, and I gained more than 10 lbs. No periods, just a week of increased bloating.

My partner is getting a vasectomy (after we move and put out fiances in check) but this pill has been so horrible, I decided I couldn't wait any longer. It's been a month as of today. Still no period and I've bern more tired than ever. The haze thing is true, though. I discovered while walking to work last week that I just feel lighter. Like little weights had been taken off my legs.

The mood thing is hard to gauge. I've had a lot of good things happen to me over the past two years but I have some kind of ptsd that drags me down, makes me space out and stay in bed too long sometimes. In this last month that I've been without bc pills I've had no problem getting out of bed.
