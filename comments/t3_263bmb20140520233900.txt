Signs on the roadside usually need permits. Check with your local government, but [here are Maryland's highway sign rules](http://www.roads.maryland.gov/pages/faqs.aspx?CatId=0&QId=27). If it is determined that those signs are not lawfully there, they'll be taken down by the town. It is possible that they are there legally, but you won't know until you ask.

I'm sorry.
