Your body will start producing hormones again once the shot wears off or the IUD comes out. The same with the pill. 

For some women, this takes a few months (it takes a few months to get a regular cycle again and to become fertile), for others it only takes a few weeks. But in all cases, your body's hormonal cycle will return and is not "made lazy" or "put into a coma" by a birth control method.
