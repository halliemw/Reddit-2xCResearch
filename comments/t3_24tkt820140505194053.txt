I had no idea that someone's reddit post about their partner with introverted tendencies allowed you to diagnose someone with a serious personality disorder... And by your description, you really know nothing about personality disorders. I don't mean to sound harsh, but people really shouldn't go around handing out labels to mental disorders unless they are licensed professionals.
