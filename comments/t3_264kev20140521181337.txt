If your child can't express their creativity through things that aren't clothing for 8 hours a day, they have bigger problems than clothes. And I hate to break it to those poor crushed spirits, but many adult jobs require you to wear a uniform, so it's not such a terrible idea to learn how to express yourself in other ways. The only valid point I think you have here is about gender, though I think there will always be something inherently gendered about clothing because of different shapes, at least after puberty hits.
