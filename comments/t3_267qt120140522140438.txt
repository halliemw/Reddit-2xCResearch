What would that say about a woman that a box of rubbers (often found in plain view in a guy's apartment in my experience) does not say about a man? My husband has no problem with me keeping a box of it in our shared bathroom cabinet, so at least one man on this planet is down with women in control of their own bodies >.>

This is exactly the sort of thing every woman should have laying around, just in case. Saying you shouldn't keep one on hand is like saying you don't need a spare tire in your car because hey, you don't want people to think you can change your own tire.
