I think it should be covered under "sick leave" Some women have such bad menses that they cannot go anywhere because it's too painful, or heavy, or it makes them sick. 

But a lot of workplaces just tell those women to suck it up, and treat it as though they are overreacting, or just trying to get days out of work.
