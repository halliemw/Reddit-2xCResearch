Agreed, BV sounds like a possibility, I've known friends who left it untreated for a while and just couldn't smell it anymore...but they kind of developed a cloud of funk that followed them around despite showering. In my experience (possibly TMI but anyway) taste is more reliable than smell if you suspect that kind of imbalance.
