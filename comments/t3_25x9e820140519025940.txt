Great to see you tackle the issue, and I agree that the most effective way to get on top of it is to get guys to call each other out when they see someone behave badly. 

Of course, I'm not there and I haven't read the Tab, so this is an outsider's perspective. That said, I think what you've written may not achieve your aims as well as you're hoping. 

For example, in answer to the question of why the workshops are compulsory, I would be more inclined to ask how many people had sex ed where none of this kind of stuff was covered. In that context, mandatory workshops might make sense - after all, you should already know this stuff, but if you've never had the opportunity to learn it, that may need to happen here.

And it also seems like you're conflating lad culture with the concept of homosociality, which is the formal term for non-romantic male relationships, and the basis of what you're talking about when you say guys need to call each other out. Like I said, I agree that unless guys call each other out, we won't get very far - it's a sad fact that a lot of guys out there don't respect the opinions of women, which is why we need organisations like Men Can Stop Rape. And I think that's the key - you need to take a step back and talk about the fact that a lot of guys don't respect women. Because if they don't respect them, why would they consider their consent important? *That's* really what this is about - understanding that a woman's opinion is just as valuable as a guy's. 

Blech - I don't think this is a coherent as I'd like, but I hope you get my point(s) anyway. :)
