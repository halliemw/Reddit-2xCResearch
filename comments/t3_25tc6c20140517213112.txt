The office of student conduct and integrity (which is one person who reviewed my case with the equal opportunities counsel).  I'm not sure if they have a law degree.  I've been googling the person who made the decision, but I can't find anything.
I'm sorry, I don't really understand the next question.
Okay, I'll see what I can do come Monday. Thank you!
