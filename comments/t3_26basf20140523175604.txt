In the immediate sense: my prom is next week and I'm so excited! I'm going with an awesome friend of mine, and I absolutely adore the dress and shoes I bought. :D

Slightly more long-term: in just a couple of months, I'll be attending my first year of university. I am thrilled to be going to university and living on my own, and I can't wait to actually start studying electrical engineering.
