This was beautifully put. You didn't ask for advice or suggestions, so feel free to ignore this, put could you perhaps reach out to people who were her friends? Uncles? Aunts? Even after all this time, I'm sure there are many other people out there who miss her and would love to talk about her.  You will of course never have the real experience of fully knowing her, but perhaps you could get some kind of image of her, from others that loved her.
