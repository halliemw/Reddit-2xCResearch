They're not necessarily unpopular IRL, just on these specific subreddits.  For example, Teavana is a wildly popular and successful store.  It would seem that the popular opinion is that its a good place to buy tea.  Paleo eating styles are huge right now, so just counting calories at this moment isn't "popular."  

It doesn't make either opinion right.  They're opinions held by people whose life and choices and influences have led them to believe X.  Looking down on those who believe Y doesn't make anyone more right.  It just makes us different.
