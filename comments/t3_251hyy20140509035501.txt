Yep, they're called "Free Presbyterians" who left the church and set up their own because the normal Presbyterians weren't crazy enough.

Same is true here of Methodists, Baptists and any other number of "Free" churches full of nutters that needed a way to hate Catholics more.   As far as the Catholics go, while they are "quieter" about it, they pretty much have a view that Protestants are all guilty of apostasy and are going to hell.

This place has made me fully agnostic, and no doubt another few years here will make me full on atheist.
