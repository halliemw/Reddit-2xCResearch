You're sort of hand-waving my question here. You didn't address any aspect of the joke, you're just saying it's not comparable because of the twist. That's not true though, because the punchline isn't simply "you thought this was a sex joke but it's not!", the thing the statues are doing is in itself absurd.

In other words, this joke sprang surprise animal abuse on you. If you want to narrow the field of comparison here, a more similar joke would be a regular joke that sprung surprise racism on you. Now the argument put forth is that finding a racist joke funny makes you racist, so then it follows that finding a joke about animal abuse funny makes you an animal abuser, or that you think animal abuse is acceptable. The logic is faulty.
