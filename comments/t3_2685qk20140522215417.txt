I have a friend that does this too!! I just wish people would actually tell me when they're upset with me. This friend (who I love dearly but this one trait about her drives me crazy) will just ignore me when she's mad at me. She won't talk, won't text, won't look me in the eyes, and will run out of the room as fast as she can. 

Eventually I'm always the one to be like "what happened?" But it's really annoying and I just wish she would tell me she's mad a me. :/
