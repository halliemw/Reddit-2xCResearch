Wanted to give my niece GoldieBlox for her birthday (she asked for a Barbie fairy with wings to draw on and I thought, we can do better than that!), but was very put off by the amount of negative Amazon reviews... a lot of people who really wanted to like it were very disappointed by the quality they received, as things semi-broke down or didn't fit and were limiting in creativity. [But see for yourself](http://www.amazon.com/Goldie-Blox-The-Spinning-Machine/dp/B00BCXU3PQ/)...
