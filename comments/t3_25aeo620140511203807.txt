I know they had a run in with the cops previously because one of their friends was arrested for raping another Saudi student at their school, and they've all been on the shit list since then for that and other smoking/drinking violations of the buildings lease but the rest of them seem to only take it as far as normal college partying goes. I'm actually moving next month, but I will definitely let the building managers know and talk to some of our neighbors.
