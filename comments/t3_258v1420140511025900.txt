I remember discussing the "tampons feel good" part with someone on reddit once long time ago. Someone was sure that we women would get aroused while inserting a tampon, or receive pleasure from it, like a dildo. I just told him that women are FAR from being aroused while inserting a tampon. It's just something you do. Not everything about vaginas is about sex and pleasure, and specially not about tampons and periods.
