I'm a female engineer and this is my struggle everyday. You're right. We do have a long way to go. 

Earlier this week I received a call from a man that was surprised I was a woman (because my name could be a woman's name or a man's name). He told me he was going to skip doing a certain test simply because it would take precious time out of his day. I told him no, you have to do it no matter how long it takes. He bitched at me for a half an hour until I couldn't take his complaining anymore. I told him I'd talk to my male supervisor about it. Once my supervisor confirmed what I had said he instantly shut up and agreed to perform the test. It's upsetting to know that if he had called a male engineer instead that he would have instantly respected them and wouldn't have tried to weasel his way out of doing a test.
