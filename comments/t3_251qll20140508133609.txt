I've been a member of this sub for a while and I never got the impression that it is about feminism.  It is a sub for women, about women, and women issues.  People post here about their experiences with sexual assault, their periods, relationships, body image, or just to seek advice or share happy events in their lives with other women.  Yes, every so often a link to an article about feminism (or a related topic) may pop up, but it is certainly not the norm, as far as I see it.

What I always liked best about this subreddit is the supportive nature of the community.  We don't troll each other, we don't shame, we don't put each other down.  We may disagree but we are mostly polite about it.

Just want to point out that when I say that this sub is for women, I don't mean that men are not welcome here.  Not at all.  Men have always been welcomed to this sub, and their viewpoints are appreciated, as long as they respect the fact that this sub is a supportive community.
