This is old data, but it probably comes from this: http://www.statcrunch.com/5.0/viewreport.php?reportid=7996

If there was no wage gap, women on average would be doing less work for the same pay since the average woman (as of 2009) worked 35.6 hours per week vs 41.3 hours per week for the average man. (The BLS data is the same, but I don't know what year it is from). If men and women were being paid the same, and the only difference was these work hours we would see a wage gap of 86 cents to the male dollar.
