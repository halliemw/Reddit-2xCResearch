I've read these opinions before and never quite understood, but the discussion in this thread helped me finally understand what the problem is. Thanks everyone, this is why I lurk on TwoX. And don't anybody feel like discussing the same thing over and over again is pointless, some people like me have thick skulls and need to hear it a few times.
