I totally realized that and it's been edited. Thank you for the input. I totally feel you on the period thing. I hid mine under my bed and my grandma felt so bad for me that she had a chat with my mom when she came home, which probably helped prepare the both of us for the impending talk about "becoming a woman". I cried and I remember my mother asking me if I was scared, and I realized that was EXACTLY what i was feeling. The fact that she said it was ok to be afraid really helped me feel validated about my fears about a lot of things surrounding my changing body. Thanks for sharing. 

EDIT: I say "totally" a lot.....
