Teach your daughter a skill- I have fond memories of fishing and cross-country skiing. Don't assume that she isn't interested in a skill because it's seen as masculine - I wish my dad taught me woodworking like he did my brother. Best of luck; it sounds like you are already headed in the right direction.
