Downvoted to hell, creepy PMs, your inbox getting filled with people telling you that you only stated your gender because you want attention, shit like that. Either that, or we get positive attention for no reason. Basically you get treated much differently for better or for worst when you let slip your gender. I'd rather not have to deal with either.
