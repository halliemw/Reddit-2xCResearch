There are so many goddamn rape scenes in movies and shows now.  I officially can't watch game of thrones anymore because every episode there's 1-3 rape scenes and I can't handle having flashbacks and panic attacks every fifteen minutes. I mean, I understand a couple throughout the show for realism and and plot, but when it's all the fucking time and it's done so that the breasts and body are exposed in the most seductive way for the viewer, it seems like they are turning the whole thing into a constant, pornographic experience.
