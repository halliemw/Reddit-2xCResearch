> or a soldier

Don't even get me started on the military industrial complex.  Bunch of pawns thinking they're going in as Captain America and coming out as Captain Ben Willard.  Poor teens fighting for corrupt rich men who don't fight for them.  I'd be in support of our troops if they defended our country, rather than oppressed others.

There's nothing sadder than a person who takes their office job (there are a lot of important jobs out there, most aren't), or our false economy seriously.  

Out of curiosity, are you at work right now?
