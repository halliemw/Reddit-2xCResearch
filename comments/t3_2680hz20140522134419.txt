Hm I understand, you don't want superficial encounters.

I get that, but some people are superficial, as you aknowledge that yourself, everyone is different, some people only talk to others that they feel physically atracted to, its how they either preffer to be or just are, maybe its a choice, maybe it isn't.

Do you want them to change? (I feel like I'm oversimplifying this, sorry)
