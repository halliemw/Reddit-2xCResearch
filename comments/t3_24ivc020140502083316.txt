Even if sexims was a first world problem, then this type of behaviour would still be disrespectful towards you. A respectful partner would notice that this is an important issue to you and treat it with corresponding tact. In contrast, your partner agressively discourages you from mentioning it at all while at the same time bringing it up in disparaging ways. If he was really fact-oriented, then he himself would have already looked around for arguments (on both sides). It doesn't sound like he is trying to have a mature discussion but instead is baiting you, either for laughs or because he can feel superior in 'knowing better' than you.
