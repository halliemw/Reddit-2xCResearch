There is a little more to it then that, unfortunately "playing hard to get" is a thing, and so often people with poor social skills assume that excuses are offered to be worked around and if they are persistent then maybe you'll accept their advances.


Saying "I have a boyfriend" cuts all that off because they only real way around that is "well dump him/cheat on him" and even people with very poor social skills will recognize that as conversational suicide.
