I'm about the same height and weight (6', 165 lbs, size 10/12). Just because of my different shape I have and never will have the thigh gap. I'm pear shaped and most of my body fat and muscle is in my thighs so my thighs are thick. This is with me doing vigorous exercise 5 days a week. Even when I was a competitive swimmer in high school when I spent 2 hours a day in the pool (and had not yet fully filled out my curves) I didn't have a thigh gap. 

So many of these standards are so unrealistic for most people and I think the trick is to realize that. I take care of my body and I love it but I will never be model skinny. Hell at my height my skeleton alone wouldn't ever fit into a size 6/8.
