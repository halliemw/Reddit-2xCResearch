> I'm pretty sure you were just being internet brave and didn't mean to compare women to property.

I didn't. I offered an example of the use of gun laws in Texas. I never said it had anything to do with OP's specific situation. I, too, am a woman, and I have to deal with this shit all the time, and you know what? It doesn't do any good to get depressed over it. I've been there, it just made my life miserable. I'm choosing to be light hearted over a bad situation, and if you're not ready to do that yet, that's not my problem. Everyone deals with their pain in different ways, so I'll thank you not to scold me for my own coping mechanisms. I have as much a right to them as anyone else.
