I love my cup. If you want to pm me with more questions feel free. They can be worn for twelve hours safely so no pocket issues. 

Size is based on the brand. Some have two some have more. Go to their site and look at what they say. I'm bigger too and that may mean you will need a bigger size but since you are young maybe not. Look at their size charts and comparative ones found online. 

Divacup and Mooncup are the big US brands. I have a Mooncup and two MeLunas which are German. They are all good brands. Meluna has the most in terms of size options but you have to order it online. I did. Nbd. But the traditional choices I listed are also great. 

I have minimal cramps but I get sore. Cotton absorbs all moisture. Sore, dry, bad. Cups hold, not absorb. I noticed less pain in that respect. 

They seal when inside but no pressure is felt and when you take it out you easily break that seal, also pain free. 


You never really need to change them in public. You can wear it longer than tampons so minimal need and no need to change every bathroom break. Twice a day is more than enough for most folks flows. I change it when I get up and again when I get back from work. If you do, empty it, wipe it with tp and put it back in. Clean it more intensely later. That isn't a problem. 

I trimmed my stem so it's round. But you can cut it off. The cup is easily grabbed on its own. But if you leave the stem you won't feel it. Cut it to suit you and what you feel comfortable with. 

I can't feel it at all. I could feel tampons and their pressure from expanding after a few hours. No feeling it. Easy to get in and out. I never struggled. At all. I expected to a little. I didn't. 

You would need to talk to your doc about cups and IUDs. 

I truly love my cup. Less cost. Less waste. Less hassle. Do your research. But it's a great option and not gross like some may think.
