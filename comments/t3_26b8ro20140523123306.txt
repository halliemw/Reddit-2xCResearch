Yes, I saw the interview with one of the mods and was a bit surprised when they admitted to not being concerned with subscriber input. I think whether or not a petition will have the desired effect is questionable, but I also think that it would be a good opportunity for the users to finally have a sort of input into the situation. 

Do you feel like there is no point of input at this time then? Thank you for taking the time for responding.
