I had to testify in front of a grand jury after being mugged once.  It is definitely a little unnerving, but wasn't too bad.  The prosecutor should run you through everything that is going to happen, including what they are going to ask, so there are not any surprises.  The prosecution is just trying to lay out the most essential facts of the case, and in my case the defense was not permitted to do a cross examination.  The whole process wound up being very quick.  The guy wound up pleading out after he was indicted so I never had to testify at trial.  I imagine that would be much worse.
