He'll know not to trust everyone who claims to be on birth control. There are other women like you out there that put their own desires above the health of others (and sometimes themselves) and he should be aware of the situation he was involved in. You don't even have to tell him you got pregnant if you don't want to. To me, that's not even the most important part. You've already decided to abort and pay for it.
