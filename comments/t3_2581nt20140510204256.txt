Actually, there is an increased risk of an ectopic pregnancy with both tubal ligation and an IUD:

"Tubal pregnancy was more likely to occur among IUD users than among women using oral contraceptives [relative risk (RR) = 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-9.9] or barrier methods (RR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.6-8.1), or, to a lesser extent, among women who had been surgically sterilized (RR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.8-3.5)."

I certainly would recommend one before tying tubes personally, but since I have neither a vagina nor a medical degree my opinion doesn't really matter.
