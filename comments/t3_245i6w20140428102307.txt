Hi there. I'm 5'11" and know exactly how your daughter feels.  It feels weird and awful to be looming over everyone else and if she's proportionate or proportionate+, she will just be wider and *bigger* too.  

One thing that helped me was something that my dad told me when I was in high school. We were in Mongolia and I was feeling awful because I was like a tripleXL in their clothing. I felt so out of place. He told me that it wasn't fair to compare myself to them because we were different species. That they were gazelles and I was an elk, and an elk can want to be a gazelle all she wants, but it won't ever happen.  And yes it doesn't get to the issues that society thinks that gazelles are prettier than elks, but it helped me in some weird way.

Could you involve her in crew? Volleyball might serve the same function, but there was something about being in a boathouse where I was on the short end, where the doorknobs and counters and chairs are all at a "proper" height, that felt amazing. Where my height (and muscle mass/weight) was treasured and I could feel how *good* it was to be shaped the way I was.  

Just make sure she keeps her good posture.
