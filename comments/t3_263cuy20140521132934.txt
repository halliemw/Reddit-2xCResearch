It is possible to have good platonic friendships with guys even if they have hit on you at some point. Just clarify your position and hang out! I had a lot of guy friends in college, some of them had crushes on me at some point (or vice versa) but they were pretty valuable friendships and some of the most supportive people I knew. The crush factor doesn't make it impossible.
