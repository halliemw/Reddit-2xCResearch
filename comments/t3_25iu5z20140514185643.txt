well I feel a little comfortable about using the word "fishing". I was under the impression that this is a supportive community no matter what, and yes I posted because I, just as every other human being, need to be told things are okay. Fishing has a manipulative connotation to it, which I don't think was present in my intentions. I'm not pretending to play victim, I own up to what I did. 

appreciate your two cents, don't particularly appreciate "fishing"

edit: **present in my intentions to post this
