Well, I certainly hope that we can expect more of these snobbish, chiding posts in the future.

Look, different people get different things out of this sub. When there's change, some of them are going to be unhappy. That's their right and opinion. It's the way of things as they evolve. Those people will leave and form a new community.

But it's not really cool to be 'disappointed' in them or to look down on them for it. They have valid concerns.
