You are absolutely right, maybe I didn't word my point correctly. I had one myself and it was probably the most responsible decision I ever made, but you are right when you say it's a completely different experience for every woman and I don't think the girl in this video is filming it to show everyone how "cool" it is or how righteous it is of her to get an abortion, but simply stating that you shouldn't  feel guilty for not feeling guilty. I am all for that!
