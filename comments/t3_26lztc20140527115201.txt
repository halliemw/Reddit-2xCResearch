Asserting boundaries is fine. And those boundaries will be different for everyone. Personally, I love flirting. I flirt with both my male and female friends. My friends are attractive and I enjoy their company. I'm also a touchy person. I love hugging, touching, hand-holding, cheek kisses, shoulder rubs, whatever. The difference is that both touch and flirting isn't intended to titillate.  
Flirting is just my way of saying "hey you look good", and physical touch is just my way of saying "I like you". I don't do it to get off, and would feel uneasy if my guy friends popped a boner or if my female friends got wet from our interactions.  
I keep things light-hearted and fun. I have had to be up front with friends before (I'm a very blunt person) and will say things like "Hey, just need you to know I'm in a stable monogamous relationship so there better not be any funny business!"... And if lines are crossed, we discuss it, as friends, and talk about what we perceive as inappropriate or what makes us uncomfortable.  
All relationships require maintenance and good communication.  I don't find relationships with my male friends are much different than those with my female friends. Everyone is different and everyone has a different threshold of acceptability and appropriateness. Mine are very loose and are based on what I know my partner would find inappropriate. I respect my friends boundaries and I expect them to respect mine and my partner's.
