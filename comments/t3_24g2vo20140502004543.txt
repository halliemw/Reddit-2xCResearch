I can tell you right now that I have never, ever seen an ugly pair of legs on anyone in my life. That's just not really something you look at and think, "wow, not cute," you know? 

But, there's a few ways to go about loving your legs if you're not convinced. One, workout. I've noticed that even if I don't make any personal records or anything, just working out makes me view my body as beautiful because I know what it's capable of. Defined legs are also very sexy regardless.

Two, get some killer heels! Maybe I'm biased because that has sometimes been my solution to any problem, but heels also have a way of making legs look incredible and making me feel badass. Also, if you don't have a fav pair of heels yet that's just blasphemy and needs to be fixed right away.
