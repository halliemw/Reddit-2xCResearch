From a 43-28-44, try a. [wrap dress](http://m.target.com/p/mossimo-women-s-long-sleeve-wrap-dress-assorted-colors/-/A-14616994). Professional, comfortable, hides the insane hips and bust without being uber baggy. And I go to Nordstrom Rack to pick up James or Paige denim at a lower cost. Also try finding a mid-rise denim. High waist is back in. And hides butt crack.    
    
Also, the Gap has some great wide leg professional pants that are decent priced and machine washable. Old Navy is owned by the same corporation and carries the same cuts at an even better price.
