So then do you believe that in EVERY rape case, there is no need for a safety net to protect possible assailants against false accusations and life ruining consequences from a verdict based solely on hearsay? 

Do you believe that the default sentence for EVERY rape case should be the maximum regardless of the level of physical and psychological harm afflicted upon the victim? 

Do you believe that the rights of EVERY person accused of rape are exceptions to the basic constitutional rights provided by the United States Constitution?
