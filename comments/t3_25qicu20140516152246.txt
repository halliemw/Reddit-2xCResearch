Also, I just want to point out that this was just a call for dialogue, and it's been downvoted a bunch already. so far mainly by women who seem pissed i dared to ask for a conversation. Probably by a few men as well who don't want it to take place. but the female reaction to this has been less that optimal. The guys i can understand, but wouldn't you want this discussion to happen? Why would you downvote such a thing, or add comments that are obviously hostile.
