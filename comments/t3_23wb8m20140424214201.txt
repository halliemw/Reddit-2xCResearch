Yep. I generally don't do anything but shave the bikini line in the summers, but when I go to the doctor, I always at least trim. My SO prefers me hairy or completely smooth, but I don't stay smooth for more than 12 hours so I don't even try. It's a lot of effort for zero payoff, so my vulva is generally as hairy as my head, but when I go to the doctor, I shave. Comparing everyday you to me at my annual appointment is pointless.
