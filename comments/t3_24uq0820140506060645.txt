6 days a month is a lot! 

Especially when many people do not enjoy sex on their period that knocks out a week. That leaves nearly 1/3 of the time you have sex you could be ovulating. 

Perhaps you're so surprised because you have a low sex drive, but there are many people that have sex 5-7 times a week. Obtaining for 2 weeks a month isn't really an option, especially as women with irregular cycles can never be really sure when they're ovulating. 

Some women are also more fertile than others. From a very very young age my mother warned me to be careful because she never "tried" to have kids. She was pregnant 4 times and each child was conceived within the first two months. My sister has had similar success with her two children. They also both had freakishly quick births. Now, for all I know I could be infertile as I've never attempted to have children but with stories like that it's easy to imagine an accident happening.
