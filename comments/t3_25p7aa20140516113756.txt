i think that some of these core people decided that 'we went default, this place will turn to shit' and maybe since it didn't go to shit immediately, they felt the need to prove themselves right in a way 'Did you see? did you see all the random downvoting! see i TOLD you this place would go to shit!'

is it a stretch? maybe, but i wouldn't put it past them.
