You did nothing wrong.  Your parents have made it perfectly clear that they don't care about you or your well being.  You are better off never contacting them again.  They burned that bridge.  Your mother could attempt to fix it by divorcing your father, but that won't happen.  It's best to start over, as much as that sucks.
