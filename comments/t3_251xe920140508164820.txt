I think part of what you can do is talk about you expectations from counselling, what you want help with and what you want the outcome to be. This is pretty much the first thing they have you talk about in counselling, so its very useful to give it some thought before hand.

   You can talk about wanting to be better parents, providing a calmer home to your child with less fighting, communicating better, and generally learning to be happier and less irritated by each other. Probably bringing up how much how you love your husband and want the to feel more secure in your relationship.
