I tried to avoid that, as it tends to derail the topic. Short version is I do not believe I have ever experienced love, and am unwilling to put forth the necessary effort to maintain what I'm told is a healthy romantic relationship.

I am however very friendly, and affectionate in the bedroom. Because of the conflicting messages this can send, I try to be brutally honest about my complete lack of long-term prospects for any potential sexual partners.

And that's... Pretty much where we're at. Hope that helps?
