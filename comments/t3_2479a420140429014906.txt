Almost any description of a complex and ubiquitous social issue which is less than 1,000 pages long will end up being 'an overly-simplistic and inaccurate framing of a much more complex reality.'  I acknowledge that as a de facto limitation of human language and thought, while also acknowledging that some short summaries are less inaccurate and more useful than others.

Do you have any *specific* objections to, or improvements upon, this list?
