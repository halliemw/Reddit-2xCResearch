I can imagine it would be annoying when your relationship is legit, that's also a problem when people are quick to judge. I think for the most part, you can tell that a couple is together because of their genuine feelings for each other, the ones that are more forced (such as ones with sexpats), you can see their awful behaviours, the way they treat the women they're with (whether it's many or one-on-one), how the girl behaves, etc.. This is just the context I have being in Southeast Asia. Back in North America, it's not something that would cross my mind.
