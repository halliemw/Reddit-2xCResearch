Honestly, I think the article struck a nerve with that user because it went against a firmly held belief.  This stuck out to me:
 
> This is a huge generalization about an entire sex. 

Followed by:

> Women are just passive aggressive where as men are generally straight forward.
  
/u/ptc4015 doesn't like generalizations yet... generally, men are straightforward?  Is this user a troll??
