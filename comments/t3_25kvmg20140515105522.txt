If the police don't find enough evidence to convict (or you don't file charges) and the accused suffers from the accusation, it is most certainly libel in the full purpose of the term. 

It works the same as libel for a company. For example, I can complain of sexism at my company but, if I cost the company value from my public accusations (loss of market value, lost contract value, etc) AND their isn't enough hard evidence of corporate wrongdoing, then the company can and will sue me for every dime I cost them. 

Libel is a legal structure. If you accuse someone rape but can't prove it, they can sue you if they suffer from the accusation (e.g. the Duke lacrosse scandal).

tl/dr: Report EVERY crime when it happens.
