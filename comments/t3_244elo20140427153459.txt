As mentioned, it's really a trial and error sort of thing. Some things to keep in mind: 

Do you have insurance? If not, birth control can be pricy and I'd begin my search with one on a discount drug list. Walmart has several for $9/month http://www.walmart.com/cp/4-Prescriptions/1078664 and most  retailers with discount drug lists have around the same offerings. 

How responsible are you? All birth control takes discipline but some are more forgiving than others. Progestin-only mini pills have fewer side effects for many girls but take longer to take effect and are much more likely to lead to accidental pregnancy if instructions aren't followed exactly or if something happens (like throwing up soon after taking). I take a combined pill that's "heavy duty" enough that I can actually miss an entire day and not need backup at all assuming I follow the directions. 

Are there any other symptoms that you're looking to decrease? Some pills help more than others with acne, unwanted hair, etc. 

One more thing to keep in mind is that there's a growing body of evidence that the progestin-only pills may not be nearly as effective in overweight women. Scary stuff. Right now I believe the evidence is only really conclusive for plan b but it's something I'd keep in mind until more literature is published
