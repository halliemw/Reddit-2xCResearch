>I might start crying because I want to hold him. 

This probably won't be well received here but this seems like such a strange thing to be upset about... have you tried talking to him? I don't see that you did anything wrong here. You are telling me you want this to blow over, but then you are also telling me that you are so upset you want to cry. What do you want him do to? What exactly are you looking for? 

>I'm upset that he is making me cry and feel bad over something I had planned and then completely neglecting to tell me that there was a lunch date planned.

This is completely rational. He should not be making you feel bad about going to that event. Was the lunch date planned or was it spontaneous?
