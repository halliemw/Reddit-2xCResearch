I absolutely love that film! You know what, if the genders were reversed and it was a film about men going on a road trip and doing stupid stuff then it would just be considered a good comedy but because its women its thought of as a stupid guilty pleasure film. Well screw that, I think its hilarious and I don't feel guilty about it. :) I mean its rated at a 5 on IMDB, but is it really any worse/stupider than Road Trip which is rated at 6.5?
