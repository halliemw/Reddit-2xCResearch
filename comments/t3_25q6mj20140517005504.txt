I just want to say that I very, very seldom log on to my reddit account.  I'm just too darn lazy.  Also, I don't care about most things.  

But, when I saw this truly noble cat, and the touching account of his fearsomeness, as described by his faithful subjects, I was truly touched.

What a superb cat.  And what a great family you guys seem to be!
