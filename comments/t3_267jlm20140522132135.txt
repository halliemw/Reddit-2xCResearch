This is always the secret, Octavia.  What you (and the wife) may not get is the reason for the extreme guilt.  There are usually thoughts and actions that the person regards with true fear and guilt, they want forgiveness for whatever it is.

In my fundamentalist branch of the family, alcoholism, sexual acting-out and other "sins" are well-recorded among the ancestors who committed themselves to evangelical, fundamentalist churches.  In order to stop embezzling, for example, one family member responded well to threats of hell fire (including retreats in which men of the church held his feet to a literal fire to remind him what torture awaited him if he continued to sin).

Everyone agrees that the embezzling was a bad thing, and after becoming increasingly religious (read:  hanging out only with other church members, becoming more and more reclusive, losing his job, etc), this family member never embezzled again.  He ended up living with his adult child and working hard on his son's property to redeem himself.  They rarely spoke, but the man was finally able to be fully religious and untempted by money.
