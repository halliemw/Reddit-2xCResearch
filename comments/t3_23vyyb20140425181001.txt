Well yeah, I never said anything about what I thought the outcome should be in any given case. I wholeheartedly think that survivors should report things to the police because they are better equipped to investigate, but what I wanted to clarify is that universities don't have to report incidents to the police and I don't think they should have to. Survivors should have that choice. 

I've just noticed that too many people think universities aren't doing their jobs because they aren't reporting matters to the police, and that isn't how it works.
