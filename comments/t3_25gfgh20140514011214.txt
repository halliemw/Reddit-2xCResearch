One thing I really admire about Lena Dunham is that she REALLY dresses herself down for Girls to fit her character. In one episode her best friend criticizes her behind her back for not doing her makeup right, for example. Even in episodes where her character Hannah is really done up, she doesn't look as good as Lena Dunham looks in interviews or events when she's done up. So while I agree that on the show she's "average," I personally think she's very pretty.

(On a semi-unrelated note, it makes sense for her to be one of the leads in Girls because she got the deal at HBO partially based on her movie, Tiny Furniture, where she plays a character similar to Hannah. So she'd proven herself a bit as an actress.)
