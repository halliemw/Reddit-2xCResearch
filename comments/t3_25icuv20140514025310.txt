No , it's not rape but itis still sexual assault. And if you wouldn't say it to. Rape victim you shouldn't say it to a sexual assault victim either. 

The same psychological mechanisms of defense take place. Either you expect women ti fight back all the time or you just allow them to react as they are and not blame them for itbecause often they cannot help it.
