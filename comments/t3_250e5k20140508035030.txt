The wording's kind of ambiguous - it definitely restricts shaving part of your head, but not necessarily the whole head. And as I don't think the army would consider a shaved head "trendy" (I mean, they traditionally shave guys' heads), I doubt that sentence is meant to include a completely shaved head.
