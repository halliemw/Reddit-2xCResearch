Hey, I've loved this whole thread but I wanted to point out something that was helpful to me. You mentioned compulsive nail biting--it's something I do too when I am very stressed. It's a kind of impulse control/obsessive compulsive behavior (sorry, [wikipedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatophagia)) which means--you're not gross. You're anxious, and it's probably a big chunk of why you have a hard time making lasting connections. You might want to talk to a therapist--you deserve to be comfortable in your skin.
