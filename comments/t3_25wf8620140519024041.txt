When I was 15/16, I lived in a very deprived area. All my friends were getting pregnant, and it kind of seemed like that was the thing to do. I was also struggling in school at the time due to my dyslexia. My mum sat me down one day, and said "the best contraception is ambition". She talked honestly and openly about sex, and even though I was still a virgin at the time, we decided I should go on the pill just to be safe. I'm now about to graduate with first class honours from one of the best universities in the UK. While I'm not disparaging teen mothers, my mum's advice made me see that I had options. My friends love their children, but I'm glad that I now have a life where I can see the world and do what I want to do, when I want to do it.
