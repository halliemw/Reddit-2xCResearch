If it was an optional thing added onto admin-training/relevant talks/etc, I would be ecstatic. If it's mandatory, that's a bit weird. I am just getting started in the world of makeup and I rarely wear it out of my house. I lack confidence in my low ability right now, but I also do it mostly for myself. (What happens if I do X? How does my face look if I try Y color?) Hell, I often  do it at the end of the night, just playing with colors. Getting personal advice would be amazing, as long as I got to choose to do it.
