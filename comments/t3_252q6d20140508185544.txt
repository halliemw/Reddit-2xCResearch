This is a big reason why I think the mods could have handled this better. If they'd gotten out in front of it (e.g. a big public post on what the plan is and a place to address concerns and have a debate) then I think the sub could have held together better in the course of trying out being a default.

As it is, they left commenters to create a ton of pro & con threads, but didn't give any public notice of the plans or how subscribers should bring up concerns.
