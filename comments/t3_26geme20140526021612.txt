Its a weird place to be. I will give you that. Before I gained weight from children I didn't care what I looked like. Then suddenly it felt like a crushing weight from society that because I as fat I should just die. I don't even know what started it. I have been slowly trying to deal with it. Some people I know doesn't affect them at all. WHat does affect me is not being able to get a job, treated harshly and genrally made to feel like shit because I am not a size 0. I am not even that big. I am only 20 kgs over weight and if I really knuckle down I can lose it. Its hard as I am studying and raising a family. Healthy food is so expensive.
