I'm saving up for a fitbit and want to do some allergy testing when I get better insurance.

I think the support group will be the most important part for me. I have tried so many times and failed so many times...I just don't have a lot of close friends and my husband isn't "here" yet. He doesn't realize that we need to change  (he's as big as I am if not bigger).
