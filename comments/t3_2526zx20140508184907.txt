Most of us wish we had your courage. 

I'm a man who was raped by women, beaten and tortured by women...but that just taught me what abusive people of either gender are like. Those who are attacking you, want you to be scared. They want you to feel guilty. It's how abusers always work. It's all about using your mind and your conscience against you.

You have nothing to apologize for.

Look at their arguments-  they really want us to ignore the common sense observation that the majority of the posters raising Hell about a safe space for women's issues in a male dominated website are going to be men? C'mon, that would take a lobotomy. Those of us who have been supporting this community for years know we weren't included in that group. A lot of the better new arrivals understood your meaning, easy enough. 

Most of the men accusing you of sexism just don't like the idea that now there's a spotlight on them, and they're being asked to prove good faith, if they want to have a voice here. 

All you did, was give them fair warning.
