I don't think the problem is hitting on someone if you like them, wherever that might be, as long as you get the hint when someone is not interested. 

There's a huge difference between harassing someone, and try to flirt.

Please. It's not gross if someone gives out a compliment. A simple thank you, and going on with your work should suffice if you're not interested, that's not awkward, not for you, not for him. Things change when he continues, though. But, just a compliment like the second example should really not be a problem.
