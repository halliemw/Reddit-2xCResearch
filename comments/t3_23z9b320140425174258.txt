Yep, mine destroyed my couch, my mattress and dust ruffle, my shoe chair, my blinds, my carpet, my feet, and my arms.  They're 7 years old now and still intent on making all my suitcases look like cat-scratching-posts.  When I have to pick my bags up from baggage claim, that's how I recognize them.  They're the ones all covered in cat fur and looking like they've been mauled to death.

But then they curl up in your lap or snuggle up in bed and it's just all worth it.  I hope you and Freya have a long and happy life together.
