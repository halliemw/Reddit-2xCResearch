I quit pills recently and here are the things that I've noticed a difference in: higher sex drive, longer/heavier/crampier periods, and more acne. I'm pretty sure that this is me returning to my normal baseline (i.e. the pills lowered my sex drive, lightened my periods, and reduced my acne). Thinking about switching to the implant.
