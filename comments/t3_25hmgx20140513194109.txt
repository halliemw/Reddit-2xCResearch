Most universities have an ombudsperson who takes care of situations like this. I've made several complaints about profs who have been sexist, and the ombudsperson approaches them on your behalf so you remain anonymous yet the complaint is still dealt with. Also it helps to have it officially on file with the university so that if this is a chronic case of Sexist Jerk Prof then they can be reprimanded appropriately. 

Ombudsperson: your new best friend.
