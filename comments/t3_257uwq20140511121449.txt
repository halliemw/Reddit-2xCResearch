Why *are* they inappropriate?
What the fuck is so bad about bra straps? Oh no! Now the whole school knows that females wear bras!!
You know what should be inappropriate? Pit stains. And as an Arizona girl, me wearing a spaghetti strap top doesn't mean I want the whole school to look at my shoulders and collar bones, but that it's 120 degrees outside and I walk a two miles to get to school. 

But thanks for letting me know that the bra straps are the problem with spaghetti tops. Going bra less is way more fun anyway!
