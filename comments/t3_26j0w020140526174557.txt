Rodger. His last name is Rodger. I realize I might be the minority here, but I think this article is part of the problem. Rodger wasn't just a guy who grew up spurned by girls. That doesn't make you a murderer. We would have a lot more shootings were this the case. Teaching guys (and gals for that matter) a lesson about sex isn't what you should be looking at here. Do not turn this guy into a lesson about sex and attraction. He was a narcissist. He believed because he was rich and found himself attractive he deserved things from the world. He was entitled to them. He didn't get this isn't a normal reaction. He had a severe disconnection with reality. Read his manifesto. It is one thing to be spurred by a woman and think you are entitled for her to think you're dreamy. It is another to go on a killing spree, killing innocents and hitting people with your car. Instead of telling men and women how people aren't required to have sex with you (which a lot of people already get) focus on mental health. I'm not saying you shouldn't still explain this to your kid because it is important, but saying that that is the main thing to take away from this is part of the problem. Do not hold him up as a poster child for accepting rejection.
