Congratulations on the pregnancy! Many people will not receive this news well but I urge you to not be swayed by other's opinions. I also got pregnant when on birth control, and there was a lot of shame there even though we tried to be safe about it. I ended up getting an abortion because of the shame and the pressure put on me by my parents (thank god yours will be supportive?) but I wish I stuck to what I believed.

That being said, you'll need a lot of help! Instead of just thinking your parents will be supportive, you have to make sure. This means working out baby care, possible nightschooling, taking a year or two off, getting loans, a temporary part time job...whatever the case may be that works for you and the fam, you will have to work all of that out well in advance of your delivery date. If your parents can't watch the baby, and you feel you can't do it on your own and SO is out of the picture, then always remember that adoption is an option! It may not be what you've envisioned for yourself, but if you're against abortion and feel you cannot care for this baby well, then I think you should definitely consider this.

I've since had a beautiful son, so let me tell you that while this may be the most difficult time in your life, it will also be one of the most fulfilling! The absolute joy that can come from being a parent is astounding sometimes. He's so worth the effort, just as I believe the other baby would have been. Good luck!!
