Well, shit. 

I'm not at all surprised at you're attracted to this other man, he sounds nice. Your husband sounds absolutely terrifying. It's hard to maintain your emotional bond with a person who's response to you being upset is to get angry, or just ignore you. If that was me, I have to admit I'd be doing everything I could to separate myself from him on an emotional level and bury every feeling- good or bad- that I ever had for him. 

It does sound like your husband has some shit he needs to address. Probably raising that with him is going to result in a temper fit- so I have no idea how to broach it, all I know is that you cannot continue in your marriage as it is. I know you love him, but it's not a healthy place for either of you at the moment.

At some point, you will have to address this. You will never be as young, or have as much potential as you do today. Good luck.
