I'm not sure why you're getting down voted. I suppose because you're arguing in a thread about a comedians offensive statement on his radio show. I suppose because you're disagreeing with a woman here, that somehow means you agree with him? I don't understand the downvotes here, but you are completely right when you say that laughing at a joke doesn't mean you agree with it. Any comedian will tell you that.
