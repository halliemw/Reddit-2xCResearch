oof, that last bit got me right in the feels. I can only relay the same advice that someone gave me earlier... it does get better.

You are doing the right thing, and it's good to know you have friends there to support you when you arrive :) It may not feel like it now, but it sounds like you're going to be okay.

I like quotes... so my best advice to you comes from churchill... "if you're going through hell, keep going". I'll see you on the other side :)
