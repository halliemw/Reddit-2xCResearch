I have a colposcopy booked for July 2nd, after having 2 abnormal pap test results a year apart, although my doctor never mentioned if I have HPV or not. At first I was terrified - I freaked out and cried - because my mind automatically went to the worst case scenario, but after venting to my SO and reading about peoples' experiences on here, I don't feel so bad. It's better to catch whatever it is (if anything) early and hopefully get the all-clear, than disregard my health completely and let things get worse.

What you need to do, is reiterate the fact that she did NOT fuck up, that abnormal results are very common, and that getting tested AND going for a follow-up is the best thing to do. I hate going to the doctor, but I would hate to have late stage cervical cancer even more. I imagine she would feel the same.
