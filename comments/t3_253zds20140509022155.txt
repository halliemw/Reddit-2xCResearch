Vaginal condoms are a great idea, I was guessing she might be involved with partners who refused to wear penile ones since she wanted to know about IUDs. Or maybe it's an allergy thing, who knows? 


I have some business cards for different LGBT+ places and planned parenthood and homeless shelters and the like, I guess I just need to start carrying them around with me!


I also tend to hoard free condoms from events and give them out to whoever might need them, since I'm asexual and don't really have a use myself. Maybe I'll start carrying spares around in my bag, if that's not too creepy.
