I worked a similar summer job on a golf course for most of my early 20s and absolutely loved it. Sure there was casual sexism (the one old dude who called all three young females "baby" instead of remembering our names - also provided very good natured non-creepy 'dirty old man' comic relief), but as far as actual respect for capabilities, it all came down to who worked hard. If you were a lazy ass, it didn't matter what you had up front, you weren't taken seriously. If you pitched in and took your turn at the crappy difficult jobs, you were one of the team.

Edit: I was also randomly put on mulching an old garden, really enjoyed it, and asked to work on others. I ended up spending 4 years restoring all the old gardens...best summer job ever :)
