Great response! My partner and i have already decided that he will be the primary caregiver when we have kids because he loves kids and i am not very maternal. Plus, when we were honest about it, i have more earning potential. So really he should never be hired because as soon as i pop out a womb fruit hes going to quit. But no workplace would ever just assume that like they do with a woman because big man bring home bacon for little wifey etc etc.
