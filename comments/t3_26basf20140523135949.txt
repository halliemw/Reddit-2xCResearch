>So fuck you for being so rude, and fuck you for being a bitter person in general. Its a post about whats going well in your life, and celebrating what you're thankful for. In this moment, I am extremely thankful that my relatives are so fucking generous, but it was completely unexpected. 



Quite frankly, the only bitter person in this thread seems to be you, who clearly can't take a joke.  I think you missed both the point of the thread as a whole, and the lighthearted joke OP was making in the reply.
