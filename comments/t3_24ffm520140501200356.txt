I was just responding to your comment that claimed they didn't take into account the girls' previous weight. They did. 

I'm not claiming that the negative statements definitely caused the weight gain. I think the findings look interesting though, especially given that there are a lot of people out there who defend their fat-shaming with the claim that it'll motivate people to lose weight.
