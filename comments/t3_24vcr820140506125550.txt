Another short girl checking in at 5'1"! It drives me nuts sometimes. 

I always feel dumpy next to taller women and I hate that your average stranger can render me completely invisible by standing slightly in front of me. 

I work in a super male dominated field and it's super frustrating getting them to take me seriously when I have to crane my neck upwards just to be able to look them in the eye. When you're short, any attempts to stand your ground just get you called "spunky" or "a feisty little firecracker" (fuck me, right?). I find that the only way I seem to be able to command respect is to overcompensate by being incredibly cold and serious. 

It's annoying to be constantly carded at the age of 27 but the worst is it happening at really nice restaurants when I'm out with my boyfriend and I'm the only person in the entire restaurant asked to show ID. At least when it's at a liquor store, it's not just me, but it's totally embarrassing, not to mention ruins the mood, when I'm at a place where the average meal is $50 a plate and I'm the only one in the whole room being asked. 

Ugh. I could go on and on and on....
