I'm going to be blunt: you really need to calm down about this. I know it's stressful, but something like 70% of the population has HPV (according to my last STD clinic visit) and it is only unlucky people that show symptoms. Truly. MOST (sexually active) people have HPV and MOST people don't show symptoms. Did you have warts on your hands when you were a kid? Exactly the same thing, these just happen later in life, and they will disappear with age in exactly the same way. Even if you do have it, who cares? You're not showing symptoms. Life is good darling :)
