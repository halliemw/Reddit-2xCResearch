Of course, the only people responsible for rape are rapists. But you can still give advice, giving advice to minimize the chance of rape occurring is totally justified. Avoiding excessive drinking is a no brainer, when you are intoxicated to a point where you don't even know where you are and cannot make safe decisions you are putting yourself at risk of a whole range of things. 

I was robbed on holiday of my wallet. I was targeted because I was almost at the point of blacking out. There's a massive chance I could have avoided that if I hadn't drank to that extent - that's just fucking brutal reality. I'm not at fault for being robbed, the blame isn't on me, I just placed myself in a situation where I more likely to be a target. 

Dressing in accordance with norms - I don't know too much about this, but in a lot of Muslim countries if you as a woman dress outside the norms you will become a target (for a whole range of negative and threatening behaviours).

You might not like hearing this because its the truth and it isnt a nice truth, but its a harsh reality which exists. It shouldn't exist, but it does.
