OP didn't claim they were paid minimum wage. She just said they were paid $15/hr and that they were "paid well" which, whereever she's from, implies better than the bare minimum.

In general, I assume everyone on reddit is from the US until they claim otherwise, since basically half the users are from the US. Unless I'm on r/worldnews. OP could be upside down I guess, but I've never heard anyone claim minimum wage as being paid well before.
