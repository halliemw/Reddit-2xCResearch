> But hearing that I wouldn't have fell for it if I loved myself more really hurts. I know that's not the intention.

Can you tell me why it is? Doesn't have to be here if you don't feel comfortable. 

I'm not trying to be this strict teacher lady saying in stern voice ''well, if you only tried more and loved yourself enough, you wouldn't end up with such a bad mark!''

What I'm trying to say is that part of the manipulation is the promise of love, the magical unconditional love - ''if only you deserve it'' (as per the abuser's weave of manipulation and lies). 

It works very often - because love is also very often something that victims were never given enough, were not given unconditionally, were not given without strings attached. 

The abuser starts from giving massive amounts of 'love', and then starts to take it away, bit by bit, so that the victim 'has to work for it'. 

If the victim didn't have enough love in herself, this works. But still, this is not, never, the victim's fault - as we are to a really high extent products of our childhood conditioning. And conditioning for something as strong and basic as love is really powerful, and really hard to break even if it is realised that something went wrong many years ago. 

Funnily enough, a very high proportions of the victims/survivors are seen as very strong women in the life outside the relationship... 

hugs to you.
