My husband and I were especially weirded out by how not-a-given it was. Only about a 25% chance per cycle, generally speaking. But in sex ed they made it sound like if you so much as let a penis touch your vagina without birth control you'll get pregnant instantly.

My sex drive has always been shitty -- like, once every two months if I wait until I get horny -- but I couldn't get enough the first time we started trying. My husband enjoyed making me wait for every other day. I admit I enjoyed being horny all the time too. That's a nice problem to have.

But yeah, the whole thing is weird. We now have a 3.5-year-old girl and a 5-month-old boy and so much of it is weird. When we found out our second was a boy I was a bit unnerved at first by the fact there was a penis in me, a little one and not my husband's, and that it could get boners (even fetal boys can get boners, which is also weird). My husband said, "It's okay, I put it there." WEIRD

Our daughter recently started using the word "actually". Oh my gods. It's the cutest thing ever. Also, that fat little baby who fell over while chewing on a plastic toy is now talking in complete sentences and writing letters, and you can tell which letter they are. Every once in a while she comes out with something that makes me go, "holy shit, you're a real person!"
