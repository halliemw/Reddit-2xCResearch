Yes and most of the time that's fine (unless they are chewing with their mouths open or eating food I find disgusting like seafood). Just because something is 'natural' does not mean I have to be happy watching it. Breastfeeding is one of those things. I also don't like seeing animals breastfeed or watching cows be milked, something about it grosses me out. It's one of the reasons I don't want my own children because I hate the idea of breastfeeding. 

But yea, that's something I would keep to myself in the presence of someone breastfeeding or expressing and either leave or ignore it.
