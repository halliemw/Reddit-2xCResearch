Thank you for your input and interest in participating. I am sadly aware that the chances of us resuming the prior sub is small, but I think I am also under the impression that it is only going to get worse and worse as time goes on. 

One thing that really concerns me is that this seems purely a numbers game, and they're not concerned that their big content providers are going to likely leave. This may still be a forum for women's issues, but I don't think it will be the same quality and type of content. Obviously whether that is good or bad is subjective, but I am worried this will become a sounding board for the women's issues that *men* think are important, rather than women or even an even mix of men and women. 

If that's what it becomes... is it really a women's forum then? 

Again, thank you for your input.
