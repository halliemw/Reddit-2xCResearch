you sound really insecure (and i don't mean that in a bad way - i've been where you've been). it seems like you're exaggerating your own flaws and putting everyone else on a pedestal. for example: 

"oh my gosh, that was really funny! ___ is such a funny person without even trying, and my sense of humour is so awkward in comparison. why can't i be naturally funny like her?!"

except maybe ___ is also nervous about being funny; she just doesn't let it show. you seem to be making romanticized characterizations of others and then only focusing on your own negative traits. of course you're going to be unhappy with yourself if you let yourself think like that!

there's a quote that goes something like "the reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone else's highlight reel". i think that's really applicable to your situation. maybe seeing a therapist could help you form a realistic image of yourself, build up your self-esteem, and stop comparing yourself to others. you said it yourself - there are lots of great things going on in your life! so let yourself enjoy them. get help :)
