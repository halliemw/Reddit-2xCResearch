> It's just very difficult to make time for things other than work when all you feel like doing is sleeping off apathy and hopelessness.

That's depression talking and that's just one more reason that you need to go get help. 

>I'm just afraid of how much a psychologist is going to cost and of how any medication I might take will react with both BC and my brain.

It costs what it costs. You'll pay it eventually. But what is the value of *YOUR LIFE*? Because that's what getting help can give back to you. Months of your life that right now you are sleeping away. 

Medication is a funny thing and will take some time to experiment with, but trust me that psychiatrists are used to dealing with birth control pill interaction. About 50% of their clients would be on BC.

>The thought of getting so bad that I have to be hospitalized terrifies me.

I can understand that worrying you if that's what happened to your mom. But please understand that statistically your mother is an enormous outlier case. And you have the benefit going in that you can tell your medical provider what happened to your mother and the two of you can go in with a more conservative approach. 

But please don't use your mother's experience as an excuse to not get help. You are in more danger from your depression than you are from your treatment. Definitively.
