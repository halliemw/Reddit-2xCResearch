My husband bought me a heating pad when we were dating and I told him I didn't have one. For that time being, he borrowed his sister's for me. We aren't big soda/sweets people so we don't keep them in the house. When I was having an exceptionally yucky time, he'd go out and pick up chocolates and a Sprite or Coke. Then we'll snuggle on the couch and read or watch something on Netflix.
