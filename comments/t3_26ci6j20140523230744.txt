Very cool!! Structural (or mechanical) engineering is what my boyfriend wants to get into. It's challenging to get a degree in that for sure! 

And no, so far we've been able to just patch around the old rebar in stages so it sets properly. I've been told there were jobs that some of the guys worked where they had to reinforce some patches with new rebar or some sort of anchor, but its rare. 

It's alot of fun! :) I've worked many jobs in the trades and this is one of my favourites. Working on a swing stage at 16 stories is pretty great. :p
