My husband is five years younger than I am (and we were about your age when we met). I have no regrets. 

That said, the age difference DOES crop up sometimes. Occasionally it's funny (how old were you when X movie came out again?), other times, less so. 

There is a lifestyle issue that comes up with age differences, especially in your 20s. At 26, I'm guessing you're working and have a career while he may still be in school, or just leaving it. That can be challenging to work through at times, but becomes less of an issue as you both get older and more established in your lives. 

The other issue for us is kids. I was ready for them and he wasn't - and unlike relationships where the guy is older, when you're older, there can be actual time issues with conceiving. 

This is probably way past where you're thinking on a first date, though. ;) And like I said, NO REGRETS! It comes down to the person. 

And five years feels like a bigger gap now than it's ever going to again. So if it doesn't feel like a huge gap now, then go for it. It's only going to get easier, in my opinion. 

FYI, since you mention double standards, I just thought I'd assure you that it's pretty much never come up as an issue for us. Most people don't realize I'm so much older than him, and when they do, they mostly just go 'huh'.
