I too suck at the "tell me about a time when" questions. I now ALWAYS write them down during the interview so I have time to think about what Im going to say, then I answer. It really helps me.

Another great thing that you can do is send them a professional thank you letter thanking them for their time, that you look forward to speaking with them and add anything that you have missed or remembered after your interview.

Dont feel bummed if they don't call you...that just means that there is another more suited position waiting for you =) Keep your head up girlie!
