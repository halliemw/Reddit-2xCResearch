I'm sorry they responded to you that way. Try calling at a different time tomorrow and see if you get someone different. Hopefully you will and you should say, "Hey, I have a few questions, but firstly, I called yesterday and an extremely rude person answered the phone." 

That's not how you handle customers, clients, patients, or any other name for a recipient of your business' services. That's crap and this is your health they're not addressing.
