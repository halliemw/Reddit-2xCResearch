>(which is why I downvoted you - you are not contributing to respectful discussion by being rude)

You can't churn up outrage over some "hivemind" against "accepted beliefs" in specific subreddits and then illustrate that with examples filled with unpopular, minority opinions almost anywhere.    

"Saying Breaking Bad isn't a great show will get you downvoted..." 

REALLY?  No shit.  It's a wildly popular show pretty much everywhere, not just in some tiny subreddit.  Most of the points where about that level of whining.   

Unpopular opinions will be unpopular.  It's absurd and specious to bitch about it. 

>(which is why I down voted you...)

Do you honestly think I care, or that your convenient justification for your downvote means anything?  (other than to you)  What you call rude I call blunt.  It's absolutely a contribution to a respectful discussion.  Just not one you like. Blunt can certainly be respectful.  

Is your opinion more valid than mine?   :)
