Yeah, I hated this article.... I am *sure* there are many difficulties that he faces, but it's just a bra. If she's comfortable who cares? Just because it's "sexy" doesn't mean she's going to start taking her shirt off all the time.

I have an odd bra size and my bras cost MUCH more than $68. They are not made out of 'spun gold'. They last years longer than cheap costco bras. They are, typically, "sexy", unless they're hideous giant beige contraptions, because I guess they figure when you're spending $100+ on a bra they're going to make it pretty. It's been that way since I was a teen and I am 100% sure it didn't make me behave any differently than if I was wearing a $20 plain cotton bra from costco.

Understanding things like that is part of learning about bras for him just as much as figuring out the right size and places to buy from is.
