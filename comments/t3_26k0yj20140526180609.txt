Thank you, I feel a little better. I did get the mirena, I guess I was just hoping the bleeding and cramping would magically disappear. I will wait it out then, hopefully it gets better. I hope your situation gets better and you can get the care you need. I hate that feeling of being stuck and not being able to get something done that needs to be.
