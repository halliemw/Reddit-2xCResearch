Here is a male perspective for you

First, good for you being responsible and getting tested, its always good to see somebody be safe with their body. However i am sorry that you had such a judgmental nurse. It is not their business to tell you who to have sex with or how many partners you choose to have. Next time i suggest you find a different clinic. Im sure the place you went to was t planned parenthood, try them next time.

On your relationship

Men can be jealous sometimes, so can women, especially when discussing passed sexual activity with partners. I for example have only been with one women and im marrying her. She however has had more experience with partners. I try not to be jealous but hey, nobody is perfect. She assures me its i. The past and all that and i know she is mine. 
So please if the conversation comes up, and he is jealous dont be upset. It is in our nature to be jealous and depending on the man, possessive on varying levels. We are much more emotional creatures than we like to let on. 
But as i see it the possessive feelings should go both for both parties in the relationship. He will be yours if you will be his
