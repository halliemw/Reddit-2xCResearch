The line right above that. "In feminist theory the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert **male** dominance over women." Exerting male dominance over women does mean society gives men all this privilege and power and then they assert that or oppress women. I've heard many variations but one thing all branches agree on is the patriarchy is when the "powerful" men "oppress" the poor women.
