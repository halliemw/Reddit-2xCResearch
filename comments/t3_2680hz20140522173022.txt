I'm a guy, so maybe I don't get it but I think the guys who are asking you out are doing so to get to know you. It's tough to really get to know someone in customer service while they are on the job, because they are paid to be nice. Looks will often make people show initial interest, but character is what keeps them around, and is hard to pick up on right away.
