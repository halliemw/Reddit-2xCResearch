I'm telling you that people aren't unaware of it. I haven't had a single Mother's Day yet where people haven't told me to remember those who are infertile and those who have lost pregnancies, children, or mothers. I don't see the same for fathers out there. People don't tell dads to remember all of the dads out there who have lost children on Father's Day. I just don't understand the point of intentionally trying to make the day sour for those who are meant to be celebrated for one single day of the year.
