>Especially since he sexually assaulted you. You were just confronting your attacker. 

Unless he gets convicted, legally he isn't "her attacker," he's just some guy.

edit: Who the hell downvotes this? I'm sorry, but it's true--if he hasn't been convicted or even brought to trial for rape, she won't have a a lot of luck using the rape as a mitigating factor in her own case. *In the eyes of the law*, he is not her rapist, so the case can't be dismissed as "well, she has a right to confront her attacker."
