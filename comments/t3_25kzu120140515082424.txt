Others have covered the more serious part of your post, now let me bring some levity. Next time your mom asks you to get a boyfriend tell her:

> oh sure! Let me just pop on down to the Boyfriend store, pick me up a 5'10, brown eyed brown hair guy with a++ in hugs and b in taking out the trash. Since it's so easy, I will also grab while I am at it an easy job, a perfect health, and joy and happiness. After all, doesn't one just GO. AND. GET. THEM?"

So after saying that in the most sarcastic and dry tone possible, drop a mic (protip, always have a mic with you ) and walk away.
