This subreddit is clearly not 'women only' though, we have plenty of male commenters who are very much welcome here. These posts are not saying "You as a male may never comment here", but rather they try to point out that *sometimes* 10 comments from the male perspective on an issue is not useful, or insightful, or even relevant.
