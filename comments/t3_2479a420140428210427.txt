>Should we really exclude men from bring up relating and/or similiar issues that women have as well?

I honestly don't think it's about that, it's a shut down tactic....a way that they can get their peice of the opresion pie so they don't have to feel bad, getting you to stop talking about it 

 

Like if I talk about the sexualisation of female characters they'll counter it with "yeah but male characters are portrayed as mindless hunks if muscle" 

Soooooo....what's your point? Shall we just pack it up and go home? Sexism is over? Yay? Hers a bold statement on my part...I get the feeling some of them wouldn't even bring these things up outside of trying to hand wave things 

Feminism is called feminism because it deals with woman's issues, that's like saying its unfair that a book publisher called "sci fidelity" only puts out sci fi and not lit fic
