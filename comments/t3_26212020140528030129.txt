What about for happy subjects?  I miss the days before becoming a default when many of us felt comfortable enough to post something happy but still personal and sharing with a like minded community without fear of scrutiny (aside from the occasional trolls).  What about a "SHARE" tag, like the dinosaur sub has a "FLUFF" tag for non serious/scientific posts?  It's meant to be fun and sharing without someone coming along and poo pooing it.
