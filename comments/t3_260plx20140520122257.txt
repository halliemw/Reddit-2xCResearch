I'm not OP. I was asking because your comment read really dismissive to me - like OP's feelings are illegitimately hurt. OP even says she's miffed at herself for being upset. Regardless of why the choices were made, her feelings are valid, and even if someone wouldn't agree with that, they are real. Though I do think saying it's a practical decision is a huge inference. OP doesn't know how or why the decision was made, we can't, as the internet, decide that it was for practical reasons.
