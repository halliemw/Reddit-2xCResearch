My apartment routine was doing a little research on the neighborhoods. I looked for quieter and relatively safe ones. I want to find one where I could avoid break-ins and vandalism (house or car), and drunk undergrads. Then I checked Craigslist for places in that area.

Next I looked at the ages of roommates. I tended to look for people in their 28-30s because that's the type of low-key drama and maturity that I find livable. I looked for women, although I would have been fine living with a guy. I just find guys to be pretty messy. But a craigslist-savy girl won't always post her gender to avoid solicitations and penis photos.

If I find some place I'm curious about, I'll send an email introducing myself and then hopefully they'll send a reply. More often than not their full name is in their reply and I'll google that. I'll also ask to friend request them and thoroughly go over that. 

I also judge pretty hard on their grammar and spelling. If they type liek dis u no der gon b sum drama.

Edit: I avoid hard partiers, and shut-ins. I always ask if they have problems with open communication and how they feel about dishes. If they get slightly defensive I know they probably do have trouble communicating. But for two months it's pretty easy to suck up any discomfort unless its sexual harassment or straight up filth.
