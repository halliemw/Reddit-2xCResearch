That's not cool at all. One day you might explode and he'll be all "Why'd you never mentioned this before?".

Do not encourage this behaviour (don't pretend you like the clothing he wants you to wear if you don't, don't act like you actually appreciate this comments if you don't...).

If he's trying to be nice he should shut up as soon as you tell him he's making you feel uncomfortable, if he's trying to be helpful and he's a smart man he should have noticed he's not being helpful at all.  If he really dislikes your style then he's dealing with it the wrong way, ask him directly if that's the case and if that's not what he thinks then he needs to stop.

>But in the back of my head, I'm asking myself "Why is he telling me how to dress "hotter"? Why does he think that I need his help? Am I that bad? Am I not good-looking enough?"

You dress exactly how you want to dress, if that's not attractive enough for him then he shouldn't even be dating you and that's his problem not yours. Tell him (and tell yourself) "I always look hot, dear, but thank you."
