I don't think I'd say "suck it up", though I know some people who might. I'd applaud this person for their activism and use them as an example of how a person in a position of privilege can work to recognize their privilege and call it out. The issue though is that there is not a critical mass of these individuals--they are the minority. Until they are the majority, these cultural problems will still exist. As they become the majority and culture begins to shift, so too will the stereotypes against men.  For example, when I read an article about white privilege, I recognize that while I actively consider my personal privilege in being white, the critical mass is not there. I listen to the points and fold them into my evaluation of privilege, but rarely feel attacked as a white person (obviously there are some instances where the article is intended to attack--I don't think that is the case here). It's in everyone's best interest for us to fight to get to that point of critical mass for all privileged/marginalized groups.
