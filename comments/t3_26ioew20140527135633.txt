There are things requiring a high GPA, don't get me wrong. Just not that much. What's President Obama's GPA? Who gives a fuck? No one, that's who.

I've worked in computer systems. Computer system sales. Politics. Own business. A lot of other stuff.

No one ever asks about GPA, ever. Ok, maybe some weird situation. But it is rare. If someone tells you they ge asked all the time, they lie. Or are in academia or like that, where no doubt, it matters.
