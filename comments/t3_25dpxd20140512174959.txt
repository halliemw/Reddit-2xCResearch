I did it with some ibuprofen, but I didn't find the cervix exam as painful as you did. I have a relatively low pain tolerance (fainted while getting my ears pierced). 

The pain is intense but it's very very fast. Breathing really helped. Look up diaphragm breathing techniques (you could even look at pregnancy breathing techniques). 

I think knowing it was going to be fast help me too. I think if you take the pills you'll be fine :D 

P.S  I love love love my IUD. Have the copper coil and although i have had some side effects, not having to think about pregnancy is amazing.
