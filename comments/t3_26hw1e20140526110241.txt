No actually, that's just what he thinks. He would have answered that question in that way if I had asked it. What makes you think that his lack of opinion on genital grooming makes him uninterested?

I would be jealous, if he was in the least bit interested in her. I know he's not. I'm angry at her for stepping over boundaries. If she's going to ruin her relationship, she needs to find someone single to do it with.
