5'9" here.  It's hard to be a tall girl because there is so much social pressure to be small and meek and acted-upon. Really really. A survey of teenage girls shows that they think that sex is something that happens to them, not something they participate in.  Your daughter might be dealing with a lot of "coming of age" realizations before her peers because being small and meek teenager (only to bloom in later years) just isn't a practical option.  She's being confronted with being an individual head on rather than exploring the desires to be an individual like so many of her peers... that being said, it's tough as hell to grow up a teenage girl... no matter what you look like, it's just not what you're friggin supposed to look like.

If she's having a lot of trouble fitting in a school or feeling confident then you really need to get her into extra curricular activities. Swimming and venture crew (co ed boy scouts for 14+ year olds) is where I made friends. I struggled with body confidence, too... I think swimming really really helped with that.  Sports have a way of making you appreciate your body for what it can do rather than what it looks like.

That's all the advice I can give you. Make sure your daughter has an outlet for stress (exercise being the best) and make sure that she has enough opportunity to make quality friendships (extra curricular activities).  Oh, and Zappos is the best for picking out size 11 shoes. Free shipping and free exchanges for the win! And one day your daughter will realize that, while it may be damned near impossible to find decent shoes in stores, there are always designer shoes in size 11 clearance because all the full price size 7 shoes sold out 8 months ago.
