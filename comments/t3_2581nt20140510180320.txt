I think there are legal reasons that they can't allow you to opt for a tubal ligation. Malpractice lawsuits are a bitch. I totally agree it's bullshit though. Your body your choice.

Going outside the country if you can afford it is not a bad idea. It sounds like with your medical issues, even if you did change your mind it would be safer for you to adopt anyway. I know that I often feel this way. I don't think being ill for nine months and then going through post-partum depression is worth it if you can just adopt. My father was adopted and I've never once felt that my adoptive grandmother was not family.
