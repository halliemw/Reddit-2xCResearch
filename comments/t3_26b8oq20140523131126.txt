I've been off an on ortho tri-cyclen for 4ish years. I like it. It provides me with a way to control my periods. I originally went on birth control because of acne, and the next step was accutane, and you have to be on birth control for that. I'm not sure I saw any results, but my periods were so much better. They came regularly, they weren't as bad, I was in control. I'd rather be on a birth control method that works for me than not be on one. A huge plus, not being pregnant.

I can give you some ortho tri-cyclen specific advice and anecdotes about my experience! I spotted with breakthrough bleeding the whole second month I took it, but once that went away, it was great. I like that is is tri phasic, so the hormones are less at the beginning. Also, skipping periods is harder in a tri phasic regimen. I have had some success in skipping periods, but you can'y go back down a hormone level. Having two half open packs at a time is a little bit of a hassle.

If you have any questions, ask away or PM me!
