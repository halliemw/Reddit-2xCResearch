> I posted to point out that pro-life posters are disagreed with far more than pro-choice activists, when in this sub both opinions should be equally respected and seen as equally valid.

I'm sorry, but what?  You think you have the right to not be disagreed with?  Seriously?  Exactly what makes you think both opinions should be equally respected?  Why exactly should I respect your opinion of taking my right *to choose* what is best for me?      

Everyone has the right to share their opinion, that doesn't mean everyone has to agree with you or not find it offensive.  It doesn't make you a victim or not tolerated.  **It means you are offensive.**  Your comments thus far in this thread have been incredibly condescending to anyone reading that has gone through an abortion.  

> there are some legitimate reasons for abortion.

Who are you to decide what is a legitimate reason?  How about in the cases of abuse?  I got an abortion because I was too frighted of the effects of being connected to my abuser for the rest of my life.  Is that legitimate enough for you?  The entire point of pro-choice is that the only one(s) who gets to decide when it's a legitimate reason are the people actually effected by the situation.  Not some stranger posting on the internet.  

>  Is this because it's become "cool" to think abortion is ok?

Are you fucking serious?  You then obviously don't understand the distinction between pro-choice and pro-abortion.  Pro-choice is a popular stance around here, because *a woman's right to choose* is popular.  Period.
