I have maybe 5 hairs on each nipple. I've never really cared or had any comments about them. They are not all that noticeable. And who gives a shit? But then the other day, I realised that I could pluck each hair with my bare hands.

I plucked the ones on my right nipple and left the ones on my left to see what would happen. Would they grow back thicker? Would they grow back at all?

Then I promptly forgot about my experiment. 

Just checked now. 

The ones on my right nipple look like they are beginning to grow back. They seem to be the same texture, thickness etc as left nipple hair.
