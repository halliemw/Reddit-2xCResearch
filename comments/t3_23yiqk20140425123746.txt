I do not know the intricate details of your relationship, but it sounds like you might be making yourself too accessible. He must have a reason to chase you, and if you are always available and willing to come to his side he has no reason to chase you. Make yourself a scarce commodity by taking longer to reply to his messages, call him back or get to his house. Make plans with other friends that do not include him so you are away from him and give him time to miss you. Its difficult when you want to spend every waking moment with the person, but that is what it takes for him to reciprocate the chase.

It is unlikely that you will become pregnant based on the scenario you presented. Not impossible, but unlikely. Doesn't sound like much sperm could have been introduced to your vagina and given the distance it would have to travel to fertilize an egg in your uterus makes it improbable.
