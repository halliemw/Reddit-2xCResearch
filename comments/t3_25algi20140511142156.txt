I got nothing, other than yes, go back to Germany and see a doctor there. Get a second or third opinion from doctors there, too. None of this sounds good and an GYN who isn't suggesting surgery at this point ... at least you have had some ultrasounds. Can you get copies of your tests to bring with you to Germany? Go armed with everything you have. 

I had an ultrasound for ovarian cysts and doc only saw the stuff going on on the right side. Once she went in through my belly button realized that the one on the right was splitting my ovary in two and there were two on the ~~right~~ left (I edited there) side that no one had caught yet. So she had to do a full incision to get in there. So just because it isn't showing up on the ultrasound doesn't mean squat
