That's a really good opener! If I talk to her I might actually use it word for word haha. Cuz it also would help me suss out whether I'm wrong and she DOES have some deeper issue that's causing her to act this way - I would hate to have assumed that she's "just unreliable" and it turns out she actually does have some issue. She did once talk to a counselor about separation anxiety from being an only child... But I would think that would make her WANT to hang out with people rather than cancel on them all the time.

Thanks for the advice! I take your point about people not reacting well to measured criticism - I do tend to agree with you and I'm also not particularly aggressive, so it's not in my nature to confront people with criticisms that aren't immediately pressing.
