I think the poster is happy that the comments didn't devolve into an identity exposing gossip fest and instead semi shamed him by mentioning Duke. The Duke comment could be referencing the famous 'rape' case but I'm from Canada so I'm not certain. 

Edit* I was replying to a comment stating they had no idea what the post was about. That comment is ?gone and it seems like I'm answering an unasked question. Hell this edit is probably answering an unasked question. I'll go ahead and shut up now!
