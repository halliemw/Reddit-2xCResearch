Fuck.  We didn't do that heart exercise, but that same sentiment was told to us in my sex ed classes.  I still struggle with it today, to be honest.  There are times where I resent my boyfriend for having had sex with other people before we were together.  It takes a few minutes to ground myself and make myself realize that that's such a silly thing to be upset over, but that's such a harmful thing to tell kids.
