My mom is hoping she will finally be hitting that milestone. She'll be 55 this year and has begun with irregular periods and small symptoms. It's still stubbornly been hanging on though, for now. But the longer you have it, the better, due to protective hormones, so it's probably good you've lasted that long with it. Congratulations though. :)
