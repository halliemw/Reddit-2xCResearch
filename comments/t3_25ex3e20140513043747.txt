Here's my two cents, but I'm not even sure it's worth that: 

-sounds like the living situation is caustic...living with an ex while dating someone else can cause some major trust issues for the new guy

-the current boyfriend is skating on thin ice by talking like that with an ex. He's not guiltless and should not be talking like that, even in joking. 

-IF you both think it's worth saving the relationship (and you'll find out by calmly having a talk), than you should change the living situation and he should apologize to you and quit flirting with the ex. 

You are worth somebody's love. So if this relationship doesn't work out, turn to family or a friend soon and let them know you just got out of a relationship and want to have some good, clean fun.

Don't rebound hook up with anyone, that'll just add to your self-loathing, and can hurt someone else.
