> A lot of TwoX posts are about politics, current events, and opinions. It's a lot harder to police that kind of stuff, and to set clear guidelines for what's "acceptable" and what isn't.

Exactly this. The mods are already right on the ball for truly mean comments (sometimes even a little sensitive imho but whatever, it's the nature of the sub). Any more policing and you would be getting into censoring territory.

And no one should want to be in censoring territory.
