That would require me getting in a situation where kidnapping was possible, which is most likely to be getting in some sort of vehicle with people. Since I'm already "trapped", being able to pay would keep me safer from harm. The one time I was nearly taken (different country), they didn't know I had money. They just knew I was attractive. 

Fortunately, if you keep a cool head and pay attention to your surroundings, traveling is usually pretty safe. I've been in more sketchy situations in the States than abroad. "The Gift of Fear" made me a lot better at reading situations.
