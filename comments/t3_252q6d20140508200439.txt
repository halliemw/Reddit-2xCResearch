I hope you'll forgive me for quoting another mod here, but I think she put it really well. I'll expand a bit with my own thoughts as well:

> The admins contacted the mods of /r/TwoXChromosomes as part of a much larger overhaul of the default subreddit system. There are now 50 defaults, rather than the 25 there used to be. The new defaults now cover a range of niche topics, rather than being selected as "universal appeal" subreddits.

> Because the admins wanted to keep their big announcement a surprise, they asked the mods of new default subreddits to keep the decision under wraps. 

One of the biggest things that lead us to agreeing to do this was the fact that if it doesn't work we can back out. Knowing that we were on short notice, couldn't ask, but could change our minds after the fact convinced us to give it a try. The idea of a wider default front page, one that includes women as well as many other very niche subreddits, was also very appealing. We love this community and want women to have a place on the front page women new to the site can find us and related subreddits.
