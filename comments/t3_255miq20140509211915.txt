you're definitely not alone. I'm not even stressed, I'm generally happy, but sometimes I think I get overwhelmed thinking about the positive changes I've made in my life. And also facing 13.1 miles with thousands of strangers is overwhelming too! 

But I've cried on regular runs all the same. I also cry watching commercials... For no reason... They aren't even the sappy ones. Ugh. Womanhood.

Anyway so sorry to hear about your  parent. Hope they make it through. :( Hugs!
