I don't think Rabbits are a good idea for an introductory toy. They're kinda expensive and complicated. 

I think it's good to start with something small and simple, like a bullet vibrator. [This](http://www.amazon.com/Berman-Center-Waterproof-Massager-Packaging/dp/B000C9MB74/ref=sr_1_9?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1398644917&sr=1-9&keywords=bullet+vibe) is the first one I ever got, and it was great for me-- lots of reviews to check out on Amazon, too. I can vouch for [this vibrator](https://www.smittenkittenonline.com/vibes-buzz-me-tender/pirouette-vibrator-by-pleasure-works.html), if you want an insertable one. It works awesomely, and it's kinda pretty, too.
