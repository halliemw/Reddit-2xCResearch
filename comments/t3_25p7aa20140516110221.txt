I kind of wish that they'd do away with the downvote button.  Posts would instead simply be ranked by the number of upvotes.

TwoX used to be way better when it comes to an honestly dissenting opinion, but I supposed every sub will eventually grow into kind of a hivemind after enough time.  In general, I don't downvote just because I disagree with something.  I'll only downvote if someone is being an asshole or is blatantly just trolling.
