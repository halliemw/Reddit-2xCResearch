> Seriously, how could someone be worried about some dude thousands of miles away?

I suppose there's something to be said for the possibility of nudes that could lead to doxxing and threats.  None of us were particularly smart at 15 and it's easy to be swept up by this fantasy of a man thousands of miles away who puts her on a pedestal of worship.  It's easy to fall in love with that kind of attention at that age, especially when somebody's perception of love is limited by 15 years of life.

There are things to worry about, for sure.  But as with all relationships, honesty is more important than infatuation.
