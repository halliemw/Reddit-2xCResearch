I would. I find it a lot easier to relax my muscles enough (especially with bigger guys) in missionary when I can let him take control, at least for penetration. The angle also feels a bit more natural to me-- with cowgirl a lot of women need to lean either forward or backwards for it to feel comfortable to them and I think this could be a little confusing for a newbie. I tried both missionary and cowgirl when I lost my virginity and couldn't really get cowgirl to work-- I found it to be too painful because my muscles were so engaged and it made me feel tighter. I suppose missionary does take trust since he's in more control, but if you feel comfortable with each other and use verbal communication for when it hurts it will be just fine.

But obviously everyone's body is different. There are some people that would prefer to start out with cowgirl. OP and her husband should just try different positions to figure out what works for them.
