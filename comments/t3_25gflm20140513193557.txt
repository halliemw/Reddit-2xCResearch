The joke where they're walking away? 

She's repeating "and so does the fat lady" to everything he says, & he's talking about doing mundane stuff like going out & buying food n whatever. 

He says he buys a ballon (and so does the fat lady)
& the last line of the joke he says is 'and it pops' (and so does the fat lady)

The fat lady pops at the end of the joke.
