The store doesn't molest you to do a bra fitting.  Let them know you are modest and they will be understanding.  You should never feel uncomfortable with that experience.  

A DD might feel great but it might still not be the right size.  I have some bras that are comfy but don't provide enough support.  Bigger boobs need a bit of architecture to hold them up and something may feel great in the store but not support you properly.  Go to a GOOD department store and get measured (not victoria's secret- they measure wrong A LOT)  

Sounds like your mom might just not understand the issue or is freaked out by you growing up so quick.  You can try to tell her that your breasts have been extremely sore and you want to ask your doctor about it.  It doesn't seem normal.  When the doc looks at you it will be obvious that you're in a bra that's too tight-  Your mom can't really deny it any longer at that point.  Or just put your current bra through the dryer on super hot and ruin it so you need a new one anyway.  Ask for money to get a replacement and get the size you need.  Its a little dishonest but your mom isn't giving you a lot of options.
