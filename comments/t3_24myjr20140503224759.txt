For me, I take a drug called Naprogesic in Australia - not sure what it's called elsewhere, but it's available over the counter and is brilliant. Not only does it relieve cramps, it also relieves the "I wanna stay in bed and not exist for three days" thing I get going. 

Other than that, I get my boyfriend to come over and cuddle me, drink lots of tea and watch my favourite TV shows.
