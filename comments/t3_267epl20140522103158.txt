The first thing you need to do is make an appointment with an ob/gyn. At that appointment, ask for them to refer you to a pregnancy counselor. Some places have them in-house, sometimes you'll need to go to a pregnancy clinic/planned parenthood/crisis center type of place. A counselor will be able to tell you all about all these things that are concerning you. You need real advice; not opinions from people on reddit. 

It is do-able, but you *have* to take steps now to protect yourself and your child. You need to get on the right medicines, and you *have* to contact a lawyer immediately in order to protect your rights. Getting a lawyer involved doesn't mean things will be combative with the father, but it means things will be legal, and you'll be protected from him changing his mind, from his parents having different ideas, etc.

You can absolutely finish school, but you need to know what your support system, custody arrangements, and financial situation are going to be in order to come up with a realistic plan. Again, this is exactly where a pregnancy counselor can help you. As a single mother, your financial aid will be different, there may be income-based daycare options open to you, and the school you attend may have daycare. You need someone experienced to help you navigate it all. 

Yes, life is going to change in a big way, but you say that's what you're choosing. Just prepare yourself as best you can for the life you are now going to have. And good luck!
