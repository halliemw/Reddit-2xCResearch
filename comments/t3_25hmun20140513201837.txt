Very easy definition- I drive a diesel car. Did the research, spent some time coming to that idea, love my car.

Many, many men have taken it upon themselves to tell me all about my car when they find out. What kind of gas mileage it gets, what the environmental impact is, how hard it is to find diesel fuel (bonus points if I'm literally *standing at the pump* when this happens). They're not asking me, they're not 'making conversation,' they're showing off their (often incorrect) knowledge trying to impress me... about my own car.
