I go to every interview, even if it's for jobs I've already decided I'm not interested in taking due to salary/whatever because it's practice.

I'm looking for a job right now and I've gone to two interviews for positions I couldn't have cared less about getting, and by the time I interviewed for positions I was excited about, I was already really in the rhythm of answering questions.
