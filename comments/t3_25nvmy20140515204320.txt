Report him for what? What law did he violate? In case you didn't know, he's supposed to ask those questions. A lot of men are falsely accused of rape so they have to make sure it's genuine. I know I'm going to get a bunch of downvotes and see comments saying "you hate women!" but it's true. He did exactly what he's supposed to do, and just because it hurt her feelings doesn't mean she gets to complain.
