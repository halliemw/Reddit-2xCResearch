I've got the contraceptive implant in my arm , had it since February and it's fantastic. I was warned I might have non stop bleeding, break out in spots and be crazy hormonal.. And I was also told it could be fantastic and really suit me .  Fortunately I've had no problems, no bleeding, no crazy mood swings and my skins perfectly normal. I came off the pill as I'm aweful at remembering to take it and also I'm overweight and they was worried about the pill affecting my health.  All I have it a small pink scar on my arm and I can feel the bar under my skin, lasts 3 years too!
