Very normal. Don't apologize, if he has the mind to have sex he probably knows the deal already! Sex should be a mutually beneficial, fun experience. There should never be pressure put on yourself by you or anyone else! Nothing sounds out of the ordinary to me. Foreplay is an absolute must for most women- so try extending it and voicing what you like. This should help you get wet more easily and will help the next time. Most gals experience some form of discomfort their first time- it took my first and I many attempts before my gears starting goin' down there.
