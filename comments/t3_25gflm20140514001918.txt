What reason do we have to believe that 1/3 of our country is lazy slobs, besides obesity? There should be another symptom of this supposed laziness. Under 5% of the population is on Welfare, so that doesn't support the theory. Obesity is a symptom of many different things, and we have more evidence that obesity is a genetic disorder and a symptom of other illnesses than we do that a third of the country is lazy, unless there's some data out there that I haven't seen.
