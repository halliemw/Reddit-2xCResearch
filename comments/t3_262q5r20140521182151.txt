I felt guilty immediately after I woke up and remembered what happened, before I found out I was pregnant. I'm opposed to telling him for a couple reasons. One being that I know how horrible it was to lie about the BC in the first place and I made him feel safe when it wasn't. That kind of betrayal would probably lead to the other reason, which is the possibility of losing him as a friend. It seems like the males in this thread would rather not know about an abortion if the girl already made the decision to do it, and that also weighs in to my decision a bit.
