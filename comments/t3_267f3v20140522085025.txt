>My boobs have been feeling really sore lately but I've had no other symptoms

I would just like to point out that your boobs can feel sore at other times other than being pregnant.

Taking pills a few hours late will not cause them to be ineffectual.  The hormones build up in your system and takes a few days not a few hours to loose their effectiveness.  There really isn't a problem with running 2 packs together other than then running out before you can refill your prescription.
