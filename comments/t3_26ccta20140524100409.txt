I did/am still thinking about it but I'm very hesitant to go on hormonal methods due to a bad experience and I hate pain plus I'm extremely tight so an IUD is out of the question at the moment.

I would still use condoms but if and when I *do* choose to go without a condom, I will not need to feel like my world is ending because there is only a slim chance of falling pregnant and if so, I have adequate resources at my disposal.
