I've only ever changed over the battery in my car and topped up the wiper fluid. It's only a 2007 model Lancer, so she's still running beautifully.  
  
I do miss working on my motorbike, though, a 1999 Honda CBR 600F. [Looked exactly like this one](http://www.mcnews.com.au/2000-honda-cbr-600-f4/). Oil changes were dead easy. The filter a little less so. Why? Because the damn thing sat in behind the front wheel (so you had to get around that first), just above where the 4-2-1 exhaust joined 2 to 1. That created a little spot for oil to pool. It didn't matter what I tried, I always ended up with a little oil on the exhaust when changing that filter. The headlight bulb was a pain to change, too. Thankfully I only had to do it once. Right under the light is a tiny square hole to remove it. By "tiny", I mean about 2 square inches. Even with my small hands, I couldn't do it. I had to pull the front of the bike apart. Mirrors had to come off to pull off the front cowling, and it had to be detached from the rest of the fairing as well. Also had to disconnect the front indicators, move the air intakes (the funny looking black bits on the front. They linked up to the airbox, which sits just under the fuel tank, by plastic ducts that ran just under the handlebars). Took me ages.
