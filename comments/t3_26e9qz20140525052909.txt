I don't have time to reply to this properly right now but I will later when I get back in but like other posts have said, please please go and get help. You might love your mother but she's only made this worse for you and only continues to. You need a healthy diet to maintain a good healthy weight, you don't need to strive to be thin all of the time. You are not "not thin enough to have an eating disorder." It's mental as well as physical. You've been struggling with this for years and you don't seem to be able to cope alone. Print this out, what you've just written and just hand it to your doctor and they'll probably get a better idea of the situation you are in right now than if you went and tried to think of it all on the spot. Let them see what you've just said to us. No mother should bring their child up counting calories, the mothers themselves in that situation probably have mental issues with food. You bring your child up on what's healthy, reasonable portions and some sport for exercise a few times a week with friends. You want them to be healthy, not brought up as obsessed with eating disorders, with a drastically reduced life span. Take what you've written to a doctor now and as much as you love your mum I would just tell her you're not well and can't cope with seeing her right now. She doesn't even realise what she's done to you and all she will do now is make you more ill.
