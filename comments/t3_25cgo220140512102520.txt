This is a good idea. I agree it's easy to get caught up in the negatives of life. So to begin I'm happy I passed another semester of college. My internship is going very smoothly and I love the guys I'm working with. Hoping to learn a lot from them this summer. My family is constantly being supportive of my dreams and even though my parents annoy me sometimes I know that they love me more than I'll be able to understand till I have a child of my own. It's mind boggling how they could love me so much. My friends are mainly all off at colleges doing their thing but I have been able to keep in touch with some of my best friends even though we live so far away. And with no Facebook that means a lot more. I have the cutest pup in the world that greets me every time i come home like I'm the coolest guy to ever live.
