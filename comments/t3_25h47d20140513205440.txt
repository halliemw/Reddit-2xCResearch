He might not appreciate it now (or ever) but it does make a difference that you went out of your way to do the right thing. I know I've been a jerk to people who broke up with me but when i could see past my own pain I was able to appreciate the times when it was done with consideration to my feelings.
It's totally not cool to act like he did though.
