I got a lot of advice from ~~/r/hotwifing,~~ * EDIT: /r/Hotwife * honestly.  Even moreso than the other poly/open subreddits.  But, that's probably because I needed to hear a LOT of differing opinions from straight males in this sort of relationship.  I needed to understand from others, not just my husband, how I should act, how I should seek partners, how to stay safe, etc.  You can pm me anytime if you want to talk or have any questions, but I would also highly recommend seeking the advice of those friendly folks.  Good luck in your adventures!

EDIT /r/hotwife sorry
