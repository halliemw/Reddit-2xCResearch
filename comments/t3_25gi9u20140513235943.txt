If it's what your sister's comfortable with then good for her, but personally I wouldn't wear one. Baby hates being covered, plus it's an extra layer of complication to have to bring along and then put on when the baby starts fussing, plus it makes it immediately obvious to *everyone* that I'm breastfeeding.

I wear nursing clothes or layers that can be adjusted in the right way, so even if people notice I'm breastfeeding (and they often don't), they'd have to be looking really hard and practically standing on top of me to see any skin at all. That's just me, though, and I have no problem with other women just pulling clothes down/up/aside - the baby's head is over the nipple anyway, you're showing less than you would in a bikini!
