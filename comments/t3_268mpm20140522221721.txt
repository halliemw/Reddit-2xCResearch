If he feels like time is running out you two could always freeze some of his sperm and keep it in a bank.


 Finishing school is a great idea and you should never be pushed into having kids. I was pushed into it and as a result I had to overcome postpartum depression. For the most part I am over it, at times I notice myself becoming distant from my child. What I am getting at is this. Becoming a mom/dad is not something to jump into. Each person needs to be in agreement. A harmony if you will. I would suppose it's like a marriage. The joining together of two separate lives(parenting styles) to guide and grow a child. You need to be in a good place mentally, physically, financially, and in your relationship. If someone is not in harmony and that baby comes any negative feelings will be magnified.
