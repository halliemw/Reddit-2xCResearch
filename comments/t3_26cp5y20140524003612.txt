Because not putting on a condom is different than committing to raising a child. They are not the same thing. Just because I forgot to put my seatbelt on, doesn't make me committed to getting ripped from my car seat in a high-speed accident. 

It does, however, make it more likely to happen. So OP's SO should have put his damn seatbelt on. Being in a committed long term relationship, the conditions of this situation should have LONG been worked out before it got to this point.

"Assuming" someone was agreeing to a lifetime commitment by failing to put on a rubber was probably not the best course of action here. With better communication, this situation could have been avoided.
