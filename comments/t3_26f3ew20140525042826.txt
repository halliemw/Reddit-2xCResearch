... what I want to add is that it is really hard if the other person and you don't have shared interests. If you're totally into errr... kite flying, and the other person isn't but is totally into classic ballet (which is something you have no interest in), then it is hard to find a subject to keep talking about. 

So it's not only you, it's also the other person. 

But yeah, part of it can be practiced, and who knows, you might learn more about classic ballet or acting or kite flying or paintball than you ever thought you would know...
