It isn't about protecting you, as much as it is being sick of having to deal with terrible attitudes from women who generalize men, because of other men being pieces of shit. I'd be willing to bet a good portion of the women here could kick my butt. Telling men to stop policing themselves is a terrible idea. It's something that needs to be encouraged, not slammed.
