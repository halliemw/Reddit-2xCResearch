Have you tried joining couchsurfing.org? They run meetups in most cities and its full of travelers & locals and super easy going people. They often go to places that locals know, hikes, adventures etc. English is usually the primary language as well since the users are so diverse.!

you don't have to surf or host to be a member but an extrovert personality & a love for travel often helps :)
