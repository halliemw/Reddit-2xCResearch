While there are problems with any approach that only focuses on one particular group, there are problems, also, with trying to focus on everyone at once. The problem of each individual group is typically so complicated that achieving a real solution requires many people to focus on just that issue, trying to understand it and sort it out. As humans, there are limits to the amount we can hope to thoroughly understand, be that by the limitations of our lifetimes or something else. I do not see a problem with taking a specialization in the consideration of the human condition, provided we understand the limits of its applicability.

Conversely, I would advocate caution, that in the process of trying to include everyone, you (and I, and everyone) do not end up prioritizing the needs and voices of the majority or those already in power.
