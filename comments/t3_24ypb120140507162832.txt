I spend about 4500 on my wedding total. how I saved the most money is by having the ceremony in a park (gorgeous and free), having the wedding on an "off" day and time ( 11am on Sunday FTW), and only having a photographer for the ceremony only and 1/2 hour after for formal pictures. Because we were married in a botanical garden, I didn't need decorations and I felt better splurging on the more expensive chairs. 


Honestly most of our budget was for food. It was a lunch reception so no one was angry about no alcohol. http://www.jasminesbridalshop.com/ was where I got my dress, She does knockoffs of the designer wedding dresses that feel and look amazing and are VERY cheap, but used bridal dresses are a great option too. 

weddingchicks.com has free wedding invitation printables that look VERY professional and you can print them at home on fancy paper ( stardream paper is amazeballs  BTW)

As for rings, I just bought a rose gold plated tungston ring for me and my husband off of ebay. I wear it every day and it looks perfect still, and they were super cheap ($20 each)
