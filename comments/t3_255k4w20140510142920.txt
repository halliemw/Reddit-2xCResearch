I grew up with a parent in the fashion industry so I might be biased, but everyone should tailor their clothes because almost no one can buy clothes that fit perfectly off the rack. I get that for trendier clothes it's super frustrating; I'm pretty pear-shaped so I have the waist taken in all my clothes too and it sucks when you find a cute $20 piece but you'll spend around the same amount getting it altered.
