This probably is why you are not able to connect with people. I can totally relate with you. I grew up in a very well mannered family so like you I am also extremely polite and a true lady around people that I don't know very well. I don't gossip and don't like much drama. As a result I think it is hard for other people to connect with people like us. They really can't relate with what you like or dislike, what your opinions about things are, or  they don't have any stories that reminds them of you. So they don't have anything that they can relate with or remember you for. Once you start to let go it is much easier to make friends. Share small little details about your life with other. It does not have to be anything very personal. For example, I mentioned to a group of people that I love peaches and I can eat just peaches for dinner. After that one of the people sent me a link to a website that has the best sells amazing peaches. They were truly mind-blowing. So I emailed her back to thank her and buy her coffee for introducing me to that and we have been friends since. Share little details like that and it is easier for people with connect with you. And also it is okay to express your opinions. If they don't agree with you that is totally fine. You don't have to be in good terms with everyone. That way you will be able to meet people who you can connect with well.
