I'm picky. I don't like to wade through the Amazon Rainforest and I also don't like barren lands... My BF has a patch of hair on his sternum that I think is lovely, along with a happy trail leading to... hairless happiness. It's goldilocks. (Also a little face scruff is nice when going down. Textures are cool.)
