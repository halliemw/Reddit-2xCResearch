The whole plopping thing is pretty helpful too.  And sleeping with your hair wrapped up, especially if you're like me and shower before bed, going to bed with wet hair.  Don't use a towel to dry your hair with, find an old oversized tshirt or something.  Don't wash your hair every day.  (I wash mine a couple times a week on average)  Avoid using a hair dryer to dry your hair and if you do, a diffuser is what you need.  But yea, definitely check out the curly hair subreddit.
