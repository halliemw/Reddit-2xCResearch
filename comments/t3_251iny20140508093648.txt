It isn't the talking part. It's how **he lied by omission**. He has plenty of female friends, just like I have guy friends. 

And I think I know him better than you do. He really is a bit naive. I certainly admit I apparently didn't know him as well as I thought I did, but either way, I think that he is naive, and several people we both know agree in that statement, so I'm confident in its accuracy. 

~~I asked for support, not negativity. This isn't just you sharing your opinion and advice. IT's being a negative person, who feels the need to exude their negativity on others. It's hostile, too. And detrimental to the success of TwoX getting through the default sub status.~~ <--- I'm a terrible person :/

Edit: I think I took it the wrong way. My bad, overreacting. It's all the other trolls. You can tell yourself you're ready for it, and then you accidentally twist someone else's valid opinion into something bad.
