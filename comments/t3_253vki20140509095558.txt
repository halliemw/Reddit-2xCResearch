I'm male and appalled at your experiences here.  I feel guilty because I could probably have done more to speak out against behavior like that in my own life.  I've heard stories like this before, and maybe it's because I'm older now and more mature in these matters, but your stories really resonate with me now.   I think maybe one of the best things I can do at this point is to raise my son to not be that guy.
