OOOOH I was talking about this a few days ago with Twitter friends, no one hardly ever mentions it, it's like the last hair taboo. Or the last Hairbender. There is no porn, no weird fetish site of nipple hair. So rule 34 is invalid.

I have a few hairs around each areola. When I was a teen, I thought I was the only woman ever to have these. I thought I was a freak, and would either pull them out or shave them stubbornly.
Fast forward to med school and a surgical internship. I've been seeing naked people for over 5 years now. I can't tell you the relief I felt the first time I saw another woman with hairy nipples. If she hadn't been under general anaesthesia, I might have kissed her.
Now I don't really care. Although when I expect someone else to see my nipples I shave them, because they're really dark hair against a very pale skin. Also, they look like pubic hair, only less curly. While I am a kind hearted woman, I don't want my potential lover to be able to floss while sucking on my teat.
