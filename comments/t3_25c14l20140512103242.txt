Your friend doesn't seem like too much of a friend. People often don't realise they're being stupid because, y'know, they're stupid. If you've spelled out how you feel for her before, maybe stop hanging out with her; it sounds like you guys are going to grow apart eventually anyhow. But, if she continues to be selfish and disrespectful like this then maybe it's better for that to happen sooner rather than later.
If you talk with her again about how you feel, some useful advice I've gotten before is to have a list handy of all the things you'd like to say. That way nothing gets left out and you won't leave the conversation feeling like you didn't get your point across.
