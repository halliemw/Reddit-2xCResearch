Maybe now would be a good time to start family counseling? Or maybe just your wife could get some one-on-one time with a counselor. Just bringing up the idea might get your family thinking about it so they might be more receptive to doing something proactive when the time comes to cope. Are your family or your wife's family geographically close to you guys? Setting up a good support network now, so that she doesn't have to when the time comes, could help a lot.

I'm so sorry about what you and your family are going through.
