I found my guy when I was 30. I used internet dating (a website that asked a small monthly contribution, I hoped that that would mean people were serious about this dating thing, and they were indeed). Just keep looking. 

I would say: avoid red pill like the plague. Avoid red pill-guys in real life like the plague as well.
