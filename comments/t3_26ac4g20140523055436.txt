Not IMHO.  People should pay for their own families.  I don't believe I should have to work extra hours or take a pay cut to pay for *your* family.  You want to have a family, great, wonderful, couldn't be happier for you.  Be prepared for the costs, out of your own family's income.  When I have a family, I shall do the same.
