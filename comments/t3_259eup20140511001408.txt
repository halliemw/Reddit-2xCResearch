He thought it was naive because one time this friend had made out with me and I said "stop" but he didn't stop. BUT. I had multiple conversations with this guy, and he had agreed that I wasn't "available" for that and I didn't want to do that anymore. So that's what made me think it was okay to go hangout with him.... because he agreed and we'd hungout before! That's why my boyfriend thinks it was naive. I'm not saying that as....as a justification, but 

1. I do understand his thinking 
2. But I don't understand how it's my fault I was basically lied to
