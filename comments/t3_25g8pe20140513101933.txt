These fundamentalist nutjobs know their strict whack-job ideologies won't gain many converts, so they do their best to entrap their existing members by keeping them isolated, powerless and uneducated, and encouraging them to have as many children as humanly possible at the youngest age possible. It's why they're so against girls' education (or any education that disagrees with their philosophy, really) and enact tight controls over their children's lives. For examples, see the Taliban, Hassidic Judaism, the Duggars and the Quiverfull movement they are part of, and Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints (aka fundamentalist Mormons, many of whom were part of Warren Jeffs' cult).
