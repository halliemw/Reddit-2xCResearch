I definitely understand the feeling of betrayal. When my ex and I broke up, I still wanted to hang out with some of friends I met through him. So I invited them to hang out and they took it as 'She wants me now'. No! no, no, no! If I wanted you, I would have gone out with you instead of my now ex! It was awful thinking I could still be friends with people I'd met and realizing they just viewed me as another available female to have a shot at.
