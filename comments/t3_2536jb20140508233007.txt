I had a pretty terrible case of dry mouth (and a bit of dry throat) for the first couple of weeks when I started Wellbutrin (SR, 300mg) back in October. It was pretty irritating, but dropped off fairly quickly. As for insomnia, I remember having a few pronounced bouts of it at first (which was actually alright with me, as hypersomnia was a huge problem before that), and it does occasionally return but never as severe or for as long as when I first began the medication. 


The only worrying thing that happened to me within the first few weeks of adjusting to the medication was that I had an anxiety attack about 2 weeks in. Pretty disconcerting considering this had never happened to me in my life, however I was able to talk myself through it, and it hasn't happened since. I did a little searching around online to see if this was a common occurrence, and it seems that if you already have issues with anxiety (which I suppose I do), Wellbutrin can sometimes exacerbate them. My therapist also confirmed this when I brought it up with her. 


As for how I felt: I was pretty amazed at actually being able to wake up in the morning (and stay up), and I never felt tired in the afternoons anymore, whereas before, I used to be exhausted by around 5-6pm regardless of when I got up or what I did in that time. All in all it's been an incredibly positive experience with fairly mild side effects. 

I'd wager your insomnia will taper off within the month (hopefully sooner), but like others have said: if it doesn't get better, gets worse, or you just have concerns about the side effects you're feeling, talk to your psychiatrist - follow-up is part of their job. 

Finally, I just wanted to add: congratulations on taking this step, OP! Asking for help in this situation takes way more guts than a lot of people might think, so hurray for you for taking care of yourself!
