Don't rush kids.  Split the difference maybe.  What about two or three years?  

My husband will most likely be 49 when we have our first (depending on when we get pregnant).  I'm not saying the timing is ideal, but it's how things have worked out and we're going with it.  And it's not just looks, it's lifestyle and mindset too that really makes you think someone is old.  There are people who are old at 50 and people who are young at 75 -- obviously we're hoping for the latter.  

Food for thought: [Here are some people who are allegedly old](http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/quick-way-to-make-todays-stars-seem-old.html).  If your husband is 63 when your kids graduate high school, he won't necessarily be Jack Lemmon.
