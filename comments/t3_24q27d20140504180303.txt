He always insists that I should go out and make girl friends, so I think he would like them, but you're right, it is a little concerning. He claims it is not jealousy, but I'm starting to think it may be. 

One thing I forgot to mention: not that I am advocating his actions or blaming myself, but I did have a relationship with a coworker prior to dating G (G used to be my boss, obviously he isn't anymore since we are dating). That's why I'm so severely against being nice to my coworkers, I don't want them getting the slightest idea. It's fearful, but I can't think of a better way to be in situations with them. 

I do wear makeup, I lurk on makeupaddiction all day long! Thank you for the advice, I'm really taking yours and the other posters advice here to heart!
