My friend is strange. She yells back at them, and puts on her best "deaf voice". Which I'm sure is very offensive to deaf people... or maybe not because they can't hear it. Either way, any deaf people reading this, I'm sorry if that offends you.

She'll always yell back in a deaf voice "I'm sorry. I can't hear. Can you speak slower so I can read your lips. Do you need directions, sir?". They almost always just stand there paralyzed for 3-5 seconds and they say "I'm sorry" and leave.
