With you there, too! It's like they don't think they should have to witness the hurt they caused...

 I ended my relationship because he couldn't cut contact with his ex who  has been toying with him since they met and I was never angry that he wasn't over her yet (else she wouldn't get under his skin) but so upset that he would lie to my face about it so many times. I took him back so many times because he said he was over her but she just pries her way back in like a snake. The most fucked up part is that until about two weeks ago she was in a long term relationship while she made sure to shit on mine. 

She comes into the bar at my job and sits closest to my now ex. Now that I have been promoted to bar I have to try and act like I'm not extremely upset while they now openly talk. I'm humiliated. . :( rant over

Ive never loved someone so much and letting go of it has been the hardest emotional obstacle of my life so far.
