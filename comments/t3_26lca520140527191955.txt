I don't know your age, but I'm assuming you're in your 20's as that's the demographic on reddit.  All I'd say is, there ARE better guys out there, but there are a lot of young men who are really stupid.  Whether this guy is actually misogynist, or whether he just spouts crap on his twitter that makes him seem so, we don't really know.  Keep in mind that people's personalities are vastly different online and in person.  He might be tweeting to his "bros" who expect that kind of garbage.  Doesn't forgive him, but it's understandable.

It's a part of the culture, in some places.  Hopefully for his sake, he'll grow up and realize that kind of attitude is ignorant as hell and that he doesn't need to parrot his buddy's stupid ass comments to be respected.

If not, find an older guy who's had a little more time to wise up to the ways of the world and how a man should behave.
