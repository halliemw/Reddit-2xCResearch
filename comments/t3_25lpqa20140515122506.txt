When I was younger I was afraid to talk to doctors. I would just nod and say yeah I'm fine. Didn't ask questions. As I got older I realized that there really isn't anything you can say or ask a doctor that hasn't been said or asked before. Even if you think it's a dumb question, they have heard it a million times. Now I ask everything I can think of and they seem to appreciate my wanting to understand. I have no shame at my docs office now.
