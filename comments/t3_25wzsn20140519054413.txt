I agree, you have to think of yourself. If nothing else, could you stay with your partner and be happy if you have up what you felt you needed to do to stay with him, especially if it were just for him to be 'directionless'? I know I personally would have a hard time not being bitter or resentful (which is my own problem) and I don't think the relationship would last. 

Many people have made it through long distance, and if that is what you two want to do, in sure you can work on it. Many others decide to move on, and that is ok and healthy, too. But don't put your life on hold for something you're so uncomfortable about.
