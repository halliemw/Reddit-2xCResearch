The analysis of compassion is a common formula in Louis.  By expressing personal opinion, without being muddled by a preconceived standard of fact or truth on the particular topic, a sense of compassion and respect is instilled in the viewer.  In outlining personal values in an honest form, we can easily interpret the importance for ourselves.  This improves the comedy by better delineating the incongruence between what is presented versus what may or may not have become a social norm.
