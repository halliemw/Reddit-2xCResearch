No no, it does look sickly. I have greyish complexion, if I eat too much gluten it gets blotchy, I have dark circles... It's ok, that's what a real human being looks like, but I feel more confident when I'm wearing some foundation and eye liner. Also, I feel like saying one look is better than the other isn't very feminist or empowering.
