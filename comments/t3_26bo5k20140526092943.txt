Yes!!! I moved to a small office, with only five of us. It was a very laidback atmosphere, and it was soooo nice after the high-stress office I had come from. Not long after, three of the girls were moved to a different department, and it was just my supervisor and me, which was one of the best working experiences ever. Then, quite abruptly, the higher-ups decided to move us to the main office, and everything has been pretty awful since. One of the supervisors micromanages us to death, and throws tantrums (and that's no exaggeration-shrieking, swearing, etc) when the mood strikes. It is SO not what I signed on for! I feel your pain!
