During the treatment I was not allowed to have sex at all. I don't know whether my chances of becoming pregnant would have increased a tremendous amount due to the medications, but that's why I assume I was not allowed to have sex. I honestly have no idea what would have happened had I gotten pregnant during the treatment. Most likely, the clinic would have asked me to terminate all of the medication and the donation process would have been stopped.
