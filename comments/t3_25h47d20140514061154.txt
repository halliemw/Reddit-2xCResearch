There is a big difference between someone breaking laws to take your property and someone breaking laws to use you as property, for physical or sexual purposes. 

As a man, you are surrounded by 50% women and 50% men who are overwhelmingly heterosexual. Out of the gay ones, overwhelmingly most will be law abiding on purpose and not try to assault you. You literally have a very small chance of being sexually abused by a strange man. And physical violence ... While still horrible, will not happen without a particular reason, at least, not overwhelmingly. **Most people will brat you up to get to X.**

As a woman, 50% of men are heterosexual and overwhelmingly stronger than you. Even if a small amount are not law abiding, a small amount out of 59% is a lot. And the amount is **cultural**. In patriarchal societies more than a small amount might rationalize raping you or kidnapping you. Basically the only thing protecting me as a woman is a thin glaze of civilization and statistical chance that I won't encounter someone who disregards that. Men won't beat you up to get X. As a woman you ARE x. Let that sink in for a moment. 


It's not about every man being violent. Of course they won't. Men have just as much capability of being decent folk as anyone. But it's about fear. And risk. If 5% of men choose to be violent to women, there is nothing I can do about it (and please do 't bring in guns and self protection). It's just a fact of life that every woman has to live with. And whether 5% of all men choose to be violent, and 95% are decent it won't make you sleep better at night. if I am a victim of a violent crime, my statistics have gone from zero to 1, not from sero to 0,05. I am a victim, it's over. Well technically it 's not over because I can become a victim at any point, again and again. 

So yeah, igetting back to the subject at hand. Someone propositioning you and beng turned down, is an exercise in statistics. Maybe he will accept. Maybe he won't. Maybe he will take offense and call you a bitch. Maybe he will take offense, call you a bitch and then wait for you in the parking lot to show you a piece of his mind. 

So yeah, calling a woman a bitch is heavy and awful and potentially threatening.  Imagine two dogs, one small and one big. Even if the small dog starts barking in aggression, the big dog should not respond in like (and most don't and have more careful ways of dealing tinier things like small dogs and puppies). If you pay attention, many bigger dogs will use softer moves, lat down at the level of the smaller dog and allow him to yap and not take it as aggression. They know what's up. 

Just a small disclaimer, because some might read into it, this does not mean to justify woman on man violence, nor argue that men should take it or whatever. This is strictly when someone is merely turning someone down, and is perceived as rude or not.
