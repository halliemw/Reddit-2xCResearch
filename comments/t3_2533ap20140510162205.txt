I think they were more implying crying over the loss than the haircut -  at least I hope so, because they were cutting my hair! Maybe this bad experience is what has made you want longer hair? And I mean, in one way it's practical; longer hair can always be cut again into a nicer cut the next day, while if it's too short, you can't regrow it right away.

But yes, apparently long hair is a big thing that makes women more attractive in the opinion of many guys I have met. So, you may actually be more attractive to a certain subset of guys who like long hair.

I don't think it's "silly and vain", I am just honestly confused. To me, hair is like fingernails. If I chop it off, it will eventually grow back, so why worry? But it's totally up to you how long you want to wear it or prefer it.
