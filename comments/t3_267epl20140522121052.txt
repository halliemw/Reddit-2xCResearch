You should think about getting a doula! A doula is a person who acts as a liaison between you (the birthing mother) and the nurses/doctors at the hospital you choose to birth at. Lots of doulas are willing to do trades, barters or financial plans, and they can provide lots of birthing information and advice. 

On the other hand, if you absolutely can't afford it, feel free to message me and I can email you any/all information you need or want, my mom is a doula and I can ask her for you if you'd like. :)
