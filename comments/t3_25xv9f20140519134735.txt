The article discusses harassment/abuse that originates online while focusing on *one* particular case study of how *one* company decided to tackle it.

Because the article uses a single case study to also discuss the larger issue does not mean the article is not addressing anything outside of the LoL community. That's why it, you know, specifically mentions social media sites and other forms of online interaction.

> That's why threats of physical violence carry no weight.

This is not true and I have demonstrated that. Go gaslight somewhere else.
