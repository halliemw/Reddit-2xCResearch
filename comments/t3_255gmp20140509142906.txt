I can't help you with the birth aspect, but periods are like... hmm.

Well, you know when you're running and you get a cramp in your leg? At *first* it's really sharp and painful, but after a minute or two it kind of goes deeper and gets a little more dull, but it still really hurts? Combine that with when you've eaten *just* a little too much food and you're not quite nauseous, but you're almost nauseous, and then put that feeling into your lower abdomen. Also, your back hurts a lot, like you lifted and carried a lot of heavy things yesterday.

And you don't feel like you're *irrationally* angry or irritable or sad at all; it just feels like suddenly, everything happening is really annoying or hurtful. You feel like you're responding normally to *abnormal situations*, but then someone is like "Wow, calm down, are you on your period or something?" and you realize you must be acting weird. But to you, it genuinely seems like everyone else is being meaner than usual.

And your whole face breaks out in acne suddenly, which somehow surprises you every month even though it happens every month.

And no matter how much you shower, you just feel kind of... gross for a few days. I don't know *what* causes this one, I just know I always feel a little dirty and sweaty (all over, not just down there), like I didn't take a shower.

Plus you get blood on tons of your favorite clothes, which eventually teaches you to just dress like a hobo as much as possible during your period.
