Perhaps she doesn't want to go through 9 months of pregnancy? She'll have to drop out of school, perhaps lose contact with friends, suffer the judgements of society as her stomach grows and experience many physical changes that even takes a toll on middle-aged women. It's a life-changing and doing it all for the benefit of someone else (she isn't a gestational carrier) doesn't seem worth it at 15 years old.
