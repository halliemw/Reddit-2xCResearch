I was going to mention Taylor swift as well. If your daughter is a fan I'd look up a few articles about her discussing her height. She often talks openly about it and how being tall isn't going to stop her from wearing heels or dressing how she pleases. She's also never let her height get in the way of dating as the headlines say. 

When you're 13 being tall is a curse, but there are tons of tall athletes and (positive) celebrities to turn too!
