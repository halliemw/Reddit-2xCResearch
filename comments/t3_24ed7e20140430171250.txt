I'm sorry you experienced that.  He should have asked before he took the condom off.

The thing is that trembling can be a sign of sexual excitement or pleasure.  Body language is ambiguous.  Do you know why you never asked him to stop?  I'm not blaming you, fear can make people mute.  It's just the whole thing seems a bit weird.  Did he ever threaten you in some way?  Did he ever imply that he would hurt you if you ever said no to him?  You knew him well, I guess I just don't understand why you couldn't say no.  Sorry for saying so.
