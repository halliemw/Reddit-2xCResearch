I suspect that you don't know a few of the people on my list, then.  Ganges Kahn's people LOVED him.  Ned Kelly, while hated by the English, was pretty popular with the actual people who lived in Australia and is kind of a cultural hero.  Nero was practically raised by the Roman army and was their darling for a long time.  Lu Bu is painted as both a villain and tragic romantic figure.  Hannibal is still a favorite of histories although the Romans certainly would not appreciate that he is.  

Edit:  I have one you can't deny:  John Dillinger.  Look him up.
