For your time problem; /r/EatCheapAndHealthy and /r/budgetfood have a lot of suggestions for making stuff in bulk, you can make it for example on Sunday evening and refridge/freeze for the rest of the week. This way, you control what you eat and don't have to spend too much time on it. 

Also; are you really kind of busy? If you find yourself able to browse Reddit for hours in the evening, you have time to cook as well! :) And practice makes you do everything much faster in the long run; I was always very lazy and bought pre-sliced vegetables and meats etc. because I found that it cost too much time to slice all these things, but I've become determined to learn to do it faster and it is going much better already. It just has to become a habit. 

Other things you can consider is your portion sizes; do you eat accurate portions? Many portion sizes in restaurants are too big because they want you to leave with a full feeling; if you leave and you are hungry afterwards, you will blame the restaurant for not giving you enough food and not worth your money. You can find out what normal portion sizes are by weighing your food and calculating how many calories are in it, and using online resources to find out what normal calorie amounts for meals are.
