I'm still a little confused as to why he considered at all abandoning his religion/ turning his back on god when you seem to be so supportive of him being religious.  Did something spark that?  Or did he just come to the conclusion that itd be easier if you tso believed the same thing?  If all you've ever done is say "I respect your believes and i'm willing to support you in them, I just don't share them" and at no point ever tried to tell him his believes are wrong, how can he possibly think the devil sent you to test him?  Hopefully, he can calm down from this, see what he has, this great thing in his life, maybe even think god sent you into his life to make him happy, and you guys can just go back to being happy again.  
Relationships need a lot of things : trust, understanding, respect, sacrifice, comprimise, etc.  Though I believe that no one should have to sacrifice what makes them them, such as believes, likes, hobbies, friends, family, etc.  You werent asking him to give up his religion, he shouldnt ask you to believe (or fake believe) when you don't.
On a bit of a lighter side to end this, that's a bit of an ego he has to think that satan, the ultimate cosmic evil, would take a personal interest in him out of the billions on earth and try to turn him to "the dark side"  by using you  :-P
