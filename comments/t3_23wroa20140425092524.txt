There is NOTHING endearing about forced sexual orientation stereotypes. What her family is doing is beyond disgusting. If this was a mom saying these things to her effeminate heterosexual male son, would we find it so endearing? If this were a work place telling her to do her makeup just a little bit more for the men, would we find it so endearing? This family needs a lesson in shaming, social/gender awareness and the meaning of real acceptance. If they really didn't have any hang ups, then they would just love their daughter. The end. Instead in some sort of screwed up intent to appear cool or accepting, they're forcing her into something because of stereotypes. There is nothing endearing about this.
