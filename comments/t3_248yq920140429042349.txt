Ugh, YES!! My brother is very immature and still acts like a teenager and my mother is a drama queen. The pair are always having issue's and treat me like the middle man.

I feel like I'm always being there for them and other members of my family but no one is there for me, they just expect me to sort out their issues and be Mrs. Mediator. It's getting very old very fast.
