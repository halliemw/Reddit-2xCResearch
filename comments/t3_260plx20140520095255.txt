Maybe this isn't really what you were trying to say, but it's a little unfair to assume the friend in this scenario is being fickle:  it sounds like she still has a constant and happy relationship with OP, but that doesn't mean she can't make close friendships with others.  The number of friendships a person can maintain depends on their personality and the time they devote to those relationships; she may be legitimately closer to these other ladies because she has had the opportunity to spend more time with them in the past several years.  That doesn't make her a bad friend, or fickle.  People tend to be emotionally closer to the people they are physically closer to.
