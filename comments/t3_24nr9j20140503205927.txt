>Why cant I get over it?

Because it's your first. All break ups are hard but when it's your first, you don't have anything to fall back on. 

Take your time, be kind to yourself, do things that are affirming for you, and you'll find yourself aiming for someone who will treat you as well as you treat yourself the next time around.
