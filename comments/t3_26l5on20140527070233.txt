Use a "dirty job" towel under you while you masturbate. Wear disposable gloves if the ick factor gets to you and you're not allergic to the material. If you're dry you can try a tad bit of coconut oil for your adventures. Most of all, find a position you like and all.

I had a dumbass ex who did not understand that I was more comfortable lying down to 'bate or that I preferred to use oil, so of course he harassed me about it. Fuck him. Did what was comfortable to me--especially on a period.
