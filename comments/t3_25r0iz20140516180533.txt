Now you are single, do yourself a favor and address your anxiety. Speak with a doctor, try some medication and counseling, or take up yoga or meditation and get on top of your anxiety. You owe it to yourself. You need to be stable for you - in order to have the rest of your life and relationships work well. Take care and good luck. PS, I'd move out if you can.
