You sound like a trained counselor.  This is ridiculously helpful, much more than I was expecting.  Thank you.

Everyone gets to hear her complain.  My sisters that take the brunt of the responsibilities, his visiting nurse, my partner and I, everyone.  My mom actually does very little, but your comment "*You have to realise, that for her, it is hard on her, and if she has no capacity for empathy or compassion, she probably thinks that it's harder for her than for your father. That will probably never change*" really hit me-- I think you are dead-on.  I think she is so accustomed to doing nothing except what she wants to do that when she has to do something unpleasant, even if its minor, it's a huge hurdle for her.  You have really put this into perspective for me.
