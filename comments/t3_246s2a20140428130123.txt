The rape scene in last week's episode pissed people off because it completely diverges from what the books had and it completely changes Jaime's character. Yeah, incest is bad and in terms of consent, there's a gray area in the books when it comes to that scene. The original scene actually could have sparked better discussion about consent than the obvious black and white scene they turned it into.
