I honestly do not think you understand my point. Misogyny was a driving force. Okay sure. He hated women; this isn't under debate. The fact you seem to glaze over is the fact that sane minded people DO NOT KILL OVER THAT. You can hate someone til the cows come home. That doesn't mean you are going to shoot them to death. Hatred has caused people to do awful things to other people, but generally killing each other isn't something a right minded person does or even considers. Yes, he hated women. BUT you are failing to take into consideration the fact that he was clearly mentally disturbed and that this was the underlying factor of it all. This isn't some opportunity to make a public agenda of women's rights. You know what he was more than misogynistic? Narcissistic. He thought because he had money and good looks, he deserved the world, that he's entitled. So, sure, let's talk about changing the fact that a lot of guys determine their worth around getting laid along with how women are seen as objects. Talk about how sex is seen in general by the media. How money affects people's values. Make a big public forum about it. BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. You're ignoring just how full of himself this guy was and just how out of touch with reality he was, to the point he felt the whole world needed to die besides himself. As a woman, I know we aren't treated equally, and it sucks. People with mental illnesses are treated worse.  I will agree to disagree with you, but honestly I think you should sort out your priorities.
