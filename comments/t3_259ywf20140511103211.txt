> I'm considering saying something to the bride.

Absolutely say something, but DO NOT ASSUME that she's being a rude asshole who didn't invite you. That will put her on the defensive and start drama you don't need. Call her up and say, "Hi Sally, I haven't received my invitation to your wedding yet. I want to make sure I get my response card back to you on time. Since it seems like this one got lost in the mail, could you pop another in the mail?"

If she sent you a save the date, there's really no way she wouldn't invite you to the wedding. I had at least 5 invites get lost in the mail when I got married, and we had a relatively small wedding with under 75 people. I think it's quite likely yours got lost.
