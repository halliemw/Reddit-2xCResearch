It's actually used in headlines in all kinds of publications. It's meant to be there to reduce the appearance of editorializing. For example if a newspaper gets a quote from a man saying "These pies are great!" the headline would say *Man eats "great" pies*. That lets you know it's not the opinion of the newspaper, just of the man. It is a technique often used by tabloids to stir up drama though.
