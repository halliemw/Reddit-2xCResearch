I've always thought that a good old fashioned BBQ is just the perfect party for a reception.

Raid costco for buns and hot dogs and meat for burgers. Have everyone bring chips and a side or beer. 

Set up picnic tables in the backyard and a couple of boom boxes and you're good to go! 

It's cheap, intimate, and who the hell can say no to pulled pork and your aunts famous seven layer dip?
