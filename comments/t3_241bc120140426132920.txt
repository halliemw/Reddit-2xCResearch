when I got interviewed for my first job out of university, they asked if I was married.  I said no, and that I don't plan on having children in my lifetime because I want to concentrate on my career. That way you are telling them that you will not take maternity time off.   THen again, you might come off as 'cold' for not wanting to be a mother.  Maybe it's a 'screwed either way' type of thing.  IDK.   Hopefully that was the correct answer lol.  Employers want to know that you will be a good little corporate drone/slave which, I think, speaks to some of the more unfortunate elements of our current society :/
