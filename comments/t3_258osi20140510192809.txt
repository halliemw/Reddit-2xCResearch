That is good advice, and I do that frequently -- in college, I pledged the same sorority she was in, and I often talk to the alumna about their memories of her.  She also has one living sister that I often call with questions (especially about family recipes!)  My cousins are also often eager to talk about her, though of course their recollections, like my own, are seen through the lens of childhood.

And while that is all wonderful, and I appreciate knowing she had an impact on so many people, and learning about how she affected them, I recognize that everyone is going to bring their own agenda to their recollections.  We are not biased on purpose, but just because the way we see others is often colored by our own experiences and who we want them to be.  I acknowledge that is present, even in my own version of who she was.  I daydream about the awesome relationship we would have had now that I'm grown, and how she would have helped me with the hobbies of hers I have picked up, and we would be such good friends! But I also recognize that isn't necessarily how it would be, in the alternate timeline where she did not die.  I was just entering my troubled teen years -- how much would we have fought, and how would that have affected our relationship?  Would she have disproved of life choices I've made? Would I have even picked those hobbies up in the first place if I wasn't trying to find connections to her?  

And so, it is truth by way of averages -- I hear the version of her her sorority sisters remember; I hear the version of her my dad remembers; I hear the version of her my older siblings remember; I hear the versions of her that her students remember (she was a teacher).  And somewhere, between the overlaps and the variations, a portrait emerges.
