My husband took it as a teen, apparently it also helps with migraines. He had a mental episode. Violent, uncontrollable. He says that he could see himself doing it, but couldn't stop himself. He trashed his room, threw a keyboard stand through his door. He picked up his computer to do the same and suddenly had clarity and stopped. He never took it again.
