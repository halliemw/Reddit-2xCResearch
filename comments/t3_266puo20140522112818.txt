I would absolutely back out and likely just forget about the friendship. She obviously would rather have a Pinterest party than friends (and honestly, it sounds like you're a filler anyway). I got married last summer. We did a joint bachelor-bachelorette party at a local food festival, I found a great site with low prices and tons of dress options (I gave them a color and a fabric), gave them shoe ideas when they asked (they ended up buying $16 flats), made them necklaces and provided earrings, and gave them the option of having their hair done or doing it themselves. Everything went smoothly, they looked great, everyone was happy. I don't get brides like this "friend."
