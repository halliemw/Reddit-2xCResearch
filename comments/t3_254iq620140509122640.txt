Yes! Was gonna ask if OU stood for what I hoped it stood for; that's my alma mater too. Try not to let the idea of busting out into the real world worry you too much - I had like a big teary eyed existential crisis/freak-out the morning before my graduation, but I've ended up absolutely loving where my path has led me from there. Congratulations!
