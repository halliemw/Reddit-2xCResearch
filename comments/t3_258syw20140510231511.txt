Part of the problem with Texas law is that both statutory rape and rape are codified side by side in the same statute.  [Link](http://law.onecle.com/texas/penal/22.011.00.html).  22.011.f points out the penalty for the both is the same except for the judges discretion.  It isn't clear if the plea was to 22.011.a.1 or 22.011.a.2.  If he pled to the latter, even though the crime would be reported as the same as the other option, he may have been given a slap on the wrist for stat rape.  Even though the reported facts of the case show it was a violation of 22.011.a.1, the fact that it is so similar and not knowing the details of the plea deal offered (if any) leaves doubt as to what happened here.

  With the Polanski case, the same thing happened.  Anyone who read the facts of the case know it was clearly forced and in no way statutory, but Polanski was offered a plea deal for stat and thus that is, per the official record, what happened.

What we need is a ban on allowed stat to be a plea deal when the charge is rape, because to let the accused plea to stat is for the legal system to paint a different picture of the situation where the victim consented but wasn't able to.  This is nothing short of a slap in the face to any victims out there who now much read a court conviction that states they did say yes, just it was invalid.

This by no means solves all of the problems with rape culture, but it does solve some of them.
