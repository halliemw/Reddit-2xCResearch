I am looking into therapy. I have been in therapy before, but I just started a new job with new insurance so I am looking for someone new. It'll be good, for this and just in general.

Yes, I have been in something abusive before. I don't think I choose abusive partners. Maybe there is something that is similar between the people who have abused me that I am not seeing - besides them being abusive. But I don't think anyone actively chooses to be with someone abusive. I don't think that is what you are saying though. 

I do think people who are abusive might choose someone who was victimized/abused before. However, I don't know what any of them were thinking when it happened.
