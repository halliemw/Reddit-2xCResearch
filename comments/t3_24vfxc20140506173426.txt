My ex nearly had no body hair and I really don't consider that as manly.

My current BF has lots of body hair and I love it. I love it when we cuddle naked and his chest hair tickles my nose. I like it when his hair tickles my body while we are having sex - this is amazing.

The only two parts that needs to be shaved are the pubic area and the armpits - I like to blow him (finally) and I hate having hair in my mouth afterwards and after some sweaty sex armpit-hair would be very nasty.
