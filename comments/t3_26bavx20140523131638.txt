It's one thing for two drunk people to have sex. 

It's another thing to start fondling someone WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING. The reason I call him a predator is because his actions seem pre-meditated. He was the one who suggested you stay at his place, not your friends. He is the one who found the futon "unbearable." 

He then told you you "agreed" to cuddling the next day - he was trying to cover his bases and make you feel like he hadn't done anything wrong.

Surprise, surprise, another really drunk girl ended up in his bed, and he had sex with her even though "she was so out of it."

I've been in a college party culture before, and I've seen people do a lot of dumb things, and have some regretful sex. That's not the situation here. When people do what this guy does, they're rapists.

How many more women do you want him to do this to?
