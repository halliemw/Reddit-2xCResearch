No problem! I inserted and removed it twice before my period started, and that was all I needed to feel comfortable enough to use it once it actually started. The first time I inserted it, it felt somewhat uncomfortable/I could feel it, so I took it out right away. Then I waited until later in the day and gave it another try. That time, I couldn't feel it at all (much like a tampon). I guess you just know it's in correctly when you can't feel it. You should not be able to notice anything at all.
