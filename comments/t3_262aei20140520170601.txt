Thank you for taking the time to write this! 

I was expecting, and still am, pitch forks being thrown at me for these thoughts, so I appreciate your message. I probably opened a can of worms here and kind of regret posting it, but I really wanted to share my feelings and see if anyone else had similar experiences.

I mentioned in another reply that I definitely know many women who have had no attachment to their baby during their pregnancy, whether it was wanted or not (a lot of the times a planned pregnancy actually, they were shocked to feel...nothing), and I get that. But you are right, I was one of those people who, though I never thought I would get pregnant for health reasons, never thought I even wanted children, and now that I am pregnant I think baby brain has taken over.
