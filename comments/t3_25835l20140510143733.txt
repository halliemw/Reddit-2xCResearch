Well, the pill is still an option...unless you can't get to the doctors in the next 2 weeks. I understand if you don't want the hassle of dealing with potential side effects while you're away though!

If you do get a cup then you can practice with it even if you're not on (unlike tampons!). Use a bit of lube though. It can take a bit of getting used to - I love mine though, would never go back to tampons.
