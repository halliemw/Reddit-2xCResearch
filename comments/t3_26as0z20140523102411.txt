No, car maint. is a good example... but we're not living together yet. He might do the mowing (right now I pay a kid to do it), I don't know. We both get our own car's oil changed, and inspections and maintenance, and we both keep track of when it needs to be done. So, even though I don't mow or change oil myself, I know those things need to be done, and I schedule them. But this might be a good place to start the discussion - with something he may be more familiar with?
