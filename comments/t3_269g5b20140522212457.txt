PTSD is exactly what the name implies and lots of life events are traumatic. The reason it initially became a diagnosis was because we saw it more prevalently in veterans, but it applies to any traumatic experience.

OP, I'm so glad you're getting help for this and feeling the need to open up to close ones about this. You don't have to work through this alone!
