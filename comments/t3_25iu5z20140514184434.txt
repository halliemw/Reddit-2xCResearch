Ah, thank you for this. I know that everyone has experienced something like this, but it's nice to hear that there is solidarity behind it. 

I broke up with my boyfriend like 3~ish months ago, and while I was fine initially, I think lately his absence caught up to me. He was my best friend, and I miss having an emotional connection like that with someone. But yes thank you, and it will get better
