It's controversial for a lot of a reasons. While its heart may be in the right place, its methodologies are...questionable, and what it chooses to target and how are problematic. It fights things like religion - which always opens up a big can of worms - while having topless marches. There have been criminal cases against them for hooliganism, vandalism, public indecency, and generally being nuisances. People object to them because they are extreme, yes, but more than that, they come off as making a mockery of what feminism is and putting a bad picture on it. Others say they're more interested in self-promotion than actually discussing issues, and still others criticise their extreme west-centricness. They're a bit like the PETA of the feminism world. They have their supporters, but their methods and philosophy leave a lot to be desired.
