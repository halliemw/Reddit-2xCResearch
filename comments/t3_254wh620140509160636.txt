Thank you, I think it's getting better as well, there are still a lot of legitimate concerns that we're hearing and seeing but things seem to be settling down enough that we can read through it easier. The TMI influx and IFF surely boosted a lot of spirits, I know it boosted mine and the other mods. I laughed my ass off last night when it started, those posts have always been one of my favorite things about this community.

I'm in the in between group on whether we are a teaching subreddit or not. I think in some contexts it is okay and others not so much, and that's how I tend to moderate. One thing I always try to remind myself of is not only are some of the questions from guys a lot are from young girls that aren't exposed to strong women in their daily lives. Or they are but they don't feel comfortable (because teenager!) asking anyone in real life. 

We have some amazingly strong, empathetic, and wonderful women here and if they feel comfortable answering questions (a lot do) we're glad to provide that space, if they don't there's often no reason not to let someone else do so. For an extreme example [we wrote this FAQ up about a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/faq#wiki_i.27m_prolife.2C_everyone_else_here_appears_to_be_prochoice.2C_am_i_allowed_to_post_here.3F) when we saw an uptick in prolife users. That's basically our moderation philosophy on most subjects talked about here, there's a time and a place for discussion and there's a time and a place for support. 

I'm hesitant to add those subreddits more prominently right now, they are both in our related subreddits but the difference in traffic would be huge for them I think. There is a bit of a difference between picking the posts we redirect there after removing and hanging a bigger spotlight on those subreddits. We would want to talk to their moderators first. We do remove posts from guys already under a spectrum. Questions about penis size and 'how do I get this woman to like me" are obvious removals on the other side of the spectrum posts that ask us how to support their [lady friends will still be allowed](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1vadf2/ive_been_asked_to_be_the_designated_driver_for_my/) if that makes sense. 

As for new mods, we added 2 this morning and will be adding more. We knew going into this that we would need more moderators, but adding too many at once in the middle of chaos could lead to more chaos. Do stay tuned on that front!
