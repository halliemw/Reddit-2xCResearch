I had a sports event to go to a few days into my first one, to which my dad took me. I was talking to my mom on the phone, and not realizing she was on speaker in the car, she started asking about how it was all going. Of course, as a twelve year old, I was mortified. After we hung up my dad said, "you know, it happens to all of us.... well no, *that* doesn't happen to all of us.... it happens to the best of us!" Looking back, I've always thought that was really cute and sweet.
