This makes no sense.  We could paint an abortion as a doctor acting on their belief it is fine and thus it would be perfectly fine to ban any doctor assisted abortions, because it involves two people.  And it would be perfectly fine to ban homosexuality or homosexual marriage because it involves two people.
