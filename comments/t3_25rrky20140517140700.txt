Former New Yorker here. I usually walked the same routes everyday and never once had an issue. I knew my local bums, and thugs, and kids, and grandpas. Everyone looked out for each other. I know that is not always the case. Whenever I did go somewhere new/different I just was confident in my stance. A few times I congregated with other ladies on the subway and walked part of the way with them.
