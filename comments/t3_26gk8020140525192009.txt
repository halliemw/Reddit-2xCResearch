This sort of subject boils my blood whenever I come across it on Reddit. It doesn't matter how much cleavage the child shows, how short her skirt is, how much she flirts with you, or how much you think she likes you, she is still the child with a child's brain (plus hormones experienced at that age), and you are the adult with the adult brain and willpower!


This is not that difficult of a concept to grasp.
