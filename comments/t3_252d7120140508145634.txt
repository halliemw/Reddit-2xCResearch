Your belief is definitely not wrong. It is your body and you get to choose what you do with it. If you want to wait until marriage to have sex then you have every right to do so. Don't ever feel like pressured to do something if it isn't right for you.
 
However, if you don't mind I would like to share my thoughts on all this as someone who formerly held similar views. I am not trying to tell you that your views are wrong, but I would like to have an open discussion with you about sex. 

As I stated before I used to have similar views on sex, but after being with him for a few years and having many open discussions about sex I decided to lose my virginity, and afterwards I felt disillusioned. Even though I felt ready to have sex with my SO, I was a bit scared, which is natural, but part of that definitely stemmed from the expectations that I would be losing a part of myself after having sex but no such thing happened. Like most things, sex is defined by the people involved and I do find it a little sad that you seem to think of sex as a tool for male enjoyment only. I think sex should be about both partners' enjoyment. And in my experience, sex has been a way for my so and me to feel as physically close as we do emotionally.

 Sorry that this response was so long! I tried to keep it as short as possible and still don't feel like I said everything I wanted.
