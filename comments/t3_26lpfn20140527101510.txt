You are doing the things and taking care of the things he would otherwise be unable to do himself. You are essentially taking care of everything for him outside of work, while you work and school and cope with mental illness. I am in the exact same situation I know this feel well. Dealing with mental illness is enough to have on your plate on it's own, I'm proud of you for even having the motivation to get these things done. MY family is the same, just remember its not all about money. The house needs to be looked after, things need to be CARED for and taken care of, not just PAID for.
Remember this.
