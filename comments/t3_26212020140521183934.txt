I want to trust you when you say you're taking community concerns into account, so may I suggest *much* stricter moderation, Ã  la creepyPMs or AskHistorians? There are so many threads discussing sensitive, personal topics like rape and assault that get interjected with "well-meaning" comments that are extremely upsetting to both OPs and users who might be triggered by them. And quite often, the comments either aren't deleted, aren't deleted quickly, or don't result in a ban. I would much prefer a mod team that was too heavy with the banhammer rather than too light. Granted, you'll probably need [many more mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/about/moderators) in order to make this work, but that's true anyway now that this place is a default.
