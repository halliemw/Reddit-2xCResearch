It's either that or "I bet you're fat and unattractive". 

I grew up with 3 brothers who played video games, it's in my blood. I've been heavily involved in MMORPGs. I now prefer using male characters to avoid this but God forbid I join a raid with voice chat! It's "Omg a girl" and when I reply I'm a happily married woman it's "I bet you and your husband are fat nerds". 

Luckily I feel the girl gamer population is becoming bigger which seems to help.
