>What kind of backlash do you get when you say you're a woman and in what context? 

My ideas and opinions are dismissed and I am threatened with sexual violence. Quite frequently actually, and even when the post that inspired the "comments" does not reveal my gender. This never used to happen when I actively avoided revealing my gender (a hold over from my time at /b/). My ideas and responses did not change. How others responded did.
