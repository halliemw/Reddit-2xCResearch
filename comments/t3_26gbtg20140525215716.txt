> I think it is icky and would have trouble enjoying that kind of sex, therefore would not cave in and give him the one sided unenjoyable (for me) sex.

It's.. ugh, messy. I "enjoy" the sex, but only because he verbally/physically frames it like he's interested in getting back together or whatever, and he was the first guy I've ever fallen in love with, so after being badgered over and over (I keep saying no because I've learned that he's not interested in what I'm interested in) I cave in because, I mean, I feel guilty if I don't? Almost like I have to give him sex for him to stick around in a friendship way. I don't know, none of this makes sense when written out but it's where my mind jumps.
