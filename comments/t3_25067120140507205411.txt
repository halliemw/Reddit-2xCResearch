I think you might consider sitting down with her and having a practical conversation about the logistics about what could happen and how prepared she is to handle it. If she gets pregnant, what is she going to do? Is she prepared to either give birth or have an abortion? Is she able to handle the concerns about STIs? Is she prepared to see a gynecologist for annual or semi-annual STI screens? I think the best way for you to handle this is probably to make sure that she's going to be responsible about it, which coincidentally may be enough to convince her to wait on it.

The other thing you might do is discuss her reasons with her or at least the difference between healthy and unhealthy motivations. It sounds like she may be in a position where she thinks having sex will make her feel wanted or loved or like she's in control, and those are not really healthy reasons for anyone to have sex. Sex is not a way to find acceptance, and in fact the best sex is sex you have when you feel at home in your own skin and you know your boundaries and you would be ok if you didn't have sex. Sex is great, but it often causes more problems than it solves, and that may be the point you want to get across here.
