I am sincerely flattered. Considering that IVF is still not widely accepted by most American cultures as a perfectly normal medical procedure, it seems that there is very little information out there for donors on the donation process itself--the regimen, its requirements, the medications, etc., so I thought I would share my story with other women to give them a better idea of the whole process. 

Most clinics advertise that you have to be between 21 and 29 in order to donate, but some will list as young as 18. In my experience, 21 is the preferred age, as some clinics WILL require parental consent if you are under 21 for whatever reason.
