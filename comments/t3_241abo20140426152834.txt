> They become both the storm and shelter from the storm. When they're not there anymore you lose that focal point and there's nothing concrete and definitive to point to anymore when you're feeling down or lonely or angry and know that that's the problem.

You described that perfectly. I spent almost 4 years putting all my energy into trying to make him happy, trying to be a better girlfriend, trying not to upset him. At first when he was gone I felt an amazing sense of freedom, like a weight lifted from my shoulders, but that gradually turned into feeling lost, like I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing with myself at all anymore.

He was my best friend and someone who I had such a close connection with. We had so much in common. Despite the violence. I try not to, but if I'm being honest I miss him so, so much.
