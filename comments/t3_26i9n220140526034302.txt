Honestly, I'd send a text message saying that if you don't get a call in the next fifteen minutes, you're taking the kids to your place. And do it. Alternatively, you could ask someone to bring over food and pain medication, and wait it out. Obviously, if she doesn't have an *excellent* excuse, don't babysit for her again.
