Howdy, I love my SO because she is totally awesome and her body size has no affect on my feelings towards her. We actually met through OkCupid so I can give you a little advice from a male perspective. I'm not sure exactly what horror stories you're talking about but I feel like its when the guy feels lied to or cheated when he shows up to the date and the girl is overweight when her pictures led him to believe otherwise. The simple solution to this is to make sure any photos you post are full body. This might reduce the number of responses to your account but it will almost certainly make sure you aren't a horror story. Its very cliché but if you're confident in your body you'll get a lot farther than if you take the angled face pics to seem skinnier and they don't realize until the first date those were a façade of sorts. I really hope you find someone as awesome as I did if you decide to do online and don't lose hope it took me 4 or 5 years to find someone online. :D
