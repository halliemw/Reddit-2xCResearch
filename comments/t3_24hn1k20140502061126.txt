Yeah that's what I've found here in the uk. The women's loos don't have baby changing things in, neither do the men's, but the disabled ones do, which are unisex. I guess because the disabled toilets are usually bigger, and a private room of their own, it makes sense.

The only problem is a lot of disabled loos need you to unlock them and get staff.
