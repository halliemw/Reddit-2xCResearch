There was a wonderful r/bestof post awhile back where a guy compared being wanted for sex to being wanted for money.

Imagine all your "friends" didn't really like *you*, they just knew that you had a lot of money and were nice to you in the hopes of gettin sum.  Thats objectification.  You aren't being viewed as a person but rather as a resource.  Aren't valued for *who* you are but rather *how you can be used*. 

It sucks.  People who do that to other people are jerks.
