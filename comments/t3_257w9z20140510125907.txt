Well said, this is exactly the kind of replies I've been getting. People think I'm arguing about the film (which is fair, the film does play a large part in the argument) But It's a complaint about the portrayal of women in mass media at large, and this film's elevation to the status of "progressive and feministic" is unhealthy at best.
