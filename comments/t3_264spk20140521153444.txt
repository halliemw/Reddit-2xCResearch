I too am super impressed with OP's parenting, and I don't want this to come off as discrediting her/him in any way! **This is not meant to be argumentative or to detract from OP's accomplishments as a parent**, I simply think it's important to point this out: 

just because a child chooses not to disclose their sexual orientation with a parent before disclosing it to their close peers, that shouldn't mean the parents are less awesome, open or supportive parents than OP. 
Coming out is such a highly individualized process. While good parenting can have an impact on it, it's only one of a million factors in how a kid/person chooses to reveal their sexuality to the world.


THAT SAID,  OP you should be *very* proud of both your daughter and of yourself.
