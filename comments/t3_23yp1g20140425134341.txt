Awwww this makes me miss nursing my son so much!!  Congrats, mama.
The first 6 weeks were the hardest time I've ever survived.  I was so, so thankful to have the support of my family for whatever decision I made, and a wonderful LLLI group who got me over some tough times.  After a lot of pain & tears we got over the hump and nursed successfully til my son was 2 years old.  I miss it!!
