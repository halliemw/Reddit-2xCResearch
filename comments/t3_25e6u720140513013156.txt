I kind of agree that shaming someone into it sucks. I didn't really care about my armpit hair until a friend of mine got freaked out when we were 13 and told me it was gross. I think maybe I have a complex - but at least I apply it evenly across genders in my opinion on pit hair (I've never told anyone to shave their armpits because if they don't care why should I? But my feelings on it are personally that it's not attractive on anyone).
