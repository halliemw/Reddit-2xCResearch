Ummmm... That is a *really* valid question. I'm 21 next week so there's no chance in hell that the doctors would let me have a Mirena. I only know what I know because my Mum has been using the Mirena for about 7 years. 

After a quick Google search, it seems that insertion problems tend to make themselves apparent in the days/weeks after insertion (punctured uterus, it attaches to the uterine lining etc). So I would assume that if it ends badly you would have it removed and be put on some other type of birth control. I have no idea though, this is just my assumption.
