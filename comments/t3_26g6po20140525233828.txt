As someone who was supposed to go to that gym that night, still goes to that gym, and was connected to someone who was hurt that night, I know well what will happen to this story and those women. They will be forgotten. There is no indication in the LA Fitness in Collier Township that anything occurred. When I work out there, I don't always feel safe. There is no memory of it now. No one seems to care. And when the shooting happened, there was little mention of him hating women, but they put it down to mental illness, just like they're trying to do with this shooting. It's awful, and I hate it.
