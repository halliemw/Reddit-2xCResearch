As far as I have been told, I can get pregnant right after. What the medications do is tell your follicles to overstimulate ova production. About a week after the mature eggs are retrieved from this production cycle, you get your period, and then your body goes back to its old self. 

From my knowledge, there is no statistically significant risk of complications on future pregnancies if you donate your ova. The general recommendation is to limit yourself to five-six donations, however.

Significantly overweight women are far more likely to be rejected as egg donors, as excess body fat tends to accompany other adverse health risks, and the point is to create the healthiest possible baby. Everything that one does to her body can affect her ova.
