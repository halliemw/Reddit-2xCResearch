The anger isn't stemmed from the action directly.  It more comes from the fact that he first tried to hide it from me and laughed it off with my boyfriend.  When I approached him he chose to ignore me.  It's pretty clear he has no regard for my feelings and as more and more people are brushing off the situation I keep getting more frustrated.
