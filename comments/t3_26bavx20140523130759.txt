this guy seems *way* too handsy with inebriated girls. Am I the only one sensing a pattern here? If you were pushing him away for the majority of the night, then I highly doubt you would suddenly "agree to" being groped and fondled. It sounds to me like he believed you didn't remember anything and was trying to take advantage of it by feeding you lies about your behavior. That's really fucking creepy. What do you plan to do? :(
