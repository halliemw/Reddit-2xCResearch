I got married a week after I turned 21 and I thought to myself "if there was ever a conversation I should avoid, it's this one" and what do you know...here I am.  It's not that I necessarily disagree with anything said here, it's just such a complicated situation to discuss. I don't even know what I'm trying to say, it's probably because I can't say I am for or against marrying young. It's just so subjective it hurts. Sometimes when I hear young people talk about getting married, I want to scream NOOOOOO and other times I'd like to applaud them. I feel like as a young married person that I have acquired gut feelings about others who choose to go down the same path on whether it's going to explode in their faces or actually turn out fine. Other young couples who wish to marry tend to approach me about it and how I handled everyone around me screaming no and it puts me in such an awkward position because there are those who I feel are making a huge mistake, but it's not really my place to say. I don't know what my point is. Fuck it. 

 I'm not religious at all, by the way. I was raised Mormon, but left the church in my early teens and it has not influenced my decision as there are no real outside pressures because only my immediate family is Mormon and we are pretty much the only Mormons in the area.
