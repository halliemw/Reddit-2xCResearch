Yeah, I think I gained about 30 pounds or so.  Not too much but enough that a lot of pants don't fit anymore.  X3  

I'm slowly working on getting healthier... quit smoking, started drinking more water, now working on eating healthier and getting back into shape.  Even before I quit smoking (especially before honestly) I'd find myself gasping for air way too often on hikes and such.
