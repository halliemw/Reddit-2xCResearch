I think you definitely have a right to be angry. Your friend knew you and your boyfriend are in a committed relationship and crossed a line by kissing him. Your friend's sexual orientation does not excuse his behavior what so ever. 

On another note, I also am concerned with what his actions say in relation to your friendship. You said he was one of your really good friends and, being a stranger on the internet, this is only my speculation based on what I've read so this may not be the case, but it feels like a lack of respect on his part. 

If you haven't gotten a chance to sit down and talk with him, it might be good to do so.
