I just had this conversation with my doctor, and I'm sure she has opinions that differ from others. She told me that by and large the copper IUD is being phased out because it is not as effective and there is increased risk for ectopal pregnancy, fusion to the uterine wall and other complications. The side effects of Mirena long-term, per the pamphlet I was given, would be less extreme than BC pills, because they are progesterone-only. So, if you've been on birth control before, it should act the same way or less so, with heaviest periods right after the insertion. Extreme pain or bleeding is not normal and should be dealt with by a doctor right away. The scariest side effect I saw was the possibility of one of the Mirena "arms" piercing the uterine wall, requiring surgical removal.

Honestly, if your goal is just to lighten your periods, I would try the lowest-level hormone BC pill you can find and do that. Both have risk of complications.
