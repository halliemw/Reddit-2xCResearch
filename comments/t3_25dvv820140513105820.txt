It really is.  For someone to strangle someone else it takes only 8lbs of pressure, which cuts off oxygen to the brain.  It takes around 8-10 seconds for people to lose consciousness, which is not a lot of time, although due to lack of oxygen it is common for strangulation victims to feel like they were being strangled for much much longer.
