I know you were talking about real life safety and privacy, but I was just trying to say that when people say 2X was once a "safe space" I don't think they are referring to real life safety, they are referring to it the way I described, as a safe space to avoid male-dominated conversations, and not see as much of the sexist crap that is present in a lot of other subreddits, and to not have as much of a chance of receiving creepy pms, or being downvoted because they aren't conventionally attractive.

I don't think anyone ever thought/tried to say that it was a safe place in regards to privacy/real-life safety. So I guess I just disagree with you when you say that this sub was never safe and the illusion of safety is now removed, because no one ever meant real-life safety when they referred to it as a safe space.
