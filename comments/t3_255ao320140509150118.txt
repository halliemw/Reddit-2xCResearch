It tends to be a lot of disrespectful comments.
If someone tells me I look nice or my hair looks good - I will say thank you. If someone tells me they want to fuck me - I will tell them to go suck a bag of dicks.
If some random people were constantly telling you to smile "because you'll look prettier when you smile" wouldn't you ask them why the fuck does it matter if they find you attractive? 
Street harassment is one of the main examples of how the public thinks they have some sort of control of women's bodies.
Sometimes you want to walk from point a to point b, while wearing shorts, without someone whistling at you.
It gets old really fast.
I'm sorry if my comment is jumbled. It's Friday afternoon. 

*this is coming from someone who has a serious case of bitchy resting face and apparently I look "scary." There are girls who look cute and innocent who I am sure get more harassed than I do. Which isn't even that often.
