Honestly, I do fine, and my secret is not acing like every other woman in those sorts of jobs. Usually chicks in mostly male workplaces are pissed. Really pissed. 

Edit to add: I have a very high level of job satisfaction, and am respected for my capabilities, and have friendships and trust among my coworkers, all because I don't get pissed off whenever someone makes some kind of sexist gaff.
