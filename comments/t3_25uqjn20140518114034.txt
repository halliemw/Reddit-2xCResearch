I've gotten this treatment for years and I feel like many women do. Unfortunately many men seem to think that because I'm being paid to act like I like them, that's grounds for them to cross a line. A lot of the advice here on how to handle each situation is good. I was stalked online and men would send me flowers et cetera at work. I adopted a nickname totally different from my real name and had that printed on all of my name badges so they couldn't find my name in the interwebs. I hate the idea of wearing a fake ring because women just shouldn't have to do that sh*t. Now when men ask me for personal information I literally laugh it off, shake my head and them and just say "That's sooo not appropriate. You should know better" and then quickly ask them if there's anything else they needed today. I treat them essentially like children because that's what they're acting like.
