Telling people not to talk in this subreddit because of their sex will get individuals fired up. Considering a woman's perspective to be equal to all other women's and exclusive towards a man's perspective is just plain sexist which will spark debate. You won't have what you want because some people are not into respecting the wishes of others because they feel there is bias present. It may suck but it is legitimate because reddit is a mostly free internet forum and your expectations are far fetched.
