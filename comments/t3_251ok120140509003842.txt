I'm not even sure this is about a women vs. men scenario. It's about the TwoX community. There are plenty of women on Reddit who don't subscribe to TwoX, and while most just end up getting mistaken for men and don't seem to mind, they're still women.  
  
It always hurts when a subreddit that is small, tightly-knit, narrowly specialized, or all three ends up getting a large volume of outside traffic. *Most* of them don't handle it well, but the /r/TwoXChromosomes reaction to becoming default feels more like a stress test on the integrity of the subreddit than a sudden challenge for women on the internet. Yes, all (maybe most?) TwoX subscribers are women, but that's not why you're experiencing what you are. *Every* subreddit that's put under sudden stress experiences a rebound of some kind.  
  
I don't know if you like the Fallout series, but the behavior of a lot of TwoX is reminding me of /r/Fallout during the *Survivor 2299* hoax. A lot of people are posting who don't understand the community's dynamic, and that's rustling a lot of jimmies. A lot of less mature users on both sides are fighting each other, and that's looking very bad to/for the rest of you. This is an *opportunity* for /r/TwoXChromosomes to prove it's a strong group of people, not to prove that women are strong.  
  
Maybe it feels different to a veteran of the subreddit, but that's what I'm seeing from back here on the sidelines.
