I am not a lawyer, but I imagine that would depend on the doctor. Go over every aspect of why they would refuse you this procedure, making sure they are well aware that "you'll want children later" is unacceptable to you. Find out exactly why they won't do it. If all else fails, I'd suggest finding another doctor if the one you have is being obstinate.
