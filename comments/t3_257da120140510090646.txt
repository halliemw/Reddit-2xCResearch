For me, YAY all the way. My boyfriend is five years younger than me and I revel in the age difference. It provides fun opportunities like me having to explain who Kelly Kapowski is and him introducing me to snapchat. But really it's about the person, so don't get all hung up on the age thing. If you happen to enjoy his company and you guys click, then go for it.
