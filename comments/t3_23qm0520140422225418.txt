That's really cool. I always wanted the boy toys as a kid (I hated dolls, pink stuff, and the McDonald's toy was invariably one of the two), and  I'd often get given the girl toy even if it was my parents asking for the boy toy. It didn't help that my parents put me in the poofiest dresses ever, so I was always immediately identified as a girl.
