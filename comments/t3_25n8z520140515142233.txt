I was in a situation kind of like this, except with a team coach and captain instead of instructor. I ended up leaving. You might not think its jealousy, but honestly that is my only guess in my situation, though only in retrospect. I couldn't have imagined it to be jealousy at the time. 
I wish you better luck than I; at least I had another sports team I could leave and go to, though it came with its own issues. You are already so much stronger than I would have been!
