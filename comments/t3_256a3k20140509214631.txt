So there is this common frustration that comes on r/makeupaddiction in which make up is so dainty looking, where as really make up is like war paint because women are going to a world that is ready to rip them apart.  

I kind of wish something similar--a way to show that isn't making us weaker. It makes us stronger.  

I guess that's my only thing.
