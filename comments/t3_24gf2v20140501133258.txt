I've experienced hyperemesis gravidarum with my daughter, had losses, traumatic birth and was a NICU mom of a 41 weeker. 

I suffered some pretty serious PTSD symptoms after my daughters birth as well as son ppd. The idea of a second child got thrown out the window.

We are ttc again and I'm handling it okay. I'm very anxious about being so sick again or the next c section. Everything. I'm worried. Terrified still. 

Seeing my therapist is what gets me through. I hope you can get to a place where you are happy and enjoying your pregnancy. 

If you want to talk pm me.
