>They're slightly magnified caricatures.

Absolutely! Just like most sitcoms (I'm thinking of Friends specifically though), the characters all together sort of make up the full personality of one person - we all fluctuate, we all reach some extremes sometimes, but it takes a plethora of different characters dominated by more overt traits to make us see that reflection in ourselves. Personally, I feel Girls does this in a realer way too me than any show I've watched. I feel like I'm perceived like Hannah, I identify a little too much with Shosh's anxiety and desire to control it, I'm terrified I come across like Marnie all the time, and I wish I could embrace anything I see of Jessa in myself. It's like the perfect identity crisis every time I watch it.
