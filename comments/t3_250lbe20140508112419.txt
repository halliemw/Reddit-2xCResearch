I hear you. I have thin hair too. It sucks. I have a brown-colored dry shampoo that I spray into the thinner parts around my crown to fill it in. And not to give more unsolicited advice, but I like [L'anza Healing Volume Thickening Shampoo](http://www.amazon.com/Lanza-Healing-Volume-Thickening-Shampoo/dp/B002GYQ0FW/ref=sr_1_14?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1399565519&sr=1-14&keywords=thickening+shampoo) too. Still doesn't change my genetics.
