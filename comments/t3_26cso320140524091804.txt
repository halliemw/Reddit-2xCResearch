There's a HUGE difference between 6 and 13. He may not have known how wrong it was, but he knew it was wrong. He also knew it was sexual. We aren't talking about little kids discovering that they have different genitals and touching each others' while they try to figure out the world around them. Having sex with 6 year olds is not a part of normal teenage development in any way. If this had gone to court, he would have been tried as a minor because he didn't have the same understanding as an adult. That doesn't mean that he didn't know he was doing anything wrong. 

There's also a difference between a child following directions given to them by someone they see as an authority figure and a child giving directions. Most children want to please the adults around them, so when they're told to keep quiet they do. It's not at all uncommon with children who are being abused sexually. But to give the instruction that you can't tell anyone is a completely different issue for a child of any age. When a four year old tells you not to tell their parents that they did something, it's a safe bet that they know it's not ok to do it. When a thirteen year old tells a 6 year old not to tell anyone that he's putting his penis in her vagina, you know damn well that he knows it's not ok. He may not have known it was illegal, but he knew it was wrong and did it anyway.
