This is part of a bigger change to reddit, though. There were previously only 25 default subs and yeah, they were intended to be mostly "universal" but now there's 50 defaults with the idea being that some of them offer up content that isn't quite so universal. I like this idea, I like that it's pushing people towards content they wouldn't normally gravitate towards. 

Exposing people to differing opinions and ideas is ultimately a good thing, otherwise it just becomes a massive circlejerk.

There will be assholes and trolls, like there always have been, but the important thing is to remain determined.
