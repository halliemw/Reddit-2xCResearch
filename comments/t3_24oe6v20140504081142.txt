Ah, yeah.  I forgot about the crazy competitiveness of academia.  My dad's retired, my mom's passed away, so I haven't heard those wonderful dinner time stories of backstabbery and departmental politics in a long time. :)  

Your tutoring option sounds pretty good then.  I know some K-12 teachers who have transitioned to real-life and online tutoring, mostly because of job shortage.  But they seem to have more family time, so perhaps looking into expanding your tutoring business (if you like it!).  

There is also working part-time in an unrelated field, which might give you the flexibility to be with your kids, but you will probably find it less intellectually stimulating.
