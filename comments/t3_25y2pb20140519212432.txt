I think this is a good point.

It's also worth noting however that in some of the games you mention such as Mass Effect and KOTOR you might be able to create your own main character in the game but the default used in all the marketing and tie-ins like books and comics, is male.

This is a personal bugbear of mine. The main characters from those two games I mentioned would work just as well being female, and may even be a little more compelling in terms of story, so why not make them canonically female? 

But those games are old now, so nothing can be done about it. I hold out hope for future games. It doesn't have to be a huge thing that the lead is a woman. Just pick who would be better for the story and if it happens to work better with a female lead, run with it!
