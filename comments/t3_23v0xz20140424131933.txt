You must not speak to a lot of career networkers. I know a few (including my own brother), and have met many many more because of those few, and all of them are like this with everyone they meet. It's second nature to them to approach and encourage complete strangers to get involved in whatever business or plan they're a part of. Most of them love to give unsolicited career or personal advice as well.

Like any group of people there are of course outliers, but I saw nothing in OP's story that would lead me to believe this particular fellow was dangerous.
