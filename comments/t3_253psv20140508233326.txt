I didn't go to one til I was 19 and having down problems. The only reason you would need to see one before 21 (US guidelines) or 25 (UK guidelines) is if you're sexually active for STI screens or if you have a problem. Other than that, you should start having biannual, or even triennial in some countries I think, Pap smears at the recommended age in your country, whether you're sexually active or not. Yes, HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer, but it can develop even without the virus, so getting checked regularly is important. You also might consider talking to your pediatrician about the Gardasil vaccine. I know you aren't sexually active now, and that's what makes this the ideal time to get it for maximum protection.
