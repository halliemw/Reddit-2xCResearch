I am so sorry this was your experience, as this is not an uncommon thing to experience in these type of situations and the nurses should know better. I work in a nursing home and I can't get mad when people shit themselves or pull out their lines or leak semen all over because that is just part of what happens to someones body and in taking the job, I accept that I will deal with that. Please don't feel bad, as it is the nurses who should feel bad for making you feel like that was somewho unnatural or gross. They should have just cleaned you up right there and not made you wait for the doctor, as there are plenty of ways to clean someone up regardless of a cath or other equipment. Keep your chin up and feel better!
