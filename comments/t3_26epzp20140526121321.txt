> Do you think it helps any when those that claim to be feminists say "strawman feminist" only so to discredit or that say some person isn't a real feminist? Just because that other feminist doesn't believe or more so hold the same views as them?

I'm not saying someone isn't a feminist, I'm saying the imaginary version of feminism created by ignorant people is a strawman.

> Why not? Feminists pretty much allowed others to give it a bad name. It also allowed its own to give it a bad name as well.

Not really, misogynists give it a bad name because it confuses and threatens them.
