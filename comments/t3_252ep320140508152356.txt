Completely overwhelming. I was very young and I hadn't had the talk with my mom yet. I didn't know what was going on (or if I did, I couldn't accept it) and I ended up hiding it for a year. I just "spotted" occasionally. Then I bled on my sheets and my mom found the bloody sheets and confronted me and was so disappointed that I hadn't told her. I was humiliated. It was awful. Awful awful. Bleh, I hate thinking about it. 

Also, I remember the cramps being terrible. My period is much kinder to me now.
