thank you for thinking so.  i was surprised how little i freaked out.  i suppose i just entered "get-it-done" mode since (to me) there was no other option.  the whole clinic experience was way more normal and less intimidating than i could've imagined.  definitely will be paying it forward to pp in the future.
