I'm on the pill so we don't always use condoms. Afterwards I will spend a few extra minutes on the toilet to let most stuff drip out and I like to use (flushable) wet wipes to clean up. It helps a lot with the funk - which I always just assumed was a mix of fluids and sweat.

There are several brands of regular wet wipes for bathroom use, but there are a few others making wipes specifically for lady parts like Always. I too fear the douche.
