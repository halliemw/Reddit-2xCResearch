Okay, from coming in from the *default* fiasco, I have to say, I like this sub. You guys, for the most part and I really mean that-I've only seen a few non supportive posts, really give some insightful replies to people. I don't usually subscribe to the gender specific (I am honestly not trying to be insulting, I couldn't think of what else to call it) subs because I feel if I have something really personal to say, something I'm really struggling with I wouldn't want it to become someone else's drama, you know? I know I'm not explaining that right. But I'm sure you've experienced the whole 48 child argument of who has it right and who has a right to say it de-evolution.  Anyway, your post struck a chord with me. I am also a female bible belter with a daughter. Your response was respectful and insightful. And I can totally relate.
