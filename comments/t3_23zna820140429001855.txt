First, there are 14 women on the chart.  Meaning that your 1 in 4 failing is much closer to 1 in 5.  Second, I'd argue that anything above a 90% in a class where 6 students are failing (and is thus pretty darn difficult) constitutes high achievement.  The percent of women in the 1st two categories is, in absolute terms, over 20 percent higher than the men in those categories.  And finally, your last HR example is moot, because the probabilities assume that the HR rep has no information except for gender when surely they have transcripts, letters of recommendation, and other evidence by which to judge candidates intelligence.
