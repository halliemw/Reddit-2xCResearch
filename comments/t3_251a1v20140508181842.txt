I don't even know how I ended up here but people just kept replying to my posts and I felt it would be rude not to answer them. I do agree though, the women who frequented this sub before it became a default will be pushed out so that people can just post anti-feminism jokes and other useless stuff for no real reason, while down voting all the post that would be popular before. 

Sorry ladies.
