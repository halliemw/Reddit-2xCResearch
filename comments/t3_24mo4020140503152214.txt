Try to imagine yourself hearing this story from a friend. What would you tell her? Then take your own advice. I doubt that you would tell the friend to stay and try to fix things. 

My advice is to get the hell out. I know that fuzzy brain feeling where your world feels scrambled. For me at least, it's the sign of being around someone who is trying to manipulate me. This is what your parents are doing. Your father is threatening you so that he can have his way. Your mother is acting co-dependent and trying to get you to behave in a certain (unhealthy) way in order to maintain her image of a perfect family. They are both being manipulative and this situation is harmful to you. 

It sounds to me like your mom needs help as well, but you have to help yourself first. Sometimes helping yourself makes other people upset. It sucks. I know. But your health and safety have to come first.
