My general advice when it comes to reproducing, or having children in other ways, is that if you're not completely and entirely sure about it, then don't go through with it. It's a big deal, especially producing a new human being, bigger than pretty much everything else that happens on an individual level. You should be sure about it.

As someone who doesn't know you, I will also join in in suggesting that you talk with someone who could be more familiar with the case and have the skills to help you with it.
