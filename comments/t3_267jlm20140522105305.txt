That's something I find sad.... why isn't it enough to not want to harm fellow man? Why do you need an incentive to not hurt people? If I hurt someone's feelings, I feel horrible. I wouldn't dream of physically hitting anyone... why do you need the catch "if you hurt someone, God is sad." No! That removes you from the action, that removes your responsibility. If you do something bad, you're the bad person, you need to fix it... and you need to make it up to the person you hurt. If you cheat Bill and then pray to God for forgiveness, Bill will never know. He will carry that pain of being hurt, never knowing how you felt. You feel better after hurting him, but he won't.

People need to realize they live in a world of other people... it's other people that are hurt when you cheat and steal and lie, not God. Our time on this planet is so short and precious, instead of doing our best to make sure it's a good life while we're still alive, some worry about a reward when they die. 

This isn't to criticize you as a person, specifically.
