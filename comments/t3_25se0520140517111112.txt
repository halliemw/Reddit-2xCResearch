I can't even begin to formulate how much this post means to me. It's been a struggle, but I think I've finally gotten to the point where I've decided that a gastric bypass of some sort is the way to go doctor willing. I've never had a surgery before so it's been daunting for me to even consider.

Seeing this post. Seeing how happy you are means a lot to me so thank you. I'm still nervous about the whole thing, but I'm more convinced than ever that this is the right thing for me to do.
