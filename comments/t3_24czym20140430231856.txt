That's the main thing that I am so self conscious about. I started getting adult acne a couple of years ago (once I hit my 20's) and after going to a dermatologist a few months ago it seems to be finally clearing up, however I have a bit of pigmented scarring on my cheeks. It was so lovely to get such a comment when I was feeling my worst.
