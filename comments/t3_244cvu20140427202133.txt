I understand that it doesn't build up your uterine wall, but does the constant stream of hormones with no break have possible repercussions? 

I ask because I've been on the Nuva ring for about 3 years and just recently was told I can skip my period by just popping another one in after the rings cycle. I've tried it a couple times but near the end of the second ring's cycle, I start to get super emotional and weepy and dramatic..
