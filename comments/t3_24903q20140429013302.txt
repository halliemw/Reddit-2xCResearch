So... in Canada, you go out and buy the Mirena, then bring it to your doctor for insertion? This is very confusing to me.

Edit: if anybody has any data on what this does to follow-up rates, I'd be interested in seeing it! I know that follow-up rates plummet for postabortion and postpartum IUD insertion if there are delays.
