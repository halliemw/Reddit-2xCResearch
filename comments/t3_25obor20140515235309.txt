If you're going that route, send her screenshots with your name totally blacked out. If my husband was going to cheat on me, I'd trust things written in his own words (because I've read plenty of them and would probably recognise them) more than someone who is a burner identity saying he did, if that makes sense. The former is someone giving me information, the latter could be someone trolling.
