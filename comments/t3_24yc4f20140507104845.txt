I got a little uncomfortable when they showed the procedure…like I actually had cramps a little bit. I always thought that if I got pregnant now I would get an abortion…but now I am thinking that I will be extra careful with my boyfriend to make sure I will never have to do this procedure. It's pretty amazing that she videotaped it and put it on the internet. She is a hell of a lot more brave than I am!
