I was on the pill for many years, switched to Nuvaring. I liked the convenience of it a lot except ... it seems possible/likely that it was contributing to my depression. I started developing depression a few months after switching to Nuvaring, but none of my doctors ever suspected my BC could have had anything to do with it. (I do remember that one of the first symptoms of my depression was a complete lack of libido, but that often comes with depression, so I don't know if it was a flag.) I was on a few different antidepressants for a couple of years before a psychiatrist noticed the correlation. I quit hormonal BC and went off antidepressants a few months later, and I feel somewhat better now.

I love birth control. It has absolutely changed women's lives for the better. But I think there's a lot of research to be done about how different forms of hormonal BC affect us. The depression was pretty subtle and mild, all things considered, but it has affected me in a huge way.
