Health, affordability and how it will affect your professional life should be your only concerns.  You and only you should decide what goes on in your body.  That said, I'm personally a chicken when it comes to tattoos.  I've been wanting one for years - small and delicate either on my foot, ankle, back or backside of my neck (where hair or makeup can easily cover it)  but I just can't decide on whether to get or not because I wanted it to mean something but I just don't know what. Yet.   I know no one needs to tell you this, but for the other people who read/lurk these posts, make double sure you choose a licensed clean and safe place that complies with all the health and safe cods of your region.
