This guy is in high school (or a recent grad) and posts about gaming and his anxiety issues.  Ignore him.  What do YOU want?  For yourself?  This question didn't make sense to me until I started lifting weights.  Suddenly I was doing something that made me feel strong and confident, regardless of other people's opinions.  Maybe for you it's martial arts, or dance, or singing lessons.  Whatever.  Check in with yourself about what's going to make you feel best in your body.  THAT is what matters.  Best of luck, sister.
