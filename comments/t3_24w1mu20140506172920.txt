The list of successes you mentioned are what anybody wants. You need to develop aspects of yourself that are unique to you, or you won't feel like an individual.

You should try developing a hobby. To start from scratch on a skill, and to work very hard at developing it, is extremely satisfying. And I mean to actually work at it, set aside a couple hours each week to develop your craft. What's something you've wanted to try your hand at? Playing an instrument, watercolor painting, salsa dancing, learning a foreign language, writing short stories, rock climbing, joining an intramural softball league, what would you like to do?

Something that's not widely understood among us young adults is how we were forced to do all these extracurriculars as teenagers to make our college apps look more "well-rounded." Well, there's a reason being well-rounded is considered appealing, it makes you unique and feel fulfilled. Just because you're an adult now doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to be well-rounded!
