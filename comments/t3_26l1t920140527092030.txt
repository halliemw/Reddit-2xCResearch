I had a 'Bella Swan' moment. I literally got up and went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and noticed a bump that wasn't there before (it was very obvious because I was in really good shape at the time). I had no symptoms up until that point. By week 10, I was having cravings for grapefruit, the smell of meat made me extremely nausous, and my boobs hurt, a lot.

I am a paranoid person (before and after the unplanned pregnancy) so I usually just take a test whenever I think the potential for pregnancy is there. There is nothing more relieving than seeing that negative sign on the test after internally freaking out about possible being pregnant...again.
