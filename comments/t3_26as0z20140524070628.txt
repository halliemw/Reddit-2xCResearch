This has been a recurring battle with my wife and I for nearly 20 years. One thing I'd suggest is that *if you're going to keep score, keep a full and accurate score*. There are a number of difficult, unpleasant, and time consuming things that I do that never cross her mind either.  I have at least as many hours per day into contributing to the family as she does, so when we start fighting about me not knowing how many eggs we have/need, everyone feels under appreciated, and that sucks. I appreciate that she takes care of organizing things, but I also see that (and many other things) as her job, just as she sees snow removal (and many other things) as my job.
