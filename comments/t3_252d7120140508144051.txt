I'm not sure if you're trolling or not but I'll offer my two cents. 

Marriage is not, and should not be, about free sex for the man. Sex between consenting partners should be mutually enjoyed. Sex is a million times better when it's with someone who is just as into it as you are. 

If a partner expressed views like yours to me, I would run. 

On a separate note I think 19 is very young to be thinking seriously about marriage. There's no need to rush.
