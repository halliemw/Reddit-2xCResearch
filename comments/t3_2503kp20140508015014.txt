When (if) the time comes for the two of you to decide to produce little shits, you'll know and discuss it. Now is not the time and has been discussed. 

I think it's important that you involved him and discussed it rather than a blatant and stubborn approach, and (at least from your telling), as a male in a relationship, I would be happy with how it was handled. 

As far as the future, this is a hurdle. If y'all make it over this, then so be it. If not, then so be that. The point is that relationships aren't about the good, and aren't about persevering through the bad - it's about *all* of those things and more. So, if it works, it works. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work - and it's best to find that out now than when things are harder to handle in separation (IE: Kids, house, etc)
