This is definitely possible. My stepbrother got married in March, and I received their save-the-date in the mail months and months before, but for some reason I never got the official invitation. My mom mentioned it to them, so they sent me a second one.  Still nothing. My fianc√© and I ended up RSVPing by word of mouth.
