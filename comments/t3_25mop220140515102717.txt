It sounds like depression. I have struggled with that, as have the people I love. If you can afford it and have the means I recommend getting him into therapy. One bad therapist does not mean that the process will always be ineffective for him. There are different schools of therapy and, honestly, drug counselling and depression counselling are different beasts all together.
