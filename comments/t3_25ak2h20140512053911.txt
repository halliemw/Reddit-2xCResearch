Yeah, one of my friends said something similar to this and it resonated with me. She said "Do you let your daughter eat ice cream all day?

"No"

"Does she get mad when you tall her no ice-cream?"

"Yes."

"Do you give in and give her ice cream?"

"No"

"And you do it because you love your daughter and you want her to be healthy. Sometimes making the right decision is going to make you look like the bad guy, but a good mom needs to do what is right, not what will paint them in a positive light for their kids. You raise her to protect her, not to be liked."
