Oh I didn't mean to attack you or accuse you of being wrong, I'm sorry if I came across that way! I only wanted to highlight the other side of the situation for those of us who are less lucky. 

I visited TOG back in April and thought it was brilliant, not just because you have more than 2 girl members but it just seems like a really awesome welcoming space :) I'm trying to get more involved in my hackerspace a bit more, but the attitudes are more frustrating up here sometimes.
