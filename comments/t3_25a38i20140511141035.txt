Your feelings are valid. You are using the vibrator together, whereas the pocket pussy is for his enjoyment alone (I assume).

What may help you, however, is understanding that he could just as easily use his hand if he's alone. His toy does not represent another woman, just like the vibrator does not represent another man.
