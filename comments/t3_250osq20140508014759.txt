Treat women the way you hope her boyfriends treat her. 

Respect her opinions. 

When she dates a shitty guy, tell her you think she can do better, but leave it at that, (in other words respect her decisions) and be there for her with some ice cream and mario party when he breaks her heart. 

Ask her for girl advice. 

Ask her for fashion advice. 

Be nice to her boyfriends, even the shitty ones, but don't get too close. If it breaks up, she'll need you to be on her side, even if that means gently pointing out some of the ways she may have went wrong. Gently... 

Oh, and even if she does break it off with a shit-head, don't put him down too much in case she needs to go back to him to relearn the lesson, or if he should happen to change. Also, it can make us feel bad about our feelings, especially if we still have them for someone we know we shouldn't. 

Ask for her opinions on things, politics, abortion, whatever. Try not to let it get too heated. 

Feel free to bug her about weird stuff she did as a kid though, but not badly enough to hurt her feelings. 

Oh, and, if you're stellar... And notice she's down, for whatever reason... Maybe get her flowers (or chocolate if she hates flowers) once in a blue moon. Doesn't have to be expensive, doesn't have to be a lot... 

Maybe some nice pink daisies. Red roses would be weird from a brother. 

Damn, I wish I had an older brother.
