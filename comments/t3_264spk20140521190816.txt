This why it *is* a big deal every time someone famous or in the public eye announces their sexual orientation. It annoys me when people make snide remarks and announce they're straight. Seeing public figures announce to the world that they are gay normalizes the sexuality and allows young kids to feel more accepting about who they are as opposed to the self-loathing or denial that was the norm for previous generations. It kind of still is the norm, but it's becoming less and less so. 

Teenagers have so much nonsense to deal with at that age so it would be nice if sexuality stopped being something that kids are so stressed over that they're tempted to take the extreme measure of suicide.
