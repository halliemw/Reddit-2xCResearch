I just got Mirena  about 2 weeks ago.
Getting it in wasn't to bad. Just a major crap but until about two days ago I had major gas and I could lie down on my stomach.  Now about a week later I felt much better. Still some cramping and some spotting but other than that good. 

Now two weeks later I feel great! I keep forgetting that it's there or when I do remember I kinda panic and check if it's still there. But now I don't have to take the pill (levora) every day and I'm covered for the next five years! Which is great because I know I'm not ready for kids any time soon!
