In many Chicago schools everyone is required to wear a polo shirt, and khakis. In many instances some of the better charter schools wear military fatigues/boots. 

Everyone looks the same. No issues. 

Keep in mind this is middle and high school they're not 18 yet. Their jobs are to go to school and be educated. Afterward and not on school property they're allowed to wear whatever they want or parents allow.

Uniforms are the simplest best solution.
