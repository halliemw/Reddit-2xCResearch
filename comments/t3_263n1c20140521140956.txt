This is about the way one person treated you and the shitty dynamics involved in being her "friend."  It's not about your friendships with all women, or who women are generally, though it does reveal a certain dynamic that occurs in *some* female friendships.  Now that you've been through that, hopefully you can recognize that dynamic and learn not to make the same mistakes.
