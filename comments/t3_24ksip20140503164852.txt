Dear leggypoo, thanks for your story! Six years is an astounding length of  time to do  long distance. You two must be tough as nails with soft squishy centers to hold all that love keeping  it up for so long. Seriously I'm impressed and you must have something very special. I would absolutely love to have a family with him. I've known him for long enough to know how he handles the tough times. But it seems irresponsible for me to assume that is what would happen even if we stay together when we've only actually been in a relationship for a few months.  It's actually a scary easy decision which must make me abnormal.

Unfortunately we would be on opposite sides sides of the world's second largest country for five years. We would only see each other every few months. It really doesn't seem like something we can handle. Both of us have been in long distance relationships before and were not able to find it as rewarding as you and your husband. I'm mostly worried about the wait I think I will try your list idea and then just not think about it very much until I have to.  hopefully you'll be picnicking with your husband by August 1st :)
