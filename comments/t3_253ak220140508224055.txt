See I don't understand this. What do you think this will do? 

Okay, say I do record every one of these encounters and then present them to the police (this would be very time-consuming by the way). What will happen? How will this help anything? Is this a priority for the police? Will they take me seriously? I should mention, I've worked with cops before and am familiar with the police as an EMT. I have some idea of how they work. In my opinion, they would label me as that over-sensitive nuisance that's always over-reporting thing that seem insignificant. Because relative to the things cops have to worry about, someone on the bus saying they want to fuck me and then calling me a cunt when I ignore them is insignificant. (ps-cops are some of the most misogynistic people I have ever met).

And I stated already I don't live in a shitty area and that I'm met with this stuff regardless of the area I'm in.
