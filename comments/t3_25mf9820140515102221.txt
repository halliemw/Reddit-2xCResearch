I don't like jewelry, and I don't like needles.  So mine are of course unpierced.

However, very few people notice.  I've even gotten earrings as gifts!  Even if they did notice- it is absolutely not necessary to modify your body in any way that is undesireable to you.

My grandmother DOES love jewelry (just one of many things she refuses to understand about me...) but she's never had hers pierced and wears clip-ons.
