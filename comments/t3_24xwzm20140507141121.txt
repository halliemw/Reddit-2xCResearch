First, thank you so so much for being there for her and for recognizing the wrongness of this situation.

Second, I wholeheartedly agree with calling CPS. They're the professionals. It's up to them to know if a child's needs are being met or if the child is being harmed.

Third, Is it at all possible for her to stay with you? Even just for weekends or something? It doesn't sound like your parents actually care if she's there or not, but if you challenge them, they could fight back just so they don't "lose." But see if she can stay with you, if you can help her more.

Again, thank you so much for being such a good person and such a good sister.
