Talk about not the best time. I saw that nasty comment but it seems the poster deleted it before I could report it. : / being a default subreddit really sucks.

I'm so sorry this happened to you. This guy is a prick and I'm not sure I'd be above lifting his phone to delete all photos he may have taken / crush his spirit by crushing his iPhone.
