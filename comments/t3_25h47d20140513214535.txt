You only think that because you're a good person and can't imagine calling anyone a bitch without good reason, right?

Some guys aren't as nice as you. I promise you, plenty of guys will turn on you on a moment's notice as soon as they don't view you as "potential". Guys like that... they're the ones who are total jerks to women they don't consider attractive but all flirty and nice to the ones who are.
