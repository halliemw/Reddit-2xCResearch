We are trained (perhaps by how the media acts) to drill down to the one area where someone said something wrong and focus on it instead of the actual point being made.  

Oh look, a funny typo.  Let's focus on that and ignore the point being made.

Oh look, someone said something that would be called sexist if reversed.  Let's focus on that and ignore the point being made.

Oh look, someone said female instead of woman.  Let's focus on that and ignore the point being made.

Oh look, someone pointed out they were a woman.  Let's focus on that and ignore the point being made.

Oh look, someone forgot a not in a place which was really unfortunate.  Let's focus on that and ignore the point being made.

Oh look, the President picked a bad word choice to express a business's dependency on government provided infrastructure.  Let's focus on that and ignore the point being made.

I think for most people, nitpicking is a very easy way to dismiss a differing view.
