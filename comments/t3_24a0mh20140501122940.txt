Yes, I read that, too.  However, it doesn't let the nurses/hospital off the hook.  Clear rules (based on article, other comments and life experience) exist that non-family members aren't allowed in the ICU.

It doesn't matter if the guy was the girl's boyfriend.  Not family.  And if he's the kind of guy that will go and even think about having sex with a girl in the ICU who's very ill and on meds, then I can see why the mom wouldn't approve of him.  He said she was really tired - she was obviously sick - why the hell would he think it was okay to jump on her?  And if she actually was coherent enough to agree (legally or otherwise), was it the medication?  Did he threaten her?  Do you really think she was horny in that condition and really wanted it?
