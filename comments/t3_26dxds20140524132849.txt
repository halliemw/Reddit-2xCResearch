Yep, I've been wearing various types of steel toes for the past 3.5 years. I know what works for me, and these will work. Especially since underground mining is very cold due to the ventilation systems, so I'll need room for thick socks anyway. 

And the online returns process is lengthy...I need boots before next month :-P
