You are now trying to split law from personal beliefs.  Do you realize how laws are made?  They are embodiments of shared personal beliefs of those in positions of political power (and to a decent extent represent the average shared personal beliefs of others).  They force those beliefs onto those who disagree with them.  Thus the personal belief of 'abortion should be banned' could be made into a law banning abortion if enough of those in power agreed strongly enough.
