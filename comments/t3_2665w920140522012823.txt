I mean it's not like I think you should require a slip of paper proving you're certifiable, because not everyone can afford the doctors' visit, or has the ability to get there for whatever reason. In fact, I think it's that sort of attitude that can sometimes lead to people overplaying their issues, to make sure they obviously 'count'. That was a problem for me as a kid, like I wasn't depressed enough because I'd never been hospitalized or whatever, and that was something to aspire to, so that my feelings would actually be valid. But I don't really know what the solution here is! I guess ultimately, de-stigmatizing mental health issues is the only real fix. If they're just another thing, like any other health problem, then they aren't something to be ashamed of OR look up to, you know? They're not that interesting. Just unpleasant, like a broken leg or recurring sinus infection or something.
