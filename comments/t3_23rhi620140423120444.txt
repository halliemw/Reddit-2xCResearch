Stop talking to him.  Falling in love with someone other than your husband is not okay, even if you're "just friends" and you never meet.  You should be having this special connection with your husband, not strangers online.  So stop talking to this guy and start talking to your husband.  Go on dates, tell him about problems, etc.  No good can come from emotional affairs.
