This is a very good way of explaining it.

I myself have flirted with suicide all my life(5 attempts so far) and it's always in the back of my mind. You try to tolerate it for your loved ones, but it gets harder and harder with each passing year. After a while you get a bit resentful as you realize you're just wasting year after year in hoping things get better while you perceive others getting on with their lives and building what may look like a future. You, however, don't see a future. You just see the decaying body you are and the first thing that decayed was your sense of joy and wonder. Food tastes like ashes, and the colors are grey and washed out. Some will turn to drugs and alcohol; a popular escape from the dreary stank of reality.

The worst part is that this all builds up on itself. It's like a creeping orgasm with the promise of oblivion at the end. At first you battle the hopelessness, but with each battle your closest allies get felled one by one until you have very little left to connect yourself to reality. Soon you have nothing left but the broken television set that gives you a jarred image of reality.

In your search for hope you will try out all the things. You will try therapy, AD drugs, exercise, and diet, but most of these things are transitory and you can only hope that each part lasts longer than the last. 

Then it ends.
