The counselor suggestion is a good one.  I actually tried to get everyone to go to family counseling but there was refusal on the parental front.  My older sister, who is married, had to take the brunt of my mother's narcissism and she's basically checked-out of the family and I hardly see her.  My younger sister is on her way to checking out; she's decided to move in with my older sister and her husband while she finishes college.  

If you don't mind me asking, what was it like talking to a counselor?  How did they direct the healing process?
