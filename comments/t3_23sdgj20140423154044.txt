As a hunter, a gun owner and an avid shooter oh yes I can relate.

Whether it's assuming that the gun I'm carrying belongs to which every man is nearest to me, or assuming that I only go on hunting trips with my husband to do the cooking... yes. Or my personal favorite being redirected to the pink guns. "Oh honey that calibers too big for you!"

The upside I suppose is that I swindle these men when I'm bartering for ammunition and for used guns. Equally my husband and father-in-law are quick if not quicker to correct those who make these assumptions. Individuals do look a little ashamed after I put them in their place.

What I find very interesting though, is that the assumption seemingly to be held by men. If I'm interacting with the woman vendor, she rarely assumes that I'm shopping for my husband. I assume this is because she's faced the same frustrating interactions that I have and doesn't wish to perpetuate them.

Not sure I have any advice to to give you, beyond staring them straight in the eye and telling them "No it's for me".
