People are... not reading this article before commenting. In summary: Drunk sex happens, but alcohol is also used to explain away sexual assault when it does happen. The idea that all drunken sex is rape is a straw man. Rather, when someone is so drunk they can't stand up, their ability to make informed decisions is impaired, and they can be coerced into doing things. Sure if a drunk person crashes a car that's on them, but if I shove the keys into their hand and put them into the car and instruct them to drive... I've done something fucked up, regardless of the muddy legal details.

I'm convinced that no one bemoaning the "regret sex rape" epidemic has been to a college party. What I remember as someone who was frequently sober was a disturbing number of sober people just standing around waiting for other people to get drunk enough to be carted off. Hell, even better the person who keeps handing an already drunk person beers and assuring them that they haven't had that many when they're trying to keep count. It was all some pretty predatory shit no matter who was doing it, and it doesn't have to be iron-clad in the eyes of the law in order to be morally culpable.
