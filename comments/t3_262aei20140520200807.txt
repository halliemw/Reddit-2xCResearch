I want to point out that late term abortions are almost never done on a viable, healthy baby.  They are drastic interventions in horrible and heartbreaking situations including severe birth defects, and less frequently, very young girls, often victims of inter-familial rape, who were too young and/or scared to get help early on.  I saw a poster while driving in west Texas this weekend that stated "Abortion stops a beating heart"  That is true, but does it stop a thinking brain?
