Yep I've used it before, and in a few weeks I'm traveling alone for the first time, and just booked a 2 week stay. 

Here are my tips:

* Choose a place that has good reviews, and check the validity of the reviewers. 
* Talk with your host over email to settle any concerns. 
* Choose a place that has a "flexible" booking policy - that way you are free to leave part way through your trip and will still get your money back for any days not spent there. 
* Make sure you have an emergency contact who knows where you are at all times, including address and phone number of your host. 

Good luck and happy travels to you!
