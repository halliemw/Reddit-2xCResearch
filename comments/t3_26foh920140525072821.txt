I was in London recently (Australian girl) walking with my boyfriend back from dinner and a tipsy man grabbed my waist as I walked past him, I shouted "do not touch me". His friend said "I think he was trying to touch me" I replied "I don't think so" as I walked off and the handsy guy said sorry and his friends had a go at him. 

I think loudly objecting is a good method to embarrass them.
