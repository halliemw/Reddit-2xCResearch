More times than not I do notice this and try not to make guys feel like it's their fault that I won't go out with them. It does take guts to approach someone with an invitation, and I definitely don't want to be rude in such a situation. 

It's just one of those things when the actions of a few assholes leave a bad enough taste in my mouth to question everyone that approaches me. It's a personal struggle as much as it is a disdain towards the situation as a whole. I guess I just mostly wish that I could have interactions with some of these guys without it relating directly to attraction or lack thereof. It'd be cool to grab a beer and talk without feeling like they're expecting something from me.

It's just such a tricky situation. I don't know. I do appreciate your view on it all though. Thanks for sharing:)
