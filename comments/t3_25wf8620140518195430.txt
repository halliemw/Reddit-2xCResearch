I think that it's different for different people. I'm happy for you that you are happily engaged, and I'm glad that you didn't "sleep around" if you didn't want to. 

I have slept with many people, sometimes casually, sometimes in committed relationships, and I couldn't be happier with my choices. It certainly hasn't "ruined me mentally", nor has casual sex ruined anyone I know. 

I would suggest to you that your friends may have had mental problems unrelated to their sexuality, or that only *you* consider them to be "ruined", and that you are making a huge leap by thinking it was sex that ruined them. 

I'm 37 now. Maybe you'll understand what I am saying when you are older.
