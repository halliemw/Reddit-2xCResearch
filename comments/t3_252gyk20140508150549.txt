Can you call the prosecutor and ask what questions you might be asked?  That way, you can plan out what you're going to say, and you might not be so rambly.  And you can give short answers.  If the lawyers need more details, they'll ask more specific questions.  

I know court rooms and trials are intimidating, but they're just questions and the people you'll be talking to are just people.  Remembering that helps me sometimes.  They're just people.
