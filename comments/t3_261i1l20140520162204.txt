Well for some it's a hard choice, but when I had mine, I knew before I even became pregnant.  There were no other options in my mind, within the hour I found out I had already scheduled the appointment.  I feel no shame, no regret, and I rarely think about it (only when other's bring up abortions).  I am happy healthy and wouldn't have changed a thing about it.  It's no more than some cells my body had produced, there was no long nights of tears and what ifs.  The only thing a waiting period would have done for me would have just delayed me moving on with my life.  We are all different, but either way there should be no shame in making decisions for our own bodies, we know best about what we want/need.
