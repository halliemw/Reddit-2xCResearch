You are hilarious. Im glad you have turned your frustration into humour.  I was on a seafood binge when I got my first one. Thought it had something to do with that. I was sadly mistaken when I realized the smell was coming from my beautiful flower.  I looked it up for you. There about 20 bucks. http://mobile.walmart.com/ip/Biocodex-Florastor-Probiotic-Dietary-Supplement-20ct-Capsules/14894566?type=search
