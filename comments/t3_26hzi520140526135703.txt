Self defense weapons are as much about psychology than they are about use during an actual attack.  Purchase and learn to use whatever type of self defense tools you need to feel safe.  Even if the statistical odds of you being attacked aren't that high, it's impossible to measure the value of feeling safe.  Also, feeling confident and safe will give you better body language and honestly is more likely to deter a potential attacker.  So just having it with you and feeling safer can actually prevent the need to ever use it!  

I hope you get what you want and feel safe in your new home.  Best of luck to you.
