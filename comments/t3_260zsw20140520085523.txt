Totally personal opinion (I'm an atheist): I would run far & fast from anyone who believes in a literal sense that Satan is tempting them. Particularly when that temptation involves the faith, conversion, or behavior of another person.

In your case, I think give it a few days. Think about things, talk with your counselor. Maybe consider talking with some of his church leaders - they may run a pre-marriage or relationship counseling class. Just be aware that you shouldn't feel you're railroaded or made a villain. Your relationship has a problem/obstacle, that doesn't mean you are the problem.
