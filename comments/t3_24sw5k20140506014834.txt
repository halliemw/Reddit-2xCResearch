This sounds really similar to my situation a year ago. My ex husband was spending a lot of time talking to this woman and it was making me really uncomfortable but he swore nothing was going on. This went on for about two years before I finally left him. A week later he was in a serious relationship with her. Yet he still swears there was absolutely nothing going on before that. 

My dad told me something that really stuck with me when I was having a hard time in the months after leaving my husband. He said, "You're an angel and he's a dumbass." It really stuck with me for some reason.
