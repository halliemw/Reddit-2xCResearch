Some people swear by Hitachi, but in my opinion, that's like... the jackhammer of stimulators. It's super powerful which threw me off too much to get off.

There's all kinds of erotica online you can read to get yourself in the mood, like [LitErotica](http://www.literotica.com/stories/) or [Kristen Archives](http://www.asstr.org/~/Kristen/), and they have different categories for whatever tickles your fancy :)

For the physical aspect, it definitely takes a couple tries to figure out what works for you because maybe direct clit stimulation is too sensitive or you need to build up anticipation by stroking your fingers over your skin. 

Masturbating before bed is a great way to relax and I've found in a sexually active relationship, I masturbate more because it's like.. revving the engine before the race :D Masturbating makes me think about sex more and in turn, I want it more with my partner.
