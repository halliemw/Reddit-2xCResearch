EXACTLY!! See why I'm so puzzled by them? The most I'll answer is if they just keep asking, but I won't go into details. But they find a way to keep talking (About themselves mainly) and if you just read between the lines, they're basically saying they had a better time, I did something wrong, or I need to do this or that in another way.. it goes on and on. I don't know if I'm making sense but I've never really had to deal with people like this, so it is very new to me.
