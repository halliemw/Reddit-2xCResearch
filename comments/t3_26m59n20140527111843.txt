When you signed the lease, how many tenants were on the *legal* document?

Surely the new g/f is showering, charging her phone, etc., so she's also incurring additional utilities costs. 

Speaking up now is not being a bitch, it's realizing your rubicon has been crossed and that you pay for a safe, comfortable domicile. 

If you can, ask to meet just with your roommate. Beforehand, decide whether this new chick may stay, and under what terms. Treat your current roommate to a coffee, and calmly explain that you're concerned about the sudden new tenant on the property. Review any agreement you made when you signed the lease with her, and point out how this violates that agreement even if just in spirit. Keep yourself as calm and neutral as you can, and be prepared to negotiate (which means you already know what's not negotiable). 

If your housemate is unwilling to budge, investigate whether you can relocate or whether your landlord has feels about the third tenant not paying her fair share. You may have to cede the apartment or get her kicked out for violating lease terms, if you feel like taking it that far. In my experience, I've been sure my housemates were going to tear my head off for expressing my concerns, but when I took the time to make them feel safe, respected and keep the terms neutral, I've had great outcomes. 

Best of luck!
