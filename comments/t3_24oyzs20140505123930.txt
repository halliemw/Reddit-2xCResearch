No. I was saying that I was initially put off by the hatred of women on TRP but your sub helped me understand the philosophy more. I do agree with some of it. (Although I don't think it is right to bash women for their life choices) For example, not that it is any of your business but I stayed off the "carousel" as you call it and found a man who treats me well. We have been together since 2006, married in 2011 and are very happy. I agree that it is good to keep the man in your life happy, it will obviously help you to have a better relationship. (Within REASON of course. If a man treats a woman badly, he deserves to be called out on it) That's why I asked the question about hair. But whatever, if you want to ban me that is your choice. I find it creepy that YOU are stalking me on other subreddits now. Who's the troll now?
