I'm commenting as a female long-time community member.

I have not received unwanted PMs, and actually I've received an increase in number of friendly, supportive PMs from women who wanted to talk in more detail/privately about their personal concerns or their birth control choices. I've seen an increase in questions about birth control and fairly straightforward relationship questions, which makes me think that women who might not previously have realized that TwoX existed are finding this to be a welcome place to go for this kind of question. I'm therefore happy that TwoX is currently a default because we're able to reach more women.

For threads that are obviously going to attract controversy, I've found that the mods are actually pretty fast at removing at least top-level posts that violate the rules and/or say things like "as a man" or imply that false rape accusations outnumber actual rape. For the PSA Rape thread, even sorting my controversial doesn't yield you that many mansplaining/false rape statistics hits.

I've definitely got more downvotes for completely benign statements. I've noticed this is starting to go away. The gross-out posts have decreased in frequency, the rants about being a default have decreased in frequency. Comments on people's IFF submissions are pretty normal... I feel like we are returning to how it was previously, and I do not feel like my experience on TwoX is remarkably different.
