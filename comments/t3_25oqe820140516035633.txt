It took me years to label what happened to me as rape. Because it was my long term boyfriend. Every time someone posts those 'helpful tips' on how to avoid being raped I want to scream. I'd been with this guy for years. We lived together. I loved him. I was asleep in *our* bed when he decided he wanted sex. I didn't, but that didn't matter.

I know not all rapes are the same, but telling women not to get too drunk or walk home alone perpetrates the image of the rapist as a stranger in a dark alley. It's a dangerous standard. 

I'm pretty sure my ex doesn't classify what happened as rape. Actually, I'm pretty sure he doesn't think about it at all. 

We need to talk about this - a lot. We need to educate both men and women. And the victim blaming needs to stop.
