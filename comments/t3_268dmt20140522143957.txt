>Periods suck less.


Not for me, OP.  I bleed so heavily that I can't even wear tampons, so If I'm not shaven during my period, my bush becomes a bloody hairy sticky, painful mess.


I love the positive body message in this post.  Enjoy this moment of self discovery, new found body acceptance, or whatever you want to call this moment.  It sounds beautiful.     :)
