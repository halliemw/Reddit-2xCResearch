This...fills me with strange hope. I am pretty lazy but can also get stuff done (motivated by necessity and negative consequences). I have been in fear of my want for children because although I take doting care of my two cats, I always fear I'll be to lazy for kids. Like I'll screw them up because I enjoy spending my weekends at home instead of hiking or whatever motivated people do.

Thanks! :) I hope your not so little one is doing well.
