My first job after graduating from my all-girls private school was as a deckhand on a sailing ship where I shared a cabin with five men. My only privacy was a little curtain I could pull across my bunk. Suffice to say I was a little apprehensive about the whole thing, but the guys I worked with were utterly brilliant, so professional and kind and not the slightest bit creepy or sleazy, and many years later they're still my friends.

As many others have said, if you pull your weight and don't expect privileges just because you're a girl (and you don't seem to be the kind of person to do that) then you'll love working outdoors with guys.
