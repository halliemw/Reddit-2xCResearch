I have a Sig 380 but I have to say that there are a lot of things to consider before you decide to purchase a pistol, beyond the "ooh guns are scary" emotional reaction. You can't take them onto federal property, which includes the postal service (of course, many people do just because the odds of anyone finding out are essentially nil). You can't take them into bars, so if you are carrying on yourself and you and your friends decide to get a drink, you may have to not drink or go back to your car and put your gun up first. Also, a pistol, ammo, a CHL license, and range time for training will end up costing you about $1000.

One other thing I forgot to mention about stun guns (and tasers) (and guns, of course) is that there is a small chance you will kill whoever is attacking you. If you are morally opposed to killing an attacker, then it may not be for you.
