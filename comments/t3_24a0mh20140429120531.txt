This is pretty disgusting. Not because the hospital is claiming it's their fault, because really that's the only defense they have at this point, but because they let it happen in the first place. The girl in question is 15, I don't care if he was her boyfriend and they claimed they're madly in love, if the legal guardian of a minor says do not let this person into the hospital room you do not let the person in. Period, end of story. Then to add insult to injury they caught this boy who shouldn't have been there to begin with, in bed with a minor who was under sedation and did nothing. Even if this girl wasn't a minor I don't think she could have given consent under all those pain killers and sedatives. I don't understand why people on this thread are justifying the actions of the hospital. "What are they supposed to control all the people who come in an out of there." YES A MILLION TIMES YES. This isn't public property just anyone can waltz right into. This is a hospital, it's supposed to be a safe environment. Even if there was no threat to her safety there could still be a threat to her health. She was in the ICU for an infection, you don't just let anyone and their brother walk in and out of there. The negligence here on the part of the hospital is sickening.
