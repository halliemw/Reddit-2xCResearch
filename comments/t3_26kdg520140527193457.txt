I'd post a question about it to /r/ABraThatFits. My guess is that the shape of your breasts might be hiding their size. You could have shallow breasts, wide roots, etc. If you post your exact measurements and your concerns on /r/ABraThatFits, they can help you figure out your best options. Shape is just as important as size when finding a bra. And let's be realâ€”you could still be growing. Puberty is just all-around a long and awkward stage, so don't get too stressed about finding the perfect bra. You'll grow into your body eventually.
