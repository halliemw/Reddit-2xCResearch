Since 2003--and in many cases well before this--states have made a push to reduce the legal limit at which you are considered "intoxicated" from .10 (or higher) to .08. There is currently no state in the union where the limit is higher than .08. Women tend to weigh less than men, which is one of many variables that means they will metabolize alcohol more slowly, and reach the point of "impairment" faster. Combine this with an atmosphere where DUI cases are prosecuted vigorously--with officers taking pride in arrests and some prosecutors bragging of 100% conviction rates--and it's very easy to understand why an increasing percentage of women are being arrested for the crime.  
Having written this, I hope it doesn't give anyone the impression that you will be unfairly targeted if you have a safe amount of alcohol and get behind the wheel. There are many things you can do to protect yourself, some of which are described [here](http://www.motorists.org/dui/traffic-stop). The most important thing you can do is familiarize yourself with the laws in the jurisdiction where you live, and, of course, arrange for someone sober to drive if you plan on consuming alcohol.
