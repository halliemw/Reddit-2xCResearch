I second this. Swimsuits are a freaking nightmare. I can't find a one-piece that fits because I'm tall and they always give me a front wedgie lol. And I have broad shoulders, so if I can't find my BRA size in a swimsuit (not S-M-L) then my boobs are hanging out the sides. 

I think they're so hard to size because even if they fit right, you're almost exposed and if they fit even a tiny bit off... you're exposed. In public.
