I was so so tired but I would push through work and working out. Other symptoms were/are hair loss (I've lost so much hair), brain fog,headaches, irritability...I was a mess. The fog and headaches are gone and I'm a bit less fatigued now. Hopefully my hair will start coming back in though. 

I got 5 rounds of 200mg of iron. I'll be getting blood work next month to find out what my levels are - hopefully I'll be up in the 50s at least. 

As for cost I ended up being very very lucky in that my insurance paid for it all and I didn't owe a cent. But it looks like they charged around 500 for each infusion I think.
