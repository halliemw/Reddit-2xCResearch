I'll usually try to drop the b word early in the conversation if I think the guy is flirting with me/going to ask me out.  I just want to let him know early on "if you're wanting to pick someone up, you're barking up the wrong tree."  I don't want to spend the evening talking to him (because I like talking to cool people) and have him expecting it to go somewhere.  I also don't want him to miss out on taking home a girl who is unattached and interested in him (and I don't want her to miss out either.)
