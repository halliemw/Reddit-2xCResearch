> at least 3 forms of government-issued ID to get into the polling location.

I don't get why this is controversial? In every other first world country you need to show ID to vote, to open a bank account, to register a car etc. If you don't require voting ID whats to stop me taking a busload of like minded people around to every polling booth in town on election day and each of us casting ten votes?
