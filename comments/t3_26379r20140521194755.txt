Thank you for posting this! It's important to see that not all Black women are uncomfortable with the way they look and it's incredibly condescending to push these fantasies of the poor Black girl wishing she had blond hair and blue eyes. Some of us are incredibly proud of our beauty in spite of what media and society tells us, and that should be celebrated.

As usual with these kinds of posts, I'm kinda side-eying comments directing the convo to the pale girl struggle. It's cool that you can find similarities in your own experiences even if you're not Black, but being picked on in middle school for being pale is not the same as the systemic damage that colorism/shadeism inflicts on women of color. I hope people realize that.
