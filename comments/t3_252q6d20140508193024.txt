Why wasn't this in a stickie at the start of things? Why didn't you actually start a debate rather than disseminating info in a very piecemeal fashion?

What is the mod response to the poll on whether 2X should be a default?

What is the plan to solicit subsequent community feedback?

I find the explanation that your job would be harder if you gave a timeline inadequate. It gives the people here no way to know if they're being heard. You say that you're listening, but have failed to do anything concrete to back that up. 

Essentially, in the wake of how badly this was handled, why should I trust the mods' judgment?
