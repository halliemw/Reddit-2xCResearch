Over the internet, everything becomes "radical," because it is easy to do and the hivemind (of whatever group you are speaking to) will react accordingly, in disagreement or agreement.  Let's a look at some examples.  Internet atheism is a good one.  In real life, these atheists go to work, go to class, pay bills, and live a very similar life to a believer.  But if you look at the internet atheist, it is "GOD is a faggot and the people that believe in it are st00pid, Christmas isn't even the real birthday, I eat children because I'm evil lol."  

Next up, take a look at the liberal/conservative INTERNET views.  In real life, a conservative may support gay marriage.  A liberal may wish for tax cuts.  But not on the internet, because it makes everyone into a radical warrior.  Unless you are down with a $15 minimum wage, single-payer healthcare, and basic income, then you are not a liberal.  If you think that a dude should be able to marry his boyfriend, or that businesses can be dicks, then you are not a conservative.  Because of the anonymity that the internet provides, liberals = libtards and conservatives = racist hicks.

The same thing happens with feminism.  Radical thoughts and actions get more attention, which inspires more of the same, which inspires more of the same, which leads to the lines being blurred.  I hope that makes sense.
