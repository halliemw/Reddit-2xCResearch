Everyday on the street, "Hola guapa!" Which isn't horrible, but is slowly grating. 

Also the men in my neighbourhood, who I don't know, think it's unsafe for women to walk home alone at night so pretty much every time one will accompany me. It's super weird, especially since it's only the last two blocks of the walk...
