That's awesome! I think it's great how nowadays being a father isn't just a background thing: my husband made sure his job wouldn't require More than forty hours a week so he'd be able to spend time with our kids, and now I'm in school working towards my masters, he's willing to move anywhere a job opens up for me (he's a programmer, and says there's jobs everywhere for that). My own father couldn't be bothered once I hit puberty unless I was willing to do laundry or cool dinner.  
Hooray for good men!
