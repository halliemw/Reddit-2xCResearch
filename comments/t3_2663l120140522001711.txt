Sounds like you've got a [missing stair](http://pervocracy.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/missing-stair.html) situation. Seeing as you don't have M on your side. I'd leave the group and make it very clear to M that you're leaving because he helped create a hostile environment. And make it very clear to D that he made you feel uncomfortable, and that as an artist he needs to be aware of the impact his art is having on his audience.

Start a new group with everyone that has left this one.
