I only wear mine in autumn/winter (to stave off the nipplocalypse when it's not cold enough for thick clothes, but still cool enough for pointiness) or for going on dates... for reasons.

In theory, I think they're lovely, and some of them are so beautiful! It's just the whole "wearing them" part that sucks.
