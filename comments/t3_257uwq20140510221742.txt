I always feel conflicted about things like this. I can remember when I was a teenager, I had absolutely no awareness of the social implications of anything I wore. I just wanted to fit in and feel good about myself. My mom saying I looked like a slut once still upsets me to this day, and every time she made me "cover up" left me feeling hyper self-conscious and mortified. On the other hand, women's fashions were created to attract attention, especially sexual attention, and the reason young girls want to wear more revealing clothes is that's what's available and that's what everyone else is wearing. So we grow up complicit in being sexualized and objectified before we're even aware of ourselves as sexual creatures (preteen me would have been horrified to know what those teeny tiny shorts were meant to highlight). As I grew into adulthood, I was able to consciously choose when to attract attention, when to present a professional appearance, and how to look and feel good more casually. So the shaming and public humiliation is atrocious. The underlying impetus to encourage girls not to unconsciously sexualize themselves beyond what they're aware of doing is understandable. I think it would be better to educate, though, so they can make the decisions consciously. Empower them to be more in control then unconsciously complicit. I don't really know. Anyone have any thoughts?
