It's something like three days into this being a default sub, and I don't feel like it's going nearly as bad as people think it is. There's a big influx of new people right now, things take time to adjust. Trolls gonna troll, but people will get banned as needed and others will give up when the newness wears off. I doubt it will be an issue in a month or two. We're seeing lots of "what does X mean?" posts, but that's because this might be the first time for some people to ever be exposed to these ideas, and it's a place where they feel mildly safe to ask questions. I feel it's good that more people are confronted with different worldviews and people outside of who they see every day, but some 2Xers might disagree with me and argue that this isn't a teaching sub. That's fine, everyone has their own opinion on what kind of place 2X should be. But if anything, I feel we just need to update the FAQ to include common questions like "what is feminism" or "what does trans mean," as well as update rule 4 to advise posting to /r/askwomen, /r/asktransgender etc. as needed instead of bogging down a women's subreddit with guys asking basic things. Redirect and remove posts as needed, and keep things going in a positive direction.

Also, more moderators couldn't hurt. There's 18 mods for over 191,000 subscribers. That's not even one per ten thousand, and it's not counting how many people visit but aren't subscribed.
