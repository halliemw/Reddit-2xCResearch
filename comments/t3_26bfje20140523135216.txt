So, while laying in bed daydreaming of all the cool things I should do when I'm better, I started googling "alternative hair salon" in the area and found one that seemed to know a thing or two about crazy colors. I talked with the stylist for a few weeks and figured out exactly what I wanted.    
    
The actual appointment took nearly SIX HOURS - due to it taking forever to strip all the color from my hair to get it super blonde so it would take the color. But fortunately the stylist was AMAZING and we talked the entire time like old friends. Such a fun experience! Now I need to wear it out and show it off!    
    
Thanks for the compliments! If you're not able to dye your hair crazy colors, try a wig!! A bright red wig was like my training wheels to taking this step, hahaha.
