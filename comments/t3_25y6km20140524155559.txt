It could be physically possible to reduce miscarriages. Miscarriages caused by the mother's body could be prevented. Certain immuno-suppressants, uterine supplements, etc. could work. Additionally, a ton of steps could be taken to help implantation before having sex. Were the anti-choice lobbies to focus on getting governments to redirect their money to research into preventing what should be the greatest tragedy, in their eyes, they might actually seem "pro-life" by their definition of life and person. However, they spend their time trying to convince governments to defund Planned Parenthood, one of the largest contraceptive and women's health providers in the US.

You've used "person" in your argument and stated that it isn't ok to actively kill people, which a fetus is implied to be. You should define what you mean by it if you don't take the conventional approach to it.
