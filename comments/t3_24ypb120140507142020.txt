If you don't want matching rings, then don't get them! You'll be the one wearing the ring all the time, so pick something you'll be happy with. I bought my ring online, and there were a lot of good choices that were cheaper than in stores! My husband I ended up with matching rings because we have similar color tastes, but didn't decide that in advance. We both got got silver-colored rings with blue accents - mine is white gold with sapphire, his is tungsten carbide.

I got married last year. This next bit isn't that relevant to you since your wedding is going to be tiny, but I'll say it anyway for anyone else reading. My biggest piece of advice: if you're going to be cooking the food yourself, hire someone to manage the kitchen. Not to cater or cook, but just to keep the buffet and appetizers stocked. You or your relatives don't want to be running around serving food, cake, replenishing things that run out, etc. This was probably the single biggest thing that made that day less stressful for me.

Beautiful cheap dresses - if you're willing to go non-traditional, that's easy. Even regular wedding shops will have bridesmaid dresses for $200 or so. I got mine at Nordstrom for less than $300. I'm not sure where to go for cheaper traditional dresses.

The officiant - At one wedding I went to, a good mutual friend of the bride and groom got certified to perform weddings just for them. I thought that was a really special, non-religious thing to do.

Since this is something I wish I'd seen during my planning, here's the cost breakdown of my wedding. On other websites they only seem to show cost breakdowns of stupidly expensive weddings. Anyway, there were about 60+ people or so at my wedding.

* Invites - $0. Used evite. Would not recommend if I was doing it again, despite the money saved. Too many people didn't take it seriously and replied with shit like "maybe" then never updated. Or never replied at all. But since your wedding is so small you probably don't even need invites. Just call them up!
* Food - $410. Served buffet-style. Dressed up chicken and rice for the meal, along with salad. Fresh finger food veggies, french bread with hummus and herb butter for appetizers. Coffee and tea. We made the food the day before, then had the hired kitchen people warm it up. There were a lot of leftovers so we could have spent less.
* Beverages - $240. Wine and local beer. But there was so much leftover! We overspent here. Ours was an afternoon wedding, so I suppose people just drank less than they would at a evening wedding. I think I still have a bottle of wine left.
* People to manage the kitchen - $225. We hired two people.
* No venue fee because the wedding was at my parents' house.
* Cakes - $100. My mother made them. There were actually 4 normal-sized cakes instead of some towering thing. Lots of leftovers but no complaints there.
* Dress - $318. This included my dress + my mom's dress.
* Shoes - $63. I recommend 6pm.com for cheap shoes.
* Hair and makeup - $10. I did my own hair and already had enough makeup. This cost was just nail polish.
* Officiant fee - $50
* Flowers and labor - $400. We had a florist family friend who volunteered to help, but a professional would probably charge more. She made arrangements to put up all over the house, it was great!
* Other decorations - $85. Rolls of fabric for decorating the house. This also included paper plates, cups, plastic silverware we got from a bulk supply store. There were a LOT of leftovers that my parents are still using for parties.
* Ceremony musicians - $36.
* Favors - $45. Tiny bags of jellybeans with a note saying "Thank you!". I saved the leftovers and used them as halloween candy. I made these myself.
* Photography - $800. Okay, I did spend a lot here. But it was important to me to have professional-quality pictures. I didn't want my wedding pictures to be something my dad took with his iphone.

**Total: $2800 (rounded up)**

Edit:
forgot to mention music. It was $0. We made a playlist from our own music, hooked up a phone to the stereo in the house, and let it go. It wasn't a dance party, so we kept it low volume. Just for some atmosphere. Not during the ceremony itself of course!
