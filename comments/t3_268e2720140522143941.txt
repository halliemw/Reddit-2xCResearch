I agree that these students shouldn't feel ashamed or like they need to hide the fact that they are parents.  However, it seems like a yearbook is a funny place for this type of recognition.  Yearbooks are for school specific memories - clubs, sports, class trips and things like that.  We don't have pages dedicated to other kids' family lives or after school jobs, because it's not relevant.
