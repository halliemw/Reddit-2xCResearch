Definitely don't ignore it. Keep tabs on it, including the duration and amount of bleeding. The gyno might not think you have anything, but documenting this stuff might help in the long run. My mom was in a very similar situation and it took a few years before she finally had a doctor who tested her for uterine fibroids. She was in her late 30s by then and ended up having a hysterectomy. Most women don't need treatment that drastic, but my mom doesn't regret having it done. Her life has improved dramatically since then. 

Also, if possible, try to flesh out your family history as much as possible. A family history of certain conditions (like my mom's) means that you could be at a significantly greater risk of developing the same conditions. 

Disclaimer: I'm not a health professional, but everything I've just written is based off of the instruction I received from my gyno after I had a uterine fibroid scare earlier this year.
