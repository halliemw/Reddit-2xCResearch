I dunno, I'm happy she felt comfortable making this video, but I think the biggest pro-life myth is actually that there's a way to totally abolish abortion. Sure, legal abortion can be done away with, and tons of social programs could reduce the number of abortions for financial reasons. But at the most basic, unless birth control becomes perfect, with perfect access, there will always be women willing to go to great risk to obtain an abortion.
