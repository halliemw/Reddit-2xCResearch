So there is something kind if weird. I decided to venture "up there" to see what the strings feel like. But I can only find one. I've checked a bunch of times and there's just one string but I thought there were supposed to be 2. plus...it's REALLY long. Doctor said she cut them long but this string is nearly the entire length of my vagina which doesn't seem right. I'm going to call the doctor about it tomorrow. I was too scared to feel around previously so I don't know if it started out that long or if something has shifted. I'm not in any kind of pain though.
