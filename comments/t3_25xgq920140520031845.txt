You lost it in the best possible way.  Those feelings are natural, it's just a sort of unsureness because you've crossed a bridge that you cannot uncross.  But I think in the future you'll be glad you did lose to him in this context.  I've heard so many horror stories about losing v-cards to assholes at parties or to people they didn't care about.  

Two young, beautiful people who care about each other experiencing this for the first time is the best context possible (even if it wasn't his first time, it was his first time with you so it was still special to him I'd wager).  I know how you feel, I felt the same way when I lost mine.  It was just a little doubt about whether I really made the right decision and all that.  But I really think you did make the right decision and you'll look back on the memory and be glad you did it with someone who loved you and treated you right.

Being a virgin isn't important, but how you lose your virginity is (for most people, you and I included, I'd say)  I lost my virginity to my first girlfriend 9 days after we met (I was 18 too).  Afterwards I wondered if I made the right decision.  But after hearing so many of my friends tell me about the first times they had with people they didn't know at all, didn't find attractive, didn't like or they just plain used a prostitute because they wanted to get it over with, I knew I had made the right choice.  She was beautiful and we were young and loved each other and I'll always be glad I lost it to her.
