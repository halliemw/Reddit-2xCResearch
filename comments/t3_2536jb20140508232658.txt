I used it as well as about half a dozen others.  The best one for me was Lexapro, but I have since gotten off of everything.  The insomnia was horrible on all of these drugs, and the Doctor was always ready to prescribe something for each of the side effects.

The absolute worse was not being able to cum.  I don't mean not being able to get it up, the Doctor gave me viagra.  I mean you CANT cum, even when masturbating.  Most frustrating thing ever.
