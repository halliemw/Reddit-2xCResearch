The pictures with the compression wear show that you are in better shape and look so many times better than most of the women that try to compare yourself to them. You are in fantastic shape, and have made amazing progress. The excess skin is just another type of scar. Scars are what show that we are human. We are fallible and make mistakes all the time. The scars ARE what make us Amazing. I think you should absolutely embrace your skin. 

Plus, rarely do I see a woman that makes a pair of jeans look so sexy! Hot damn!
