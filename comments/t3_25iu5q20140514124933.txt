The thing is, this is hypocritical because western women live in a society where their bodies are still viewed as sexual objects, on display for men. We need to be fit, trim and curvy so that we meet the desires of the male gaze, which isn't all that different from a woman needing to be covered up so that she meets the demands of the male control in her country. 

We should focus on the true problems these women face: violence, lack of access to birth control and education, the subjugation they face. We should be helping them, not looking down upon them and focusing on something that is relatively minor (clothing) when there's a bigger picture. On top of that we need to remember that a lot of these women actively resent western women coming in and telling them that their style of dress is wrong.
