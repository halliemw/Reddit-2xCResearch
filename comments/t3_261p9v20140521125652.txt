That position is not only not supported by any data, but doesn't even make sense. Why do girls "try harder" when school starts? If you ever spent time with children, both boys AND girls in early grades are trying their hardest to seek approval. A more logical position is that both boys and girls try about equally, but girls are encouraged to try less over time. There are are clear biological difference between boys and girls, like girls growing and maturing faster, which can easily account for their better grades for equal effort to boys in early grades, since their brains are slightly more developed. When it starts to even out, around puberty, boys catch up and surpass girls. The catching up, along with social pressures and aforementioned stereotype threat, can disenfranchise girls towards school and they engage in defense mechanisms. 

They may start to disidentify with school. From the Wikipedia article I linked, they even use women facing stereotype threat as an example:
>For example, a woman may stop seeing herself as "a math person" after experiencing a series of situations in which she experienced stereotype threat. 

The difference between your position and mine is there's actually research in my area (and a lot of it).

Girls don't "try harder" than boys in the early grades. They *do* try less in later grades, though that's due to societal pressures that we should be working to eliminate.
