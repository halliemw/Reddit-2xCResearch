I think everyone is concerned & saddened by how this will impact some women on a personal level. 

But i can imagine what the politicians were thinking & still hold the view that they were probably making a good decision:

- The concept of Great Britain respecting NI's cultural & political views is important. NI's politicians represent the people, so it comes across as the people who don't want abortions, & if it is seen as murder then how could England allow a loophole that will let them pay to murder babies from NI that NI doesn't want happening in the first place, it would have bad consequences. 

- The positive side of it, it will trigger a backlash in NI, people want their right to an abortion & by making it an issue it should hopefully revolutionize NI for the better. I am sorry for any troubles you or your friends have had to go through.
