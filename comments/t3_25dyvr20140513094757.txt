Thanks so much for that. You pretty much outlined what i'm already doing so hopefully that means i'm heading in the right direction with it. I definitely do my best to stay neutral and I've made it very clear that his kid comes first and I totally understand/am ok with that. I think it's just going to take time for me to adjust and be comfortable with the situation.
