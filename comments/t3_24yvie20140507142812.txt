I don't know. I think there are two reasons. 

1. They don't understand that cyberharassment/stalking/bullying are real issues and almost all states have laws in place to charge the accused. Granted I have no idea how they could find out who is behind the accounts, but if they do find out this is definitely illegal. 

2. Other uses have suggested deleting my account or to stop using instagram. And truthfully I could do that, but I don't want to run away from it. I should be able to have a professional presence online. 

I graduate on Saturday and then I'll be moving, so if it keeps happening I will have to talk about it with my parents and probably other law enforcement officers.
