> You can't tell me that a community named "against men's rights" advocates men's rights where appropriate. That's absurd. Spending a day in their subreddit proves the absurdity.

It's been a while since I've been on reddit, so it's possible that it's changed, but AMR isn't against rights for men, it's against the "Men's Rights Movement" - a movement which does nothing for the promotion of men's rights, other than using the issues that men do deal with as an excuse to spout anti-feminist nonsense. I'm opposed to the American Family Association... does that mean I'm opposed to families, or does it mean that I'm opposed to a hate group that uses a deliberately misleading name?

They don't advocate men's rights "where appropriate," they advocate men's rights full stop. They advocate equality. Unlike MRAs. It's not like AMR wants rapists to go to prison, and MRAs don't - the people on AMR want rape to stop happening, while MRAs just want to claim that they already don't.
