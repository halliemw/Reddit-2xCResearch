I had a friend at school with ridiculously thick hair, and I don't remember liking the sound of her maintenance regime for, honestly, not great results. So I do sympathise! 

Just to clarify though, I said people don't *notice*, not that they don't care. :) 

I totally get it if people are nice enough to notice but not let it affect the way they deal with you. 

What baffles me, though, is when people seem to just not be paying attention. I mean, if you  look at my hair, it's completely obvious that it's thin enough to be not "normal". But people who know me see me in a wig, which clearly has 2-3 times as much hair as I do naturally, and assume I've just had a very flattering haircut. That leaves me speechless. Have you ever found something similar?
