OH hell yeah.

last job I took - they hired me away from a 6 month contract position that had offered me full time.  I didn't want to work full time at the contract job because it was a bit dysfunctional, but manageable.  This new job - 20% raise - full benefits immediately - and it was offering me the ability to expand my skill set into selling, which I had never done before.

I got there - first 2 weeks (christmas/new years week) were great. I had a senior programmer who helped me with the raw code and introduced me to the app.  3 day week, so I only worked 6 days with him, but I making major progress.  

Then he left.

This was a small company.  8 employees including me.  The only other employee that would speak to me (other than that senior developer) was the VP I was working with on the selling side.  The other developers would not even answer a direct question.  We are talking something as simple as "I"m going to Chipotle for lunch.  Would you like to join me?"  Not even a no.  Just a grunt.   Then they would go to Chipotle without me.  

I lasted through almost 2 months of that.  It was absolute hell.  I should have accepted that full time position with my contract job.  SIgh.  But my next big paycheck is waiting for me!!
