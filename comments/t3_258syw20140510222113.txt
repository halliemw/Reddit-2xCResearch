I think a lot of people think "taking advantage" isn't rape. Or they think "no" really means "push harder" and being passed out is an invitation because of how she's dressed. They genuinely think a wife or girlfriend is default consent. 

I don't think all men are like this. But I do think enough are that rape still is so prevalent. And I think enough men and women have the really narrow idea of rape of a stranger in the dark that it makes convincing the person who knows the victim (80 percent of cases) very difficult.

It's those kinds of rape, not the stranger in the dark, that I think education can help eradicate. The kinds people see as a shitty move but not *really* rape, and education can teach people that yeah, actually it is rape and you shouldn't do it.
