The fact is it isn't easily accessible to get an abortion in Detroit. There is one clinic that will perform the procedure, and there is one planned parenthood that offers contraception. I'm not sure if they have a state program like my state does, that if you reach a certain income threshold you may receive BC for free, but the point is that women and especially those of the poor find difficulty in accessibility due to distance, education, and money. When you either choose to spend your money on food and utilities and not BC, you're making a survival choice. When you're choosing to take a loan out and get an abortion, you're making a survival choice. This is a problem.
