You know how in Star Wars movies how when they go to hyper and the camera kind of zooms out before it zooms into all the stars flying by? [like this but in reverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvnk9dcqVbA Sorry that was terrible but it's the closest I can think of. I will look up the wikipedia page and see because I'm terrible at describing my symptoms.

Don't worry about scaring me off, I'm taking it now and I'm keeping a close eye on myself and I'm going to ask my boyfriend to do as well. My dad had a huge manic episode (full on hallucinations and everything) and ended up in the psych ward recently so I'm making sure that someone is keeping an eye on me in case shit goes down. I don't think anything was scarier than watching my dad through that time.
