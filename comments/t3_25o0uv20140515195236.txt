It's hard to say. People's track records vary. My cousin just got married to a man she met less than a year ago. And they seem like a really happy couple. My parents were the same way.

However, there is one key difference between all those people and you two: My mom was 31 when my parents got married (my dad was 27). My cousin is 25 and her husband is 29. I used to ask my mom how she could have gotten married so quickly. And her response was that when I got to her age, I would know myself really well and know what I was looking for. She had a good point. She had experienced a ton at that point. 


Let me say this: You are 20. You are still very young (and this is coming from a 22 year old). Chances are, you're still going to change. You might discover new things about yourself. And there is absolutely no reason for you to rush into this marriage. It's not like your eggs are dying or anything.

The other thing is, I've known several people who dated someone for several years, *with* the intention of marriage, and then broken up after several years, even after discussing engagement. Things happen. Circumstances change. 

As someone who was hesitant to sleep with anyone before marriage, I can understand the temptation to rush towards sex. I also understand the difficulty of living together before marriage (my parents would be very disappointed if I ever did that), and honestly, rates of divorce are higher among people who do live together before marriage. So I don't fault you with not doing that. I don't believe it's necessary. I've seen plenty of people who are happily married who never lived together first. But I would encourage you to continue dating.

 I mean, again: what's the rush? Give yourselves time to experience some stuff. Live through some hard times together. Figure out each other's life philosophies, opinions of child rearing etc. If you're so sure, it shouldn't matter to wait a little bit longer.
