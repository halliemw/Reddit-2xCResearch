For generations we have allowed our media to shape our opinions of beauty. As a result, we grow up trying to emulate a version of beauty unattainable to most people without extreme body changes and in some cases surgery. This project seeks to show our children that beauty theirs. Beauty is in every woman and every woman is worthy of love and respect regardless of body shape. I want our children to grow up without the body image hang ups that many of us have.

You are going to see ribs, fat, cellulite, wrinkles and scars. These are the things of living. If these make you uncomfortable, if they challenge you and still you look and take something away from these images, I applaud you. If you are appalled and offended and feel the need to leave, I wish on you the clarity you need one day to accept yourself and others and to see the utter coolness that is in everyone.
