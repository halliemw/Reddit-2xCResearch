I know it sounds hippy dippy but this stuff totally works and no antibiotics needed. It works for yeast infections and UTI. Its an herbal salve you scoop a little on your finger and insert it about 2-3 times a day during the infection. (for a uti you would drink tons of water and wipe a little on after peeing & wiping yourself). I personally use it every time I get a UTI and a friend of mine who is very prone to yeast infections uses it for those. She uses it maybe once a day (or every few days) when not having a current yeast infection as a preventative.
