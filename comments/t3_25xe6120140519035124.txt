*You* don't fix anything.

Your boyfriend needs to see a therapist. OCD is something that can mess up your entire life. Yes, you can have relationships, but if your behaviour is slowly hollowing out your partner's self-esteem, you both have a problem.

I'm not a fan of recommending you leave the guy, but if he refuses to get treatment, I don't really see why you should continue dating. Do you really feel like the positives outweigh the negatives? You said he makes you feel like shit, and that's something your partner shouldn't do - or if he does, he shouldn't be all "That's just how I am, deal with it". A partner should care for you, and for your feeling of self-worth. Your boyfriend uses homophobic and sexist language. He uses language that you have told him is hurtful to you. He doesn't seem to care for what you want in bed, or in this case, on the floor. He talks trash about women he doesn't even know, and he seems to be very negative about his previous girlfriends. 

Don't expect to be the exception. You will not cure him. You will not even make him better. Leave that to the professionals, and ask yourself why you are with this man. Are you okay to be with this person in the long run, even if that means you'll probably feel shitty for some time, if not most times?
