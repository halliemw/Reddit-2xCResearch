Why would it make her uncomfortable? Probably because it's intimate and involves body parts that are conventionally taboo in public places.  The same reason people would be uncomfortable with me checking myself for prostate cancer on an airplane.

That said, I think the relevant question isn't "why does this bother you," but whether a person's individual discomfort is more important than the activity causing the discomfort.  Breastfeeding a baby is a time-sensitive necessity, whereas me checking myself for cancer isn't.
