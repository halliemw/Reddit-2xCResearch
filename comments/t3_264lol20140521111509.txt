What field do you work in and is it a large company or small company? In my experience larger companies take stuff like this a lot more seriously than smaller companies. Not to say smaller companies don't take it seriously, but it really depends on the boss of the smaller companies. Corporate takes stuff like this really seriously, because they seriously don't want to get the crap sued out of them. The eye candy comment is immediate grounds for sexual harassment which corporate would take even more seriously. 

What does your boss think about the other managers behavior?
