I also had wisdom teeth out last year and consulted Dr Google extensively. I'm on the pill so don't have a "natural" cycle (often skip my period) but I read that women taking birth control pills are at slightly higher risk of dry socket - basically where the clot falls out of the hole in your gum before the wound is healed. Apparently it is incredibly painful. I think having your period also puts you at slightly higher risk of dry socket and this is why it's recommended to reschedule if needed (please correct if I'm wrong).

This didn't happen to me luckily, but my dentist never mentioned anything about being on the pill and increased risk of dry socket... best advice is speak to your dentist :D
