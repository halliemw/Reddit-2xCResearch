Me :D  My friends and those I associate with just really don't put up with it.  And anyone who does, well, I don't need them in my life.  I don't have time for that, I don't approve of it and I certainly won't stand for it.  

Now understand, I've been in situations where it's a play party and people say they want to do things.  But consent was given before hand, and things may or may not happen, but it's there and important just in case.  And I can *still* say no.

The best thing do do is surround yourself with people you aspire to be like.  It's a bit easier from there. :)
