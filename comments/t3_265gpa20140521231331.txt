I'm not sure why it's hard to believe - tenant's rights vary from place to place. I'm in Quebec, where landlords are not allowed to ask for a damage deposit, pet rent, or first or last month's rent. (That said, some landlords ask for a deposit which is subtracted from the first month's rent, but it's not hard to find places without deposits.) Landlords do almost always perform credit checks, more so than in other places I've lived.

As a tenant, I prefer it over the damage deposit system, since the majority of landlords just keep the deposit when you move out. I've only ever had one landlord return my deposit without asking even though there was no damage and everything was left in the condition it was received.
