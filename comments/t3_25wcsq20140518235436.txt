I've seen a quite a few texts that randomize their default gendered pronouns. Depending on context I like it more than a generic. It points out a lot of subtle instances of gender discrimination... but for that reason it can be slightly distracting in situations where the subject matter is already quite complex. Those are rare situations however.
