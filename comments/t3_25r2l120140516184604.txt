I hate the "intimidating" one the most.  Do people really expect someone to downplay who they are to make them feel more comfortable?  

I find that most people still subscribe to the gender roles and expect everyone else to play along.  That also includes women.

I work in an incredibly male dominated field (video games), so my experience might be a bit different.  I find that in general being a bit softer and dare I say bubbly in situations such as networking, happy hour, coffee breaks and lunches does help.  Disgusting as it may feel at times.  I think the trick is to find an equilibrium.  Being more approachable without changing who you actually are.
