Tell your parents, and talk to the guidance counsellor at your school and a teacher you trust. 

If it will make you more comfortable, tell a close friend or two that you're uncomfortable with him. Maybe they could come over to your place after school for the next few days so you don't get spooked walking alone. It also means if he tries to talk to you and you tell him to fuck right off (if he tries to approach you at school practice saying "no, I'm not interested and I've told you to leave me many times. Stop talking to me" loudly. He might try and use social pressure to try and make you feel bad for rejecting him. Don't let him. If your friends know what's up, they'll have your back.

Are you able to move so he can't look at you? Do you think the teacher would move him in front of you so it would be harder for him to stare at you.
