I have to admit, I'm not sure what I'm meant to look at in the picture. It must truly be tiny. However, I've had little blumps on my labia as well, but those were just normal coloured and they started appearing more often *after* I'd taken an STD test, so I figured it was simply friction damage...Now I'm a little bit scared.
