By family business, I meant small family business - we're talking 4 other F/T employees besides me plus 3 or 4 contract workers.  It sounds like you're indignant over the fact that I feel I deserved a less abrupt termination, and maybe this is due to something in your own life, but I feel like you're not understanding where I'm coming from.  I'm the only employee invited to family events, their kids make me cards for my birthday and holidays, the grandfather calls me to say hi, etc...  Many other companies give employees advance notice that their position will be nixed on a certain date, partly to make sure the outgoing employee finishes up all her work and trains the remaining staff on her tasks.  I wasn't a security risk.  I would've just said, hey let me cut my hours to 15-20 per week until mid-May, a little time to tie up some loose ends and start looking for something else, and then I'll be gone.  Since I'm still getting calls and they're still emailing me for help, that would've been the wisest route, and certainly a less priggish one.
