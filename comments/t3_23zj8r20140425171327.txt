I would LOVE to do that, But I feel like it would just fuel the fire... I have ignored him for so long just trying to be the better person and let it all go and move on... but clearly he isn't... I can't psychically make him stop being a child, but if I just play his game then I am giving him what he needs to call me "crazy"... That is what he loved to do when we were together, just keep pushing me and pushing me until I showed emotion, and then he exploited and manipulated it...
