Well, I got the diflucan in a bit of a weird circumstance edit: (forgot to add) I was about to go on vacation out of the country. When I got the yeast infection the doctor prescribed me two, and said to take one. If I was still having symptoms in five days, to take the second one. He said if the first one cleared it up then I should hold onto to the second one in case of another infection later on (I have really sensitive lady bits). But I definitely understand the importance of taking a full* course of medicine. 

I'm going to the doctor tomorrow for sure. Thank you so much for replying though!
