If she can't cope with the truth, she loses the privilege of having it.  She is not entitled to information about your life, and she clearly doesn't deserve it.  If you don't feel comfortable telling her to back the fuck off, leave the room.  Practice the phrase "I do not wish to continue this conversation", then leave the room.  If she follows you, leave the house.  You do not need her approval to exist, and you are not required to accept her lecture.
