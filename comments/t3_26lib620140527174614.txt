I could cry. I had a very similar experience and it haunts me to this day. 
I had a hard time even calling it molestation for a long time. Not until I took a child abuse and neglect class in school where my behavior throughout my whole life was just so spot on to children who have been molested.

Another aspect of my issue is that there were a lot of mental games that we're used to control me.
I was molested by two sisters who would hold me down and hump me or pull off my clothes and look inside my vagina. All while being babysat by their mother who truly was oblivious.
Their mother was also really strict on diet I.e. No junk food. The girls would get really jealous of the fact that I was allowed to eat fruit roll ups and pop tarts and all that crap. So, in order to get my treats.. They would kind of blackmail me by saying "if you don't bring us pop tarts tomorrow we'll tell your mom you like to touch us down there."

Even though I was the victim, they would threaten to say I was the aggressor.
The older of the two girls was 14 while I was 6. Truly, a 14 year old knows what she is doing much more than a 6 year old.

I have always felt as though people think I'm a lesbian because of those terrible years being babysat. And this happened for a period of about 3 years.



It feels wonderful to get this off of my chest even if just to the reddit world :)
