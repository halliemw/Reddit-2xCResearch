Jeez... what a difficult situation to be in. You shouldn't have to move because of him!

I wish I could give you some advice, but I don't want to tell you to do anything illegal, so I won't. Hang in there! Keep thinking, discuss it with your friends, maybe a solution will appear...

although I feel I should say one thing. Date rape is rape. Have you considered pressing charges? I know you probably just want to put it behind you, but maybe it's an option?
