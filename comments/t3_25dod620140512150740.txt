I'm currently eating a diet low in carbs and higher in protein. Protein is what triggers the 'full' feeling, and carbs are really easy to eat too many of. 

I've found in the past that the best 'diets' are the ones that make the fewest changes to out routines. Cooking meat and vegetables instead of meat/vegetables and rice/pasta has not been a big change, although I'm struggling with breakfasts at the moment.

My Mum accidentally lost a lot of weight this way (gluten allergy) and my father-in-law has purposefully lost a lot of weight this way.

Disclaimer: None of the people I know or myself have used this to lose a large amount of weight.
