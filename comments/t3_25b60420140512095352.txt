People who do full term breastfeeding are feeding their kids proper foods - that starts prior to them turning one.  It's not like they're only getting breastmilk.

But what about this psychological process? What evidence do you have that if that's not done by 2-3 it's "bad" or results in psychological damage? I have no intention of going that long, I am ramping down and weaning now, but I've never seen any actual evidence that going longer is a problem or creates psychological damage (I've seen plenty of people saying it, because they think it's weird, but no study/evidence or indication from any medical association that it's bad).
