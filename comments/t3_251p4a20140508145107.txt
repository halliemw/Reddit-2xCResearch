I see the point you're trying to make, but I also feel like I've seen the side of reddit that reflects the population of women on this site. I don't know if the "we're all guys here" mentality permeates that much either-- but then again, I don't draw many assumptions until I've read the comments. I understand why this is happening, I just don't think that this is really the right way to go about doing it.

I feel as though the assumption that everybody is a guy on reddit is one of those circle-jerk type of concepts where a few people think it, but not everybody feels-- it's just that those that are inclined to think it are vocal about it.
