When I first learned about periods, I was really excited to get it, because I figured it would mean I was an adult and whatnot.

I actually got it during middle school. We had an assembly and I was sitting on the ground in the gym for a long time and I thought that was why my back was hurting. I finally got home, went to the bathroom to pee, saw the brownish looking nonsense and then IMMEDIATELY GOT A NOSEBLEED. It sucked, and I totally started crying. When my mom got home I cried and told her, and she was just like, "this is supposed to be an exciting day for you!" No, it was not.
