I was just trying to give you a bit of historical perspective on this issue, and I am certainly not trying to deflect the matter as I have numerous times expressed that I am against both  these practices, but I use a different philosophical background to justify it. As for the doctor being "furious", I stand by what I said, it's cultural bias - "prophylactic" surgery doesn't exist anywhere else in medicine.

I think it's a pity that these issues are so genderized, I'm not interested in posting in mensrights - thanks.
