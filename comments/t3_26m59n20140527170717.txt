> I would try to stick with statements of fact. You like your roommates girlfriend, you notice she's been staying over more and more, you've noticed a spike in electricity and water use, your lease says that the apartment is being rented to x number of people, and feel that it is unfair to move in another person who is paying.

i have lived in a few shared flats in my life. 

the best way to split costs is as following:

rent (and rent only) is shared so that everyone pays a share that is equal to the ratio of private space. communal space is split so that anyone pays an equal share.

all utility costs are equally split. there is absolutely no fair way to calculate heating, water, electricity and internet usage.

given the fact that you really don't mind the gf in the flat you should propose changes to the rental agreement. 

it's okay that you pay a bit more of the rent (rent !) because you have more private space, it's very much not okay that you pay utility for someone else.
