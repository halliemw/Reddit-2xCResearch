Exactly. My parents gave me a choice of what school I would attend (local public school and a catholic school). My family wasn't remotely well off, and my clothes weren't real awesome, but the catholic school had a very rigid uniform system with single options like yours did. I decided to go the public school route with fashion anarchy, and while sometimes it really sucked, at least I could buy things that didn't make me look tremendously heinous, or made me feel physically ill.

Besides, while useful at times, uniforms don't fix everything. My friends at the catholic school had to adhere to the uniforms, but jewelry, makeup, hair, and phones (along with bodies that could fit into the uniforms well) became the ways of attaining status instead of clothing, which aren't really much better, as they still included body, class and gender policing. There's always a hierarchy like that, and I've never really understood the idea that uniforms fight that effectively. Is it effective for somewhat leaning what culturally appropriate clothing is for when they graduate into the workforce? Sure, but that's about it, from my vantage point. But if people are going to implement them, there should be a number of acceptable options per article of clothing for students, to ensure some flexibility.
