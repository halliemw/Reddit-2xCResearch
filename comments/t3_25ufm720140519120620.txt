You're dealing with men that either have esteem, masculinity, or fear issues but aren't self-actuated enough to confront that reality.

So they identify a group that has "victimized" them or that they feel they can safely demean.  They wouldn't say that kind of shit to another man because they know it would be met with aggression.

The best thing you could tell them is "Go take a look in the mirror, I believe you will find the source of most of your problems." but I doubt it's going to make a difference.
