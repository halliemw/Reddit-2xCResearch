As someone who is very empathetic, I can understand how you feel. It boils my blood when I think about someone hurting my siblings.

Regarding less than sensitive people...
I have a couple not-so-close friends that will occasionally joke about rape. Like, for someone's surprise party they yelled out "rape" instead of "surprise". It is their brand of humor. I'm not very close to them, and they don't know that I've been sexually assaulted in the past. Every time one of them says something like that, I think they are being kinda insensitive. After all, sexual assault happens to 1 in 5 women. That doesn't even include everyone that is affected by rape. It partially bothers me, but it just makes me realize how out of touch some people can be when they are a) not empathetic or b) have never been personally affected. I've just come to realization that some people are not like me (emotionally) and may never be.

Some people insist that you have to have a thick skin to be on the internet. I think it's totally ok to acknowledge that something is bothering you so long that you don't obsess over it. 

Also, you shouldn't be attacked for having an opinion and sharing your experiences. Whether or not that guy was right in his statement is invalid (since you were adding to the discussion).
