This reminded me- my first job was in fast food, and I wanted to work in the kitchen but they put me up front as a cashier. I soon realised that all the kitchen staff were exclusively male and most of the cashiers female. I still don't understand why, because the management was equally mixed male/female at the time. What's with this perception?
