For what it's worth, I was never boy/girl crazy or crushing on anyone.  Which lead my parents to assure me that they would support me if I was gay.  

Started dating half-way through college, just because everyone else was dating. Found that I very much enjoyed it, and started having relationships.

Happily married for well over a decade at this point.
