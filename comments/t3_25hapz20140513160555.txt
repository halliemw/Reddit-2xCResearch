If you have spoken to him and he confirmed that you should not ever expect to have a weekend with him without racing, then he's telling you what you need to know. He's not doing anything wrong by having a hobby (although if he's taking out loans against his 401k to support his hobby, that's a totally different discussion), but you aren't obligated to stay with him if you want to be in a relationship with more free time together.
