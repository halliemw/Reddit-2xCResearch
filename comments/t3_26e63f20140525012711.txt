They break SUPER easy! It's a weighted mechanism that is supposed to dispense the tampons but unless it's fully stocked doesn't typically have enough weight to operate correctly. When a machine has had a few removed (either from purchase or not fully stocked) it tends to jam because the bottom comes up slightly. Then a frustrated and desperate girl inserts a coin and tries to twist and can jam it worse or break the tiny pieces holding it together. It's horrible technology. 

Source: worked at a gym and had to fill the machines. It was always broken so I ended up putting a sign on it and stuck a large basket of tampons at the front desks to give away for free. Ended up removing the machine completely and did a lot of research into finding ones that actually work. Found one but it operates more like a pepsi machine and was crazy expensive. Also it was almost no cost to offer free tampons. You can buy a huge box of tampex brand (although cardboard) filled with around 2000 for about $100. 

Edit: ahh gee thanks :)

Edit 2: If you are in very desperate need you have better luck with the pad side. Pads weigh more thus the machine tends to work better (though still not good) for them. So if you can scrounge up 2 coins stick one in the tampon side first and then the other in the pad.
