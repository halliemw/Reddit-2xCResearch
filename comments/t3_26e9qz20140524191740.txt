I can relate to this on a few levels. First, I suggest seeking help. Find a therapist, or even a new doctor. Eating disorders are dangerous at ALL sizes. Especially dangerous if they include purging. I have met many people in treatment that were on every side of the weight spectrum.
My mother used to make jarring comments about my weight (she had an ED). But once she learned what I was doing, they stopped. She denies ever making them, but at least they stopped. So if you're willing - tell your mother how you're struggling. 
ED's are hell to fight on your own. I've found I can't do it. Seeking help is a big step, but for many a necessary one.
