That was pretty much my first thought when I heard about it. 'I bet this dude hangs out on reddit, this sounds like red pill levels of rage and entitlement'. I'm scared to go look in case they're all over there jerking about it and either praising him for maintaining alpha frame, or complaining that he wasn't alpha enough because he didn't kill enough people (although that may involve acknowledging women as people so unlikely). Completely gross.
