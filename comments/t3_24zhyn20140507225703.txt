I have a pretty badass dad. He would take me fishing with him and sometimes to work at the welding shop so I could see machinery being made, he would help me pick out my Easter dress and paint ghosts on my toenails for Halloween, and would sing a long to "Pretty in Pink" with me while he took me to ballet. He came to my cheerleading tryouts and never missed a single game, and taught me how to change brake pads and make science fair projects. He listened when I had problems with boys or friends, ran out and bought tampons in the middle of the night, made up bedtime stories, played Polly pockets with me, and let me watch "Tora, Tora, Tora" at entirely too young an age. He didn't let me get that awesome tattoo I wanted at the age of 15 and every time I stumbled home drunk at the age of 16, he put me to bed and grounded me accordingly. He treated me like I was his little girl, even now, as an adult, telling me my shorts are too short and freaked out when he accidentally found my vibrator.  

The point is, don't look at her as your daughter. Look at her as someone you wholly, and totally love, are absolutely crazy about and want to do right by. Be her dad, and be her friend. Care about all the amazing and wonderful things she's going to discover and want to try and learn. Share with her. Share what you care about, what you want to learn and what you know. Forgive her when she messes up, and she will forgive you for grounding her for failing gym class. 

TL:DR; YOU MADE A BABY!
