Depends on the situation, time of day, place, etc. In some situations I'll put my keys between my fingers, ready to scratch if they are sickos who attack, sometimes I'll pretend to make a phone call (or actually make one), and I'll look around for people I might run to, if it's necessary. These percussions I mainly find necessary to do at night.
Otherwise I ignore it. Keep my head looking straight forward, walking away from the situation, as fast as fucking possible without running.
