I watched the video you linked to.  I've actually seen a lot of those same thoughts posted on reddit many times.  Guys lamenting that women don't appreciate how amazing they are and obliviously crying that the hot women they deserve are so shallow or foolish.  The people who think this way fail to see that they want people to appreciate them for who they are (which isn't that wonderful once you've heard what they have to say), but they only want to appreciate other people for how they look.

I assume there's some sort of mental illness at work here, but I don't think this type of hypocritical and delusional thinking is uncommon, it's just that most people don't lash out violently.
