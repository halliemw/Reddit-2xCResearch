To ask for and receive medical advice over the internet and to give out anecdotal advice to someone who could be having a serious medical problem is incredibly reckless. 

Anonymous people on the Internet are no substitute for medical or mental health professionals and frankly, mods should end it right now. That shit doesn't fly in AskReddit, or any of the medical subreddit because of how easy it is to spread incorrect or harmful advice.
