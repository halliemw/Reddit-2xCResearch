I see your point, but my life got SO much easier when I finally escaped high school and no longer had to deal with horrible mean hormonal teenagers and tests and homework and the Presidential Fitness Test.  (Damn you, pullups!).  

Growing up gave me much more autonomy.  Of course, I stayed single and childless so I had a lot of freedom.
