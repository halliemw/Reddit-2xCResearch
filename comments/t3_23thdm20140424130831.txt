Totally agree. It really depends on OP's guy's job too. I work in IT and I find bullshit reasons to call off all the time. I get plenty of PTO, I have lots of days where my calendar is empty and I don't have any pressing projects.

However, I wouldn't use my partner as an excuse, and I wouldn't do it knowing there was a chance that my partner might actually need support and therefor I should save that time for them. If he'd just taken the day (no excuse), it would have been zero bad but using her as an excuse is pretty cruddy.
