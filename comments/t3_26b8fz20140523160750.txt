Damn, I read that last night and I was impressed. I thought the way you handled the situation was perfect, with respect to the Bride and Groom and a full explanation to them about why you wouldn't attend. I think that took a lot of courage on your part, ESPECIALLY given that you were now exposing a very sensitive part of your life in great detail. I was then very pleased to read how the Groom went about handling the situation. From my personal perspective that was the best part of all of it, that he had enough respect for you and the situation to immediately turn around and call this guy to un-invite him from the wedding.   
I'm really sorry you got some terrible PM's. I for one was glad to see the sub hit default as I have learned quite a bit while being here. One of the best posts I saw was the post where a 19 year old man asked what feminism was. He was clearly misinformed (I'll admit, I had some inaccurate preconceived notions as well) and the women that responded to him had some absolutely FANTASTIC responses. It was really a great thread, and I am really glad I read it.  
That all being said, I understand that the change to a default subreddit also comes with the influx of default trolls and hatemongers. It's really unfortunate, and I wish I had stumbled across this sub a long time ago. Like I said, I really have learned a lot and I feel like I understand the women in my life a bit better than I did before.   
I am a 26 year old male, if that makes any difference whatsoever.
