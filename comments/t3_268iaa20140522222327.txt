Wolverine does that a lot too..

But Janeway is totally a Mary Sue.  She's the best at every single thing on the ship.  I guess with great power comes great introspection with Da Vinci?

I'm really not convinced of the "Power Fantasy".. seems like a very convenient dismissal tool.  A thought terminating cliche.
