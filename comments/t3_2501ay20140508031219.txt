I'm afraid I disagree. I find it to be the precisely correct amount and direction of criticism. (If this is hypocritical, then so was Edward Snowden for using a trusted position to take and disclosing private information about the NSA.)

Our word choice has power, and continually leaning on the same phrase to describe these is attempting to leverage the moral outrage of a peep shot with recording a conversation for legal evidence. If you want to explain why the latter is bad, please do it without trying to slop moral opinions across boundaries.

The guy took a photo of something we as a society and OP in specific hold as very private information: our nudity. A similar type of situation with an audio record would be recording him confessing to a diaper fetish or something (which is not something reasonable for OP to expect on her tape). Nothing really intrinsically private of the guys is in danger of being released.

Also consider the fact that so far as I'm aware, in every state in the US, taking and keeping a nude photo of someone in a private setting without their consent is against the law, whereas in a large majority of states, it's legal to record any conversation so long as one party knows about the recording.
