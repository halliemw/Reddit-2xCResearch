Ain't nobody got time for that. I think it's fair to be spending *your time* enjoying yourself, and the company you have. We've all met someone who is *nice buuuutttt... damn s/he's annoying.* (I agree it feels weird to be feeling this way when we kind of experienced this in middle/high school). If you don't feel like you're not getting anything from being with this person, I think it's fair to be without them.
