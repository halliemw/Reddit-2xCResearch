Here's a serious question: I see some intense downvotes happening in the new section to nearly every post. Sure, I'll upvote the stuff I want to see on the front page of 2X, but that's like throwing a bucket of water at a wildfire. How are you going to moderate that? How am I going to report those downvotes?

For pete's sake, one of the top post in 2X right now is titled "what is feminism?" by some teenage boy. Is that what 2X is about now?
