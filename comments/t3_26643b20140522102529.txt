Nursing student here. While nothing can replace the amount of education and training that MD's have, Nurse Practitioners can be great people to receive primary care from. That being said, you should realize that an actual medical doctor knows a lot more and shouldn't be afraid to get a second opinion on things. While [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11934775) has shown that the quality of an NP's primary care is on par with an MD's, it's important to realize that incompetence is not exclusive to any one profession and that MD's know a shit ton more than NP's.
