I have told one friend who I was closer to, who I don't think believes me. The group was all friends before I joined in, and pretty much all guys & their girlfriends. I didn't tell anyone else because I'm extremely private and I wasn't that close to anyone else. Once the friend I told wasn't supportive, I just decided to drop it and not be friends with any of them anymore. 

They know something happened because within a day we went from being best friends to not speaking, and they probably assume it was something sexual since we were apparently seen leaving the party together, but not the full situation.
