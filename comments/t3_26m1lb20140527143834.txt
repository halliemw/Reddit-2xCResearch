>No, that's called having a preference.

Then it should be stated as "I prefer X," not "she should do X." Besides, most fashion choices women make are *not* to appear good-looking to men, they are to appear good-looking to themselves.

>This is far too broad of a statement, it has no impact on their value as a person, however it may have an impact on their value as a dating partner( and I use this statement regardless of gender)

I think /u/WatersLethe is trying to say that having had mutliple sexual parters in the past (not more than one at a time) does not make you any less of a person or a dating partner. I don't think they were trying to say having more than one at the same time should be okay to any potential dating partner (although some people are fine with polyamorous relationships).

>I think a decent number of these are either incorrect or oversimplified to an extreme degree.

Please elaborate, and I or someone else will answer your questions.
