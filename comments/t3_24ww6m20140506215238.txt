See, I'm the opposite. My car is a death machine, and I feel pretty safe inside of it, especially if it's already on when I'm being approached. I'd rather be approached while I'm already in my thousand pounds of steel than while I'm outside of it. I feel so much safer sliding someone a few bucks through an inch of open window than I do reaching into my purse while I'm out in the open.
