I didn't have kids and wasn't given pain meds before the procedure. I was given a big pill to push up there to try and loosen the cervix the day of my appointment and while my bowels were pretty damn loose that day, my cervix was not. As she prepared/fiddled for the big insertion down there, I kept focusing on my breathing (it was only mildly uncomfortable) and knowing it would be over soon. All of a sudden I felt as if my uterus imploded, and that was the precise moment she placed the IUD. It was furiously painful but only for about 3 seconds. My fingers and nose were numb for a good 2 minutes after, and I had apparently my bowels were just a tad loose, too. The doctor declared the procedure a total success and sent me home with instructions to veg out and take pain meds if I needed them. Cramps lasted a few days and spotting lasted a couple of months. That was two years ago and it has been smooth sailing ever since! Hope this story helped!
