I tried an IUD twice.

First time it came out immediately. The ultrasound showed I had a normal uterus, but somehow it didn't like the IUD. It was also very painful, so...

... it took me a few years to try it for a second time. 

This time the IUD *did* stay in place. However, I had cramps for four weeks non-stop. I went to work on painkillers, sometimes it woke me up at night. One day I was crying from exhaustion and my boyfriend brought me to the doctor. He took it out. The cramps stopped within the day. 

They were the hormonal IUD type. Perhaps I should try the non-hormonal one, although my suspicion is that my uterus just doesn't like any foreign object inside of it. Currently I make do with the NuvaRing.
