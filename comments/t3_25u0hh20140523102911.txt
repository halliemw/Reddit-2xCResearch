Personally I felt that the body language from the actors came from a place of "oh haha I'm being asked to point out how ridiculously oversexified this other ad is" rather than a place of "oh baby yeah I've been asked to be SEXAY!"

It is always interesting to see where exactly biology intersects with our ideas of what biology should mean. I'm finding myself more and more fascinated with transpersons' experiences for that reason.
