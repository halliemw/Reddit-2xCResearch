I know that I'm a bit out of place here, but as a son I see Mother's day as a day where I show my appreciation to my Mom for all the shit I put her through as a child. I don't feel that it's about people saying that mothers are better than those without children, but that the children of mothers should show them love and thanks, even if it is one day a year.
