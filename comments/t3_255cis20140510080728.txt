Yay congratulations! 

What really got me was that the article pointed out that women they interviewed wouldn't apply for anything unless they were sure they met 100% of the qualifications, but men would apply if they figured they met just 60%. And as someone who hires people, I routinely give jobs to people who don't meet 100% of what I'm looking for because they have other strengths, or I see potential.
