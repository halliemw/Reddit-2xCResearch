Downvote brigading is happening, and they've deleted posts critiquing the sub for racism that did not break ANY of the sidebar rules. I feel like a lot of people saying what you're saying maybe aren't frequent redditors in other subs and don't understand the history of defaulting subs (the disaster that happened with /r/science or the declining of invitation to become a default by /r/wtf because they knew the quality would take a hit). This is a thing that has been a problem in the past.

Secondly, the rest of reddit doesn't fucking want us to be a default because they think it's somehow infringing on men's rights. I have pointed out multiple times that there is no equivalent of TwoX for men, there is OneY but it is by no means an active sub and thus wouldn't meet default requirements. The folks who have been a part of TwoX for a while (some years) don't want it to be a default because of the lack of safe space it's creating. Which is just true, there's not only downvote brigading but also nasty comments on very personal posts (re: periods, sex, labias, etc.)

So, essentially, no.
