Infrastructure in general (networking, AD, LDAP, DNS, etc.) is probably the last bastion of old school WASP corporate America. I've consulted for a number of Fortune 500s and, by and large, I'm talking to white men with the occasional woman. I think the only thing that is comparable are the monolithic R&D houses in companies such as GE, DOW, DuPont, Honeywell, etc. They have more women though... 

Traveling to other IT 'towers' such as security or going to see the developers you see a *ton* of H1Bs and a lot more women & minorities.
