I'm so sorry to hear what you went through.  I can't imagine how scary that must have been, in addition to the pain and sadness.  

I'm...lucky(?)...that I have known people that this happened to, and so I took the stance early on that I would talk to them very openly about it. We talk about my death, about cremation, about chemotherapy, radiation and surgeries very openly.  In fact, just a few minutes ago, my daughter told me that she invited one of our neighbors to the "thing when you die."  She also told me that maybe he would want some of my "dust" too.

I'm lucky because I get to tell them every day how much I love them, and that when I'm gone, I'll always be there in their minds and hearts.  They cry when we talk about death, but then they console each other, or they come and hug me, or both.  

Thank you so much for sharing your story and your ideas.
