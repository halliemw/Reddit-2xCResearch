It makes me really sad. I feel like we squandered a good opportunity by going the immature route the 'scare' dudes away from this subreddit.

We could have continued on with our regular content (which of course does still include these types of posts, just not a tidal wave of them, extra icky on purpose) and it could have been REALLY insightful for men who would be curious enough to learn about more womens issues

Instead, it's just making them leave ----- and i'm not talking about 14 year old dudes with TITS OR GTFO.... i'm talking about all sorts of men, and probably some women as well. 

I'm just embarrassed by the childlike behaviour i've seen as of late, and it's this behaviour that will take me away from this sub --- not the default status, not male-infiltration ... but the core users who have disappointed this sub.
