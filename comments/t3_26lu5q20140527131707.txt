> the body I think I should want

If not having the body makes you feel all those bad things, then it isn't just something you think you should want, it's something you'd actually like to have, and it's okay to say that.  Consistency doesn't require you to seriously pursue everything you want.  You only have one life to live, and there are more desirable things in the world than there is time to pursue them.  It's human nature to want contradictory things, and it's normal to feel regret for the path not taken, even if you're glad you took the path you did.  So it's fine to say you want that skinny body; it doesn't mean you have to go after it.

However, it sounds like you're suffering from more than a nostalgic regret like, "Oh, what would life be like if I had moved to New York and become a writer instead of going to medical school," or, "Oh, I wonder what it would have been like if I had married that carpenter who was madly in love with me during that semester in Florence."  Feeling like a failure makes it sound like you doubt that you're making the right choice.  

You shouldn't try to externalize that doubt.  I know there's always pressure to internalize socially acceptable feelings and externalize "bad" feelings, which in the context of this subreddit means saying, "**Inside, my true feelings are** that I prefer to enjoy my lifestyle and accept my chubby body, but **out there, there are forces that make me feel** like I should live healthier and be skinnier."  For you, personally, both feelings are inside you and are equally valid and consequential for your life.  Just like you have to be realistic about your body, your genetics, your desire to exercise every day, etc., you also have to be realistic about what you want.  

I think what you're hoping to do is exorcise your doubts.  You want to prove to yourself that your lifestyle is a choice, not a failure, and that it's the best choice for you.  Luckily, there's a way to do that.  You can give the healthy lifestyle a go and see if it makes you happy or not.  Don't think of it as being "better," just think of it as auditioning a new lifestyle.  You want to choose how to live, so you're inviting this lifestyle to come and audition so you can decide whether it is a better fit for the part of "motherofpearl89's lifestyle" than your current one.  Change your diet, lose some weight, and then ask yourself:  "Is this better than what I had before?"

There are problems with this approach:  the long time commitment, dealing with the inevitable failures and setbacks, feeling self-conscious about not sticking to a single story about who you are and what you want, etc.  Imagine where you'd like to be in five years, though.  Imagine that five years from now you're living exactly the same lifestyle you are now, and it's the right one for you.  Would you rather *know* that it's right for you, and that it was a choice, or would you rather still be fighting the uncertainty that maybe it's the wrong choice, or even worse, not a choice at all?  I say go for it, have an adventure, and put your doubts to rest.
