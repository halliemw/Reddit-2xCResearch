Thank you for your kind words. My friend called at 5 am super drunk last night and crying. It was heartbreaking. He really wants me to make it to her memorial in a week, but I just can't.  I really wish I could but I can't.

I am a very sensitive person and I'm so sad that I can't make it there because I know he would make it here if something happened to my brother. Our siblings and us all grew up together. 

On top of it all, I lost one of my best friends/mentor this year to pulmonary fibrosis and I just finally felt like I was getting through that. I'm just not very good at losing people. I guess no one is, but it still hurts. It just feels like a lot of loss
