Hey, nothin' against you.  Just against the idiot who wrote it and accuses pregnant chicks of being essentially fat, stupid, lazy pieces of shit.  =)  

Congrats, by the way!  Pregnancy is rough.  I hope you're doing well!  I have a feeling once I'm out of the 1st trimester and no longer feel awful 24/7, I'll be enjoying this a lot.  ;)
