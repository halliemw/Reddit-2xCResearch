When I was working in a restaurant, if you had called me or any one of my female coworkers "darling", we would have smiled at you (because we are professionals who aren't going to be rude to customers) and then return to our stations and roll our eyes and talk to each other about what a condescending douche you are. 

Maybe that's not everyone's experience, but generally speaking, "darling", "sweetie", "honey" and the like are all diminutive terms that don't always feel good on the receiving end, particularly in the workplace.
