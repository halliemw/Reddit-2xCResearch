I was raised in the South and am currently living in the North. In the South it's just seen as respect for anyone older/superior or whatever, but up here I've gotten the feel that people see it more as something you say to grannies. My northern boyfriend was surprised when I told him to make sure he says "yes ma'am, yes sir" when talking to my parents. 

I've gotten chastised a couple times while living up here, but it's hard to break since my entire childhood my dad would get on to me if I didn't say ma'am or sir.
