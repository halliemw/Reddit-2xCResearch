"At work??" has been my exact reaction every time!  This usually happens at networking or charitable events, or at other after-hours work activities like dinners with my firm's clients or potential clients.  So not usually *at* my desk, but in situations where I'm clearly there for work purposes.  
Since it's not coming from coworkers, I don't know if it counts as sexual harassment. My boss is male, so I haven't discussed it with him, but I will try to chat with my women coworkers about their strategies and experiences!
