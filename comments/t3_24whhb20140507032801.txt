 "Oh, you're angry about something trivial? Well you killed our child." 

This. And also if she keeps it I feel like any future arguments about the child would be something like "what do you care? You wanted to kill it any way" I can't imagine that the relationship will work either way. It might have a slim chance but an extremely slim one.
