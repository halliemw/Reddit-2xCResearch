I initially started on the pill. It seemed like the easiest, most basic type of birth control. I recently switched to the Mirena IUD for a few reasons

* No remembering to take a pill every day at a specific time; once it's in, you're good 

* I get migraines, and was told that anything with estrogen can increase my risk of stroke, so decided to switch off the pill to an IUD

* It's a much cheaper option than the pill for me

So far, the only side effect that kind sucks is irregular periods (more on that off) for the past month and a half, which is typical for the Mirena. However, that's already begun to subside, and I can say I'm overall quite happy with it.
