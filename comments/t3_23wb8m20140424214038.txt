I don't really understand why that is such a problem. Have men refused your sexual advances in the past after seeing you have a bushier bush? I'm going to assume that's never happened.

Seriously, *seriously,* this is not an issue. In fact, the only issues I see in this post are 1) how sad it is that you're so upset that you have pubic hair, and 2) how miserable you are trying to keep it shaved and exfoliated. 

We all have something different about us! Me, after having kids, I ended up with starburst stretch marks all over my stomach. I'm sure I could see 100 women's tummies, and mine would be the only one with stretch marks *all over.* But, you know what? It doesn't change who I am! My husband has never been like, "Hmm, you know what? I think we'd better keep the light off during sex because I don't want to see your stomach." The only purpose hating my stretch marks would serve is to make myself stressed miserable. 

There are women who come on here who are upset because they have large clits or puffy labia or dark buttholes. Come on. We are human beings--animals! Should we spend our lives hating every animalistic trait about ourselves? 

Flip the situation in reverse. If you met a man you were attracted to who was upset because his chest was hairier than other men's, would you use that as a reason not to date him? Or what if you liked a guy who was worried because he didn't have any body hair, and most men do? Would you use that as a reason to not go out with him? People are people, and everyone has different characteristics. Get over your own abnormalities, just like I'm sure you get over everyone else's. It sounds like you are a med student. Do you know how cool that is? Have some confidence in yourself! Seriously.
