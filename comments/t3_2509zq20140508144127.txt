Dissension and debate and new ideas are always good things. Even opinions we don't like or agree with, are still good things. We are all different. We all have different values, experiences, frames of reference, cultures, backgrounds and educations. Imagine if we closed off the USA because we didn't want different ideas to disrupt our white european beginnings? Bring it on!... we can change minds ONLY when we can discuss openly with the minds that need changing....
