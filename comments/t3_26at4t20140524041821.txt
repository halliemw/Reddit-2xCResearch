No, I do not think that women push more than men.  Do you really think that?  I have worked for both, and in my experience men push/command/order people around more.  They are not considered "pushy or bossy" but the actions that would trigger such a statement about a woman certainly are present.

And while I agree that the vocabulary is not the only issue, the fact that the identical resume & description, when used to describe a woman results in the subjects considering her to be pushy and hard to work with, while the man is considered positively, shows that there is a very significant perception bias at work as well.
