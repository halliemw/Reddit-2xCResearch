>Guys (myself included) don't like being around bitchy girls and we tend to ostracize them so we don't have to deal with their stupid shit. 

You know, women don't like hanging out with bitchy girls either.

I'm going to guess that you don't know what it's like to be a woman surrounded by men joking about semen and having a vagina labeled as gross, so I don't think the OP has to "prove" she's an awesome girl to a bunch of guys, like it's some special prize.
