>I am a man (Edit: Wow, first flub right off the bat. I am a male, and I also identify as a man. Sorry about that!)

I don't get the need to specify sex and gender when introducing yourself. Yes, not everyone's sex and gender line up -- but, in general, it's absiolutely safe to assume that if someone has an XY, they are male. *.3%* of Americans identify as transgender. While it might be true that "not everybody who has an XY is male," it almost is.
