In all respect, I think the stereotype has more to do with the radfems' pride in not shaving their armpits to not confirm, rather than a discouragement of the act itself. And taking pride, as in: above heterosexual women, of being lesbian. That's the stereotypical radfem: doing everything she can to show she does not approve of the Y chromosome. And that's what closet-feminists (is that an appropriate term?) are repelled by and view the (straw) feminist as.

Personally, as a man, I find unshaven armpits fine. I don't know anyone who really has a problem with unshaven armpits. If they do have some kind of problem, its just that shaven armpits make for a smoother body (for both men and women) which is obviously easier during intercourse, from which the "beauty standard" arose in the past, against which radfems are "liberating themselves from". But in attraction to personality, the armpit is almost universally ignored in my experience and that of my acquaintances/friends/family. If others find a different general experience, I would like to be told.
