I think it has become a universal experience as a girl going through puberty to read online some dumbass 16 yr old boy's encounter with a woman who is not two dimensional or replicating a Barbie (i.e. totally hairless) where some part of her body shocks and offends him, because he is 16 and has not seen many naked people outside porn.

And because young girls often don't have the knowledge and confidence to dismiss that as stupid, ill informed, and juvenile, they take it seriously and stress out over what they think are norms, but what are reality the loner musings of neck beards and children.

And it can take decades to get over those silly hang ups we develop at 12 or 14, those encounters that seem to burn themselves in our minds somehow.

Some guy, an older brother of a friend, told some story at a party once about going home with a girl, but literally kicked her out when he discovered she didn't wax her vagina. Me and all my friends became paranoid that this was common practice and that if we needed wax perfectly no one would ever want to have sex with us. Pretty silly looking back but at the time it sucked.
