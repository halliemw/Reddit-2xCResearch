Do you think being in the "adult world" now gives you some kind of pass?

Real life isn't like that silly school world you've been inhabiting. If people think you're wrong they're going to tell you. And if you can't defend you view point without drama you're going to get laughed at. 

Once you get busy with the real problems of life you'll find you have less time to invent sexism everywhere. 
(PS this will also make you a happier person)
