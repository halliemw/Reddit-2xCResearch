As someone who has found themselves crying at work after the loss of loved ones and break ups, I'll say that learning to power through that shit - and finding the people at your work who will support you through it - can make you feel like a major badass. 

And if people at the office give you the side-eye because you're getting emotional, but you can power through that too, you will eventually feel unstoppable.

That's one of the worst feelings, but you can get through it. ~virtual hug!~
