I am so glad to see these comments here. A friend of mine posted this on Facebook and the comments there were just ridiculous. One talked about how irresponsible she was, while she was actually being pretty responsible and proactive in my opinion. Another talked about how they focused too much on the happiness of the mother and not enough of the child as they were "tearing it limb from limb and crushing its scull". I'm pretty sure anyone against the video was picturing a beautiful cackling baby holding a Masters Degree in Engineering, with the keys to his paid-off house containing his wife and 4 kids being stabbed and shot and thrown in a dumpster.
