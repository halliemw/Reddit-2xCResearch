Since you seem to know so much about bikes, I hope you don't mind me asking you this question:

I have twisted legs, in such a way that on a normal bike my knees constantly hit off the bar and get bruised. Would you recommend in this case that these step-through style frames would be best for me if I were to start cycling to work? And if so are there any in particular that you would recommend?
