WIth mine it actually felt better if I put my hand on my lower abdomen & applied a little pressure.  I had forgotten about that or I would have suggested trying that.  Mine only hit me when I was running or on long walks.  It would get better a little while after I sat or laid down & not bother me until I ran again.

Edit: I probably should have also said I have no personal experience with menstrual cramps so I'm just guessing from what I have been told
