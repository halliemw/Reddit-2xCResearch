I think that the article is just trying to describe the ridiculousness that is the concept "bikini body" - as if certain bodies did not meet some official standards of being allowed to be in a bikini.

The idea that you need to have a "bikini body" in order to wear a swimsuit/bikini only holds back some women from enjoying their summers at a beach, and doesn't really help anyone out in any way.

I think that this article's point is not incompatible with the idea that some styles are better suited for some shapes, but I think that it is most importantly the wearer's choice of what she wants to wear and what she feels best in, and not some imposed "bikini body" standard.
