Man, if the skin started falling off of my vag, I'd grow wings and *fly* to the ER! Don't think about going if you can't get an appointment, just go. In fact, I wouldn't be at all surprised if your gyno tells you to haul ass over there as soon as you call, honestly.

If you're worried about costs or lack insurance, keep in mind that hospitals will work with you over the cost of the bill. Last time I went, I ended up only paying $100 in out-of-pocket costs and I don't have a lick of insurance.
