I'm relatively new to Reddit, and I haven't really gotten in to signing up for subreddits or even really searching them. I've just relied on what I can find in what the defaults are. In fact, before this recent addition of subreddits, I didn't even realize that the things I see were only from a select few subreddits. 

I really like this subreddit, I read a lot of the posts in New and Rising, and I hope that it continues to provide interesting posts for all to see. You come across naysayers and negativity everywhere, its getting past it that is the real triumph. Hopefully this subreddit will survive its unveiling to the masses, because there are some in the masses that really appreciate the knowledge that it exists.
