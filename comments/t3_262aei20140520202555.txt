She had a throwaway mean thought. Sometimes when we deal with people with really different worldviews that we find irritating we have douchey thoughts. I doubt she actually means to use that mean thought as a basis for legislation. Sure, she's judging the woman who had 4 abortions, but she's not trying to take the choice away so much as disliking what that woman did with her freedom of choice.

She's probably confused on the "pro choice" thing because a lot of people who are pro choice are also fairly non-judgemental on abortion. She seems to believe in the freedom of choice... but doesn't always think it is a GOOD choice to make. She's definitely pro choice, but a different kind of pro choice than the majority here.
