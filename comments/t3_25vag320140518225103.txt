I'm curious about exactly who you're are talking about when you say they want to be given time off for a "disorder." There is a thing called PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) which is a disorder and is also rather awful for which some women do need to take time if the symptoms are bad enough and a doctor says this is necessary.
