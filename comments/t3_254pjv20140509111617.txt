I agree.  

I think sometimes that when parents realise their children are actually grown adults and that their child no longer has that... reverence for the parent it can be very hard for them accept so in attempt to get that bond back (even if that bond was not felt both ways) the parent tries to change their views/behaviour etc. to fit the childs.
