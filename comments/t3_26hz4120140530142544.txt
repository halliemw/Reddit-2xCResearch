She told me it can be complex if it is deeper than suspected. She said she hasn't done one in years so she is gonna consult a urogynecologist who does them all the time and see if he will scrub in with her. I dont feel comfortable with a male dr but at the same time I don't feel comfortable letting her do it since she hasn't done one in so long. I recover from things very easily, so hopefully it goes well. I just know at this point I am too self conscious about it to even think about having sex!
