What's your body type?  I got asked if I was pregnant when I was a US size 2 once.  I was very thin, but I am not hourglass shaped and any amount of tummy fat on my thin frame could possible pass for very very early pregnancy.  I'm cool about it now (now that I am pregnant and I can kinda see what they were saying) but at the time I was mortified and upset.  I wasn't even fat!  I barely had a belly at all!

So could it be a body type thing couple with rude/forward people?  Or like someone else said, it could be a shitty inside joke just used to tease you.
