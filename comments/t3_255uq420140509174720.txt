Oh shit, I had the exact same feeling. The girl in the XXL on the left weighs about 10 less than me, but has the same bust measurement. My natural waist is actually a lot smaller than hers appears to be. According to that chart I probably wouldn't look great in that XXL. I'm not comfortable with skin-tight shirts. I'm also 1" taller than her, but whatever.

Glad to know I'm not the only one who was comparing herself to those women.
