Try signing up for yoga classes without a friend and making some there. Just start up a brief conversation after the class each time and eventually after several chats invite them for coffee. 

I've also met lots of great people via meetup.com. They have an app now so it's even easier to find groups you might get along with. I was part of a gardening club (all of us were in our 20s and 30s) until I moved and now I'm part of 2 meetup groups "80s babies book club" and a "dog park meetup" I've made 3-4 good friends from each. 

I've also made a lot of friends through volunteering. I've become close with 3 girls in particular. I personally volunteer at an animal shelter which tends to have lots of female volunteers but find something you're passionate about. It's very easy to connect with these people because I know they adore animals as much as I do so we already have a commonality.
