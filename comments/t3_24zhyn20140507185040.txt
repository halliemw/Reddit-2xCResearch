I LOVE my dad. We have a great relationship and always have. Really, when I was young, he just exposed me to a lot of things. We played sports, went camping or hiking, went fishing, cooked together, played piano together, and all sorts of things! One of the best things about him is that he very rarely gets angry and is always rational. I have great relationships with my parents because they are always reasonable and will give-and-take so that everyone is happy. Don't get too caught up on the fact that she's a girl. You never know what she'll be interested in! Good luck and congratulations! :)
