You just described how my current relationship is with my parents to a "T"! At your age, however, they would mostly ask me how college was going and if I was thinking about applying for new jobs (I already had a job but it wasn't good enough for them) and "did you do this" and "will you do that soon". They didn't ask me about my friends, my then-boyfriend, or if I've seen any good movies. It was purely "business" with a lot of subtle "you're doing okay but we think you could be doing even better" hints thrown my way. 

I'd love to talk about life with my parents, also. Especially since they are getting up in their years and I know they won't be around for much longer. But it just isn't meant to be. Sometimes my dad will talk about his years growing up in England (we live in the US), however, and I love it.
