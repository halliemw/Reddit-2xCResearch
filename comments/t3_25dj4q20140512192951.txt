I'm a 37 year old gay guy, and I've never done something like this to someone...even when I was really, really drunk. He's no friend of yours if he's trying to steal your boyfriend. He's an immature jerk...his behavior borders on predatory, especially considering your boyfriend voiced his disapproval of the advances.
That being said, people get really stupid when they get drunk, so it's not the end of the world. But still, the kid could have pass on herpes or something (hey...it does happen.) It's one thing to hit on someone who doesn't want it...it's quite another to shove your tongue down their throat! Not rape, but kind of in the same ballpark (the more I think about it, the more I think your "friend" is lucky he didn't get decked for that little stunt!)
