Yeah, the article is extremely vague- likely to skew opinion. Regardless, it does say that officials deemed him "fit for release" which makes me think it wasn't just his sentence being up- but that he also is rehabilitated somewhat. The title could easily be "Old man gets out of jail after serving sentence." 

If the locals want to be mad at anyone, be mad at the DA who only got ~30 years for 40 counts of rape. The man paid his "debt" as far as the U.S. legal system is concerned.
