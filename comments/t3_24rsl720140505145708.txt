Here's my perspective: it depends. I came from a very conservative background and it was my original plan to save sex for marriage. However I met my current bf in college and consider how we're both career driven (and I'm kind of feminist in that I want to make my own money and not want to rely on a husband) it became apparent that saving it for marriage would mean years and years of "waiting" and pent up sexual frustration. We're very serious about each other and it is our firm belief that once we're established somewhat with grad school then we will tie the knot...anyway, we did it and have been active since. The first time is just like how anyone else described it: it was awkward, uncomfortable (even painful), scary and as far as sex goes, quite pathetic. However the anticipation did make it quite special emotionally (to do it with the person who you love is definitely a plus). I don't regret doing it with with my bf at all, but more of the fact that I still get guilt-tripped by the conservative influence around me reminding me that I chose the non-ideal path. Ultimately, it is really not that big of a deal if it wasn't for those who intentionally make a big deal out of it...if that makes any sense.
