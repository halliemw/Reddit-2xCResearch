Your sister needs to make her social media more private. She doesn't need her parents to do that, she can do that herself. Or stop going on them. Hell, making new accounts that no one in her life knows would also work. 

As someone who was bullied to the point of trying to kill herself back in middle and H.S, I wish I had grown a back bone sooner. And I know plenty here will disagree with me, but I wish your sister had hit the boy right back, equally as hard. 

Sure, they would both get into trouble but at least he'd learn that he'll get hit back, and that actions have consequences. I was in a similar situation in H.S, another girl elbowed me right in the ribs (on purpose), so I back handed her right across the face, just as hard. I was suspended for a week (so was she) but was damn proud of myself, my parents were supportive, and she never said or did shit to me again. I learned the hard way that just ignoring bullies often does not help because they'll view the victim as easy prey and just keep on doing shit. 

As for talking to the teachers, I agree with your mother, that could make things worse unless she's moved out of all the classes her bullies are in, which can be impossible to do.
