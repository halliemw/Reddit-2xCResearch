I'm 22, never had them pierced.  I think everyone was getting it done from 8-14 and I was just never interested. just seems to fiddly, and delicate. a potential injury waiting to happen. I've never had any urge to.

I know most people with non pierced ears now had them close up. Something seems odd to me about keeping metal in a would to prevent it healing over... I'm clearly not a fan of piercings. 
   
  It goes with my list of things that I'm apparently weird for not having, including high heels, any jewellery, a watch, a smart phone, lipstick. 

I'm not even super tomboy, I have dresses and skirts. Its mostly a about comfort and practicality.
