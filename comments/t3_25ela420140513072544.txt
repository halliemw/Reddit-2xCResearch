I think it grosses me out because body fluids are involved. People say "It's just like eating!", but it's not really like that in my mind. Breastmilk is a body fluid. That's at least a bit icky for me.

But just like you said, I know it's just my perception, so I just look away. I would welcome more breatsfeeding rooms like some restaurants and shops here already have them, not for my comfort but for the comfort of the mothers and children.
