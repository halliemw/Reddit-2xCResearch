That's a common misconception, actually.  The problem with triggers is that it's not about just feeling badly.  Triggers often cause people relive some trauma that they've been through.  Imagine a veteran with PTSD hearing a gunshot - that could be a 'trigger' for them that would send them back into their worst memories.
Triggers can be for a lot of things: PTSD, alcoholism, eating disorders, abuse... all sorts of unfun stuff.
