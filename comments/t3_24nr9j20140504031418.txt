It's natural to grieve loss. This is a loss of a relationship. 

I love captain awkward, and she wrote this in an article

>It’s okay to still be in love. Love is – as this hideous wedding-cake topper excruciatingly reminds us – patient, it is kind, it believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  So there you are, all shaggy and embarrassing bounding toward your person wagging your tail and doing that adorable thing you do where you pretend that you’re not going to hand over the ball you’re carrying in your mouth and your person doesn’t even want your stupid ball and then the leash of reality yanks you back.  That part of you is the purest and best and truest part of you, and you can’t really turn it off.  It’s just going to love for a while.

>I say this because it’s really fucking frustrating to try to talk yourself out of having a feeling or beat yourself up for having a feeling at the same time you’re having the feeling.   So  just have the feeling.  Just be the Golden Retriever of Love.  You’re not stupid for feeling it, you’re not a bad person, you didn’t do anything wrong.  You just feel what you feel, and you’ll feel until one day you stop, and you can’t decide when that is, so don’t even try.
