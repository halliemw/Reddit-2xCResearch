In a lot of families, it is considered taboo to even talk about mental disorders. Because only crazy people see a shrink, right? That could be part of it. He doesn't believe he's crazy, so why should he go? So there could be that too. 

There is also the idea in mens' circles that getting mental help is emasculating. Only the weak ask for help, or have issues. 

I myself came from a family where seeking mental help was taboo, and had it in my head that it would make me less of a man to seek help. I got over it though with coaxing and reasoning. He probably would too. If he's in the relationship for the long haul, he should have that instinct to dive in and 'take one for the team' if it would make you feel better. I'm also pretty sure he too would find it liberating, even if he keeps it to himself.
