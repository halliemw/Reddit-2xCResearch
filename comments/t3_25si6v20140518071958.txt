> Will you EXPLODE if you just can not get those words out? Come on, if you are a man who thinks you're entitled to put your opinion into every conversation about women? You're the problem.

If I protest someone making a generalization about men, I'm not saying I'm entitled to put my opinion into every conversation about women.  And I'm also not taking part in a conversation *about women*, it's clearly at that point a conversation about men.

As for "[a space] where we could talk about things from a woman's perspective", as far as I can tell protesting such a generalization is not against the rules of the subreddit.  Maybe you could argue it violates some interpretation of one of the rules, but the mods don't seem to think so as they don't generally seem to remove such comments.

And there are places on reddit where people can enforce a ban on those comments.  There are also places where men can't comment at all, or where certain viewpoints can't be criticized, and nothing's stopping anyone from making more of them.  The only reason to want those rules to apply here is that this subreddit is bigger than those others - but I'm guessing it's bigger in part due to comments being less policed.  It's odd to let a subreddit grow due to the lack of such rules, and then try to impose them once it's big.

Plus, it's a default sub now, and I think default subs ought to represent the whole site on some level, and generally allow everyone to comment.
