I'm so glad you're getting the help you need now and that you have such great friends :)

Still, though, I can't be the only one that thought "...and this is a positive experience?" Something is wrong when a kind, caring police officer after a year of being ignored is supposed to be an uplifting, encouraging story. You are a stronger lady than me. If I had to wait a year to be acknowledged by the police, I would have lost my mind.

Do you by any chance know what happened to the lazy cop? Is he still employed with the police department there? Also, is your friend's assault case being treated separately from your rape case? I really hope she is pressing charges also.
