I am as feminist as it gets, but I've really never understood this in the context of a learning environment.

If the dress code states no shorts above fingertip length (or any other skin-baring clothing rule) and it's enforced for guys and girls... What's the issue? Why is it slut shaming? 

High school is usually put in place so kids can learn about professionalism, conduct, and studying before they're sent to higher learning / the workforce. 

If I walked into my 8 am business lecture wearing a miniskirt and a bralette, I would get my ass kicked... As would a guy wearing a bro tank and board shorts. It's less about shaming and more about professionalism, in my opinion.
