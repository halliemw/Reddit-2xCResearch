No, but what I quoted is very similar to our Employee Code of Conduct. "Offensive language; racial, ethnic, or religious slurs; or other remarks, jokes, or conduct which encourage or permit an offensive work environment or diminish the worth of another person are not acceptable. This is true even if others do not seem to object." 

And then it goes on to disciplinary steps.

We have another section about harassment based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, etc with instructions on what to do "if you believe you have been the victim of such conduct or have witnessed it occurring." 

His behavior is in direct opposition to our company policies on conduct. *edit - removed some detail on his actions b/c I feel like I'm sharing too much*
