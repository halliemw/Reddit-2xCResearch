The [Living Under Drones](http://www.livingunderdrones.org) report by Stanford Law School and NYU School of Law is quite extensive.

"Following nine months of intensive research—including two investigations in Pakistan, more than 130 interviews with victims, witnesses, and experts, and review of thousands of pages of documentation and media reporting—this report presents evidence of the damaging and counterproductive effects of current US drone strike policies."

In the end, it helps to realize we're all humans, whether we live in Pakistan or the US. If you live in the US, reverse the situation: Imagine that in your town, there is a known groups of criminals who plot things against Pakistan. No one likes them, albeit they never actually did anything against Pakistan so far, and it's mostly spreading YouTube videos, and the local police say they can't do anything. Now imagine Pakistan is sending a drone over your town at night, fires a missile, and 17 town residents are killed in a strike, and you know for a fact many of those were in no connection at all to the criminals spreading the YouTube videos. Pakistan doesn't provide any evidence to you now, as they say it's secret. Your neighbors even lost their son in the strike and he was a good kid. How would your town react? How would your neighbor react? How would you?
