I'd like to further this for you. Don't just look at this for romantic relationships. Look at all relationships in your life and try to view them objectively. Is your best friend a toxic aspect to your life? You should remove him/her from your life. 

Be willing to move on if you need to(but don't take this as an excuse to just quit on someone who is going through a tough time!)
