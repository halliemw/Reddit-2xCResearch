Reddit has a lot of tags for things.  I know in /r/makeupaddiction, they can take CCW which stands for Constructive criticism welcome, and I note when the OP doesn't say it that maybe they don't want to hear that they fucked up their eyeliner or whatever.  Perhaps xx can make some tags like that, which make it easier to determine what the OP is looking for.  I'm not sure if this already exists here, but it provides a pretty clear rubric right in the post as to what the OP is looking for.
