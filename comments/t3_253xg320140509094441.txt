I'm in the pre-wedding planning stages myself and as much as I'd hate to admit it, my lack of close friends (I have maybe 3) has heavily influenced my decision to have a courthouse wedding with a small (30) reception for primarily family. And you know what? It works for us.

Your wedding day and ceremony can be set up however you want it. Bridal party or no bridal party, no one is judging you on your wedding day. :) Congrats on your engagement!
