Protection statistically should be enough. However, there is a reason that no birth control is marketed as being 100% effective even when used flawlessly, because it's not. 

Accidents can always happen, but I think a lot of accidental babies come from misused birth control and their being an "accident" during sex and people playing the numbers game of "what are the chances" and loosing.
