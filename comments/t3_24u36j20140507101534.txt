One of my male coworkers who is 30ish recently started dating, and broke up with, a 21 year old. I actually found it all a little comical, the first day he was bragging about it, and by the second day he was complaining about it. Went from "Awesome I'm dating a 21 year old!" To "Ug I'm dating a 21 year old."  in less than 24 hours.

They were sexual attracted to each other in the beginning I guess but then realized they lived in totally different worlds.
