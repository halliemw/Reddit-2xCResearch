It's certainly not my norm. My mother was physically abusive to us when we were younger. She's gotten a lot better but she's still emotionally abusive. I try to maintain a surface-level relationship with her because she's my mom, but there's only so much I can do because the woman is crazy.

/r/raisedbynarcissists has been a good resource for me. But no, I will never be close to my mom and I struggle just to find the right balance between knowing her and drawing boundaries. It's okay to not be BFFs with your mom.
