First, take a step back. Become overly emotional? Emotions are not weakness. It is how your body/brain just deals with things. You are going through a really huge time in your life and you are allowed to be overly emotional! But you're also allowed to not be overly emotional. An Abortion is a situation that can take a toll on your emotional health and that is okay. It happens. While I have no idea what it is like to go through what you are going through, as with anything in life, you just have to think about how a year from now the emotions and pain etc get easier on the mind. You are doing what you have determined is best for you, for the future of the potential child, and your relationship. If you aren't ready to have a child then you have made a very good decision. I am sorry that you have to get through this but just know that you will.get.through.this. I know for a fact that you'll be fine eventually. It's okay to be overly emotional. Try explaining to your boyfriend how you feel and sit him down and ask for his unconditional love and support for you. 

I don't know what city you're in but there are certain programs offered where you can have someone escort you into the building and protect you from protesters and just generally give you someone to hug and a hand to hold. They are judgement free and will help ease the difficulty of this time for you.
