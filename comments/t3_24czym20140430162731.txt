That isn't what the comment I replied to was about. Do you work in a field where it's normal for all women to wear a full face of makeup? 

I work in academia, so when I put more effort into my appearance it's noted since my peers don't dress up or wear much makeup on a daily basis. If they do it's because something professional is going on that day. If I notice someone's (guy or girl) put more effort into their appearance than usual, I will always compliment them.  

My compliment does draw attention to the makeup or clothes, that's true, but I think it's more positive than directly asking why. I've been asked directly why I dress this way or that way and it does hurt sometimes, but I've learned to brush it off as people get more used to my appearance, especially when it stands out from the norm. Going against the grain is difficult, no matter what the norm for your environment is.
