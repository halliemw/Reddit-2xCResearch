Use a planner like it is your religion.  Put all your assignments, projects, test dates, club meetings, performances, games, dates, everything in it.  You cannot remember everything you have to remember.

When you're assigned a large project (read a book, write an essay, conduct an experiment), immediately break it into smaller steps, figure out how long each step will take you, and create your own mini-deadlines for those steps.  Put them in your planner.  Last-minute work sucks.  

Do something you like.  Join the band, try out for a sport or a play, write for the newspaper, whatever you're into, but have something you do that isn't academics and that you like.

Don't stretch yourself too thin.  Do one thing you like, or maybe two, not five.  Accept that in life, you can never do ALL the things.  You'll have more fun if your extras don't stress you out by eating all your time.

Don't worry that much about dating.  Some people do.  Some people don't.  It doesn't make that much difference in whether you'll ultimately end up in a happy adult relationship.  

Regarding sex:  The brain, heart, and loins are involved.  Don't have sex until your heart says 'I am in love,' your loins say, 'I am horny,' AND your brains say, 'I'm prepared with effective birth control, and having sex with this person is a wise choice.'  If even one of three says 'no,' skip it.  There'll be another chance for sex later.

That's all I've got for now.  Good luck.
