I'm sorry for you but I don't get how this is a double standard.

edit: I may be a jerk for saying this in this context when you'd like support instead, but it's really annoying to turn anything you don't like / are frustrated about into a discrimination issue and it's the kind of thing makes genuine discrimination complaints lose credibility and women be portrayed as "crazy" and "whiny".

edit edit: I get the frustration with being told that getting kicked is no big deal - but I think people who said that meant it's not big deal for the baby and meant to comfort you; it's not ok to be kicked in any circumstance.
