I lose mine all the time. They always come back.

I've had the Mirena for 12 years (this is my second one). Docs often cut IUD strings a little "long" so they don't feel prickly for male partners. This leads to the damn things getting covered with mucus and wrapped up around and behind the cervix, which means you can't feel 'em. Depending on the time of your cycle and how much goop is on your cervix, you'll be able to feel them later on.

If you're not just-postpartum and this is your first IUD, believe me: you'd notice if it came out. It's highly unlikely, too, that it's moved anywhere unusual--those cases are pretty rare. More than likely, the strings have moved to a place you can't easily feel, the way mine do.

Good luck! I hope this is a minor thing.
