I got a Mirena inserted about 2 months ago, and your experiences seem very similar to mine. I had cramping (mild in my case) pretty consistently for about two weeks, and when I was cramping, I was also spotting. My first period after the insertion was also longer and crampier than normal. However, the cramping and spotting has definitely slowed down. I would suggest talking to your doctor about your experience though. If it is truly unbearable, then it might just not be right for you.
