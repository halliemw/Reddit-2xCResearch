Is this true?  It seems to me like people *do* criticize men's music videos as objectifying.  I mean, she brings up "Blurred Lines" as an example, and that video/song was *massively* criticized.

As for women getting naked in their own videos...it seems like that's often not an issue.  But it depends on the person.  People say it's objectifying much more when Miley Cyrus does it than when Lady Gaga or Beyonce do it.  I think partially because people still think of Cyrus as someone who's a manufactured disney type, who isn't really doing what she personally wants.  And partially, it always seemed contrived.  It's less "I'm doing all this stuff, and oh yeah BTW my outfit happens to be revealing", it's more like "LOOK AT HOW REVEALING MY OUTFIT IS ISN'T IT SO EDGY?".

Whereas most people assume Lady Gaga is doing some sort of weird artsy thing that makes no sense, but at least it's part of some plan and not just a selling sex thing.  And Beyonce is "empowering" I guess.

I'm not entirely sure who decides what is and isn't empowering, or why it is, other than maybe a person saying "when I do this it's empowering."  I don't really pay enough attention to such things be able to say.

(to me, money is empowering...if Miley Cyrus makes a shitload of money by taking her clothes off, then she's got power (which is maybe why Beyonce is empowering?)).
