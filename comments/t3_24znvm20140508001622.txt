I completely know where you are coming from here.

I once had someone on here tell me that they "hope something horrible happens to me"... 

It hurt me a lot as well and I agree people should have thick skin on the internet, but it really baffled me that a complete stranger who doesn't even know me would hope that something awful would happen to me.

I didn't even post anything malicious to cause it... it was a post about my sick cat.

Just wanted to let you know that I'm with you on feeling hurt even from internet comments, I think it's normal to feel that way just as long as we learn not to dwell on them.
