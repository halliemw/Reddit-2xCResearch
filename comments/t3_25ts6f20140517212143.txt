It was a Walmart.  Rest assured that you weren't the only one who shat oneself there today.  ;)

My mother has colitis.  She used to work with my husband in a Walmart and at one point had a similar accident.  She sent my husband a text message asking him to *please* go buy her a new pair of panties and khakis and deliver them to the bathroom at layaway.

And that's the story of how my mother ended up with the tackiest pair of rainbow panties to ever grace the female form.
