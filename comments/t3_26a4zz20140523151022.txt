This is really good advice if you're actively trying to lose your friends

You can reply to this with whatever plethora of arguments you see fit regarding standing up for yourself, your friends not being 'real' friends if they don't tolerate whatever bullshit you feel like spewing that day, etc, but that doesn't change the fact that your advice is a really good way to lose friends; it's just not the way that normal people interact. None of my friends announce loudly when they have to pee that they have to take care of lady parts (guys or girls) and I would advise anyone against doing that if they wish to continue having normal friends.
