I took you saying you're pro-life at face value. Pro-life is "No abortion ever because it's evil and murder." Pro-choice lets the woman decide whether or not she wants to have a baby or if she can't handle that and wants an abortion.

By saying you're pro life, you're essentially saying the only options are raise a kid you didn't want, or put it up for adoption, and there's no guarantee the kid will get adopted, especially if it's neither healthy nor white. You're saying you want every woman who gets pregnant should carry it to term, even if it might kill her, or if the baby will die within days of birth. Even if the child will outlive their parents, but remain needy and dependent until it dies.

You can be personally pro-life, but nobody has any business telling someone else what they do with their body.
