I haven't seen it firsthand, but i have seen people complain about inappropriate PMs (and as someone who argues with redpillers on the regular, this isn't new to me) --- but i think that was expected... bad and good always come hand in hand, i just had some optimism that the good would outweigh the bad ---- but i didn't calculate in the bad that might stem from our own core members. 

I guess all we can do is see what happens in the weeks to come --- but i for one hope we remain default and it actually ends up benefiting the community --- i wish the mods well, they have a lot of work ahead of them - but i'm sure they knew that when they decided to go default
