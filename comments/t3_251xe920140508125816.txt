I disagree with this completely. Do not try to convince/coerce/force him to go with you. It will only create more resentment and animosity for making him do something he doesn't want to do (imagine a petulant child). Going for yourself is the absolute right thing to do. You can't change or control anyone else but yourself. Tell him you don't care whether he comes or not, you are doing this for yourself because you're unhappy with the way the relationship is going and so you want to work to fix it and find out what YOU alone can do better. Because he isn't the only one running this into the ditch. And at the end of the day you will be a better person for getting help and in a better position to decide which step to take next and if you choose to end the relationship you can take solace in the fact that you exhausted every avenue to try to fix it.
