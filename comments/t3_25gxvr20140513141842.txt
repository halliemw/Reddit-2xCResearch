Strong as in a well-balanced, interesting character? The same that constitutes a strong male character. Has an idea of what they want, is determined to get it. Learns from their mistakes. Doesn't complain constantly (doesn't apply to teenage characters, teens complain about everything). Doesn't spend all their time thinking about boys or romance (again, doesn't really apply to teenage characters, hormones be crazy).
