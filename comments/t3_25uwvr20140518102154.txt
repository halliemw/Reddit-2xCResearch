I am so sick of the way this community has been ruined. I am willing to be a mod and clean up the trash. There are about a million comments that need to be deleted. All these stupid jokey comments. Let's turn this shit around and chase these jerk-offs away. I am dead serious. I have been posting and lurking here since before I became a redditor and I really want to help out. If there is any way I can do that please let me know.
