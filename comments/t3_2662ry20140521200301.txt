^This. Sexual foreplay is not just for fun, it's necessary, especially if you are small or tight. I still have to remind my SO of this occasionally. Maybe try a few times with just fingers, one at a time until they feel comfortable? Being tense can tighten up the area as well, so relaxing and taking it slow can help. I hope you're feeling ok.
