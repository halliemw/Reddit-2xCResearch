You'd be surprised at how many people in this group can't handle criticism. This includes D; I once pointed out that all the dialogue in one of his non-porn comics came from "Team America: World Police" and he got pissy. 
I try to be honest with people and to offer constructive criticism when possible. I told both D and M how the art made me feel: it made me extremely uncomfortable and honestly made me wonder if this was how D views women, as objects to be defiled. I explained that, to me, the art said, "I hate strong women and want to defile and violate them. Women are inferior beings and I do not respect them." M basically just nodded and said I was entitled to my feelings (his way of saying, "I don't want to get involved with this"). D got on his high horse and pulled the whole "hey, you know me, I've done nice things for you in the past, why are you getting so bent out of shape over this?" schtick. 
This incident really made me realize that, although I've been acquainted with D for nearly 6 years, I don't really "know" him. I always thought that he was a kind, smart, funny, and respectful person. His misogynistic artwork has really shattered that image, and I've lost a lot of respect for him. 
I've also lost a lot of respect for M over this whole thing. I know he doesn't want to be a "leader," but when you found an organization, you're a leader, and sometimes you have to act like one, even if it means having a difficult conversation with someone.
