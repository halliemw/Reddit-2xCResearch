My best advice would be to not treat puberty like its a big scary thing to be worried about. You seem so anxious in your post and your sister will pick up on that and think "this is something I should be anxious about too". 

I was an early bloomer (started developing breasts in 2nd grade, first period in 5th grade), but it wasn't scary or traumatizing because I had known all about sex, periods, and puberty since around kindergarden. My mom never treated it like it was a big deal, so neither did I.
