> Apparently a lot of women cry after cutting it off??

I've had one bad hair cut in my life. I chopped my hair off to chin length, and it didn't come out looking like I wanted to. I cried about it (to be fair, I was 12 years old, right in the midst of my angsty middle school years). 

I've never cut my hair short since. The shortest I've gone is just past my shoulders. The longer my hair is, the prettier I feel. Believe me, I realize how silly and vain it is to care so much about it. Sometimes I have to remind myself, "Crankylosaurus, *it's just hair.*"
