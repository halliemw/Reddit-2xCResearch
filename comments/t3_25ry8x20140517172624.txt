I haven't started any new medication, but we have had busier schedules. I have spoken to him about it, and he says he'll try it, but I get the sense that he isn't comfortable doing those actions and I would never want him to do something he doesn't want to. So I don't push the issue because it isn't a deal breaker for me. It's more like something I kinda like sometimes. The real issue is that I'm just not feeling the need to rip off his clothes like before and I was looking for some advice (for both of us) to rekindle the sexual intimacy.
