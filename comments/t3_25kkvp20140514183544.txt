It's not just you, it really isn't. I sometimes get the huge bloat (mentally or physically), sometimes I don't. 

Do you ever find that your PMS problems are completely random? I can handle it if I know what to expect every month, but one month I'm moody as hell, one month I'm bloated, one month I eat everything in sight, and one month I'm all of the above.
