My sister had this issue- she wears a UK 3 (same as an American child's 3, I think a woman's 5?) 

She had to stomp around a building site in men's 9s for 3 weeks and then sell them second hand while waiting for a pair from an online store. Otherwise she wouldn't have been able to complete a construction requirement for her Architecture degree.
