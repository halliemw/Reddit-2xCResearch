> I studied software engineering and abandoned drawing.

I can't believe we were in such similar situations! I totally feel you. It's incredibly difficult to balance out school, work, and the demanding hobby that drawing is. I'm sorry you stopped. :( 

I don't think I'll ever stop drawing. It's the only thing that keeps me sane. Thank you for your kindness! :)
