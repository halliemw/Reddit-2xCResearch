Does GoT have a sexual assault indicator on IMBD?  I know they have sexual content and nudity notifiers before each episode starts, but they don't have a specific sexual assault indicator.  I mean, I like nudity and sex, so when I see those indicators before a show I don't stop watching it, but you don't necessarily know if that sexual content/nudity is going to contain rape.

Edit: I just realized that you responded to a different comment where I didn't go into detail about GoT, so I'm sorry my response was about that specifically when you were just talking about movies and shows in general!
