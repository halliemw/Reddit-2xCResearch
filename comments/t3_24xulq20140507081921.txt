Love it. I'm not a fan of genital contact, but the bum is somehow different (most of us) have one, and mine feels good to touch, if my partner likes theirs touched then I want to touch it.

My husband let me try with him a bit, but ultimately it wasn't for him, he only let me use my gloved fingers but I would of liked to try other body parts. I've got too many medical issues to comfortably receive anything myself, which is a shame.
