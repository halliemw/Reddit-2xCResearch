Askhistorians isn't a default subreddit.  Personally, I think that while subs with all sorts of restrictions on who can post what are fine (and there are ones with these sorts of rules), but defaults ought to be generally open to people, since they're more of the public face of the site, and everyone sees them by, well, default.  I suppose r/askscience is a default...but I'm not so sure it should be, for the same reasons.

It's also one thing to have people held to academic standards relating to history, and another to hold people to the more vague, uncertain (and conflicting depending on who you ask) standards people here probably want.  You say "inappropriate content", but what is that exactly?  And for controversial topics, it gets much harder to decide this in an unbiased way.

Finally, my understanding is that r/askhistorians and r/askscience disallow comments based on the person's expertise and their adhering to neutral academic standards.  It's harder to do that in a subreddit about women generally.  But rules that were analogous to r/askhistorians would mandate deleting a comment from someone supportive of feminism who didn't have any particularized knowledge about it, while allowing a comment from, perhaps, a gender studies major who thinks it's all BS.  I don't think that's what people want, and so those subreddits aren't necessarily good guides.
