First off, you are under no obligation to fight any ideological battles. This is your life, your happiness at stake. Consider as lucidly as you can how you personally feel about the way he's acting toward you. Also consider if you think this is getting worse with time.

In general, relationships don't just improve on their own when there are points of friction like this. So, if you're going to stay with this guy, you have to consider if you are alright with him doing this for the years to come or if you aren't - no relationship is perfect and you've said you're very happy together. It may be that this is the so-called "price of admission" for you. However, if you don't feel you want to live with this, your alternatives are to try to talk to him about it in a way that he can understand your position and change OR end the relationship. 

Putting the resolution off indefinitely will not help either one of you though, keep that in mind.
