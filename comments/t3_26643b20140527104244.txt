I know she gave me a specific brand to look up but I haven't yet. Might be leaf, after all. I have taken it in tea before, I remember her saying that what she was prescribing was more potent and I was thinking that it was because it's the root, but I'm probably just confusing myself. I'll ask her specifically next time I see her. Thanks for the heads up.
