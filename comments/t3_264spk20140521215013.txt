I think lumping "straight as default" in with heterosexism is watering down the term.  I usually presume people are straight, right-handed, cis, hearing, healthy, literate citizens who are able to see colors because it's convenient and I'm open to being told otherwise.

No one can go through life checking every possible way someone could be uncommon.  Presumptions absolutely will result in honest mistakes, but please don't equate that with discrimination.
