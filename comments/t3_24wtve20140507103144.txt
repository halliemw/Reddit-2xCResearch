>>(he makes me get out of my chair to fix it even though I tell him I can type it in but then he says he can't trust me) I'm wasting his time and then goes on a lecture of either how much other stuff he needs to do or why his system works.

If the boss has enough time to micromanage and overreact to every little mistake, he has more than enough to time to correct her constructively and move on. I doubt most senior lawyers are wasting billable hours personally correcting tiny typing errors while their new hire watches them. Her boss is compounding the amount of money spent on errors. 

I realize that law attracts type-A perfectionists and that includes controlling assholes, but expecting her to know about everything and be able to execute perfectly her first month on the job is simply unrealistic. The bosses that use criticism as a way to push you farther are valuable, the bosses that use criticism to demean you and won't let you fix your own mistakes tend not to be. Her boss seems like the latter.
