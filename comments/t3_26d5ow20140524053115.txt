I would definitely suggest going to the doctor. The irregular cycle isn't a massive concern, you're still young and it's not uncommon. However, you totally shouldn't have to put up with missing 2 days of school every time you're on (and when you're older, that could be a big issue if you're missing work regularly). Hormonal birth control might help you, with both regulating your periods and the pain.
