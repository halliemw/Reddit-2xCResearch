IFF - Image Fest Friday. A while back, image posts were banned and as a compromise, IFF was born, where users get one day a week to flood the subreddit with their images.

As far as the "gross" stuff goes, this sub has always had those posts. I think everyone is actively stepping their game up, though, in an attempt to weed out those who might not be, shall I say, positive members of the community. I'm loving every second of it and I'm stoked you are, too.
