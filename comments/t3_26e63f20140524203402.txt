The last time I tried to use one of those machines I found enough change shoved into the slot and just completely stuck there that, had I been able to get it out (and believe me I tried), I probably could have gone out and bought a small box of my own. I can only assume the last unfortunate soul who tried to get a tampon out of the machine got so frustrated they decided to just shove $4 in quarters in there out of fury.

I know at the community college I used to go to the machines worked so terribly that they just put a sign on it saying that we would have to walk to the student store to get what we needed from the help desk. And this was totally reasonable considering these bathrooms were in brand new buildings only a few months old which housed not only most of the classrooms where night classes were held (well past the closing of that student store) but the *nursing program* as well.
