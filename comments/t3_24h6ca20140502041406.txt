I went on the pill for my acne problems initially. I was 19 or 20. It was recommended to me by my Dr so I didn't really "choose" as such. I did look at other options later in life but my Dr would not insert an IUD as I am childless and at that time Nuvaring was not available in Australia. I was not interested in the patch because I have an allergy to adhesives and the implant didn't appeal to me either. 

To me, the pill is an easy and cheap option. I have no trouble remembering to take it and I love that it controls my heavy periods better. In fact I can skip bleeding entirely without issue. 

I have taken quite a few different ones over the years as I was trying to find one with the least side effects. My worst was Yaz. It made me extremely irritable and moody. My best was probably Brevinor which obliterated my period (even when I took all the pills in the pack) and I felt great, aside from a low libido. This is the one side effect I cannot seem to shake despite trying lots of different ones. Out of curiosity, I stopped the pill entirely for a year. My sex drive came back but so did my terrible periods and acne. I can't win! I currently am 39 and take Estelle.
