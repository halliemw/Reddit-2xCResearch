This is so true for me. Especially not understanding why. No, I don't have a good reason to skip class and shut myself in my bedroom all day. I just can't do it.

And when you finally gather the courage to own up to your depression and ask for help, the only thing anyone wants to know is why. Why is this happening? Why did you let it go on for so long? You want to have an answer, but "I don't know" just isn't good enough.
