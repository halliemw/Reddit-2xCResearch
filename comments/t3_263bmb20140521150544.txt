Maybe it will help if you think about the alternatives.  These opponents of abortion aren't bombing the clinic.  They aren't harassing you as you go there Saturday morning.  They aren't even speaking.  This is a silent protest against something they feel is akin to murder.  And it's on private property.  I would think you'd have a tough time living anywhere and not see things you disagree with.  

While I'm sure this issue is particularly important to you this week, in general i don't think it's any more important to you than to those on the other side of the issue.  So asking them to take down their protest is akin to telling you to not wear a "Keep Abortion Legal" t-shirt or something else pro-choice.
