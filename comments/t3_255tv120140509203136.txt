Congratulations on your freedom!  It can be scary, and the road to healing is a long one, but you're on it.

Always remember that you deserve to be treated with kindness - from yourself and from others.  Revel in the good days, and know that the bad days are just steps toward healing and becoming the whole, strong person you really are.
