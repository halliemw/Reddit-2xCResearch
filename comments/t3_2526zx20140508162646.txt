I think there are some people reading what you're saying, but maybe not agreeing with the way you are interpreting the idea of "newcomers please sit back and listen for a while before jumping in with posts/comments" (NB: I don't think it should call out men - newcomers is the audience we're talking to, not a certain gender). It's not a demand that men/ newcomers NEVER SPEAK, but asking that they take a few days to learn what kind of community this is before joining the conversation. 

I feel like some of the newcomers here are really out of touch with the community. Some want to use this as a place to engage in angry feminist vs. mra debates, when this has mostly been a very supportive community for all kinds of women to discuss what is going on in their lives.

I recently had a partial hysterectomy and received a ton of support and advice from this community. I felt comfortable posting here because I felt like no one would attack me for my choices or mock me for discussing my gynecological issues. I'm sad to see this space invaded by people who are mocking women for taking about their menstruation or other female body issues or trying to turn very personal decisions (choice of birth control, when to have sex etc.) in to large scale political or gender debates.
