Maybe it wasn't obvious to them?  

Or maybe their plan was to push you into the pit for a second and then pull you right back out, just to give you a little scare?  

No way for us to know.  

But I would have a talk with them.  I would just say "I'm afraid of mosh pits, I'm small, etc...  I also don't appreciate jokes like that."
