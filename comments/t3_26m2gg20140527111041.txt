This is good advice, thank you.  The big issue that I'm dealing with right now is that my father, who has worked hard physical labor his life, is now suffering from massive joint problems and has had serious complications from a hip replacement.  The poor guy is hooked up to an IV and can barely walk, for goodness sake, and she complains CONSTANTLY about how hard it is on her, how much work it is to care for him, etc.  It makes me absolutely sick and I can't even look her in the face anymore.  That being said, I care deeply for my father and that is what keeps me around.  I honestly cannot think of a way to be amused by her behavior in this case.
