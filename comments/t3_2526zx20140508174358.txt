the idea is more, say there is a sub /r/Canada for people from Canada to post about their Canadian-specific experiences since most of reddit is American. Then having their sub filled with Americans saying 'well down here we do things this way.' and 'it must be gross to have to walk around in snow all the time' and other things like that. It's usually not going to be relevant or add anything to the discussion or simply just be off topic.
