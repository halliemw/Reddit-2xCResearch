Thanks for your advice, I think I'll be able to handle myself a lot better now and say "No" with more confidence. You're right, I don't need to explain myself to anyone. What's funny is that I would give this same advice to my sisters and friends, but it's taken me so long to use it myself. I need to respect my own choices and feelings.
