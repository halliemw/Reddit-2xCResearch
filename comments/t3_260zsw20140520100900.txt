> he got the notion that our relationship is a trial, and Satan knows him so well and has tempted him with me and my dis-belief (he loves me so incredibly much that he considered for a teeny tiny second, abandoning his faith/turning his back on God), and all the sudden it is so very clear to him that he cannot marry and have a life with me if I do not believe. 

Has he talked to a pastor about this? Also, is there a specific denomination which he follows?
