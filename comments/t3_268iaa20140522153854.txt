Laura Croft from tomb raider. She's a scientist, has the best boobs ever.

Also Zena warrior princess, Buffy, and Samus of Nintendo fame.

Although honestly, even though these are smart, powerful women, I would want to show my kids more relatable characters like Tris from Divergent or Lyra from His Dark Materials or Hermione Granger.
