I got my skyla interested about 6 months ago! I've had the same thing happen with the cramping/spotting. Since then it's gotten less and less  Now I have 4 day periods and maybe 5 days of spotting (and corresponding cramping) within the month. If I'm going to spot I kind of like the fact that the cramping warns me personally. 

During the first month it was quite bad for me to the point where I called my doctor. She said as long as there wasn't an abnormally large amount of blood I was just adjusting to it. I would say give it a couple months and see if it goes away! :)
