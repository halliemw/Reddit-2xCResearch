It could definitely be both a physical shield, and I see how all the focus being on your hair - as in being "the girl with the really long hair" and suddenly chopping off your identifying physical feature could be a bit....jarring. I also often go for the 12 year old boy look aha but I guess less hair = less hair to distract from your face/makeup/clothes.
