Don't go to /r/feminism.  It's run by Men's Rights Activists.  Try /r/AskFeminists instead.

This isn't the sub for debate, as others have said. We built this sub to support each other and bond over shared experiences.  You're welcome to lurk and read, and contribute, but it's not a place for debate.  Ask Women is.  Ask Feminists is. /r/feminisms is.

Respect the community here and you'll be fine.
