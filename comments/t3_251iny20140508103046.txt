You sound like a really awesome guy. Even though she didn't know ahead of time about the friend-date to the work function, once you explained it was she understanding? You weren't in a relationship to begin with (though you wanted to be), you didn't kiss this other girl, and you didn't intend for it to be romantic. Seems like a total misunderstanding.
