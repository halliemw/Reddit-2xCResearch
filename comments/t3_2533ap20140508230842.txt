Once cut my hair short and then was asked to my high school homecoming by a boy. I agreed to go with him, whereupon he felt the need to say "You should grow your hair out, I don't like it this way."

I suddenly remembered I was busy on the night of the dance.

No one will be surprised to know that he grew up to be a dude who whines about the friendzone on Facebook all the time.
