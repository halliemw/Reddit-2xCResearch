Others have pretty much answered your questions, so I'll just chime in about a couple of things. 

I got my first Diva Cup about 8 years ago. It took me about three cycles to really get the hang of it, where I was confident enough not to carry a tampon too. The suction was a little too strong and it seemed to have trouble expanding properly and creating a seal. So I sterilized a safety pin and gently inserted it in the holes, increasing their size ever so slightly. It was enough for it to unfold when inserted. The second one i got after my first child didn't have any problem in that area. 

I found that sometimes the seal would pop when I had a difficult BM and i pushed hard. 

My cramps greatly decreased when i switched to the cup. They were very sharp and intense before, now they're mostly a dull ache if i have them at all.

It's definitely one of the best purchases I've ever made.
