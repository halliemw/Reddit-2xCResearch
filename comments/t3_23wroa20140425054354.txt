I had a somewhat similar experience with my mum some years back. I guess my mum was getting her knickers in a twist over the fact that by 18 I hadn't expressed interest in anyone. I hadn't expressed having a crush on someone even as a young child and I came off as somewhat of a prude. 

Anyways, one day she confronts me in the kitchen and asks 

"do you like (name of male friend)?" 

"No..." 

"Well, do you like (name of female friend)"

 "No..."

"You can be straight, or you can be gay and your father and I will always love you but I WILL NOT HAVE AN ASEXUAL CHILD" and then she stormed off in a huff. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is accusatory conversations happen to a lot of people. Think of it like this, your parents would be freaking out if as a toddler you weren't walking and talking by certain age markers. Stereotypically it's expected that in our teen years we rage out in hormones, get horny, jump on our preferred sexual desire and ride it like a hurricane. The fact that you're no longer a teenager and you have never been in a relationship is setting off warning bells. And they're used to freaking out when their child doesn't hit a certain milestone even though this time it has nothing to do with them.
