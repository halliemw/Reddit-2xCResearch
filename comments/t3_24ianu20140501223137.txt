I try to just ignore them. I've found that big, dark sunglasses help me avoid eye contact and they tend to back off more quickly if I don't meet their gaze. I just try to walk past and give off such a "bitch" vibe that they'll leave me alone. If they know they can't tear you down, it discourages them (at least in my area).

I do have one more humourous way of dealing with it. I most often get catcalled on my way into court because lots of shady dudes are always hanging around, awaiting criminal arraignment. Any lady under 35 in a skirt is going to get called out by one of them. When it gets ridiculous enough that I can't ignore them, I say "do you really want to say that to a prosecutor?" I'm actually a civil attorney (I've never litigated a criminal case in my life!) so it's a lie but the reactions are hilarious. Lots of "no ma'ams."
