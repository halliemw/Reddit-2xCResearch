Then maybe you should take the time to go outside and meet people. Once you do you'll soon realise there's a whole world populated by people with different ideas and some of those ideas can be a bit extreme. There will be extremists in every group. Without feminism people like your mom, sister, grandmother and/or female friends wouldn't be able to vote, have a job or go to school. Sexism has no place in feminism. We do not tolerate the brand of "feminism" /r/srs typically promotes. To sit here and blame the fact that that's all you were exposed to is a cop out. You obviously have access to the internet so do some research. No better yet say here for a while. Maybe you'll learn something about feminism but remember to be respectful.
