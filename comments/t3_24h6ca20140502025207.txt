The pill seemed like the default option. I went on it 9 years ago, and I'd never even heard if the Nuvaring at the time. The patch seemed annoying and too visible, and I sometimes got irritated by the adhesive on plasters so didn't fancy wearing one every day.

I've been on 3 brands of the pill - the first ended up slowly killing my libido, and the second was great until I started spotting daily. My current brand has been fine for about 5 years now.
