I have had this most of my life too. The only time I got rid of it was when I stopped eating dairy and bread/carbs for a couple months. I loved the way I looked without the pooch but lost way too much weight. Also, I have a hard time imagining my life without bread and cheese :) I also feel like it can't be purely related to weight because I know women who are on the heavier side who do not have the pooch. I have tried to do ab workouts and exercise but have never had much luck. I do agree that it is probably related to posture as well since mine is terrible and I notice it is more pronounced when I am slouching.
