If you are a teacher, you will be harassed.  If you are female, the harassment will be sexual.  If you are white in a black community, the harassment will be racial.  (White on black harassment is rare because most white students don't tolerate racists).  

Inner city schools were the most racially charged environment I've ever seen.  Light skinned black students in my school were repeatedly teased for being "white."  Dark skinned students were mocked as "darkies."  African immigrants were called spear chuckers.  

In a rich suburban district, you will also be harassed, but it will be the type of harassment we are more accustomed to and it won't be as prevalent, and many will have the decency to do it behind your back.  Racial and sexual harassment stings a lot worse--that's why we made it illegal.

Other teachers will tell you if the administration is supportive.  Sadly, management sometimes views teachers as opposition instead of partners.  

All the talk about violence is misplaced. I found it's rare against teachers. It's like shooting at a cop, you only do it if you're irrational and you have nothing to lose.  Students know that assaults on teachers bring serious criminal charges.  The idea that boys don't hit girls is so ingrained that it's actually easier for a female to break up a fight between two boys than for a male.  Male students don't view females as physical threats, and other males will intervene if a woman is in danger.

Property crime?  That's another matter.  Lock your stuff.
