> The idea is that you have freedom of beliefs. On whichever subject you like, and really, there is no limit on that.

Second sentence of my original comment. Freedom of beliefs. Individual freedom to believe whatever you want. That's what the conversation is about. What is going on in people's heads. As a person, you can believe whatever you life. If you try to force those beliefs onto someone else, there's a problem.

The difference with law, technically, is that it is highly debated, and normally should aim at protecting the citizens under which it operates. Which is just so not necessarily the case for personal beliefs.

>Thus the personal belief of 'abortion should be banned' could be made into a law banning abortion if enough of those in power agreed strongly enough.

They have. In some places, they have. And indeed, that's a problem. Because that won't stop women from getting them, it'll just make it a lot more dangerous for them to get one. 

On the opposite side, people making into law that a woman can choose to have an abortion if she chooses to, a woman who refuses to have an abortion doesn't have to have one.

I'm really not sure what your point is right now?
