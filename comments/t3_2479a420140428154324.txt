I think that 'men also' and 'not all men' are very different responses, as the author points out in the second half.  I see 'not all men' as (in some cases at least) a sincere attempt to join the *actual* discussion, albeit in one of two problematic ways:

1. As an attempt by a man to establish his own bonafides as 'not part of the problem,' so that he feels he has the right to participate in the discussion, rather than being the problem being discussed and therefore being *de facto* excluded.  As the author points out, this is problematic because it still doesn't acknowledge that person's privilege or their subconscious contributions to the larger social problem; but at least it acknowledges the problem (at least partially) and is an attempt to participate.

2. As an attempt to clarify and specify the problem by pointing out that only a subset of men offend in this way, in a pragmatic attempt to move the discussion towards attacking those offenders specifically and coming up with direct actions against them, rather than bemoaning a universal trait about the evils of 'men.'  In some cases this can actually be a useful clarification, but it's often problematic in situation where a specific problem is a consequence of a more universal cultural trend which can't really be reduced this way, or in discussions which are about  expressing and exploring women's experiences, not about finding and agreeing on pragmatic policy approaches to address a specific problem.

So while the 'not all men' response is problematic and often ends up being derailing, I think that it often at least signals a person who is interested in discussing the actual topic (in a way that a 'men also' response does not), who might be able to participate meaningfully with more education and clarification... if anyone has the time and energy to do that.
