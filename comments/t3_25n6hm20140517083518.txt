Thank you so much for writing this! 

The name calling and unwanted attention became such a constant part of my life that I started dreading leaving the house. Sounds stupid I know, but I already have anxiety problems and this wasn't something I was very good at handling.

I tried ignoring it but then I started panicking and swearing/ yelling at these men which ended up making me look crazy and feel stupid. 

I will defiantly take on your advice in the future.
