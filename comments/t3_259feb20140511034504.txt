> I just got back from the gym a few hours ago, where I benched my PR again, tried to do a pull-up (couldn't... yet) and genuinely felt absolutely no conflict about performing a stereotypically masculine activity despite the cultural consensus being that I will undoubtedly turn into a hideous she-hulk by picking up heavy things.

I think this is changing, at least in my country. I see more and more women doing bench press, deadlifts, squats, pull ups, and you will have a hard time finding guys who think women will turn into a "she-hulk" by doing it. Women won't become a she-hulk by working out anymore than the average guy will become Ronnie Coleman by doing the same.
