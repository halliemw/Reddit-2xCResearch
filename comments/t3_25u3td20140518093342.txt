> and cleaning the terminals if they're corroded

Man I had a saturn that straight-up wouldn't start for that reason. I think it was positive not negavive, but one of the terminals was just covered in what I assume was iron oxide. 

Cleaning it off by letting it sleep in coca cola for a few hours is probably why I don't drink the stuff any more.
