All men *are* potential predators. Not all men are predators, but everyone can hurt me, and the only way I know whether or not they will is *when they start hurting me*. I'll also usually avoid women in an isolated place, but the fact is? The women are statistically less likely to hurt me. 

So yes, I assess and avoid potential threats in my environment. Wow, so horrible of me, and all humans.
