That's a good point. I guess I would consider being "comfortable" within one's own race/gender as something that is applied to every group of people, as opposed to just a majority group. That means that for every white male professor that helps out his white male student exclusively, there is a latina female professor that helps out her latina female student exclusively. I also would assume that this is much more applicable to more personal situations, which I feel this situation of needing extra assistance from one's professor falls under, as opposed to a more professional setting such as when a professor is grading a student's paper. I guess how comfortable one is with another group is also based on where/with whom they were raised as opposed to simply based on race.
