nope, I've put it on all of my underwear, blue, black, red, pink, just wash it  with water after soaking it in H2O2 for 10 minutes.  But once I actually left H2O2 on the stained area all night and dried the next morning, and no bleaching occurred! It just made the fabric hard, but put it through the wash, and it's good as new.
