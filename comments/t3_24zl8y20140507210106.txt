Well, first:

>The girls shouldn't have idolized the jocks.

I don't think I'm assuming much. That was the first thing you said. Why would you even bother to say it if you weren't trying in some form to blame the girls who idolize the jocks? 

>It won't be remembered, instead, it'll be a stupid idea some kid had.

I don't agree. I think it *should* be addressed. It shouldn't just be, "oh, silly Johnny, treating women like trade-able objects! Just ignore him and he'll stop." Nobody is going to learn anything from just letting it go. We *should* be saying, "hey, that's not okay."

The memory of the event might fade away, but the unaddressed idea that it's ok to objectify people will not just fade away. If nobody said anything, it would basically be saying that it's just fine to treat other people this way. If nobody corrects them, how are they supposed to know that the behavior is unacceptable?

And I'm sorry that my last paragraph is emotional, but what I was trying to get across was that the girls shouldn't *have* to say no. That's not the point. The point is that these boys shouldn't be doing this in the first place. 

>And yes really, a girl could just say no. It would fucking smash the kid's esteem and confidence in the draft, and in doing so, discouraging anyone else from going on with the draft.

>And the "encouragement" comes from the attention, getting a reaction is what satisfies these kind of people.

It should not be on the people who are targeted to stop the behavior. They should not be put in the position to have to say no. The behavior should just not happen in the first place. I'm glad that the school is addressing it.
