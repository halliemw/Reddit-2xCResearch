Person with just one X chromosome here. Your friend laid it on a bit thick with her choice of words but she was honest and that is an extremely valuable quality. She has since apologized but know that you are lucky to have a friend that you can trust.

The dress is not only elegant and suits you very well, it also smartly mixes a modern and traditional look. I expected to hate it from your friend's description but it looks great.   

Whatever you do, someone will dislike your choice and searching for perfection puts too much pressure on yourself. If *you* like it that's good enough.
