It is going to be okay, I promise. You don't want to die, you just don't want to have to experience these awful, hurt feelings. It's hard, but BE STRONG. Think of strong women, who you admire, and channel their strength if you have to. The next few weeks are going to be the worst part, but it will get better. You aren't alone.
