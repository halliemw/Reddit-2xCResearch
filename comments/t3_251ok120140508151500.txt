>Feminism only works when equality is equal.

While I wholeheartedly agree with you here, I really feel that the point of /r/TwoXChromosomes *isn't* to promote feminism. That's what /r/feminism is for. There's nothing wrong with a small community having a platform to speak about our own issues--whether they be big like sexual assault or sexism in the workplace or small like what our favorite tampon brand is. I'm with /u/Anxa, I'm going to just hope that things normalize in a week or so, but I do think that making this sub a default is changing its entire structure and framework. For some people that's fine, and for others the previous paradigm was much preferable.
