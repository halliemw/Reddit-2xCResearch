Definitely go get it checked out as soon as you can, if it isn't possible to see the same doctor I'd recommend trying to get the previous test results to give to your new doc, just to speed up the process. 

I wish I had better advice, but it's tough to know what's going on over the internet. Good luck!

Edit: Just saw above the biopsies showed they were benign. That's awesome, I'm less worried now
