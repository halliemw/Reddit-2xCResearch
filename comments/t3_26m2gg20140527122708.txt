Oh, for sure. When I was little, she was pretty good to me. When I turned about 11, she started getting jealous, yelling at me all the time, and just over-all went completely psycho. It was like a jekyll/hyde phenomenon. Since that point, I swear she gets worse regularly. Nowadays, she's much less outwardly angry. She used to break things out of violence and push me, scream all the time, cry and make a huge scene everywhere, etc. It transformed into more gaslighting, less yelling but more passive-agression, more guilting me, definitely way more using me for money and items.  
I'm not sure if it was menopause on her end, or me transitioning from a girl into a woman on my end.
