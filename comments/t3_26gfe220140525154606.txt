There are a lot of obese people who are also fit, believe it or not. When I was at my heaviest, I was training for and ran in a half marathon. Conversely, my best friend is teeny-tiny, size 0, and is an extremely unhealthy person (no exercise, high cholesterol, and the start of some heart issues). Many people think there is a high correlation between how skinny someone is and their fitness level, but that's not always true. Look at women who are weight lifters or softball players or swimmers in the Olympics, and you'll see fit women in very different sizes! 

So, to me, the image was advocating "get fit" in a healthy way. It was showing that women can be beautiful & fit at different sizes, and being fairly all-inclusive on body types.
