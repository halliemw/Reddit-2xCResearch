I had an ex like hers. It took me a long while to get over it because his behavior was abusive. It wouldn't surprise me if he was emotionally abusive based on how similar he was to my ex about women in his life liking him and based on it being a trend for other abusive people. You don't know how traumatizing he was(it's not like bad people wear signs on their heads) and maybe she is over reacting, but you don't know what happened so trust her reaction and trust that she has good reason for how she's acting. It took me longer than two years to get over it, your friend only had two years and she never got to separate from them.

You also need to take the time to learn how to handle people when they are upset and you need to understand that the words, 'Get over it' won't suddenly make the sun shine in anyone's life and there won't be a sudden revelation in that person's life. 'Get over it' is also a very selfish term. This is something a lot of people never learn and it's something I have to deal with consistently from people who are in their 50s.
