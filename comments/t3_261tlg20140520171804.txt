I wouldn't go.  

I might choose not to report this to Human Resources, for the sake of interpersonal peace at work, but I agree with the lady who is currently getting downvoted that this is a 'hostile work environment' situation.

If the co-workers were male, and insisting that you DO wear a bikini, that would be wrong, because it's way out of line to evaluate and comment on a colleague's breasts.  It's wrong in this situation for exactly the same reason.

I do think I would be honest about why I'm not going.  "No, I'm not going to make it.  I'm so disturbed by the amount of attention that y'all are paying to my breasts that, no matter what I wear, I'm not going to have any fun."  I think the colleagues deserve to understand what happened to cause a rift in the relationship, in case any of them want to suck less in the future.
