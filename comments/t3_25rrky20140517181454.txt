I think other posters have it covered, but I wanted to bring up this thing that I had never really thought of before I took a self-defense class (years ago): can you be loud? Can you really use your voice if you need to? Go somewhere where no one can hear you or will be alarmed, and see just how loud you can yell. If you are not used to it, it takes more practice than you might think! You really have to draw a deep breath and want to project sound. I think that women are frequently expected to not be very loud, so we don't get much practice. That was my personal experience, anyway.
