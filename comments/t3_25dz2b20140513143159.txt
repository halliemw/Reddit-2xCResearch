What is wrong with people?  I mean, seriously.  All of the things posted here are great examples of entitlement and people just being general shitheads.  But in what world does the pick up line, "Come with me, we can be a family" actually work?  How can anyone think that is even remotely an appropriate thing to say to anyone, much less a stranger?
