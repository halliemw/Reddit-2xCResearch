Don't worry. You're not alone. My older sister tried using a tampon once and she couldn't even get it up there. Lol. As long as you know how to use them now, you'll be fine. I personally hate pads. I use the really small ones at home but tampons r very comfortable. You're gna love them even more now that uk how to use them properly
