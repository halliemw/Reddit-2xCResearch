What the fuck.

I am literally about to cry right now. This is the kind of thing that makes me glad I didn't press charges against my rapist. And it's one of the reasons I didn't. What if he got away with it? What if he came after me for revenge? It just didn't seem like it was worth it. I do feel super guilty for not helping to prevent him from ever doing it again, but even if I had tried, there's no guarantee it would have worked.


When that article came out a few weeks ago about the 14 year old who was raped and her rapist pled guilty and only got 45 days in jail because she "wasn't the victim she claimed to be" I actually started to question if *I* was the victim I claimed to be (kind of subconsciously) and I started having nightmares about my rape except that I wanted it :( it's been really traumatic for me these past few weeks since I read that article. It feels like everywhere I look I see rape and/or victim-blaming. My therapist is helping me out, but my homework this week was to write out exactly what happened to me and I still haven't done it yet (I see her tomorrow) because I just really really really don't want to. It's such a shitty thing to have to go over. But she thinks it'll help with the nightmares because my brain will stop questioning what happened to me.

What sucks the most is that I thought I was over it. I can't believe after almost 8 years a stupid fucking news story is giving me nightmares. I feel ridiculous.

So I'm gonna get high and try to write this out.


Sorry, just needed to vent :|
