I think that saying is very true too! In academics it seems like your letters of recommendation are incredibly critical. I didn't realize how important they were until going through the process this year. Most of the positions I applied for had 100-120 applicants and in many cases they can only interview 3-5 people. The top 10-15 candidates all have very similar CVs (with maybe a few exceptions) so having outstanding recommendations can push your application to the top of the pile. Interestingly, it helps even more if people on the search committee know your letter writers. It's less of an impact come highly recommended from someone they have never met, than to come highly recommended from someone they know.

I definitely have a new found understanding and respect for how important things like networking and having the right connections are.
