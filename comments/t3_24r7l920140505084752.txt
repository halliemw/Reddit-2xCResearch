It's ok to be scared. Mysterious health problems are always scary, especially if they cause pain. There are a few conditions you should probably ask about. [Vulvodynia](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vulvodynia/basics/definition/con-20020326) is general pain with no clear cause, just like what you're describing. There's also the possibility of vaginismus, which is also worth asking about. There are treatments for both of these, you just need your doctor to take you seriously and not dismiss it as nothing because there's no obvious cause. If your nurse dismisses you and won't talk about these as possibilities, it's time to find a different doctor.
