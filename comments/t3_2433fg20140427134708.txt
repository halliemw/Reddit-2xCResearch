>  I have no problem calling people out on this kind of shit. 

I hear ya.  

Another story:   My two predecessors at this job were both Chinese men.  I'm a blond-haired, big chested woman. Neither one of them had any issues with this - they both willingly shared their knowledge and trained me.  Before my boss, Don, was leaving, he trained me in the finer intricacies of dealing with people.  On his last week, I got a request for service.  Don and I walked into the office, and the guy behind the desk started explaining what he needed done, what the problems were, etc.  Not once during this five minute exchange of information did this man establish eye contact with me - not once.  

Don let him finish making the request and said "Why are you looking at me, I'm just tagging along.  She's the one solving your problem."  

I loved Don so much for that - we became really good friends by the way and still correspond occasionally (it's been 16 years.)  :)
