The balance between stability and adventure has always plagued me. (I tend to always waver towards stability though whereas it sounds like you've had a few adventures!) No advice, I'm afraid, but this hit home: "We are torn between nostalgia for the familiar and an urge for the foreign and strange. As often as not, we are homesick most for the places we have never known."
