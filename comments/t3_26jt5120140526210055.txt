I disagree, too (along with deadvo2013).  But it really depends on where you are.  Research it.  The border is dangerous and some coastal cities are having problems.  But other areas are fine.  American women can get a lot of attention in Mexico, so be prepared to ignore it, or if not, set clear boundaries and limits.  Also if you are driving long distances in Mexico, use the new toll roads rather than the national highways.  It costs a little bit, but are much safer.  Unfortunately the national highways have become subject to roadblocks and setups for theft.  And generally, even on toll roads, don;t drive at night (though toll roads at night are better than the national highways).
