I unsubbed months ago because this place was a total downer. While the content is a little less intensive than usual, I am having a laugh riot over here.

Hell, being defaulted may be the best thing that's happened to this place in years. If this keeps up after the initial (heh) shitstorm, I'm resubbing.
