Although 2X is a bit...hivemind-y when it comes to certain sensitive topics like abortion and whatnot, I definitely don't think you'll be like verbally abused or something like that, maybe lectured. Worst that will happen if you voice an opinion that the community at large disagrees with is downvotes.
