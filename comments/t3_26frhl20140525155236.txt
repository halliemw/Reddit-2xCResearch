And some people are needlessly  sexualizing clothing for kids at a very young age.

I've been given the stink eye more than once (even had words from a "friend") for choosing two piece suits for my toddler.  My baby isn't a woman. She doesn't have breasts.  She does have a diaper, though, and I'm not about to peel off a sticky, wet one-piece to change it.  We're beginning potty training now and I am even less excited by the thought of removing a one piece from a kid who waits until the last possible second to inform me of their pee situation.

Sorry.  Off topic-on topic rant.

Tldr: Adults, stop sexualizing children. For real. Eww.
