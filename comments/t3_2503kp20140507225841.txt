You aren't looking at this from his perspective at all, are you? Half of that child is his contribution, surely he should have a say (not the final decision, but a say) in what happens to it? 

I'll give you an analogy: A child is a lot like a relationship; it takes two people to make it. One person doing something with a relationship (such as breaking it off) without consulting the other person is going to hurt. **And that other person is completely entitled to feel how they want to!** If you felt like your opinion on a major relationship decision was being completely disregarded, like your partner wasn't listening to you at all, you'd be angry too. And it sounds like that's how OP's boyfriend was before she spoke with him. Obviously, in this case, there can be no true winner because each person wants something different and only one of them can get their way. 

Is that a reason to break off the (non-metaphorical) relationship between OP and her boyfriend? Well, that's for him to decide. It's their relationship and by extension, their child. He deserves a say, at the very least, and I'm happy that OP gave him one. Whether his actions following that reflect his character is not for us to judge, we don't know him. We should be focused on helping/comforting OP, not on judging her SO.
