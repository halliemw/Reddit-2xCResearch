I myself was average (11, nearly 12 when I got my first period). But I worked as an analytical chemistry intern for a company that made treatments for precocious puberty. We had case studies of girls who were 4 and 5 years old menstruating. The cutoff for precocious puberty for girls is under age 8, so your sister is over the line, but I know it's still gotta be really difficult to deal with.

Even though I was fairly average, I remember my friends anxiously discussing what it'd be like to have a period and I was too embarrassed to speak up and say I'd had mine for months. 

Best of luck to your sister, you, and your whole family. :)
