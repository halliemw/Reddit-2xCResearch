I'm gonna post the same thing I posted last time I saw this article...

Another thing I'd add expanding on 9, which applies to everyone not just girls, is that there's nothing wrong with wanting to have casual sex. It's not wrong to want to have sex with someone just because you think they're hot or whatever, you don't have to be hopelessly in love with them or want to marry them or something. It's not inherently disrespectful to yourself or to the other person.
