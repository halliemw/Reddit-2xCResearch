Both. My mom and dad both worked full time when my brother and I were growing up. Personally, I think I would hate being a stay-at-home mom, or to significantly compromise my career for my family. I'm a medical student, and I'm not putting myself through this so I can be mommy. My degree is worth every bit as much as my boyfriend's (a classmate), and I will not be treated like it's second to my function as a female. I want a family, and my boyfriend was never under any illusions that I'd ever be a housewife. He's the kind of person who will have no problem contributing to family life equally, and who will work with me to handle careers and kids instead of expecting me to just handle it myself. 

It's actually kind of funny, when I first began dating my (Canadian) boyfriend, I mentioned something about how it would be nice to live in Canada because they have Paternity leave. He said he never thought about taking Paternity leave. I asked him why not, and he said "I don't know, I guess I just assumed my wife would take care of that stuff." His mother was a SAHM for ten years after he and his sister were born. It's just how he was raised, and what he's used to. But right after those words left his mouth, he said "Actually, a ton of people I know took Paternity leave when they had kids. I'd never expect you to give up your career. So I guess that means I'll have to make sacrifices too." He had just not thought about it until then. By now, he knows clear as day that I'll never be a SAHM. He knows a life with me means finding other solutions to child care. It'll be really difficult for us both, but worth it.
