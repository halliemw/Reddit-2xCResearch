If you're looking for examples, [this tumblr blog](http://mansplained.tumblr.com/) is full of them. 

The mansplaining I tend to get is from guys who think they know more about bra sizes than I do. Like, "oh you couldn't possibly be bigger than a DD cup because anything past DD is enormous and you would need implants to be that big blah blah blah I definitely know more about bra sizes than you do even though I've never heard of a gore or wide/narrow roots or projection."

I'll also occasionally get into statistics talks and have someone decide they need to explain some really basic concept like median vs mean or random sampling to me and I want to shove my diploma in their face and scream I LITERALLY HAVE A DEGREE IN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO ME. 

It's not necessarily limited to guys, either. I've had more guys than girls mansplain things to me, but I've definitely had girls try to pull that on me as well.
