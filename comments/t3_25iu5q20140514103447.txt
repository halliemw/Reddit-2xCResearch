Just a child......a phrase that belies the disregard one holds for the thoughts and feelings of a human being because of an arbitrary number.  Someday you'll be in a nursing home having your thoughts and feelings disregarded because you're just too old.  Hope the idea sticks with you when some nursing aid treats you like that.
