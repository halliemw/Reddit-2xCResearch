My sister only found out about hers when she tried to donate blood in her 20s.  

I was 19 when I got tested.  I was getting a standard STI screen along with my IUD insertion, and asked that HIV and HepC be tested at the same time.  There's a standard talk you get when you ask for an HIV test (regarding the Canadian HIV registry, etc), but they had 3 different doctors pull me aside and grill me about why I was requesting a HepC test, my sexual behaviour, etc.  

It worries me also because my sister, having discovered that HepC is not classified as an STI, doesn't always disclosed her HCV+ status to sexual partners. She justifies it as "well, the transmission rate is really low, so it's no big deal".  But then, in the unlikely case she DOES pass it, her partners won't know to get tested, and they won't find out through a regular screen.
