Great points. I'd also suggest some reading:  

[Predator Prevention - Links](http://captainawkward.com/2013/10/28/predator-prevention-links/) provides links to just about all of my favourite pieces on this subject. Read the pieces on missing stair theory, creepy dudes in friend circles, and cockblocking rapists for starters. If you haven't read the *Yes Means Yes* piece "Meet The Predators", you're going to want to read that before the cockblocking rapists piece (there's a link to it at the beginning of the piece, use it!).

I'd also suggest reading [Schr√∂dinger's Rapist](http://kateharding.net/2009/10/08/guest-blogger-starling-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-rapist-or-a-guy%E2%80%99s-guide-to-approaching-strange-women-without-being-maced/) and [this great followup](http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/shroedingers-rapist-and-the-imagined-right-to-intrude/).

And this is more about general sexism: "[What Can Men Do?](https://medium.com/tech-culture-briefs/a1e93d985af0)". It's specifically about sexism in tech, but it has great general workplace tips in general.

And here's a highlight for /u/Altered_Carbon.
