Ooh! I can relate to this! By the time I was 12 I was 5'11. By 16 I was 6'1 and finished growing. Now I'm 22 and I've finally accepted my height. I love it even. There are some negative things about it, but there are lots of positives too. This is really a thing she's going to have to discover for herself though. I've been bullied, harassed, and made fun of for my height all my life. Yes, even as an adult. A couple of guys in a restaurant called me a freak because I was taller than them. It hurts, it always will. It's hard to find clothes that fit properly too. I have to shell out extra cash to buy jeans that are long enough for my legs and shirts that fit my frame better. I'm not one of those tall people that is super skinny. I have broad shoulders and long arms. And huge feet too! I wear a 12 in women's shoes.

Those are the negatives. Thev positives are pretty awesome. Long legs are beautiful and look awesome in the right clothes. You will never have to use a foot stool to reach stuff on the top shelf. Being a tall female is distinctive and that itself is something to be appreciated. Eventually she will discover these things and learn to appreciate her height and how it makes her unique. :)
