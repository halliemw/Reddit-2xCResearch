This too! I fucking hate when they try to flirt like that, I'm an adult and want to drink alone. How is that hard to understand? And the phone thing...annoying! I've had my headphones on and guys pull one of the ears off or put his hand on my shoulder to get my attention. I thought some of these things were universal "leave me alone" signs , but some dudes don't care about that ..they're usually the most inappropriate upon rejection too.
