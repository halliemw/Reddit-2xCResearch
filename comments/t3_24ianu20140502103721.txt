usually i throw up  a finger and yell 'go eff yourself, or suck my balls, or something like that' (also hothead) luckily i have cronic bitch face and walk with mad purpose so i usually don't get any comments anymore.

the other day though, i exited the liquor store and a group of totes hot dudes were just like 'hey, whatcha doin tonight?' i hadn't washed my hair in a week and i was wearing no makeup 

i giggled and answered with 'going home to my husband and puppies, yaaay'

they laughed and said 'have fun!'

STILL GOT IT, BETCHES!
