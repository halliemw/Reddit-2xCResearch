Dude here.  I would be happy if my SO could use my life in some way to get out of work. Work sucks.  We only work because we have to, if we had a bunch of money, we would not work, only do stuff that we want to.  So, why would I care if she is able to use a death in my family to get the day off?  Good for you honey!  I place a higher value on family and friends than I do on career or the dead, so any time I can use the dead to make my and my family's life better, I jump on board. 

You decided to go to work because you only have a set number of days to be able to take off.  Does he?  And why do you care how he uses them?  You went to work.  He would have done whatever you wanted to do that day. 

I wouldn't be too mad at him. You should be happy he was able to take the day off and enjoy it.  Be happy because he is happy. You getting upset will only make matters worse and cause friction.  That's not what you want.

Sometimes it's better to be happy than right.
