The problem is the last few big super heroine movies flopped hard. 

Elektra and Catwoman were terribly written, poorly cast and horribly acted. 
If given the proper treatment a Wonder Woman movie would be great. Her power level is on par with Superman and she rules over a nation of powerful warriors. 

Just cast an unheard of actress who has martial arts training so she looks natural in combat and it could be amazing.
