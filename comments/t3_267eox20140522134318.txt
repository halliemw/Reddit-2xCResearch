You're absolutely right with your last line. I didn't want to ramble on all day. I work at a small company with 6 developers. We have one female on our team who is an excellent programmer and worker When I give her work to do It gets done. It's great, unfortunately we have this kid (guy) who is terrible and I have to baby sit him all day.
