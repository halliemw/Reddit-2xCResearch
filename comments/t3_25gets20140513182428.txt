That "mouth full of hair" line is one of those "jokes" that is pretty negative in my book and totally untrue. As if you would lick the hairy part? Obviously, you still just lick skin, you just have a smaller pallet. that pallet, however, is still much larger than the lips of a man with a beard. An occasional hair may get in your mouth, but I never got more hair in my mouth going down on a girl than a guy. Also, if you tug loose hairs when in the shower daily, it happens only rarely that a stray comes loose. In fact, you are probably just sucking on one of your own chest hairs that fell off - just as likely since guys are hairier And when I waxed and shaved I couldn't do any oral at all because of the stubble. I've never heard a guy complain and they sure seem to love it! Actually, oral isn't that important to me, but it sure seems to be a passion for the guys I have dated!
