You may not like to admit it, but /u/babycarrotman is absolutely correct. Many original subscribers do dislike this change, but you cannot tell if it is a majority using this poll.

Have a look at the new queue. It it's anything like it was a few hours ago there are enormous amounts of downvotes on everything. These are a small number of petty people who hate this subreddit being added so much they are downvote brigading it. I would imagine far more dislike the change enough to vote no but would not lower themselves to brigading the new queue.

Personally, I voted the third option since I was not a member prior to the change, but I don't think most people would have had the integrity to do that.
