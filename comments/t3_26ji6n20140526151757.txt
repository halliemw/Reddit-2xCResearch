I am a guy about that age and I usually only date women younger than you. I'm successful, look younger, and girls fall for me all the time. I actually have much better luck with girls now than when I was in my 20s. When I was younger I figured that I'd get married when the young girls stopped paying attention to me but it never happened so I just kept my lifestyle and never saw marriage, living together and having kids as anything more than a burden. (And yes, my lifestyle really pisses some people off to no end so I have learnt to keep my mouth shut about it and not show off money or womenwise)

Anyway, my point is that if he is 48 and has women your age falling for him, then he is single because of his own choice and not because of a lack of women. So, he is probably not the kind of guy who is looking for a serious relationship. The bigger risk here is that you fall for him and that he won't be interested in getting serious with you.
