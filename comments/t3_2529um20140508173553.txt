I believe that what she meant was that she either didn't realize that the look on his face was "repulsion" until later, or that she saw that he was disappointed, but as he said nothing she assumed they were going to try anyway because of how much they liked one another.

Also, having sex with her (multiple times, remember) when he knew she wanted a relationship and they had already confessed to "loving" one another was just completely uncalled for. If he really cared about her feelings, he wouldn't have slept with her.
