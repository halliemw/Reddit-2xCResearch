Agree that cheating is not the answer but wanted to be honest that it is something I've thought about seriously.  I've talked about therapy with him, and he's sort of open to couples therapy, but very resistant to individual therapy. I have been in therapy previously and agree I should probably head back to work on my own issues. As you gathered, there is clearly something in myself I need to work on too. 

I know this probably seems silly to others but I'd never really thought of him having a serious anger problem. I'd thought he had a problem with reacting to things in an inappropriate manner for sure, but not necessarily a problem.   An honest question, what is the distinction or is there one? Sometimes it's hard to know from the inside of something what you're dealing with.
