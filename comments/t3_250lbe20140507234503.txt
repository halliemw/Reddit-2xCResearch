My mom has this problem. That said, it is what it is. You can wear wigs or you can accept it. Her ears stick through her chin-length hair half the time, but you know what? Most people don't notice or care, and when they do comment, 60 years of practice have given her the ability to gracefully handle it for the most part. Most people won't say negative things, at least not intentionally, and it sounds like your Asian coworkers are making the same sorts of unintentionally offensive and possibly mildly racist comments that white people often make about black people's hair.
