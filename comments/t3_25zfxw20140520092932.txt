Yep, I started my period at age 9 and many of my friends/classmates joined my ranks by the time I was 12.  

I learned from a friend first, and I'm very lucky that the info HER mom gave her was correct, easy to understand, and not scary or shame-based. Kids at that age don't need to fill in the WHOLE sex picture, but they do need to know the hows and whys of what's happening to them.

I expect any kid of the women in my family is going to experience the same heavy cycle and cramps, and will need the low down on our collective tips and tricks for feeling better and staying healthy. If I have a daughter I really want to be the one who gets out there ahead of the six zillion other sources of information that will bombard her girlbrain.
