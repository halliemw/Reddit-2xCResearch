In truth though, this young man got more help than most men will get in their lifetimes. He was seeing multiple psychologists, and it didn't do him much good. It seems he was suffering from NPD and was interviewed by the cops. The found him to be reasonable and calm. So he more than likely manipulated them into thinking he was just a normal guy. 

I don't think he would have been fine in any society. He did claim to be God and would punish everyone.
