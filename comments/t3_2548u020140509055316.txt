no of course not -I worded that wrong.  I mean that catcalling is often meant to make you feel small, powerless, and to intimidate you, a bit like bullying.  I just cannot believe that 3 guys yelling 'show us your cunt, bitch' while driving past in a car, are trying to respectfully and honesty flirt with you.  Once a guy followed me for 3 blocks trying to get my attention and tell me how sexy I look on those yoga pants.  The cat caller is not looking to make it a mutually positive or respectful experience.
