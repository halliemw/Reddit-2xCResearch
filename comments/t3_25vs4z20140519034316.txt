Im 22 and have a similar fear of pregnancy. I kind of see it as some thing so alien , dangerous, like something thats going to leave me injured, either weeks to recover, or maybe never recover. I just can't see the good sides of it, I see physical hardship, and even after I have no faith in my ability to raise a kid. I just see myself being frustrated, feeling un appreciated, tedious.
 I almost with I would just feel all baby crazy, and then feel like all that stress is worth it, then  wouldn't feel out of place like I do now.
