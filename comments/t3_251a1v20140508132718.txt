>They can say they want $X per hour, and if the employer disagrees, the employee can walk out and the employer is S.O.L. There's nothing inherently unequal about that because employment can only happen if both parties voluntarily agree to it.

This comment is utterly ignorant of how economics works. Even without a labor glut the employer/employee relationship is inherently imbalanced in favor of the employer. In fact, this is why labor unions formed: to give employees a more equal footing to negotiate with employers.
