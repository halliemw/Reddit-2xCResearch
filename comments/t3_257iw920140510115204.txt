Obligatory- talk to your doctor first. I've had some good luck with a B complex the week before as well as some stress relieving herbs like Lemon balm and Rhodiola. Kind of depends on the month and what's going on in my life tho as to the extent of the pms. Do u like yoga? That's helped me probably more than anything- just to remember to breathe and to cultivate self confidence. I suppose any slight physicality would help tho. Sometimes even just a walk can work wonders. Be kind to yourself, above all else- and remind yourself of this often.
