...well, I would say the best action would be to stop having unprotected sex, especially drunken sex, since one day you might get unlucky enough and get HIV or the new Super Gonorrhea (which can kill and has no treatment), but that's just me. I mean, statistically speaking, the more you do it without protection, the closer you are to getting something worse, whether your a guy or a girl.
