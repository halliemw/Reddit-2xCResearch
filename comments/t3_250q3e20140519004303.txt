I'm sorry lady, youre missin the point in a very big way. Obviously we can ostensibly do whatever the fuck we want to our bodies, but we are under constant pressure to conform to a certain standard for our bodies. When millions of women starve themselves, or binge and purge, aiming for a body size that literally is not biologically viable for their body type, is it unreasonable to say that these women do not "own" their bodies? 

At what point do societal pressures become so extreme that free will becomes clouded and compromised?

I'm not talking micro-picture, this specific chick can tattoo her vah-jayjay if she so desires, I'm talking big picture-- society tells chicks in general that x, y, and z is desirable to men and therefore required from women.

ite chica, we all reach our feminist realizations at different paces. it'll smack you in the face someday and nothing will look the same. 

cheers
