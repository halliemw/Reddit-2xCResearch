You don't have to be a feminist to work with feminists. There are a lot of people who don't identify with the movement, but don't disagree with it. They work in parallel with a lot of the movement's goals (for their personal ideologies), but don't strive for all the goals of feminism. I think the neutral area between being a feminist and being anti-feminist is much broader than it seems. It's a big wide world out there. These days I try to take a breath and listen when someone says they're not feminist before I label them anti-feminist... I mean we need as many allies as we can get, even if they're not full fledged partners.
