That's great. It's a damned shame that so many Muslim women in other countries don't get that choice. Instead, the morality police arrest them if they don't wear hijab. Outrageous. 

See facebook #mystealthyfreedom for the campaign that Iranian women are waging to find just a little freedom in their own country. Let's not glamorize an article of clothing that absolutely symbolizes oppression for millions of women who don't have the freedom of choice that American muslims have.
