I've definitely learned my lesson from all of this mess, thanks so much for the advice. I'm getting back on birth control ASAP and condoms-only from now on. The only friend I've told is my closest friend who has had 2 abortions already. She would never tell him, and I'm pretty sure he's moving to the opposite coast in a few months anyways.
