Would you consider yourself to have a sarcastic sense of humor? I only ask because when I first met a girl, she whipped out this hardcore sarcasm and I had no idea how to respond to it. Now I know that's just her personality and she's hysterical, but when I first met her I kind of thought she came off as a little abrasive and was unsure of how to react. 


In terms of the internet group...who knows. Try finding groups in your neighborhood that do things you're interested in? Even just going to the same class at the gym will help you get to know people.
