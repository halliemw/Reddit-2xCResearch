For me in my 20s it was much more about internalised virgin shaming. Society, or it might be more correct to say young male society, does regard male 'incels' as inferior, yes, but it's not that big a deal. What was a big deal was the burden I was putting on myself, which I think is similar to what Elliot Rodger experienced.

It's shameful to admit, but the first time I had sex was partly because I had intimated that I would withdraw my friendship otherwise. This was an immoral act. If I hadn't put so much pressure on myself to lose my virginity, I probably wouldn't have used friendship as a bargaining chip in this way.
