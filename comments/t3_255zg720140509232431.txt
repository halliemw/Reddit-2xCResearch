> I'm also worried because I don't want to be an anchor, or a constant reminder of sadness in their lives. I want to be a good memory.

Have you thought about including that? I've seen your posts around and you seem very thoughtful and eloquent, I'm sure that you'd be able to get across what you mean. I mean of course everyone is different, but I'm sure they'd rather have the letters than not... And yes, stories. Stories about your childhood, your friends, your wife, your kids.. All of it. And yeah, how awesome you are. :)
