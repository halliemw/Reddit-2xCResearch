I'm in a different position because I've had a breast reduction- but literally just one breast. Due to some weird circumstances I had one ready grow to a DDD and one remain a B cup, so I had one breast reduced to have two B cups. For the one breast plus anesthesia it was 4800 in Orlando, fl. Best thing I ever did, but I was in a super weird circumstance. If you can swing the money I recommend it. Though, go smaller than you think you want- they really fill out over time. The scars don't bother me and are very light now.
