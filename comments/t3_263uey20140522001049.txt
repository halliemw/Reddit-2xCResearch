questions OP should ask herself to know if it was rape. 

1) while OP was drunk, did she communicate that she wanted to have sex.
if no then rape, if yes then question 2
2) was boyfriend so drunk that he mistook OP's consent for actual consent (and failed to recall previous denial of consent). 
if no then rape, if yes then not rape

if all of these questions are 50/50 odds than there is a 75% chance it was rape. i do not believe that these questions are 50/50 odds however.
