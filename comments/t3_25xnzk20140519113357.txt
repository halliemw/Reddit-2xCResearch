Women aren't just hyper sexualized in media, but in everyday life. When I go out to clubs, then majority of women I see aren't in business suits or nice lose fitting outfit. They are wearing thing that I would expect a sex worker to wear. Even if I'm just walking through the mall, I mostly see low cut tops and Yoga pants everywhere. However, thats besides the point, as most of these girls are women under 30 and the truth is Media does over sexualize women. 

My point is in comics, characters are designed to be over the top, larger than life figures. Men are given muscles the average man doesn't have. Women are given breast the average woman doesn't have or doesn't flaunt. But these people aren't real. They are creations from a person's imagination. If you were telling me every camera shot of Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama was a cleavage and butt shot, I would be upset because these are real people who have real influence on peoples lives. But instead I'm hearing outrage about made up characters that go around **killing people** for a living because they drew her breast too big and its sends the wrong message. Really? I mean no disrespect in saying this, but if you want your daughter to know that she is more than a sex object, you shouldn't be looking to fictional characters as role models. And if you want her to be able to enjoy comics, explain to her the values that the heroines exhibit. Talk to her about Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth and not her bra size. I wouldn't tell my son he needs to hit the gym to be like Superman. I would tell him to help those in need.
