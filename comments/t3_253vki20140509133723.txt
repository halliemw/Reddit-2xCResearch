>  I love how, on reddit, when someone down-votes you, they can't just simply hit the down arrow and move on like healthy emotionally stable adults. Nope. They have to go through your entire history and down-vote everything you've ever done in order to punish you...

Yup, this happened to me after I participated in this thread last night. Some real mature adults around here.
