I guess I dont see where any of my comments were condescending. I wasn't speaking directly towards OP, I was reading the other posts and it seemed like the majority of them were pretty negative. I thought this was an open discussion. I wont apologize for giving my compliment. If someone wants to take my compliment as an insult or read it as I am treating everyone like children, then that is something they need to come to terms with. Thanks for the explanation.
