It doesn't sound like homophobia in anyway to me. It sounds like an *entire* family are telling her she's something she isn't. 

I think it's much closer to having everyone you know tell you your favourite colour is purple when actually it's green, but they don't care when you tell them it's green and insist on buying everything for you in purple. And when you say "well, actually guys, I really like green" they tell you that you don't.
