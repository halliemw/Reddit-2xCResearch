There's always a risk of oversimplifying, Elliot was a deeply sick person who clearly lacked an capacity for empathy, but the focus on his misogynous isn't unwarranted. He very clearly states numerous times in his writings and on video that women are entirely responsible for the shooting. His misogyny wasn't his only disturbing view, but it was the main focus, he was obsessed with finding a pretty girl to have sex and bled into every aspect of his life.  It's also the only aspect of his writings that people are actively expressing sympathy towards. It's also not the first mass murder inspired by misogynistic views.
