Here's me: You know these old handbag clasps with two small orbs that you push together and then it snaps shut? That's what my labia looks like. Two strands that get bigger at the end.

I have a small line on my nose. It's the line where it folds, when I make a piggie nose. I don't know why, but it's always visible as a thin, slightly darker line.

My nipples are not erogenous. In fact they are pretty numb all together. Only on shark week they go completely nuts and I can't touch them without feeling pain.

Whenever I'm distracted and/or listening to someone's monologue I start pulling at strands of my hair or twisting them around my finger. During important conversations I always have to hold myself back, because I can't imagine it to appear very professional.

When I'm chilling by myself, I often start fumbling my labia. It's not arousing or connected to sex in any other way. I pinch it, flick it, scratch it or pull at it while I'm not even ncessarily aware of doing it.

I often walk around with bare feet. There's nothing like pavement wet from rain but still warm from the sun during summer. Soft, slimey mud that comes up between the toes also feels great.
