Kill her with kindness.  Don't let her see that her inappropriate behavior (assuming it is inappropriate) gets under your skin.  Make sure she knows you love her.  That's how you react to her behavior, if it's a problem.  And obviously, if she does something really out of line, appropriate punishment as determined by you & her dad.

But for what it's worth, a lot of girls her age have issues with their mother-figures.  I fought non-stop with my mom from the time I was about 8 until I was 16-ish.  Non-stop.  I was fine with my dad, but my mom & I did *not* get along.  I'd do stuff specifically to piss her off, I'd go out of my way to upset her, because... I don't know, I was a kid.  

It's a very common developmental thing for kids to push limits, often with one parent over the other.  And often with girls, they push with their mom or mom-figure.  Stick with it.  

And remember, she's not her brothers.  They're going to act differently because they *are* different - they're different people.  You'll probably notice that the 7-yr-old has a different personality than his older brother when he gets a bit older.
