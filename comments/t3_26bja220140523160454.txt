Absolutely find some sort of club or volunteer organization or something to get you out of the house! It doesn't have to be something you expect to find a potential partner or a new best friend at, but something that's completely for you. It will give you opportunities for more social situations and you can expand your circle slowly. I'd suggest looking for a book club, a place to volunteer at, or checking to see if your city has its own subreddit where you could connect with people.
