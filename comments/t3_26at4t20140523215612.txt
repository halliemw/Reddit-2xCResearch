Do you think there is any chance that women are being taught to be more bossy/pushy?  Or do you think there is no basis to that idea?

Because that's my argument.  Yes, there are biases on *both* sides.  My point is that the battle is very difficult, and not nearly as simple as "get people to stop saying certain things".
