My mom did this to me for a while. I broke up with my boyfriend while she was on vacation, and she somehow decided it was because I was deeply in love with my best friend. She had a friend of hers talk to me about how my mom would always love me no matter what and did I have anything I needed to confess to her...it was very confusing.

I second the advice to just let it die down. If anyone brings it up again like your uncle did, I would just say "Thanks that's very nice of you, but I'm actually not gay." If they don't believe you, move on. What do you care if they think you're gay? Unless they're going to tell potential future men you're into, it doesn't matter. And it IS very nice of them to try and make you feel comfortable, even if they are doing it in a way that makes you uncomfortable.
