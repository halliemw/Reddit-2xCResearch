I agree with the sentiment, but in regards to the headline: every drone missile fired is not a threat but a big *boost* to extremism (especially considering the number of civilians killed by it, or the number of people killed who didn't get trial or defendant). This is the exact action they can use to mobilize people and spread propaganda.
