First, assuming you're in the United States, talking about it is slander, so technically you won't be guilty of libel.

Second, this is a civil matter, not a criminal one, so the burden of proof is a "preponderance of evidence" not "beyond all reasonable doubt"

Slander or Libel has to be "published" in order for it to count.  If you just tell a few people privately, it should be OK, but if you shout it on a street corner, then you have a problem.  If the person you are accusing is a public figure, it is MUCH more difficult for them to sue for slander as opposed to your Average Joe.

Edit: The rules may vary by state.
