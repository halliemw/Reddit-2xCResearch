I don't always feel comfortable here, but that may be my age.  I self-censor a lot, because humor falls flat online, as do controversial opinions.  Mostly I hang out to be supportive, but I don't feel relevant, even though I have had many of the same experiences currently posted here.  I really wish I could find an active forum for older women, one not centered around menopause or grandkids.
