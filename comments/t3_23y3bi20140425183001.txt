> whether we want to or not, society tells us in a variety of ways whats 'good' or 'bad' and we compare ourselves to it, consciously or unconsciously.

THIS. A million times this. I have purposely stopped buying fashion magazines for precisely this reason, because I could hear myself thinking, "Oh, I wish I was just a tiny bit skinnier so I could wear that dress." Or it would be "Oh, I wish I didn't have black hair and brown skin so that highlights would look natural on me." Or "I wish my face was just a little bit longer so I could wear sunglasses like that actress." Magazines became this endless litany of what I didn't have, from clothes to physical traits. Not having them around has drastically reduced my negative internal voice.

Not to say I don't have one! I still do, unfortunately. But I can at least appreciate the attention I get when I dress up, wear a tight pair of jeans, or hell, just put on a new bit of makeup. I'm learning to understand that I'm attractive the way I am, and I don't need to be someone else.
