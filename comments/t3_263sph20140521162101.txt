Not sure if this has been mentioned because I didn't read all the comments.

Last year I was plagued by the same cycle of recurring UTI and yeast from the antibiotics used to treat them.

I'm not a granola girl. I believe in controlled, double blind studies and SCIENCE! But I was desperate, so I spent some time on the internet and found a few things that mitigated the side effects. I'm not saying no antibiotics, I'm only saying help your body along.

For the UTI, **D-Mannose** from the health food store made a huge difference in clearing the UTI, and also heading off a new one that was brewing (you know that feeling when it is coming). Less time on a antibiotic, less yeast. Why had I never heard of this before? I HATE cranberry juice!!!

For yeast I found the probiotics helpful, both capsules of lactobacillus and kefir. Kefir is loaded with all sorts of digestive probiotics and in addition to being a nice yogurt smoothie-type drink, helped my body recover from the wipe-out of multiple courses of antibiotics, especially my gut.

Finally, be **more proactive with your doctor. There are some conditions that mimic recurring UTI** that are not as common and may not be on your doctor's radar. A friend of mine was finally diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis after a long trial with multiple doctors who just wouldn't listen to her symptoms. Some STDs also mimic UTI.

By now you have probably read the advice about drinking enough water, urinating immediately after intercourse, and looking for dietary triggers. I feel your pain! Good luck!
