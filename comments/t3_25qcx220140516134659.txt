Yeah, the gaslighting and derailing sucks. That's part of what I mean by the shit we'll have to put up with for a while. But hopefully by being a default we'll eventually get past that stuff (for the most part, I don't believe it will ever entirely go away). 

Thanks for the recommendation about /r/femmethoughts! I'll add it to my original post.
