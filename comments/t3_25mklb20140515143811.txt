>Discriminating based on job experience is called reality. It isn't discrimination when someone who works there longer makes more money. You know why? They have been there longer.

LOL WOW. Okay, it's extremely evident that you have literally zero idea what is contained in US labor laws, and your comments smack of total youth ignorance to even the basics of American labor regulation.

You sound like a libertarian who has confused America for a libertarian system, and are "assuming" that libertarian approaches to labor regulation are already in place in America. 

I cannot think of any other way in which you can be this willfully ignorant to a legal and regulatory reality that has been true for longer than your parents have been alive.

I'm not going to use this post to teach you the basics of american labor law, but I do find it **hilarious** you call me out for not having evidence when your wildly inaccurate view of US labor law is not based in any form of evidence at all.
