You don't understand, there are 4 scenarios:

You trust him - He's not cheating - The relationship is good.
You trust him - He is cheating - The relationship is bad.
You don't trust him - He's not cheating - The relationship is bad.
You don't trust him - He is cheating - The relationship is bad.

If you have to snoop through his stuff there's no good outcome anyway. There's still a chance you'll get screwed if you don't snoop.
