I was honestly expecting a lot worse, because a. it's an 8mm rifle, so the bullets are... well, they're big and b. some of the ammo we were shooting was from the 40s. I got a little bit of a bruise from it. It wasn't too terrible, but I can see where it might be bad if you've got a previous injury to think about.

My SO and I actually just bought a [Mossberg 500 JIC Cruiser](http://www.mossberg.com/product/shotguns-pump-action-500-special-purpose-500-jic-jic-6-shot/51340) last night and are taking it to the range tomorrow. It looks... ridiculous.
