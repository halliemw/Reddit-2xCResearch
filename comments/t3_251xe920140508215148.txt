Here's my bit:

Counseling is sort of glorified cheerleading. You need to have goals and a counselor who wants you to get there, not someone who gets $150 an hour to listen to you complain, agree with you, and send you on your way. If you find yourself with one like that, after about a month of sessions (I'm assuming a weekly schedule there) you need to move on. I found the only counselor I have ever got on with and I knew she was the one when she literally said of one of my observations of myself; "That's bullshit." And that's my advice on counseling. If they don't call you out when you're wrong, and you know something has to be wrong, they're the wrong counselor.

As for your problems, I think you really nailed all the pathology. You are pregnant, hormonal, emotional. He is working a job that is paying less and expecting a child soon. He wants nothing more than to love and provide for you both. But you are in a time of extenuating circumstances. That's weighing on him. And every time you say something, whether your tone is off or not, he feels reminded of how much he is failing right now. He might not really be failing, but he perceives it that way. His anxiety is getting the better of him.

SO I'd say yes, go to counseling. And his disdain for counseling, you have to remember, is born of a current social paradigm that labels counseling as an emasculating experience. He feels like he is failing as a man and lots of guys will say to a guy considering counseling, "That's gay, just man up." Man up. Like being human isn't the same for everyone.

To sum it up: find some good counseling, be patient, and cheer on your man as much as you can. Right now he is under immense pressure, both actual and artificial socially-generated pressure. You're not feeling your best physically, and your emotions are running high, but he, and I am virtually guaranteeing this as a fellow man, feels like he is not doing right by you every single day. You gotta remind him that he is.
