>Are they serious?

I know someone who's a part of the PUA community, and yes, they are serious. I'm not sure which is more disgusting, the fact that they believe this stuff works, or that I've actually seen it work. Granted, it only really works on the uninformed & incredibly weak minded.

You have to remember, though, that the majority of the PUA community is made up of people who are *incredibly* insecure about themselves; all they learned to do is how to act like they have self-confidence. The people who actually have self-confidence don't really have the need or the desire to get into a community that sees women as toys.
