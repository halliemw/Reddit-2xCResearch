See if there are any clinics that cater primarily to LGBTQ folk or specialize in HIV, that's how I was able to get a faster test. I don't know the name of the test and I can't find anything about it online, but I did find that 97% of people show antibodies on the older test within 3 months. The 6 month test is really just to cover all bases. 

You can get an RNA antigen test that will detect in 1-3 weeks but it is more expensive.

I doubt that you have HIV, but I realize that you are probably scared. I get scared enough just going for routine testing. :/
