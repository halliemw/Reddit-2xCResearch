I'm not saying that it is better to carry full term is better I am very pro choice. I wasn't aware that it was government making it a mandatory 72 hour wait, this is wrong it shouldn't be up to governments to decide. However as fas as I am aware in the UK its is the NHS that set the two- three week wait for having an abortion and this seem to work fine with no one really having an issue with the wait time.
