this is really cool! coupled with [this new policy from NIH] (http://www.nature.com/news/policy-nih-to-balance-sex-in-cell-and-animal-studies-1.15195) means that we will have better science done surrounding women. 12 day conception period? blargh.

it is important to note that estrous and menstrual cycle can affect some data of interest, so still controlling for these during female oriented studies will be still be important. 

edit: i was annoyed at the 'journals were more likely to publish using significant findings' portion. no shit. it's near impossible to publish null result unless you take use it as a means to refine your hypothesis. v.v
