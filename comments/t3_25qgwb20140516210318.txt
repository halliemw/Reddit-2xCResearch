Anyone else getting seriously nasty PM's from throwaways after commenting about this? I won't bother you with the whole thing but whomever said to me, 

"The only thing of value about you is that stinky cunt between your legs. You should leave reddit to the men and get your gross subreddit off our home page [...] There's no default men's sub [...]  Please don't post about your itchy vag. Or how we're supposed to sympathize about your ovaries. Or some nonexistant hurdle you crossed because you're a woman." 

is obviously forgetting the small fact that 90% of reddit is a male-dominated space, including every other default sub.

the poor menz
