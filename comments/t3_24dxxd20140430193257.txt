As a medical coder, I agree with the advice given.  Are you positive it was denied due to the diagnosis code?  If so, as previously stated, the billing entity in the office is able to review the medical history and provide another diagnosis.  Before just taking a shot in the dark with diagnoses x, y and z - they should research your insurance companies policies and what is a "covered diagnosis".  

Another possibility is that there was no authorization obtained.  Yes she is seeing an in network provider but for services such as therapy, they 9/10 times require a preauth.  For example, my boyfriend had back surgery in November.  Part of his post-op course included PT and the office failed to obtain an auth.  They tried to bill us for the services even though the fault clearly lied with them.  They obtained a retro-authorization and resubmitted the claims which were then paid.  The company could have even obtained authorization but failed to indicate the auth number on the claim itself.  

There are a large number of reasons it could have been denied.  Please obtain the denial code from your EOB or directly from a customer service rep.  That will give you a better idea of how to proceed or what advice people can give you.    Please feel free to shoot me a message if I can help in any way.
