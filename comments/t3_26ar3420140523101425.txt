Depending on when your contract with the army expires, how about a compromise that you get your sleeve once you find a new job? That will give you the opportunity to establish yourself in your new career and get your tattoo, and (assuming you getting a job is his only real opposition) your SO's fears are moot because you would already have a job and not be judged on the sleeve.
