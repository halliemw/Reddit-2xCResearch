A few years ago, while I was living with my parents (I was about 26 and had just finished student teaching), we got a phone call at midnight on the landline. Midnight phone calls on the landline are never, never good.

My mother's best friend had hung herself. Her husband called my mom before even calling the police. I got in the car with my mother and we went over to the house.

The police were just arriving as we were. The husband was sitting at the kitchen table and seemed remarkably lucid for a few hours, crying only a little and even offering us drinks and the bathroom. I sat there, feeling numb and out of place. I looked at her kids, two young high schoolers just like some of those in the classes I was teaching. They'd been the ones who'd found their mother.

As the hours passed, it settled in to the husband that his wife was gone, and gone by her own choice. He suddenly started asking questions, the most common one being "Why?" I watched while the police kept milling around and my mother calmly offering words like, "She didn't do this to hurt you, it's not your fault." I said nothing.

Finally, I knew I had to say something. "The pain is blinding. You see nothing outside of yourself. No future, no other people, no consequences." It's hard for people who have not undergone such severe depression to fathom such a mindset. I don't know if my words helped or hurt, but I think they helped him to understand.
