Just look at the statistics, Canada and Britain have universal healthcare but they are 3 to 4 times more deaths than Iceland.

I don't think its "Evil Conservatives" conspiring to kill women, considering 50% of Republicans are woman themselves. Also interestingly enough, parents that have daughters are far more likely to become conservative. 

I don't believe universal healthcare is a right, I don't think you have a right to someone else service. And I think as a nation we should have only spend what we have money for. We are already trillions in debt, I think its time as a nation we became more fiscally responsible. 

**edit** 50% of this country doesn't believe that health care is a right. Yet everyone here loves to down vote me isn't a part of reddit that we can have tolerance for other ideas? Or is this supposed to be an echo chamber.
