> please let us have just this one sub where we can speak like we do with our friends.

I just realized that this is exactly what I've been trying to get across in all the meta threads where I have expressed my disappointment with the default change.  At TwoXChromosomes we discuss topics as a group of friends do.  I don't know how men discuss things with each other, but in my experience, women friends are very supportive.  

When a friend tells me a story, shows me a picture, asks me a question, my first instinct is always to first validate and support her.  I don't try to challenge her views, or invalidate her feelings and experiences.  Even if I disagree with her, I will first validate her before offering an alternate perspective if she is looking for it.  I won't say "You should not have gotten angry with your husband for that."  Instead I might say:  "I can totally see why that would make you angry, I've felt the same way when...  Have you considered that maybe ...."  With a few exceptions, this has always been my experience when interacting with women friends.

A lot of people who are challenging those of us who want to keep this a predominantly female space are accusing us of just wanting an "echo chamber" for our opinions.  That we are afraid to have our opinions challenged.  Personally, I love a good debate and if I want one, I'll seek it elsewhere.  The role that TwoXChromosomes had on reddit was not to educate or challenge perceptions.  It was to be a place where women can talk to each other like they do with their friends.
