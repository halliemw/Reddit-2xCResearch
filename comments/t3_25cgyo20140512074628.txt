Your content isn't "thoughtful" (see siderules). You can raise issues without making massive generalisations or being entirely dismissive. If there's a big difference between genders, we don't just shrug our shoulders as if to say, "whatever". The answer is to question *why* the difference exists, and is it something that should be challenged? How should it be challenged? You're being downvoted for offering nothing helpful, then get dismissive of the "ladies" because we insist you add something more thoughtful than tiredly repeating stereotypes that we're well aware off.
