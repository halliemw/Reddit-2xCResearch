>Perhaps it's more a case of going up to a friend after their house was actively burned down by a pyromaniac and saying, "well what the fuck were you thinking owning a stove?"

Maybe closer would be a defective stove made by a negligent and malicious person. The stove exploded and burned your house down. NOT normal behavior for a stove. Whether you left it on or not. But for some reason, your exploding stove was your fault because it's easier to assume that you could have prevented the stove exploding if you had just been better. Much easier than worrying about what it could mean if perfectly ordinary stoves can explode regardless of your behavior. And maybe we should look more into making sure stoves don't explode, not deciding that the stories where the stove was left off and then exploded are tragedies while stories where the stove was left ON and exploded, the person was just asking for it.
