Similar restrictions in Indiana kept a friend of mine from having an abortion.  She was told that she had to come in for initial consultation, have an ultrasound where they can hear the heartbeat, then come back 2 days later. This was for a first trimester medical abortion.  She was struggling anyway and knowing that she would have to go through all this kept her from having the procedure.  Now she is having a baby she doesn't want and can't afford all alone.  5 he father is a psycho and won't allow an adoption at all.
