Thank you. I do appreciate views from both sides, but it's so crazily dealt with I have no ability to learn. He then complains that I'm not doing enough and he needs to train me, then lists off, again, how much stuff he has to do and he doesn't have the time to go over it with me.

I told him upfront in the interview "I have no law office experience. You will have to train me." And he told me he liked the idea of molding someone into his style. Then he complains I don't know anything.

I also found a stack of resumes he received a few months earlier, but for some reason he didn't hire any of the people who were VASTLY more qualified than I was. It is a confusing atmosphere.
