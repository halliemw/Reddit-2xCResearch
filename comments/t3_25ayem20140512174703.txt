That's really true, I've never thought about it like that. You definitely never hear the opposite case - it's always the person who didn't want to changing their mind and going for it. 

I've definitely softened toward it over the years, but neither me nor my husband has any real interest, and you're right - what *really* are the odds of us suddenly having a change of heart?
