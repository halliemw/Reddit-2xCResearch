Really? We just got cheaper birth control but they're closing health centers left and right. I doubt they'd allow a good chunk of women to take off for their cramps. 

I've had to call out because of cramps before. Mine used to be debilitating (new birth control. Makes me gain weight like crazy, but I'm sane and not in pain.) I called my supervisor one morning, a couple hours before I was scheduled and told her that I wouldn't be able to come in. When she asked why not and I told her, she laughed at me. "Really? You're not coming in because of your *period*? Mine was last week and I was here every day." There are still people out there who believe that cramps aren't a real thing/are as serious as some of us say.
