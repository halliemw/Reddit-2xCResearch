Good note about the hymen. If you aren't sure if yours is "broken" or not (horseback and bike riding are common ways hymen will "break") then there is a possibility you might bleed a little. Make sure he knows ahead of time too so he doesn't flip out. You might even want to put a towel down just in case.
