Rape happens, why can't he write about it?  I think it would be dishonest to portray every sexual encounter as being emotionally healthy and with enthusiastic consent.  Sex isn't that way all the time now, and it CERTAINLY wasn't hundreds of years ago.  Can you elaborate why you think it is a product of rape culture and not a product of the time period in which his book is set?
