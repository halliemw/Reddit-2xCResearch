I also had horrible pain during insertion.  Screaming and crying pain.  It was fairly uncomfortable for the first day.  My doctor prescribed a super powered naproxen (I think called aponaproxen) which REALLY worked.  It lasted for 12 hours.  It's considerably stronger than ibuprofen.  You may want to consider asking for that.  It really saved me in the pain department.  

It did get better after a cycle or two!
