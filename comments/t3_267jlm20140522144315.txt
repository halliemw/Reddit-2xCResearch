I agree about the possibility of this church being a cult. It may not be classified as a cult, but there are many aggressively conservative churches out there that do harm. Possibly have her suggest that they try out a different less conservative church together. Christianity is not what this guy is perceiving it to be. Many churches are completely fine with non-Christians attending or marriages that are made up of two different religions. It just takes some research to find them.
