Some very simple home defenses are things like wind chimes that look inconspicuous, but will rattle when the window is moved. Also yeah, start shutting your window if at all possible. I don't know what your bylaws and stuff are there so I can't advise you on the legality or prudence of active defensive (nails on windowsills, etc) but passive stuff that makes noise, makes people think the house is occupied, help a lot. Even down to a piece of string tied across the top of the window that will trip anyone trying to get in.
