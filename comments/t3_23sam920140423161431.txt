You sign a contract when you get married. That's kind of the point; for the government to recognize your union, and the privileges and responsibilities you gain with it. If you haven't signed a contract with someone (not married), then as far as the law is concerned, you're just two strangers. I think having the kind of relationship where both people are on the same page is extremely important and valuable. But it gets dangerous if you try to bring the law in between two people who do not have that legally-binding contract with one another. A father can be anything from a committed partner in a LTR, to a man who only met the mother one time, at conception. If a father is required to cover an abortion, for example, then wouldn't it be reasonable to require a woman to provide a written consent form before having the procedure? But of course we do not want to live in a world like that. We do not want to require a man's legal consent for a woman to do *anything.* The necessary consequence is that men are not held to any of the responsibilities/privileges concerning parenthood. Unless, once again, there is a marriage contract, which is entered into purposefully and willingly.

Edit: Except for child support. Which does not require a man to "consent" to fatherhood. Which is problematic, but done to save the government money.
