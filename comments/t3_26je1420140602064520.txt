According to Google, thejournal.ie had [published an article](http://www.thejournal.ie/tuam-mass-grave-babies-1488267-May2014/) about it as well, and since the Irish Central piece other news about it has also appeared [on the RTE site](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0530/620665-tuam-babies-grave/), [the Irish Independent site](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/church-to-meet-over-memorial-for-800-babies-at-mass-grave-30321303.html), and [the Irish Examiner site](http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/call-for-inquiry-into-mother-and-baby-home-deaths-632129.html). Maybe other places too, of course, this is just what I found on Google. If you're from Ireland, have you seen a lot of news still about this since the story broke? Since a government minister has by now commented on it, I guess there must have been some?
