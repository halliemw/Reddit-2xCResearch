I think it's so bizarre that *female* body hair is seen as masculine. To me, my armpit/leg/etc. hair is feminine. My boyfriend really digs that I let my body hair grow out. Occasionally, I'll get my vulva waxed, but my bush always stays, for the most part. I shaved my legs once last year, and haven't shaved my pits in over a year. The more I go like that, the less I give a fuck. I'm absolutely mystified that people get offended by what I choose to do with my own body hair. It's such a blatant double standard. It's absurd that a person would have a completely different reaction to a picture of an armpit based on who they thought it belonged to.
