For the period you had 14 days ago, was there a lot of bleeding? The reason I'm asking is because 14 days is usually the number of days between ovulation and your period, and what you might have experienced was ovulation "spotting" (light bleeding). People say that your cycles get normal by early 20s but my experience has been that it takes way longer than that for some girls, but if you are consistently having irregular cycles then you should probably get it checked.
