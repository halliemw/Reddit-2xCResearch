Which means that speaking up and speaking out is a major risk.  And it's the kind of risk many of us should take.

I learned a long time ago (through a variety of learning experiences) that if no woman's voice is heard in the workplace/classroom/etc., women as a group become more and more silent.  At the risk of sounding [insert negative term here] I promised myself I'd use my voice, early, often and consistently (and I so appreciate the other women in my life who do the same thing).  

I find that people forget the foolish things I've said (and that others have said) in light of persistently trying to say accurate, well-reasoned things.  It's never easy, it's always about learning more, thinking more.  Right now, there's a woman (just a bit younger than me) who is *so* articulate and well-spoken in the workplace (she's always been that way, but has really upped her game to near-perfection in the last 7 years, it's been amazing to watch) that I am consistently in awe of her.  I'm learning from her (I'm also learning to rely on her just a little, to be the best speaker on almost any topic - something I need to be aware of, she may not always be there, I need to learn to do what she does).
