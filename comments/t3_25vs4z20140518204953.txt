A human body is made for whatever its owner wants it to do. Using a uterus is merely optional and it's okay to never do it and to be tocophobic - childbirth, while "natural" is a disgusting, painful process that is extremely unpleasant and can be life- and health-threatening. 

For the record, I have been raped when I was 19, which resulted in a pregnancy scare. I considered stabbing myself in the abdomen because I'm that repulsed by pregnancy. I'm not "made to be" a walking incubator, and neither are you. You don't owe children to anyone.
