It sounds like he wanted to go see a cool thing with a bunch of people he liked, and perhaps started talking before he had really thought it through. It's not out of line for you to request that he check with you before changing up your planned dates. I get where you're coming from being upset, since this was a special thing he was taking you out on. It sounds like its just a case of foot-in-mouth on his part.
