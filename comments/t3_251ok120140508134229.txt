Full Disclosure:  Not a long-time member of this sub, and also a dude (though one who considers himself a feminist).  

/r/AskScience and /r/AskHistorians managed decently, with the help of a robust and aggressive mod community.  This may be what the mods here are thinking of.  But I agree with you actually, this is a totally different situation because of the sensitive topics discussed in subs like this.  Also, there's the history of women's conversations being taken-over, beaten-down and over-run by men when they get the chance.  

Also, it's a well known phenomenon on Reddit that the larger a sub gets, the more its quality suffers.  Subs with a niche focus either eventually get drug down by low effort content, or have to work like hell just to maintain a minimum of decent content (with a drop still happening).  Look at ELI5.  It's become pretty much just /r/AskReddit now.  The responses have none of the humor or charm of the old ELI5.

Some subs work as defaults.  Some don't.  Some really should only be visited by those who take the time to seek them out.  What will the 50%+ of male Reddit users get by being automatically subscribed here?  It's a space *for women*.  Putting everyone in it by default defeats the whole purpose and just turns it into Reddit's "woman zoo" as I saw a user here put it.  

Finally, if the majority of the community is against it, I don't see the value in continuing with the idea.  Good luck to you all.
