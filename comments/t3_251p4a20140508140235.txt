I (male) am of the expectation that when I go to the front page without logging in, I will most likely not visit posts from many of the default subreddits. That's what accounts are for. That being said, I feel as though a subreddit exclusively for women is not a necessarily good thing, especially without espousing the notion of equality on the other front-- why is /r/askmen or other male-related subreddits not a default if this is the case? I would be okay with xx being a default if there was a balance, but as /u/supershinyface puts it, it's relegating the entirety of women as a special needs group. It is the only subreddit on the defaults that *automatically excludes a population* (same reason I didn't like /r/atheism on the front page)-- there's a very very low probability that your average male will visit xx, while visiting any of the other defaults is more of a choice. I do not like the fact that we are patronizing the minority of women in this way-- it says that reddit thinks women on reddit are a pity case, or we are elevating them to a higher level of popularity. Either remove xx from the defaults, or include a male equivalent. 


It also appears that the regulars in xx were quite attached to it. You mods are abandoning a community for the publicity-- or "selling out" for popularity, as I see it.
