Honestly I am 21 and have never had a bad experience just because I am a woman. I think a lot of this time on this sub you see the bad experiences because they don't happen so often and need to be pointed out more. I'm not even going to try and give you parenting advice but just know that a lot of things you see on here aren't every day occurrences for all women.
