Unfortunately I have to agree. What might be best for both of you is for you to tell him "hey, I have to work through some issues and try to improve myself/my life, but it's best for both of us if I do this alone". You can explain that you do want to be with him, but that it has to be after you've gotten yourself together. That emotional state is terrible for you, and you're abusing him for something he didn't do. If he truly cares, he'll understand.

Also, good for you for acknowledging what's going on. For what it's worth, I'm proud of you. All that's left is to keep moving forward.
