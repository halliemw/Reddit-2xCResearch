That really doesn't mean a thing.  Some people are just bad test takers.  Boys included.  In addition, it has always been my position that girls simply don't care when it comes to science because they are discouraged by just about every single TV show, peer and family member they get in contact with, every step of the way.  Girls are still being groomed as wives, even if we want to think differently, they are.  Little girls still get toy kitchens and washing machines for their birthdays, instead of telescopes.  They are still conditioned from age 0.  And the person giving the gift is not even being an ass, because that is the general vision/perception of girls from the get go: that they will grow up to be someone's wife, and someone's mom, and we better get them their little toy kitchen so they can be trained and conditioned, despite all the accomplishment.  Why dream of being an astronaut and fight all the way, every day, with family disappointment, and face unjust competition, misogyny, suspicion (like yours), and have to prove yourself 400 times more than a man would have to, when you can just get married and make everyone happily shut up?  That is the *only* reason.
