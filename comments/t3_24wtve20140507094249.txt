You're welcome. I feel your pain on the job hunt, I'm in a similar situation and the prospect of looking again seems daunting. As much as work at the job I need to leave can be painful, I keep on reminding myself that it's easier to get a job if you already have one or had one very recently. 

You're still in a better place than you were before. Best of luck to you!
