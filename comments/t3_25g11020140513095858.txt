Unfortunately, in persuasive arguments, tone is everything. It can make or break a good position, regardless of its informativeness. No disrespect to the position itself, but this piece most likely won't convert anyone who isn't already leaning toward agreement with the speaker. It tries to sound sympathetic to white men, but comes off as patronizing.
