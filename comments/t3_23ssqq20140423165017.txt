You're more than welcome, it's really no trouble at all! :) Sometimes just the conformation that you are being heard can make all the difference! 

But it's the first time YOU are dealing with this situation, and that makes these feelings new and difficult and stressful. Never invalidate your feelings, they are yours and no one can feel those feelings but you!

I am so glad you are going to have a chat with your ex, and that you've thought of a couple of friends you could confide in, another thought I had, perhaps you could speak to your doctor, about the realities, perhaps talking to a medical professional would be helpful to you, to know the facts about actually being pregnant... I don't know but I like facts! 

Writing in your journal sounds like a good mechanism!
