I think they're a wonderful solution, when they're done right. For example, the kids in my boyfriend's old school didn't have to buy their clothes from the same place. There are many places that sell button downs and navy blue corduroys, which means there were many options, and you could have your button down taken in or whatever you needed. My SO is not an average sized man, and as high schoolers, he and his brother were both over 6'5" and under 180 pounds. They were tall and lanky and awkward looking, but they could buy whatever size they needed from wherever they wanted as long as it didn't have a logo on it or the logo could be taken off. One of his old friends is a very petite girl, around 5'1", and she could buy what fit her while her best friend, who is around 5'9" I think and on the heavier side could buy what fit her. It wasn't going to be the cutest, sexiest outfit for anyone, but it wasn't terrible.

And in places where school crime and rival gangs are problems, uniforms are fantastic because they make it easier to identify outsiders who don't belong in the school and make it easier to keep kids from wearing gang colors to school.
