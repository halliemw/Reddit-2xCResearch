I would try to "lure" her in with things that she's interested in. Like say she likes horses. Start reading books about horses. Then maybe say I was thinking about going riding next week, would you like to come? Or something similar. There's a new (insert thing), I wanted to check out. Do you want to come? Or I got this new facial stuff, want to try it out with me? Or Michaels and craft stores have cool classes like cake decorating, crocheting, etc. That would be a fun time to bond. Plus crafts are something you can bring home and continue to do together.

If she gets one on one time with you and can bond without feeling threatened by your husband loving you or betraying her mom, then maybe she would be less likely to act out. It's also difficult to be mean to be people that you like spending time with, but if she hasnt had the chance maybe she doesn't know.
