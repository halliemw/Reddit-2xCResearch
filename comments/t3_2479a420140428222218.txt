It's important that we situate this in the context of a civil debate where feminists are, presumably, trying to convince others of the merits of their cause because those are the types of situations where offhand generalizations do the most damage.

The issue is the prejudice involved, as in "prejudgement." If you're trying to sell me on the evils of catcalling, and I don't catcall, it's very easy for me to say "But I don't do that" and shut the conversation down. This becomes especially likely if you keep lumping me in with men who do by saying "men" when you mean "men who catcall." Even if 75% of all men catcall, it is still wrong to assume that because any particular man catcalls in the same way it is wrong to assume that all women gossip or all black people like fried chicken. People should be judged on their own merits, not their external characteristics.

While this might seem academic, I don't think it is. Because, on a personal level, I know that feminists don't mean *all men* when they make their arguments. But I still get a little annoyed when I see it done. If you're irritating someone who is familiar with the debate and knows what you mean, imagine what it looks like to someone who doesn't and how they might feel about it. Keeping in mind that those are the people you're trying to persuade.
