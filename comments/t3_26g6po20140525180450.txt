Except he also made many comments showing disbelief as to why women didn't want him - he'd say things about his cheekbones and his appearance and how he's a perfect gentleman etc etc.  He did appear to think he was some gift to women, but women were all such stupid bitches they unbelievably went with other, inferior, men.

He wanted to put all women into a concentration camp, and stand above them on a giant tower and look down on them, enjoying the view of them starving to death.   God-like fantasies.
