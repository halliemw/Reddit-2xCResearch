[This](http://imgur.com/G77k3g5,F64GEtW#1) Is after 6/7 washes including a baking soda one. 

 I do like the pastel pink color idea but not sure how well that will go down at work. It was ok when I had my dark hair since it looked red (somehow red is ok) 
 
But I have just bought silver shampoo to combat the yellow. and I think I may leave it for a while.

Thank you for all of your advice.
