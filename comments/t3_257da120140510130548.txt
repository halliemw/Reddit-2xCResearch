Personally, I wouldn't consider that much of an age difference, really. Enough for some age gap taboo to make the relationship a little spicier, but definitely not large enough to turn many heads. The only thing I would predict from the listed ages is that there will probably be maturity disparities here and there, which you've confirmed. But five years while you're in your twenties isn't a strange or impossible thing.
