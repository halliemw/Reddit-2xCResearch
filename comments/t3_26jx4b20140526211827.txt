I tried for over a year to get the police to listen to me and now they just flat-out ignore me. I even have a letter from the Chief of Police telling me, more or less, to just fuck off. 

So yeah, don't be afraid or ashamed to talk about what happened to you, but be prepared to be blacklisted by your local law enforcement for speaking up.
