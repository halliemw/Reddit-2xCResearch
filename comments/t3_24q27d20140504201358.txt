So you've dropped your *life-long* male friends and alienated your male coworkers because of your boyfriend's jealousy. And you're wondering why you have no friends?

Your boyfriend has issues. Stop making his issues your issues. Because I can guarantee I wouldn't be friends with someone who would up & drop life-long friends or treat people badly because of an SO, and I suspect many women feel the same.
