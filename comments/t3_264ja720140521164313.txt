What was the diagnosis for the yeast infection? Was it Candida Albicans or did they not specify?

There's another fungal infection responsible for roughly 5-10% of yeast infections called Candida Glabrata.  The symptoms are exactly the same but traditional yeast treatments have ZERO effect. The infection is resistant to Azole treatments. Some people can go improperly diagnosed for years. It can infect **vaginally**, on your **skin**, scalp, throat etc... 

There's a few treatment methods. The first is boric acid for two weeks, the second is 3-6 months of nystatin. The third is treatment is given by IV but you'll want to avoid it. 

I had a year of misdiagnosis, untreatable yeast infections. Finally a culture turned up C. Glabrata. I did a multiple week treatment of boric acid and it's been gone for a long time. 


It's worth checking out, researching and making a trip back to your doctor. I hope this helps.
