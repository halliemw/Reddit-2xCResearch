This article is not sexist because it points out the imbalance of our expectations for men and women in the workplace. It is sexist because it implies that the problem is the fault of female doctors who choose to take career hits and work less to take care of their family. That really is a gross oversimplification of the issue. Even though the article identifies other exacerbating factors that are causing doctor shortages in the United States, it is clear that the author is placing most of the onus on women in the profession. 

Also, I really wouldn't say it is "socially acceptable" for women to take time off to take care of their family. They pay for it in spades just as men do by passing up on career advancement, and society is very quick to judge them for making that choice (as evidenced by this article). It is just more socially acceptable for women to want to make that choice; whereas men are judged harshly if they prioritize their family at the expense their career.
