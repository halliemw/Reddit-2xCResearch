I'd ignore it until you have something more concrete than a Hallmark worthy IM.  He knows you're in a loving, committed relationship and you've made sure there is no mistaking that.  You can always invent an appropriate anecdote about how a friend insists on disrespecting you and your relationship with your BF by continuously flirting with you and how you have severed the friendship as a result.  You can get your point across without ever giving him the chance to say that you misunderstood.
