I'm really disappointed in that post and it's tone. I'm not happy that there are users who were dishonest like that, but I'm even less happy that the admins seem to have completely dismissed the issue and publicly discredited the subs complainers like that. It's reddit, that comment had already been linked to from other places. Is this the pro-women attention the mods wanted to bring here?
