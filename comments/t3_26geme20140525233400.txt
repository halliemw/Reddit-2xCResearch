I totally get what you mean because I have the opposite problem. Due to a thyroid disorder, I've gotten extremely skinny, and I've been told so many times that "I'd look a lot more attractive if I ate a bit more." I have a damn thyroid problem man, you really think it's okay to say that? It wouldn't be okay even if I didn't have a medical condition. Ugh it makes me so angry. I hate that some people think it's okay to call someone skinny. It could be equally as hurtful. Internet hugs to you and all the women who have had to hear things about their weight :/
