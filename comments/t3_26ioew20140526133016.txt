Be real with yourself and don't let others define who you are. Speaking as a queer person, I went through highschool being told that my identity was invalid because it wasn't just "lesbian". You know yourself better than anyone else. Surrounding yourself with people who make you comfortable and people who are accepting and kind to you.  Know that you deserve to be happy and confident at all times.
