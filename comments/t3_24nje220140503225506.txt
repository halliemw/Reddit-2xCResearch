My sisters and I all started puberty earlier than most girls. My older sister (who got boobs in 4th grade) and I had our periods when we were 11, and my little sister got her period when she was 9 (poor thing)! All I would say is make sure she is prepared emotionally, and once she gets her period, physically; I had WAY too many traumatizing experiences with leaking through my underwear, pants, the thing I used to cover up the stain on my pants, the thing I used to cover up on that. . . you get the picture. 

It fucking sucked, and I had NO idea how to handle it at that age. I was so embarrassed. So yeah, I would just say make sure she's got everything she needs, including the confidence to stand up to the people commenting on her changing appearance! I started getting pubic hair when I was 9 or 10, and I wish someone had been there to tell me not to be ashamed of it! It would probably be nice for her to have a person she can feel comfortable asking questions/generally talking to about anything she's experiencing.

I hope this helps!
