Earning potential is *a* factor, as is reproductive ability, but their importance is different for different people. The simplest explanation for OP's situation is that men are less likely to view giving up a career as an option because it's modeled and expected less in society, in legal, educational, political, and economic realms. OP probably feels guilty for the same reason--women are more expected to shape their careers to having and raising children.
