Wow, I never thought that this stuff actually happens. This is so bizarre that it's almost comical.

You... may want to have a heart to heart talk with your mother. Preface it that you want to sit down and talk. Most likely, she will think that you're "coming out of the closet". Then when she's expecting you to come out as gay, say that you *really* were just trying out a new hair look and just liked rocking the pixie cut - which does not mean that you're gay. Tell her that it's starting to annoy you that she's making assumptions just based on your looks. 

If that doesn't convince her, then say that if you *were* gay, that you would tell her. It's just that you're not.
