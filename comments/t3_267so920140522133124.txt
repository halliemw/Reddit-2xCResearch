I could maybe cut out dairy if I find probiotics aren't helping with the pooch (I'll keep taking them regardless though) because then I know it's less a bacterial/digestive issue and more a food one. I don't eat much bread at all, I eat like maybe 3-5 slices per week, sometimes less, and it's always brown bread - not that it matters! But I don't think I could cut out carbs completely, maybe reduce them if cutting dairy doesn't work out. It'd probably be a little hard to cut all dairy out though, because I do love some cheese every now and then. Haha. :(
