I am went through much of the same as you are now, very recently as this past Christmas. 

It took a long time to get over him the first time. When I had gone a few years without hearing from him, he came back out of the blue and picked up right where we left off. Big mistake. 

History repeated itself basically. I'm sorry that you put in most of the effort only to see it crumble in your hands. I know it hurts so damn much, but the best you can do honestly is forget him entirely (as if you could right? But you have to...), and make the most of the situation as best you can. The Netherlands is where you're going? That's amazing. I wish I could go over there. 

I guarantee when you find love again he'll come back to try to haunt you, but I hope you have the strength to deny him. I didn't deny my ex when it happened to me and I regret it. I was foolish. I was destroyed all over again. Don't you be foolish like me as well. You seem like you have a lot of genuine love to give. Don't you waste any more of it on him. He seems selfish and a coward to do that to you. 

It sucks. It hurts. But don't try to salvage it. It's not worth your time. Don't send that present. Send it to someone else who may appreciate it as much. Sell it. Don't contact him anymore.

Your heart tells you there's hope, but I hope my words reach there and your brain.
