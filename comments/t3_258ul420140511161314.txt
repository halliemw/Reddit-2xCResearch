Read an article a while ago that said encouraging teens to use condoms as balloons, toys in general, was a fantastic aid to sex ed, because the kids developed the habit of opening condoms. Got used to how the feel, what the look like, everything. The significance of muscle memory is huge! The result was that the condoms were normalized, everyone had seen them many times before needing to use one, and so they weren't intimidating. More teens at that school used condoms, and used them every time, compared to other schools in the district.

So we should give middl schoolers piles of condoms to play with, I think.
