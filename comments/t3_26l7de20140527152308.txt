Do you have any hair cutting academies in your city? I've had really good luck with them. I like this because the student *has* to make you happy or they won't pass. The student does the cut and then has it approved by a teacher. It's also a lot cheaper. 

This may not be what you're looking for because you're already frustrated, but I just wanted to let you know of another option. :)

The place I go is called Tony & Guy; I think they're nation-wide so you may be able to find one or something similar near you.
