I am working full time and going to graduate school, the truth: my house looks like hoarders live here. I keep my kitchen clean and do my laundry that is it. I keep thinking what if I have an emergency or get sick and somebody has to come in the house, they will be distracted by the mess. I decided today I will just putter for an hour in one room so I don't feel overwhelmed.
