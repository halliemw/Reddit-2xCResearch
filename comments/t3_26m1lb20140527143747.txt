Those are all great points and I can see how calling out casual sexism amongst my friends and in conversation can help make an impact. I disagree with the point about "I wouldn't date of woman who does..." You pretty much said it a few points down about "people have a right to choose who they're attracted to". What someone finds attractive or not is their business alone and they should feel free to not settle with anybody. Whether or not they can actually find someone who they are satisfied with is an entirely different story. For example, I find large gauges in earlobes unattractive. It doesn't make sexist. It's just a preference.
