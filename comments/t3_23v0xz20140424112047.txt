i would call a 50 year old guy who tries to pressure a 22 year old woman he met in a parking lot to lunch creepy. who does that? not normal people. people aren't just inspired to give strangers career advice. he was definitely hitting on you and definitely ignoring your boundaries. 30+ year older guys pressuring you to accept a date in a parking lot is DEFINITELY CREEPY.
