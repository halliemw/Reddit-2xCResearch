DonÂ´t worry about it. At least you took my sniping with ladylike grace.

I think I should start adding some sort of disclamer in front of my texts.

 A la "this is my own personal opinion of something or other. While reading this, please keep that in mind, that this is MY opinion and no one else is in no way obligated to think the same or agree with it. I also respect that others may feel differently about it and I am completely fine with that."

That was not directed at you personally, just a random thought I had.
