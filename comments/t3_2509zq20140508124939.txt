>Your criticism can be honest but if you're saying that intersectionality is not a part of this subreddit then you should be honestly corrected... 

"Corrected" implies that my opinion is wrong. Telling someone "no, you're wrong" is not how you have a discussion. If you disagree with me, feel free to state that, but don't tell me I'm wrong. This isn't a fringe opinion I have here, others agree with me.

Furthermore, downvoting me to hell is not a good way to show someone that honest opinions are allowed here. The reality isâ€¦ they aren't allowed here. Anytime you say something against the norm, you're downvoted. All I'm looking for is honest discussion, and my voice is silenced.

>It came off as you saying discussions on racism aren't welcome in a gender erlated subreddit, as if the two can be separated.

My point was more general than that. What I'm trying to say is that this subreddit *does* have some issues, and that the majority of the users are completely unwilling to discuss them. Even worse yet, the moderators remove posts discussing these problems. Everyone downvotes and dissent, and passes it off as trolling.
