I get what you're saying, but the phrase "Do you really want to start messing with your genitals without medical guidance" is just a little funny to me...I mean, it's just the hymen. It's not like I want it to look a certain way or if it tears it'll leave a big hideous scar or something. It's pretty much there to get stretched, and if it gets torn, well, lots of women get theirs torn and it just heals up for them.
