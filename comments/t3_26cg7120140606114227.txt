x2!!! Bless your heart, OP. Sometimes we just freeze in the moment. Please don't beat yourself up over it. I'm sorry that so many people were unsupportive after your original post. The lack of empathy from a few of those who responded was terrible to see in the comments, especially at a time when you were vulnerable and reaching out for help.
