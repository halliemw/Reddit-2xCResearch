> She can just show up to the wedding if she wants.

NOPE. Anyone reading this, please GOD do not do this, unless you mean "just showing up" to the ceremony and not the reception.

>  I just think if you are a good enough friend that you really believe you are supposed to have been invited, this isn't a big deal, and would be resolved easily.

It probably will be when OP calls and the bride learns that the invite never made it to OP. However, people get very wary of stepping on toes and breaches of etiquette when it comes to weddings, hence OP asking.
