GO. Go go go.  Go.  I can't say this enough.  This is a huge opportunity for you, and you should take it. Your niece and nephew will miss you, and will look forward to those skype dates and visits when possible, but they're old enough to understand why you have to go.  Just explain to them why you have to go, and all of the things you're going to do to keep in touch and look after them from afar, and that visiting will definitely happen.
