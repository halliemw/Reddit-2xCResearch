I agree with this. It sucks to think I need his permission to see him, but I pretty much need permission to see anyone.

Will be moving on to med school in August in another city nearby, which is well enough away from home to gain independence. But my bf is just most bummed about this summer, where I am completely free but can only really see him really once a week for a few hours probably. And this is after a year apart where we only saw each other every 3 months when I came home for break. I understand why he's so frustrated :( I would be too if I was dating someone with the same restrictions.
