I had a LEEP in late October of last year, and I remember having light, period like bleeding for 5-6 weeks after.  There is a lot of scabbing on your cervix, it is going to take a good while for things to return back to normal.  I doubt that the bleeding you are experiencing is your period, but I am a stranger on the internets, I'm not you, and I'm not a medical professional.

I also tried having sex before my doctor said it was okay to do so.  OMG.  Do not have sex..
