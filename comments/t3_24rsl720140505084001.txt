For me, it was pleasant and it was kind of nice doing it for the first time with a guy I was in a relationship with if only because it made it kind of a big step in the relationship trust-wise and physically (also his first time). At the same time, I've had friends who lost theirs to a friend with benefits (she regrets this only because he was an asshole and he had no real interest in her pleasure) and one night stands/friends that they slept with starting with when they lost their virginity, which none of them have mentioned regretting and several of them have specifically mentioned enjoying. There's no right way to do it, and the only wrong way is to do it with someone who doesn't respect you and who doesn't care about whether you feel good or not. It's going to be a little awkward and you'll probably end up laughing about parts of it, but it shouldn't be painful. Don't expect to orgasm, because usually nerves and everything get in the way. If they don't and you do, that's awesome, but don't feel like you have to. Also make sure you have lots of foreplay so you're wet and stretched out, and don't be afraid to use lube if you need it. Plenty of women do, especially with condoms. Of course, use a condom, and put a little extra lube inside it. That tends to increase sensation for him and prevents tearing, so it's a win-win situation. And most of all, have fun. Sex and losing your virginity is only what you make it, so if you want to do it, do it.
