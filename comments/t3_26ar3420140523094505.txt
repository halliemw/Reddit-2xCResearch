Thank you! These are my thoughts exactly, but as someone else pointed out, I don't want to be completely dismissive of my husband's feelings. I just feel that this is a kind of a subject where his personal preference shouldn't even come into play in the decision. 

As for your decision, not every tattoo has to mean something, but I love the ones that do! I think when you find something that means a tremendous amount to you, the inspiration you need for your piece will come to you, and it will be perfect.

I promise I'm going to do my research about the shop I go to, and the artist's work! But good lookin' out! Thanks!
