Hey mate! I had a daughter 10 months ago. Those first few months were tough. But once she passed the "everything will break me" stage, it's become kinda fun. 

So far as raising her, yeah, a lot of guys have taken this idea of "be a dick, to toughen her up against guys". How fucked is that? I mean, to send her into the world thinking guys are all dicks... when in reality, girls can be just as heartless. 

Teach her all the stuff you know. Who says girls have to be prissy all the time? And I'm not talking about that pseudo-tough girl Crap, where a girl drinks hard liquor and drives a pink truck. She should know how to change a tire, and her own oil by the time she can drive. She should know better than to start a fight, but definitely know how to end one. And she should know how to use the right tool for the right job. And spot when a mechanic is lying to her. And how to low-ball an offer... and how to avoid being low-balled. And how to throw a ball. And can you imagine being the guy who gets with a girl who can grill a killer burger?
