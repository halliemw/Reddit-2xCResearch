It saddens me that this is just some 'rapist, meth head' who should just have his life ended, to you. That man was a human being. A sick human being. Suffering from substance abuse and probably mental health issues.

Here's what we should be doing. Paying more taxes. Paying more taxes so that guys like this can be treated by physicians, have access to proper substance abuse treatment programs and be regularly supervised by trained professionals.

Given that, situations like this would not arise.

I can't believe you live in a society, so fearful of it's own shadow, that you must carry deadly weapons at all times. THAT is the problem, you're just seeing the results.
