Honestly, I believe that I see a lot of confirmation bias when trolls are confronted with events that contest their assumptions. Maybe some people are going to think when presented with the new evidence, but I think for a lot of them, it reinforces the reasons for why they attacked in the first place. 

Regardless, it is affecting content. The content anti-women users see that they do not like is being removed from view, so it's getting forced through a different sort of filter.
