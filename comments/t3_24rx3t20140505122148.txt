I actually think it's more like attempts to make "socialism" sound bad than "liberal". Both feminism and socialism are positions that aim to put people on equal footing, and both get demonized in nonsensical ways, such that even identifying as them paints you as some kind of radical. Like . . . being "liberal" is considered okay to liberals, but feminism and socialism are considered dirty words by *both* sides. 

Which is ridiculous. Universal healthcare, welfare, public transit, etc., are all socialist programs and Democrats should be proud to be socialist, not hiding from the word. Same goes for feminism. Being pro-equality is bad because . . . ?
