> Virginity is something of a hot commodity these days

Ugh, this is why virginity can be such a damaging concept. 

Women's sexualities are not commodities and the "value" doesn't change based on how much someone has sex.

If your celibate, that's awesome. If you have sex six times a day, that's awesome.
