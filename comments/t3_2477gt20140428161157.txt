I am going to patriot what  /u/Nailpolished and /u/bubbleoffplumb have said and add a bit more.

If you want to be in the relationship with this fellow, then get rid of the cat. I don't know what he was thinking getting you a cat if he was allergic: this seems really shortsighted to me. 

Else leave the relationship. I seems to me like there are other problems and from your wording it sounds like you're already checking out of the relationship to some degree.
