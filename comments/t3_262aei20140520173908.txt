Hey, I don't think I've seen it mentioned here yet, but abortions at 24 or 26 weeks are *never* done as a "well I had unprotected sex once and I just haven't gotten around to getting rid of this fetus yet, so if you could just do an abortion, that would be greeeeaaaaaat." Late-term abortions are performed because there is some severe abnormality with the fetus or a problem with the mother's life. The argument for late-term abortions is that it would be inhumane to force a woman to carry a child to term that is only going to die shortly after birth, more inhumane than "killing a baby," as you phrase it.
