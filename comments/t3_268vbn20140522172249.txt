Hi, I used to get really bad anxiety before going out on dates and I was very insecure with myself/my body. It got better over time and I guess as I had more experienced with dates. I think you should do what feels comfortable to you. If this guy is truly nice, you could even tell him that sometimes you get anxiety and that you might need some time to take things slowly. The more people I get to know, the more it seems like a lot of them have dealt with personal anxiety in some capacity. 

Maybe if you aren't comfortable with that, you could try to just take the lead in setting up plans/dates etc with him. If you see him during the day time hours, it can be a lot more relaxed, i.e. coffee or a walk. It also has a lot less sexy connotations than having a late evening together. 

Not sure if that helps, but if he is a great guy, he will do his best to make you feel at ease at every step in your relationship together. Best of luck!
