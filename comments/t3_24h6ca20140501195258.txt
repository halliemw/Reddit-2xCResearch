I'm on the pill. I started when I was 16 on Alesse, and I had a lot of spotting. After about a year I changed to Marvelon and I've been on it ever since (now 24). 

About a year ago, I looked into other methods since I'm not super good at taking the pill at the same time every day. I rarely miss a day, but I basically take it when I go to bed, which fluctuates a lot. Anyway, so it seemed that a lot of the options had 'weight gain' as a side effect, and... well... I don't want to be fat. I asked my doctor about the IUD, but she said that the hospital only does those for women who are finished having children (ie have already been pregnant), so that wasn't an option. 

(If it matters, I live in Canada).
