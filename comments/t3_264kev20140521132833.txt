>So uniforms suck. Also, for people who care about this sort of thing, they tend to fail miserably at preserving "modesty" - we all wore our skirts a good foot above our knees. It made us look ridiculous but we thought we were extremely sexy.

Then it sounds like your uniforms were poorly chosen and the policy was poorly enforced. Places with good uniform policies don't have the expensive but cheaply made problems or the problems of insufficient outerwear. My boyfriend wore a uniform all through school and he loved it, as did all the people I've met from his alma mater. They had a choice of corduroy pants or plaid skirts, plain button downs with no logos, and ties for the boys. It wasn't the prettiest uniform, but it was simple and practical, could be cheap especially if you bought used, and it was enforced pretty strictly for everyone. 

When uniforms are done well, they're excellent, and just because you had a shitty experience doesn't mean uniforms in general suck. They're more enforceable than dress codes without the emphasis being on modesty, they're a big help in keeping the school secure, and they're a great equalizer when there's an income gap.
