I think it's the combo of this one and the Zoe's law bill in NSW that's making me nervous. But you're right, this one probably (fingers crossed) won't get anywhere.

And I will contact my local rep, but I'm in a ridiculously safe seat, so I guess I'm a bit cynical about what difference I make when it comes to doing stuff like that. 

And I think it was this exchange in particular annoyed me: 

>Interviewer Waleed Aly told Mr Shaw that research showed abortions had a roughly even gender split, and asked him again if he had evidence that there was a problem.

>"I'm not really here to answer your questions," Mr Shaw said in response. "You asked me to come to discuss what I'm doing, so that's what I'm doing."

I expect at least some deference to the facts from people who supposedly represent me!
