You are the center of attention. It's a bit like being a high school teacher or basketball coach. If you don't know everything that's fine, but decisions are made by people giving information to you, and you returning your decision. Listening to advice and knowledge of others is super important; but after you do, the final decision is yours, and your employees follow that.
Don't let anyone talk over you, or interrupt. Be very consistent with that; set a standard. You don't need to get angry, you just stop it, "Jason, I'm not finished," "Katherine, I want to know what you think, but not while I'm speaking."
Acknowledge your mistakes, you'll make your fair share, but never let them affect that you're in charge.
As applies to gender; good management is gender-neutral. Mediocre management is more forgiven in men than in women. That's ok, if you're anywhere close as attentive to your job as you sound, you'll learn constantly and you'll be a good manager.
Be nice, or neutral about things, but unwavering. You can acknowledge that it sucks you're turning down that time-off request, but it's the right decision, so that's what's going to happen.
I know it sounds basic, but it's importance can't be overstated: pay attention to how people are doing, and give appropriate feedback! It can be as bad to not acknowledge extra effort, as to ignore slacking.
