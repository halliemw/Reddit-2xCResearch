Yeah, how do comments like "I see what you mean, but maybe your coworker/boyfriend/mom was thinking this" fit into the rule? For instance there was a recent thread about a woman who's father invited his new girlfriend to go dress shopping with her. She was very mad at her dad, but found it helpful when people said "your dad may have thought this was a good idea and would be nice for you"
