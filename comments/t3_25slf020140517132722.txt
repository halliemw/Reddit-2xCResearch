I managed a restaurant for a few years. My salary was significantly lower than my male counterparts, even though I had been working for the company twice as long, took less time off, had more staff under me without an assistant manager, raised sales an average of 12% per transaction, revamped training and hiring processes, and only had to terminate less than 3 employees because of performance in 3 years. When I asked about a raise, I was told since I was a girl, they expected my parents to help support me financially. 

LOL wat.
