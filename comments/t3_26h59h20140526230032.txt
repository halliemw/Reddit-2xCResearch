This is great advice.  Most breast feeding failure especially in previous generations was due to bad advice.  Scheduled feelings and supplements doom breast feeding.  
I've nursed all of my children.  My mom never even tried, my grandma said she wasn't able.  My advice, throw out everything you know about baby feeding.  Buy the LLL Womanly Art of Breastfeeding and take a Breastfeeding class.  It is hard, family who didn't Breastfeed will say "just give him a bottle".  Ignore them, be determined and you will make it.
