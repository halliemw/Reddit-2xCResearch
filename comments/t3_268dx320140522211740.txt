OP here, I'm also a woman. One of the reasons I wrote the OP was because I find myself wanting to shout at the screen, "Why didn't you tell him to fuck off/go away/leave you alone?!". Not for rape of course, but when a guy won't leave you alone at the bar, or your coworker is making lewd statements to you, or you get catcalled in the street. 

I'm a people pleaser - to my family and friends. If I love you, I'll stick my neck out for you and do things I don't want to do. But I'm not going to take shit from people who are insignificant to me.
