Health and well-being absolutely is a right. A person should not be denied care simply because of the amount of money they have. 

Moving to universal healthcare would actually be *cheaper* in the long run because people would go to the doctor as soon as they got sick and get taken care of, rather than putting it off and delaying, or opting out of one procedure only to need a more expensive one further along the way. Because the US system is driven by profit this directly gets in the way of people actually getting the care they need, when they need it.

here is a good article that goes in to some of what I'm saying here. By no means do I think that conservatives are 'evil', I just think that most are unaware of the truths of how the system works and fail to realise that the people at the top have a strong motivation to keep things the way they are because of the money and political pressures involved.
