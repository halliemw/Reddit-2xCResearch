Why is there an assumption that women don't take care of their cars? Especially in this era, lots of women (and men) have had a car for quite a lot longer than they have been maintaining a household.  I could change a tire, spark plugs, alternator, and many a hose and belt on my car long before I knew how to maintain a well stocked kitchen.
