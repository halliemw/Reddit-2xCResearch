I'm a lady engineer in a serious relationship and have the same problem with vendors. True to my engineering background, I'm painfully oblivious in social situations and I take things very literally, so flirting has to be crazy blunt for me to even notice. The bonus is that I accidentally play dumb and ask what they mean or if they could explain the joke. If the flirting is very obvious, such as "what are you doing this weekend," I make it a point to mention my boyfriend, then bring attention back to the meeting agenda.

Bonus: if you like your coworkers and they've noticed this happening, get them to help. When a client makes an inappropriate comment, let a coworker raise their eyebrows and say something along the lines of "wow. Can we get back to *xyz*?" It might be more effective coming from a guy, unfortunately.
