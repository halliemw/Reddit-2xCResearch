Knowing I'm not alone helps me! I hope it helps you too.

I feel like I need to make giant posters that say:

"Someone wanting to rape me is not a compliment"

You're not being sensitive. I hate that "they're just being retarded lol" thing. Or the "boys will be boys" thing. 

Oh are we not holding people accountable for their actions anymore??
