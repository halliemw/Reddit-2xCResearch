34-44 days actually isn't irregular...a lot of women appear to think a "regular period" is when it is the same exact length every single month without fail, and that just isn't the case, if your cycle only varies by ~10 days a month it isn't considered "irregular" in a medical sense.  No period tracker will be able to magically know when your period is coming if all you are giving it are start/end dates, they all will just average them to guess.

Unfortunately, this is just kind of part of the game.  I like Instead Cups for "catching" a period, when it's as early as it can be you can insert one in the morning when you aren't bleeding and if it starts during the day you won't ruin anything.  I use a new one every 1-2 days when not menstruating, rinse it morning and evening and reinsert.  It hasn't caused me any issues.

Also you really need to find some way to take ibuprofen, it will change your life.  If pills are the problem they make baby ibuprofen in drop form, you can try that.
