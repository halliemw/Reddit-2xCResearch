So your idea is to censor center left, moderate, and conservative women. Stop trying to define what the ideal woman is. You don't speak for all women. We have a range of opinions. Your idea of censoring dissenting non-modal opinions is ludicrous. Do you want an echo chamber in here? Do you not think that women cannot have their own opinions if they do not conform to yours? What is with this zeal for heavy handed censorship?
