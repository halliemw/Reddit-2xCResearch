Sure, that's a good point- I would just say that as far as I have seen the words used, there is a major difference in degree between bigotry and prejudice. I'll certainly acknowledge that most people (including myself) probably have at least a few preconceived notions about certain groups of people that may affect how you view an individual. That's prejudice. 

Bigotry, on the other hand, is a hateful intolerance of specific groups of people. As I define it (and I think most people would share that definition) I would definitely argue that not everyone is bigoted. I think arguing that everyone is full-on bigoted is out of touch with reality. That was my contention with the comment above.
