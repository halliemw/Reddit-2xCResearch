Oh man that's the same place I was in as a 13 year old. I remember crying in the car on the way home from a family Christmas party because so many people were commenting about my height and I honestly felt like Godzilla and would never stop growing. It also didn't help that I was a figure skater and was constantly surrounded by tiny little people so my tallness was even more exaggerated... one time, in a group program we skated to "the circle of life" and all dressed up in animal prints and they made me be a giraffe. Not good for the self esteem.

But I've been 5'8" since seventh grade and once I went to college I stopped being around little tiny ice skaters and felt a lot better about it! Just remind her that it will get better, although it's hard to feel like it at that age!
