Oh hey! This is from the same guy who says that [Amazon is going to hurt the Seattle dating scene](http://jeffreifman.com/2014/05/12/youve-got-male-amazons-growth-impacting-seattle-dating-scene/) because they're hiring too many men. Apparently he's a bit displeased at how difficult it is to date women in this city since the man to woman ratio is off.

>Women want us to be passionate, masculine lovers, yet we’re expected to turn off our emotions and let go the moment we’re dumped.

I'm pretty sure the only one who can work through your emotions is yourself. If you're having trouble, go to a counselor. It is no one else's responsibility to help you get your emotions sorted except for yourself. It sounds like he's picking up shit from TRP to make himself feel better about how he handled the break up. It's really weird that he doesn't reflect on his involvement in the relationship, he just tries to psychoanalyze her actions and frame it in such a way where he's the victim.

It's also kind of strange that he is *this* hung up on a 4 month relationship. Mourning the loss of a relationship that short for 2.5 **years?** That level of attachment makes his analysis of the situation and his actions in this relationship a bit suspect.
