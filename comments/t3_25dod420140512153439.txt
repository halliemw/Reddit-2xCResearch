Meg from A Wrinkle In Time, hands down.  In a lot of ways, I was Meg growing up, right down to the pretty blue eyes hidden behind cokebottle glasses.  She was fiercely intelligent, brave, and yes...a bit prickly.

Also her family was like a warm hug I could wrap around myself.  If I have a daughter, I'd definitely be reading A Wrinkle In Time to her  (And the Tortall series, because those are awesome too!)
