Going by [some of their images](http://pics.ae.com/is/image/aeo/cat6870166_d_f?maskuse=off&wid=1000&fit=crop&qlt=80,0), It seems they don't even have the size range for the models to get bra's there. can you say ["ow"](http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/bundle_filter.jsp?productId=1735_3237_073&parentCatId=cat6870400&bundleId=cat6870163&guide=bra&cup=d&band=32&N=4294963710+4294963705+4294963629&catId=cat6880045&available=false?) (The wire is no where near her inframammary fold, and that gore is far from tack. Strapless bra's are harder to fit, But when they are trying to sell the bra with that image they need to make it look more comfortable.

I'm glad to see some of the poses are more natural though, they are standing with a posture most of us use, It gives me a much better idea of how the bra will look and fit when I am slouched.
