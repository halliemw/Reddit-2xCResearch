> Statistically crime against women is underreported by the female victims. 

You always see stats saying "only X% of crimes of type Y against women are reported...", but is it underreported *more* than crimes against men?  Rape and DV suffers from the same underreporting problem when it's against men that it does when against women.  It's not like 100% of assaults against men are reported either.  Take homicide, a crime where presumably reporting the crime isn't a big factor; the gender disparity exists there, I don't see why it wouldn't also for assaults.

Also, I think it's possible that *assault* happens more to men, but *harassment* more to women.  And also I think that men maybe have less to worry about when, say, walking home alone at night; but they're also more likely to walk home alone at night.
