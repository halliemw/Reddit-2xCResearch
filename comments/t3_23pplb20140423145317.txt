Seriously.  I love that Lena could give a fuck and think that's pretty inspiring, and meanwhile Mindy is a bit more realistic of a mentality in comparison to my own and I'm sure many other women.  

I'm not totally *concerned* with my body image, but yeah I'd be down for some improvements.  Looking good is pretty cool.
