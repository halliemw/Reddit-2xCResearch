>Of course had I not been present, I wouldn't have been raped.

This is an insane line of thinking. You could literally apply it to any bad thing that could possibly happen to anyone in the world, forever.

Get hit by a drunk driver? If you hadn't been present, it wouldn't have happened.

Someone harassed you at work? If you hadn't been present, it wouldn't have happened.

Get killed or maimed in a war? If you hadn't been present, it wouldn't have happened.

Building fell on you? If you hadn't been present, it wouldn't have happened.

If you follow that line of thinking to its logical conclusion, you may as well never leave your house. Of course, if there's a home invasion robbery and you are assaulted or murdered, that's your fault too, for staying home all the time, and not boarding up all your windows and doors and waiting wide awake in your living room in a rocking chair, clutching a machine gun.
