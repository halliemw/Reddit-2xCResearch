This is what you said: 

"It'd be nice if I, a Black Man, could find a Black woman for once. Just one fucking time. Jesus fucking Christ. This shit irks me."

To post that comment under this photo of an interracial couple suggests that interracial relationships bother you, because you are a "Black Man" who cannot "find a Black woman for once." Therefore, with your (now deleted) comment, you are suggesting that this interracial relationship (a Black woman with a White man) is problematic because the White man 'took' the Black woman out of the dating pool, which you believe is exclusively for Black men...?

This is *exactly* what your comment suggested. If you were trying to say something else, maybe you should have posted it under another picture.

By the way, I can read.
