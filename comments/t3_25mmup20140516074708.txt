For assault, we've been trained to call the police and to encourage the victim to speak to the police.  That's not exactly a lot of training.

We also had sexual harassment training (there are ten "go-to" people on campus to begin the process of an internal grievance/report).  

We have posters all over (several on each floor of each building) describing what to do (and stickers in the bathrooms).
