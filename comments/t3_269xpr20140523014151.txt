     I've been in an LDR for 1.5 years and we've been dating for 3.  There are really important things to always do like keep constant communication.  It's just always nice including your significant other in your every day life. It lets them know you're thinking about them.  Also, skype is really great and idk if you're into it but Skype sex is also really nice. It helps to keep a sexual connection with your partner. Also, every now and then my partner and I will send the other a care package.  Nothing that is too expensive, but just little things that made us think of the other.  Often this includes a blanket or a jacket that smells like the original sender of the package. That one is probably my favorite; I love cuddling up with one of his jackets when I go to sleep.
     We also watch a tv series together just so we are connected with the same things.  Every week when GOT comes out we watch it at the same time and then talk about if afterwards.  Along with our skype dates we will have a "specialty date" which includes a fancy dessert/dinner.  We dress up (from the waist up. The rest doesn't matter anyways) and then buy a fancy dessert or dinner and just act like we're on a regular date :) Super fun. 
     You are very lucky that you get to see him so often.  I only see my boyfriend twice a semester.  I have one more year to go and then I finally get to move back home!
Feel free to ask me any other questions or PM me if you need :) I wish you all the luck in the world!
