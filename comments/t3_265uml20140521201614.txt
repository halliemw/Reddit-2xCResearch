My husband does know I'm pregnant, and I have been very vocal since I was pregnant with #2 that I did not want a third anytime soon. He agreed with me, but birth control was out of the question. But in a conversation we had some days before I found out I was pregnant, he told me that if I were to acquire birth control against his knowledge, he wouldn't be terribly upset not to have another baby, as long as he didn't know. (If he doesn't know I'm taking birth control then he isn't sinning if he has sex with me)
