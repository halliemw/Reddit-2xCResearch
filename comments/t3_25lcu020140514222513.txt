I think that is a little immature. I get being pissed about the "girl bike" thing, but they are better suited to say wearing pencil skirts when using your bike for actual transportation if that's something you'll be dealing with. I remember a similar conversation with my dad when I was 6 and got a new bike that was the "girl bike" design. He explained that the point of the lower bar was to be able to ride in skirts, and now that I have men's bike to ride to everywhere I go in town, I can confirm that while it's easy to ride a bike in a knee length skirt that isn't too voluminous, it's harder to get on and off a men's bike. It's better to make your own decisions based on the fact and not let his biases away you either way. 

The "boy bike" may actually be the better choice for you, only you can know. But as someone who spent years making reactionary decisions based on not liking my parents' attitudes about something or seeing their biases and trying to distance myself, I can tell you that that's not a healthy way to make decisions and it absolutely won't make you happy if that becomes your general decision making paradigm.
