It's such a difficult cycle! Now he's said he has a hard time believing that I'll initiate for any reason than to 'humor' him, and that he doesn't want sex that way. And if I hug him half-dressed, now it's like I'm being considered a tease. Sometimes I'm trying to start in an easy place... and we have talked about how (for me) it would be easier to start with making out, instead of leaping right in. Kind of start at the beginning. But he's really embarrassed about being 'too' into it, if there's no follow through.
