Before you walk at 2 weeks GET YOUR LAST PAYCHECK!  
  
I've had a boss just like that before.  Nice enough guy, but just didn't value employees' independence or time.  He expected us to just do what he asked because he's the boss, not as an exchange of services for money.  
  
I never did get my last four weeks' salary.  He took it as a personal affront, and didn't feel like he owed it to me after I "betrayed him" by quitting.
