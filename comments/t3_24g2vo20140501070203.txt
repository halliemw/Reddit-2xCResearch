I think maybe you should start by figuring out what exactly about them is making you uncomfortable. Put on a dress, stand in front of the mirror: Is it the way they look? Is it the breezy feeling between them? Is it insecurity, as in "Just a breezy and anyone can see everything"? Some other insecurity? Does it change with the kind of underwear you're wearing, could you wear girls' boxershorts instead of panties or whatever you're wearing?

I know a lot of women feel insecure about either the way their legs look (especially the knees. Why do so many people hate their knees?) or selfconsious about the whole breeze thing. Maybe try on legging shorts underneath until you feel okay? And what about see-through tights, do you have the same feeling when you're wearing them?

And so on. Just explore why you feel uncomfortable, you'll figure out a way to deal with the outcome for sure!
