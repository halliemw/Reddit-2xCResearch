> Those privileges and drawbacks exist independent of perspective.

What you see as a privilege or advantage is obviously different than what I see as a privilege or advantage. Therefore perspective does mean something. From your perspective being white is an advantage, for me its not a privilege or an advantage, because I was never given or handed anything just for being white. The only time my race came into play for anything was when I Could NOT apply for certain scholarships that were reserved for minorities in my college years. I don't call that an advantage.
