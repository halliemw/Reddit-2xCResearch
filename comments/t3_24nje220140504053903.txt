I was breast budding at 8 and had my period one week after my 11th birthday. I was lucky because I was in a class with girls 6-9 months older than me and we all went through puberty together. When I went to high school and I met girls who hadn't started their periods yet I was amazed. I come from a family of tall women who entered puberty earlier, also tall men who entered puberty early. Shit I think everyone in my family went into puberty early..... 


If you really want to know if she is going through the early stages of puberty she would start to breast bud an grow wispy body hair. 

I think because everyone is naked in my family (in the house) I knew what an adult body looked like and the hair/boobs wasnt a big deal. I was seriously unimpressed when my period came but that was for about 2 hours and I got over it. I knew about periods however I just didnt want to get one.
