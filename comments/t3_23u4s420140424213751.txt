Thank you! I should try jotting down some shorthand of the questions they ask, even if just to have them to practice at home. I did write thank you letters; I didn't go back and address any of the questionable responses, but I did acknowledge that I hadn't done my best but was still confident in my ability to do the job. I do believe that everything happens for a reason, so I'll try to just remember that whatever happens is for the best!
