ugh this! After i wrote that comment, i went and read through a bunch of reviews that just TRASHED the movie. But you're right --- if it was a dude movie doing dude things (with the same gross content) its a classic comedy, right?

Again, could you imagine how good it could have been if there was another reason (other than a dude) for their road trip? Ah, one day!
