Those are based on a cluster of recent findings, not my words and definitely not petty.  

Your whole argument just changed from "I do everything I can to be healthy, why me" to "I may be putting some effort in, back off".  My previous advice applied to the former sentiments you had.  I can see now you are not as interested or focused on the things I talked about for them to apply.  Your preface was misleading as you mentioned only diet and exercise.  Try to give sound advice to a like-minded individual? No good deed goes unpunished. 

You can't chap my ass, I have lost 70lbs years ago/kept the weight off/**actually do the things you claim to do**.  Buy talc for your own excuse filled delusional chafed ass, Ms. "Why not me".
