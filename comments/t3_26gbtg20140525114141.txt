Coercive and icky. If I may, I would suggest that next time he does this, you say no and tell him that if he asks again that you're going to leave because it's gross and not respecting your boundaries. Then follow through. Hopefully that will shut down his behaviour. 

Stuff like this creeps me out. No is no, not ask and ask and ask until it turns into a yes. Honestly he sounds like a toddler. "Can we have sex now? What about now? Is it time to have sex now?"
