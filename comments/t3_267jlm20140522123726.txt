You're being downvoted because your questions clearly indicate that you did not really pay attention to OPs post. She has clearly stated that the problem is he is giving more than he can afford and he is alienating those around him with Chridtian guilt. Those are bad things. You are wasting OPs time by asking her questions she has already explained in the post and kind if being thick headed at best and argumentative at worst by doing this.

TL;DR your comments are almost entirely unhelpful and unnecessary
