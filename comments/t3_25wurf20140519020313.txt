>  I sometimes forget to talk if I have nothing to say.

I used to be like this, and was often frustrated with people around me asking if I was ok, or awkwardly prompting me to say something ("contribute to the conversation!") or just looking at me funny. Now I'm married to a guy who's just like this, and for some reason I drive myself crazy over it and have turned into the yappy prodder. I'm working on not asking if he's ok 23 times a day, but suddenly I have the urge to fill the silence with words, and I feel like a boob because I still don't have anything cogent to say.
