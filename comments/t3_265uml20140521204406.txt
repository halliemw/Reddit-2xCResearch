My husband knows I have had "doubts" for a couple of years but beyond repeating theological points that I already am aware of and remain unconvinced by, he doesn't want to get into the nitty-gritty. I'm sensing that he's scared that my reasoning may undo his faith too and he isn't ready for that yet.
