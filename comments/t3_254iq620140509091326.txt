I'm graduating tomorrow too. I didn't want to walk at graduation but my boyfriend really pushed me too, feeling that I would regret it if I didn't do it. I have a lot of anxiety about it. I don't know anyone else else graduating and...sigh. 

I love Doctor Who and your cap makes me happy! I'm going to leave my cap plain but good luck to you on all your future endeavors!! We got this. :)
