I married young and divorced young. There was a thread about a year ago about shocking things to find out about your partner. People actually argued, and I got downvoted heavily for disagreeing, that finding out someone had been married before was equally as shocking as finding out that they used to be a stripper or hooker (my partner is fully aware of my previous marriage, fwiw). I can understand being upset if the person had kept it from you for years and years, but to just *find out* at an appropriate time?

I mean... having had previous marriage is equal to once having been a hooker.

Okay, 2X. Okay.

Along those lines, expressing that you don't respect stripping or prostitution as a line of work is also pretty frowned upon here.

I am still young, but I wonder if some of those people who said they would be SHOCKED and DISGUSTED if a man they were falling in love with turned out to have an ex-wife are also very young and will one day be 48 years old and know a lot of people who've been married and divorced, have kids with exes, etc. I wonder if that will make a difference.
