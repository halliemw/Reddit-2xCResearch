Late to the party (as usual) but I highly reccomend checking out [/r/Endo](http://reddit.com/r/Endo/).  Even after you are diagnosed with endometriosis it is really, **really** difficult to be taken seriously by your doctor.  It's a sub that has reminded me, time and time again, to stand up for myself and not allow the medical world to bully me into thinking that it's okay to be in pain every day.

If you think you have endo and can't afford to see a doctor, is there a planned parenthood in your area so you can at least get on some kind of hormonal birth control?  As some of the other posts have said, it can take many years to get a diagnosis.  Endo only gets worse without some kind of treatment, so waiting years to find a doctor can wreak havoc on your body.  I wish the medical community was aware of how muc more common endometriosis is, instead of dismissing it all as cramps.
