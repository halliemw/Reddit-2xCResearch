So are you saying that someone who can't afford nice clothes are bums? Unless someone is wearing a fucking KKK outfit or something of that sort, what do you really know about them? A man in a suit...does he like wearing suits or does he have to do that for his job? A lady in a dress...is she just comfortable in dresses or is she straight? Who knows? I can't even say clothes are skin deep because they are just a layer meant to protect our bodies from the elements that we accessorize with. Maybe back in high school it was a big deal but as adults, don't we have other things we should be worried about?
