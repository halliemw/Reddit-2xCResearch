I read far too many insertion horror stories when I had mine inserted (about a month ago). The insertion pain for me was mild and brief, not nearly what I was expecting. My cramps for the rest of the day were pretty rough. They wouldn't have been nearly as bad if I had a heating pad.
This month I've had spotting (possibly a light period), but I heard this is expected for the first 6 months.
Also, the strings softened within a few weeks and can't be felt. So far, I absolutely love the Mirena.
