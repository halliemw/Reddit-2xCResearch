It's more of he just doesn't want to go. I get that some people just don't want to go to college and that works out fine for them, but that just doesn't seem reasonable to me, it's just the way I've been taught. He told me once that once he gets a car he won't be coming to school as much. This of course made me upset and when I tried to ask him why he would do that he tried to say it would be once in awhile as a break from school every few days, I got more upset saying that's too much school to miss. He got defensive and said it was just a joke, and that I have no right to be upset because I missed 20+ days of school first quarter (I had severe migraines before meds.) So we just have different views on things like school. 

I do believe that money is a factor though, his dad is an alcoholic and his mom works 12+ hours a day to support his habit, she never went to college.
