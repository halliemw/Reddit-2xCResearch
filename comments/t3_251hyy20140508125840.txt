I like my country even though it has its shitty stuff, though.

Some do. Sometimes doctors don't care but there have been instances where women have been arrested for getting abortions. Last year a woman was thrown in jail for half a day because she was suspected of having an abortion (she could've been miscarrying, doctors didn't perform any tests on her, just called the police for a suspected abortion) *while* she was still bleeding. Several girls have been denied abortions even in cases of rape (when it's supposed to be legal in such cases), most recently a 13-year-old who was raped by her step-father, but luckily she ended up getting an abortion in a private hospital I think.
