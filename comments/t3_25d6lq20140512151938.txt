Ok, that's good. I wasn't sure if you were just bending to social pressure to get married or not (I remember how strong it was at that age).

If you've talked about what kind of wedding you want, and are both on the same page, then try and just chill (I know it's hard). I'm sort of in the same boat...been with my bf for about 1.5 years, he's "proposed" to me but I've said he has to propose 1.sober and 2.with a ring. So he's proposed sober but not with a ring. I know we're going to get married but not for a little while.

however, we're both in our mid-40's, this is a second marriage for both of us, we both have kids, so there's none of those type of expectations.
