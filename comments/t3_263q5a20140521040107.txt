I have been doing tons of research and I'm not that stupid or desperate that I would let any doctor cut my face. Also I live in Scandinavia so the quality standards are extremely high. 

I'm trying to be as objective as I can. Do you think I haven't tried to get over this? I wish I could feel beautiful the way I am but I don't and I've felt like this for years. It's extremely tiring. Also I don't want to change my whole appearence and I'm definitely not going for the perfect tiny Hollywood nose. I don't mind having a slightly bigger nose as long as it doesn't make me look like an old woman.
