My husband did. We had good communication before I took the job about what my taking the job would mean for both of us. I told him it had been the "my husbands show" for so long I needed it to be my turn to get started.

He had to turn down certain jobs because I accepted my dream job but we are really happy. I feel like he appreciated my sacrifice when I moved and I definitely appreciate his sacrifice now.
