About 20-25% of the population apparently. It stems from Attachment Theory, which is the way we attach to people, which was influenced by our primary caregivers in infancy. People who attach anxiously tend to attach very hard (perhaps too hard) in their romantic relationships, and these are the ones who simply do not see other people in a sexual or romantic light while they have feelings for another. Avoidant people attach very little to their partners, and have a tendency to cheat, also about 20-25% of the population. And the rest attach securely. Of course there are spectrums within each group. Those are the very basics. Here is a starting article. It's actually very interesting, and will likely explain either your or your partners behaviour at some point.
