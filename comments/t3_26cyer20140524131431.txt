I bought a house because it had a big bathtub. My husband loves bubble baths. I have a bath box I got as a present and never used it.

We lived in a house with a jacuzzi bath. I thought it was gross. I dropped some tablets in it and ran it, so my husband could use it. 

I've only showered since 2000. Maybe I'll break out the bath box and try it!
