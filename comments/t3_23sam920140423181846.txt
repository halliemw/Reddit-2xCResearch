Im going to chime in here because my reaction on reading this post was "wtffff". It reads like an overreaction because you're trying to find law or precedence to throw at him in the event you have a bill to pay. Now I get it, you're financially stressed and all that but I cannot fathom ever approaching this situation from a legal standpoint with a partner. If you had already talked and he refused to help, and you were going to break up with him and try to throw him under the bus I think I could more effectively see why you might be interested in the law. Im sorry,  your whole approach just feels so weird and not a way to approach a partner. 

I'm sorry to hear about your experience and I hope you're otherwise okay.  Im not sure what your relationship is like (if you live together,  etc) but wait to see what you wind up owing and discuss with him how that bill is going to play into your finances. If he's a partner worth having I'm sure he'll be there to assist where he can.
