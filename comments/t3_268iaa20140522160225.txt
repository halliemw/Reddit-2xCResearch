Ani DiFranco. She's a musician, she's short but she's strong. She has big eyes, big lips, and a big nose and her face is just gorgeous and expressive with or without makeup. Over the year's she's had dreads, bright coloured hair, a shaved head, pretty girly hair, whatever she wants. She sings about history, relationships, family, politics, abortion, anything she wants! She does what she wants and puts all her power into everything she chooses. I will play all her music for my children (sons and daughters!) when I have them.

**Choice song quotes:**

"I am not a pretty girl, that is not what I do. I ain't no damsel in distress, and I don't need to be rescued.... 

I am not an angry girl, but it seems like I've got everyone fooled. 

Everytime I say something they find hard to hear, they chalk it up to my anger and never to their own fear. 

And imagine you're a girl, just trying to finally come clean, knowing full well they'd prefer you were dirty and smiling!" **[Not a Pretty Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cZ-nAfSkW4)**

"Yeah I'm no heroine, at least not last time I checked. 

I'm too easy to roll over, too easy to wreck. 

I just write about what I should've done, I sing what I wish I could say. 

And I hope somewhere some woman hears my music and it helps her through her day."**[I'm no Heroine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh9XeJ78yVE)**

"People we're standing at Ground Zero of the Feminist Revolution!

Oh, it was an inside job,

Stoic and sly

One we're supposed to forget and downplay and deny.

But it think the time is not then, if not ny,

To let the truth out!

Coolest F-word ever deserves a fuckin' shout!

I mean why can't all decent men and women call themselves feminists?

Out of respect.

For those who fought for this." [**Grand Canyon** - Poem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hk4bQrtaC4)
