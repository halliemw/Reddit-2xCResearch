We are a subreddit intended for women's perspectives and experiences.  Men are welcome to participate, however, we have a problem with men derailing conversations about *women's perspectives and experiences* by  inserting irrelevant and anecdotal quips about their own experiences.  If your comment needs to be prefaced with "as a man, ..." you might think twice about whether it belongs in this forum.
