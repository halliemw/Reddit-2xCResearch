I wish there was another term for it. I do go make-up free unless I'm onstage or for special occasions, and the terminology gets real confusing when you constantly have to reiterate, "I don't mean the 'no makeup look,' I mean just my own skin and lashes and whatever, with nothing on my face except sunscreen."

I've even seen, "How to get the barefaced look" articles, which are surprisingly more than one step. ("Wash your face and go about your day.")
