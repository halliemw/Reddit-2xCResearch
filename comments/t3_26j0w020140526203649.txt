Yeah, I've thought the name was cheesy the moment I found the subreddit.  Dumb name.  Seddit is much better.

However, unrelated to that subreddit (I'm arguing semantics at this point, so the rest can be ignored), I don't think seduce or seduction has really a negative connotation unless you're thinking in biblical or puritanical terms (neither of which are my background).

For example, one can talk about charisma unrelated to flirtation/sex as seduction.  Hell, this prominent Infectious diseases physician was talking to me the other day about finding my inner seductiveness when engaging with people.  He didn't mean talk to everybody sexually/flirtatiously.  He was talking charisma.

And even in sexual terms, I think seduction can be a good thing.  If a partner seduces his/her partner (the partner of course wanting to be seduced), it's just sexy times with a little extra sexiness and passion.

Edit: **Why is every single thing I say on this subreddit that doesn't tow the line established by the thread get down voted?**

If you read my other posts, I voiced that I think certain communities with certain philosophies/worldviews contributed to this murderer's worldview that directly contributed to deaths of those people.  But I shouldn't have to voice it every time I talk about the topic.  This subreddit...  Please see side panels on rules, check out reddiquette, and stop censoring stuff.
