I love this idea! I think a few things could make this work well:

* You may not have had this in mind, but a new subreddit may need to be in order. This subreddit was big enough before, but especially now with default status, it's going to be difficult for people who want to participate see "book club posts" since the front page (and second page) change SO frequently. If you log in to 2X every few days, you will miss all relevant posts. 

* Multiple books, multiple genres. Not everyone will want to read the same kind of books. If we do say, one book a month, then if you don't like the genre for 2 months in a row, you may not check back in the sub. I think Something like- 1st Monday: Classics. 2nd Monday: Scifi. 3rd Monday: Non-fiction. 4th Monday: Wild Card. Of course, a lot of this will depend on how much interest there is and can fluctuate on feedback. 

* Organization. All requests per genre must be within a thread designated for such requests. All discussion must occur within official discussion threads. I think it'd be fun to have "casual" threads as well, such as "I read *Children of Men* a while back and want to know what you gals think about [observation here]"

* I think it would be cool to have at least once a month be a book discussion on a female author, genres varying. 

I'm in love with this idea, let me know if you need any help or just to bounce ideas. 

**EDIT:** We also need to decide what makes this a "2X book club" versus a "regular book club." Maybe that means ONLY female authors. Maybe that means at least once a month, a female author. Maybe that means a gender-centic critique vs. socio, psycho, or anthropological critiques. Maybe it means for "people who identify as as a female." Maybe it means none of these things. You get my point though- why a **2X** book club over a **general** book club? What did you have in mind about it?
