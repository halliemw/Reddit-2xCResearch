That is a completely unfair assumption. I know a few pastors that would absolutely hate the fact that religion is tearing apart a family. It would be lazy and ignorant to not even try because you assume the pastor won't be willing to help.

I agree that OP should do her research first and tread carefully, but talking to the pastor is definitely a possible option.
