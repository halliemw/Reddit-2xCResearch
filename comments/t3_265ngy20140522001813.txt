Also the first time I ever heard the term, it was in relation to people with addictions. Like, if you've just quit cocaine, seeing someone do some is gonna trigger fresh strong cravings in you that could lead to a relapse. Warning people about graphic drug use seems like a really unambiguously *good* idea, regardless of how you feel about PTSD or whatever, you know? No one thinks freshly sober addicts need to just grow up and face their aversion to drugs through exposure therapy.
