Seven years is a long time to be with someone, whether they are abusive in any way or not. Also, if you ever feel he is reacting to you based off of her, try to understand that he does not think you are her, it was just embedded in his brain and no matter what, you will at some point probably do something that triggers a response. Make sure you do something unique to you too bring him back to the person he is with.

All of that aside, I do feel that getting your finals done is the main priority right now. I'm sure if he feels that way about you, another week or so won't send him packing.
