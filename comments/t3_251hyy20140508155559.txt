Its simple.  Termination is legal outwith NI.  

Patient travels outside NI, asks for treatment, NHS delivers, charges against the NI NHS budget (which as you rightly say is subsidised by other UK taxpayers since we're an economic mess), just as if I asked for treatment for a pregnancy issue when visiting England.

I can almost agree that NI should be able to deny women terminations here if that is the will of the people.   They should not be able to deny me service elsewhere.

Just as another aside, it's ridiculous that a termination can lead to a prison sentence here but be perfectly legal elsewhere in the UK.
