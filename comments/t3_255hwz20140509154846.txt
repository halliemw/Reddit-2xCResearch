Addiction isn't a choice. It's a disease and classified as such for a reason. It's a mental illness that makes the brain prioritize the addiction of choice before all else.

No one wants to become addicted. They may take the drug, but people don't often want to depend on it. It puts them out of a reasonable mind and rationality. Don't doubt your friendship over a thought process heavily swayed and controlled by chemicals.
