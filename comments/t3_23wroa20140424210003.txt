It's not cool that they are imposing sexuality on you like that in an attempt to be inclusive. It suggests they are disappointed with how you perform your gender and just want some sort of closure/certainty to their ideas of you because you are ambiguous. Maybe tell them that talking to them about sexuality is a very uncomfortable topic and that you'd prefer them to stop because it puts you in an awkward position of feeling the need to defend your identity as it stands, whatever it is. If they respect that and you, they will never bring it up again until you do.

If not, I'd consider just letting them talk until they run out of things to say about the topic. People tend to stop talking when you look at them in silence after they talk. And then, just walk away. People feel incredibly awkward after that type of exchange. Eventually, they get either get bored of the topic or avoid the awkwardness entirely. Let it wash over you like wave on the beach that only goes back to the ocean.
