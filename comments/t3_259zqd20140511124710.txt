I'm in a long distance relationship and my boyfriend has almost no filter so sometimes he'll make a comment about some girl that was hitting on him so I really had to learn to take that in stride. I just remind myself that he loves me and chose me over all the girls he could be with. It works the same way with him about my male friends, if we didn't love each other enough to trust one another then we wouldn't be together.
