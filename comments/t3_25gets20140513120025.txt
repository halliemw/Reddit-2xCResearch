Yeah, I appreciate you saying that. I have never heard otherwise about my body hair from guys, but I think that women think otherwise and have great shame. Also, social 'regulations' are getting so much tighter on women and body hair - I feel if we dont' take this on now, we may end up living in a narrow and narrower realm of existence.
