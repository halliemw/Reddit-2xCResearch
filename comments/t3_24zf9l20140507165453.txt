I still get nervous occasionally after 3 years on oral contraceptives.  However, as long as you take it religiously, the odds are incredibly low.  As you take it more and more, maybe after a few months, you'll begin to really trust it.

I actually worry less now than before I started taking bc because my period now always starts on the exact same day (3rd day of inactive pills) at about 9pm.  It's so much like clockwork now that I never have to worry about my period being late.

Also, if you're using the pull-out method in addition, there's very little chance you could get pregnant.
