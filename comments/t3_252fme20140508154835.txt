You're getting downvoted because your comment was pretty condescending. I'll break it down for you since you seem interested in learning.

Starting out:

> Just sayin...not all guys are critical or judgy. 

I think the OP already knows this and she hasn't done anything to imply that she doesn't. Starting out like this is basically saying "I think you are bigoted toward men and I'm here to set you straight".

> Youre all beautiful in my book. Unless you dont want to be beautiful. Then be whatever you want.

This just sounds like you're treating everyone here like children or super-delicate flowers who can't be upset in any way.
