You're totally right, thank you! Shopping has always been such a stressful process for me, hence why I wanted to make this decision so quickly. The dress is actually two sizes bigger than mine - crazy! I'm getting it altered though. I'm feeling more positive now that I'm imagining the dress well-fitted and dewrinkled.
