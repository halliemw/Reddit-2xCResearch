Nah mate, I think it's valid. It's a lead-in in the same way that, say, the shooting of multiple Jews by some nutso outside of a synagogue in Paris, might be a valid lead-in to a discussion about how many far-right parties there are in Paris which hold similar views, or the increased anti-semitism in French society and the influence it may have on people like this. 

Just dismissing it as 'he was nuts', also doesn't clearly answer why he in his nuttiness decided to target this specific group of people. And it doesn't help find out if there might be any potential 'next ones' from the same group who are also contemplating violence.
