I know it's hard to convey inflection online, but I honestly didn't mean to be rude to him. My "haha" was an actual laugh, because I was surprised he would card me, especially since it was late on a Friday night when my friend and I had obviously been out to the bars in the area. I think he could've said it nicer, like, "Yeah I know, we have to card anyone who looks young" or something, but the way he said it was extremely cold and rude. I think it's a rude thing to say anyway, because I don't think implying someone looks like a child when they're an adult is a compliment at all.
