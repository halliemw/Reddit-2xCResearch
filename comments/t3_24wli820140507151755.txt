I agree that this is very wrong use of the social media, but I don't get how anyone is surprised that they make this insinuation that a scantily clad large-busted "geek"-girl is better than being a modestly clad one. I didn't know this company until I read this article and then went to their website, and it's like all they show: hot, skinny women in tight bodysuits and what have you.
