I'm not depressed, but I'm crying right now because this rings so true. I want my daughter to be happy, and for all his mean, hurtful ways I still love my husband and want him to be happy too, so I hide how much his hurtful comment cut me, and "put on a happy face" because I can't bear the thought of ruining my daughter's childhood.

I know the standard Reddit response is "leave the bum", but he wasn't always like this. He changed when we had our daughter, and he lashes out at me (words only, he's not abusive), so I'm just having a hard time mourning the loss of the person I loved, but I won't divorce because that's more harmful for me and my daughter than staying and putting on a brave face. The hardest part is that I'm far from my family and don't really have any close friends, so I don't have anyone to talk to (except for you guys, sometimes I think 2X is my salvation :'( ). I think today has been particularly tough because he basically didn't do anything for Mother's Day, and it's just getting so hard to basically do it alone with no appreciation (I just wish my daughter understood so she could say nice things instead of mean toddler tantrums).

OK, enough self-pity, I have to get back to work; sorry to unload on your comment.
