I do understand where you're coming from, because when The General's Daughter came out years ago, it was just way too fresh for me, and I had to leave the room. 

I think each movie treats it differently, however. Some movies it really isn't necessary, and some it serves a purpose. 

I haven't seen Divergent yet, but I'm hoping that this is one of those movies where it serves the purpose of opening up the conversation about rape and consent.
