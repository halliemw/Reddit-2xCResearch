High five!

I'm one of the two girls in a research group and this one guy kept stealing my ideas and suggestions. We worked on the same project so I naively thought we were supposed to co-operate. He would present my data as his, when I solved a problem he would claim it was his etc.

In the end I started doing what you did: keep notes and call him out on it. I wish I got a photo if his face once! Literally a few hours before, I gave him a paper (email - in order to keep paper trail) that was highly relevant. He walks in to the meeting and said "Hey! I found this paper that is perfect for our project!" and I replied with "You mean the one I sent you by email a while ago?". His expression was priceless!

I also asked him for documentation and original data files and suddenly the only ones that were found were those I've done. Lucky for me I kept a meticulous lab book...
