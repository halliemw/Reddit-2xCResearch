There are expectations of how men should behave as well as women, and maybe he's just struggled with those expectations & that pressure. We know there is pressure on men to be in shape and tall is still part of what society tells us is masculine and attractive. 5'8" is average - the gym stuff is probably compensating for feeling small at earlier points in life... it's hard to know what people experienced previously. 

But you can't solve all of the insecurities... I mean, we see the reverse kind of post a lot, right? I see posts from women about their insecurities and how nothing their partners say really changes that. Likewise, for your bf -this stuff has to come from him. Outside validation is only a small piece of that.

Therapy sounds good... (he doesn't have to see a psychiatrist, there are different kinds of therapy available.) What helped me when I really needed to go to therapy and was being resistant was my bf at the time saying, "I care about you and you have all my support, but I could use some help in that." Sometimes we are willing to do things for other people that we can't do for ourselves, but getting there for whatever reason can help a great deal!
