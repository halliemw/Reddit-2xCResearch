That's my point. Someone might not know that being drunk and dancing on you isn't consent. That making out under the bleachers isn't consent. That wanting to wake the one night stand sleeping next to you with some more sex isn't consent. I think the biggest problem isn't that people don't know not to rape... it's that they don't exactly know what consent means. I'm not afraid of the man waiting in the alley waiting for me to walk by. I'm afraid of the guy who drives me home after a night of drinking and invites himself in when I'm not in the presence of mind to say no. And THAT is the problem we should focus on. 

I did love the, "I wouldn't blame her, I would help her." Something else we need to hear.
