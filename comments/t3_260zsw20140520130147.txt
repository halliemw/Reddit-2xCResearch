>if he fully accepts you.. I mean respects you and your choices because he loves you no matter his faith, then he may be the one. But if he is going to put his faith over his love and respect for you, dictate what you can think/say, you run the risk of having a very hard painful time.

Thank you for this reminder.

>Remember this is your ticket to the journey of life, don't get on the wrong train. Be careful and best of luck.

Much appreciated.
