This was an intense episode.  The first half of the show was endearing (when she was joking around with him and asking him out etc) and kind of a brutally honest commentary on dating.  But then...it just kept going, and going and going.  I found the monologue very cringe-worthy.  Why was I so uncomfortable?  And uncomfortable for feeling uncomfortable?  I suppose that was the point--like a work of art that induces a feeling other than pleasure.  By the end I was angry at her for being so...desperate.  Angry at him for being a douche and so damn like-able at the same time.  Damn.
