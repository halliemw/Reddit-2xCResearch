It just seems so impossible and that's why I'm so reluctant, I think. Even with me missing my pills and being so close to my period when we had sex, it seems impossible. It's also really scary too because I am in no position to have a child. I'm a freshman in college, we could be losing our house to foreclosure, and my dad is very depressed. I don't want to be reluctant to take the test, I just want to be not pregnant..
