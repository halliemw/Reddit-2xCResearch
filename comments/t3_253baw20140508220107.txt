When I wasn't taking BC pills, I was having sharp pains during sex and often random stabbing pain throughout the day. Walking a lot caused my lower back to throb. I also had pretty heavy and painful periods. Occasionally I'll still experience pain during sex, but typically only around my period.  

I'm concerned about fertility issues as well, but my mom had much more severe issues than I do and she managed to have me. (:
