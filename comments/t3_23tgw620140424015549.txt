You can also try boric acid capsules in the vagina.  Boric acid is poisonous to eat, but I've heard great anecdotal reports of it working well for BV and it is safe to use vaginally.  You have to make your own capsules, get size zero gel caps, try asking at a pharmacy or health food store.  Fill them with boric acid (aka "Borax" in the laundry aisle) then put one inside your vagina every night for five days at least.  I don't know if it kills the bad over growing bacteria or just acidifies the environment to support growth of the good bacteria.  It certainly isn't harmful.  

Bacteria love dark, wet, warm places.  So try to air out the vulva all you can!  It might be hard to go commando during the day with the discharge, but try to do that at night or around the house.  And DEFINITELY avoid scented hygiene products- soap, tampons, pantiliners.  Try only washing your genitals with water- no soap- while things are trying to clear up.  The fragrances just make the good bacteria crap out more easily.  Douching can make the problem worse because it washes all good bacteria away as well.  

Good luck!  Poor little vagina...  :(
