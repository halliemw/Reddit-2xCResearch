Not sure, it's been fits and starts. I struggled in the beginning of my college career 'cause I wasn't used to being an adult and I was dealing with depression. Now I'm better at both, but I'm out of the country and can't move forward until I get back in the US. I finally figured out that I want to be a nurse, though, and as soon as I'm back on glorious American soil I'm gonna kick all the ass. 

Congratulations again! Sorry about the dumbasses. Pretty shitty lives they must lead, huh?
