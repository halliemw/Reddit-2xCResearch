I've been where you are now. In some ways it got easier for me, in others it was only more complex as time went on. I don't ever second guess that I made the best decision for myself - yet that doesn't take away the 'could have been' or regret that I was in that position in the first place. Something few people seem to get. My experience was pretty traumatic due to outside circumstances - and yet I loved that person that could have been my baby - even though I couldn't keep him/her.
 
Over 5 years later, I have come to realize that the experience has, for better or worse, given me tools in which I now can relate directly to people who are caught in place like I was. I can understand other women better and maybe even offer something to them if needed - be it the choice to keep it or not. It has made me a better listener, a better person in understanding the complexity of life - its now something I chose to draw upon when there is need so that maybe others don't feel as alone as I did. At least that is how I look at it. Doesn't take away the pain, but makes seem less pointless at times.

I found this quote when I was going through my experience and have since shared with a few women who have found it helpful - along with others who were having a hard time grasping the intense emotions about the choice of an abortion, and how even though it was the absolute best thing for me personally - it still hurt emotionally. Maybe you'll find it useful if you don't already know it.

"No woman wants an abortion as she wants an ice cream cone or a Porsche. She wants an abortion as an animal caught in a trap wants to gnaw off its own leg." ~Frederica Mathewes-Green
