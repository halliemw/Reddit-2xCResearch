Most couples do best if they are not around each other 24/7. You are already getting married, living, and working together.  Sharing the same office as well is a little much for even the most calm relationships.  

It is healthy for people in a relationship to have some time apart.  It is likely that deciding not to share an office was made deliberately to *protect* the relationship.  I'd ask him about it.
