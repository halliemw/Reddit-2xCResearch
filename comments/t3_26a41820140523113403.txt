You are obligated to nobody to use your body for something other than your own pursuits, desires and pleasures. It often takes women a lifetime to take full ownership of their bodies and therefore their power. I am glad you are on the path to letting go of other people's ideas about your body.

I did the pregnancy where you did not; I wish I'd waited to have the support and love that you describe your friend having. At the end of that pregnancy, I had a pulmonary embolism; I consider myself very lucky to have survived. My point is that for some women, you might only get one go at it. Pregnancy is dangerous biznezz.

I've had an abortion since then and I got guilt from people who were my friends, even though keeping it would have meant risking another vascular incident that could easily kill me. People are fucked up about what they think women owe this world.
