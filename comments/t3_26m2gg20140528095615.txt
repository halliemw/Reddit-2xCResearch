I am so glad you stopped by and shared your story.  I feel like we can really relate to one another; I'm 26 years old and it sounds like our mothers are quite similar.

If I break up with a boyfriend, she gets angry at me and says that I didn't think of her feelings.  She says, "You bring these boys around and I get attached to them."  I'm willing to bet your mom does the same thing.

The part of your post that really hit close to home for me is when you said that you can't share things with her.  It's truly disheartening.
