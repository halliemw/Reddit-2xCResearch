When I was about 8 or so a friend of mine and I were hanging out at her dad's. She wanted to play mommy and daddy and make babies - which we knew the basic mechanisms for. We stayed clothed and didn't actually touch but we kind of hovered one over the other and pretend made out and had a bunch of imaginary babies. Whoever played the dad would be on top. For the longest time I was embarrassed and even convinced that what we did made me a lesbian (am definitely not). Now it's just a cringeworthy story.

I doubt an 8 year old can have malicious intent to molest someone. I think she was trying to mimic what she maybe saw her parents do or saw in a movie and didn't really understand the implications of what she was doing. It wasn't right at all but I don't think that it is something you should be ashamed of in the least.
