Well...yeah, technically, that's accurate, but you don't have to paint with such a broad brush.

Our culture has many misogynist elements. As a result, all of us - in ways subtle and not - have a normalized view of misogyny. Are all men misogynists? Of course not. But do we live in a world where misogyny is in many ways accepted, promoted, normalized? Absolutely. And extremism is born out of that.
