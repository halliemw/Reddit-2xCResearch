I totally get it!!! I am 25 and 5 foot tall. I weigh 135 lbs, which sounds normal, but according to BMI calculators, I am medically overweight. When I feel terrible about how short my legs are, I think of people like Kim and Kourtney K, Scarlett Johannson and Emma Watson, all who are under 5'4" and considered among the most attractive women. I've just recently started dressing/ looking my age.Hair style is important, as is wearing some makeup. Especially eye makeup for me. Clothes... I know you said you hate the petite section, but have you tried places like Gap or banana republic? I almost always find great things at BR, also JCpenney sometimes has a decent selection. People always ask me what grade I am in. I was actually at work (I work in a law office..open during school hours) one day and someone asked me when I graduate. ummmmm wut??? 

I absolutely feel like I don't get treated as an adult woman. I hate it. I don't like being called "cute" especially.
