Keep following up with law enforcement on the case and make sure they know this guy is still harassing you, request a restraining order or an order of protection asap. Do you have friends or family that can check up on you on a regular basis or that you can stay with temporarily? Anybody friendly that can drop in and pay you visits at work? 

Definitely document all of this online activity - it's good that you've already given so much of it over to the detectives but also keep a backup *just in case*. 

I'm really sorry this happened. An already terrifying situation is not easy to handle after a trauma like that. I really suggest checking out [RAINN](http://www.rainn.org/) and giving their hotline a try (there's an online version but you can also use the national # at the bottom of the page if you want to talk to somebody on the phone). I hope this helps!
