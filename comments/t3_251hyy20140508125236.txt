I was born here in Northern Ireland and have lived here my entire life. This is all just a sickening disgusting mess on both sides. I pay my taxes just as every woman (and man) in England does, why should my rights be lesser than theirs? It will cost me easily 3 months rent to get an abortion in England, how could any average woman afford that? 

The English governments seem too scared of upsetting our politicians so they let our insulting, childish, absolutely **disgusting** politicians have their bans on abortion, on gay marriage, on blood donation by gay men. It's an absolute disgrace and it's no wonder so many of our young people are leaving the country as soon as they can. 

I'm sorry if I come across as harsh on this, but these 'people' are worse than children, worse than animals. As long as they are allowed their old  religious white guy lives to stay exactly the same forever, they do not care about anyone else. I am genuinely ready to cry about how unbelievable this country is.
