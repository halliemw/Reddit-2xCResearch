Childfree and had a Mirena put in in March. The first time it was attempted the doctor botched it BAD. She was a family physician my doctor recommended, and not only did she have to give up because she couldn't get it in, there was blood EVERYWHERE. I waited a year before nuttting up enough to try again. 

So I went to a women's clinic. One of the doctors I work for recommended this place, it's a high security abortion clinic that also happens to do IUD's. And they do hundreds per month. 

The difference was ASTOUNDING. I took a couple extra strength Tylenol and she was done in 5 minutes. I felt a pinch, went 'heerrp' she said "I know but I'm done now" and I said "Wat." 

She even verified the position with an ultrasound right there. Blew my mind. So it might not be that you have a stupidly low pain tolerance, it's possible you have a not so great doctor. :)
