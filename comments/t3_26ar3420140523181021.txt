I think this is the kind of thing you can only find out by asking him directly. While I personally have a half sleeve myself, I can understand how someone else might find them problematic while not having an issue with other types or locations of tattoos. Even those of us who like body modifications all surely have something that we dislike, either to the extent that we wouldn't do it ourselves, or to such an extent that it would really trouble us to see it on a significant other. Either way, it's your decision and not his, but it seems worth at least asking him what bothers him about this particular tattoo.
