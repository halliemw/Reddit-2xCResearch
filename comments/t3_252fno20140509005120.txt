Yes, and my point was merely if your perception of the world enlightens me in someway I do not care what gender you are. I'm aware of the subtle difference between men and women, but again if the perspective is enlightening I don't care if the person shares the perspective in a forum made for those who didn't grow up with the experiences that led to that perspective.

This the territory that comes with being a default board. The only way a gender exclusionary board works is when it's small and unknown; because there is no way to ban the other gender from participating (which I think is just wrong regardless of the creators intent of the subreddit). 

The only other way for a subreddit to declare itself a purely gender specific perspective subreddit, is to use an honor system, ie expecting the other gender to abide by the unwritten rule to not participate. And there is no honor on the internet.
