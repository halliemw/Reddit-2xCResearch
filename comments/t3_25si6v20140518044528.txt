That's not what she said.  Sometimes she said "I don't want to her a man speak at all, period." 

Replace that with the word woman.

"Sometimes, I just don't care about what a woman says, no matter how correct or insightful her words are. My world is so so full of women."

That is a sexist statement. 

It is. 

Read it again. 

It is.

If you support that statement you are sexist. 

If that is what feminism is, it is misandry. 

Welcome to reality.
