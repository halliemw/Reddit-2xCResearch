Every once in a while I look into other options, and I always decide to stick with the pill. I don't have any side effects or problems with it, so why not? An IUD seems too risky for adverse effects, I don't like the idea of having to stick a nuva ring in and keep it in my vagina. I have a hard time not picking at things on my skin so I don't think the patch would work well for me. And I'm not interested in any birth control options that would take away my period.
