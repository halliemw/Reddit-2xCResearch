Using the implication that being homosexual is negative is offensive and not the right way to combat a bully. It lowers the caliber of the discussion and doesn't hit home that what the man is doing is wrong. Plus if they also have negative opinions on sexual orientation on top of gender, it will only help validate them as you'd be thought of as agreeing with them that homosexuals are to be thought of in a negative context.
