After I got engaged and calmed down from the surprise and excitement, I definitely had a moment where I paused and asked myself as objectively as possible, "am I doing the right thing?" I considered it carefully for a moment because I am just a super cautious person and realised that yes, it was absolutely just right. To be fair, I did this at every major milestone in our relationship (and in my life in general) because I'm definitely an over-thinker. That was the only moment in which I questioned things. We've been together 7 years and got married this past October. Best decision I ever made! I think if you had that visceral of a reaction, you probably made the right choice. What you felt doesn't sound like anxiety, it sounds like *aversion* and that is a big distinction.
