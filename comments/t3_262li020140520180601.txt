I'm a guy, but there is a reason they were torn down.

Its not about sexualizing 13 year olds, its about appropriate attire.

Schools whole point is to prepare you for the real world, a world where there are dress codes.


And this isn't a "female" thing. Are boys allowed to wear what you want to wear? What *they* want to wear? "Thats crazy, boys shouldn't want to wear skirts", exactly. It would be *inappropriate* attire to wear to a school.


To change a dress code, you would need the student body and the principal most likely. A good way to *not* get that would be to alienate half the students in your school and give the principal a reason to turn your cause down.
