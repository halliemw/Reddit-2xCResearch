>If we know that gendering words has the power to cause harm, then why is the evil force that is designed to oppress half of the world's population named after men? (patriarchy) 

But the word matriarchy exists too, and has been used to accurately describe societies where women are the primary ruling force. The issue is that there's a power imbalance based on gender. Whether or not a man participates actively in it, he benefits from it. Whether or not a woman fights against it, she's harmed by it. This particular issue *is* gendered, and therefore, we use gendered language to describe it.
