I am dying laughing here! I feel your pain! I had a broken ankle one time (really bad) and the hospital was full - the Ambulance workers wheeled me into an empty hallway to wait on a person - I don't know who, to see me and decide what to do with me. (it wasn't rocket science, just plain ineptness of a crappy ER) anyway while on a gurney in the hallway, unable to move, no one to hear my cries.... I started. then they proceeded to leave me forgotten in this hallway for 3 freakin hours! Bleeding heavy, broken in 4 places ankle and couldn't move, nothing to do but sob in pain and bleed all over myself.... when my mom came around that corner finally and found me... I've never been so happy to see someone in my life! and thank God it was my mom, although after 3 hours I wouldn't have cared if it was Brad Pitt himself that finally showed up - someone was going to help me find a bathroom and help me use it!! LOL I ended up having to wait to get to a room to "clean up" and the staff was falling all over themselves trying to be attentive at this point cause my fiesty mom and given them a giant what for for lossing me - so here I am, strangers getting close, me having that God aweful smell and praying the white sheet over me wasn't touching what used to be a white sheet under me.... I finally get a room and just as mom and I are about to clean me up the Doc barges in with a nurse, saying they are taking me straight to surgery..... That was the last of my being descret about the issue.... I said great - but we're going to need a min. The doc looked puzzled and I just gave him a look like I was going to gnaw his head off.... He must have been married or something, cause I honestly believe he knew the reason and said, take your time, she can find me when you are ready. LOLOLOL. (Not as bad as your story, but you definatly gave me a flash back!)
