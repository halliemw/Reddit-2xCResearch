You do in fact have about 10 years before you have to make a decision. There's a lot of hype around the risks of having kids after 30 or 35 or 40, and while the risks are real, they aren't as terrible as people make them seem. My mom had two healthy kids and two fairly healthy pregnancies at 38 and 41. There were only minor complications, like with me she was high risk for placenta previa but was fine and she had consistently slightly high blood sugar with my brother, but not enough for a GD diagnosis. But those things happen to young women, too, and it's always a bit of a gamble. Risks for things like Down's syndrome do go up dramatically at 35, to 1 in 400. Chances are a late pregnancy will still be a healthy pregnancy, so if you get to 35 or even 40 and you decide that you do want that kid, you can still go for it.
