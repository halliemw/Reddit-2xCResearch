No, you shouldn't be able to see the thong. This is actually why I like them, because I have a little junk in the trunk, and most underwear either fit my butt or my hips but not both. With a thong, the size of my butt doesn't matter and I can just worry about my hips.

As for the feeling it thing, I've experienced that before with certain thongs, and I find it uncomfortable. My favorite thongs are from Victorias Secret. They're called the Lacie I think, and they're one size fits all. I will say if you're going to be wearing thongs, be sure to stay well hydrated, because they do increase your risk of UTIs. If you have a badonkadonk problem like me, you could always try cheekies, too. Their fit usually doesn't depend much on your butt size, either, since they're only supposed to cover half of it. And there's the bonus of no increased risk of UTIs, especially if you get cotton ones.
