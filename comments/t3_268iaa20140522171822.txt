I think Zhaan from farscape fits what you're describing.  

Shes strong, smart, not afraid to get her hands dirty to do what needs to be done and won't be stepped on. She also has values that she sticks to. She's definitely beautiful and is [confident](http://farscapegifs.tumblr.com/post/56312206348) (possibly nsfw) in her appearance but not a 'look at me I'm sexy and hot without even trying', kind of person. 

I don't think most guys are into bald, average shapped, religious, murder( assassin?) plant-people. Definitely on the list of awesome woman though.
