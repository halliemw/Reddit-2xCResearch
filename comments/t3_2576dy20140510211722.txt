I understand celebrating a woman's sexuality as a reaction to how FGM is meant to stunt the sexual drive of women, but in this case, it just isn't tasteful.

Would it also be appropriate to use people having consensual sex in public to raise awareness for human trafficking? Girls put into the sex trade are forced to have sex with Johns, so consensual sex between adults would show the opposite of the bad outcome, right?

Of course, this example won't actually happen because public sex is illegal in most places. More than that, both of these issues are sensitive because they involve children and sex. Some level of respect is in order to combat this issue.

Besides, this issue is not just about these girls and women having the ability to orgasm. It's also about them having the right to posses a natural part of their own bodies, to not have to undergo painful rituals and surgeries or to have to live with physical pain that can sometimes stay accompany them their entire lives.

Hell, if they had taken a significant moment to go over the facts of what they were "raising awareness" for, I would be more forgiving. The way they did this, it comes off as little more than the PUAs getting their jollies from convincing women to come in front of them.
