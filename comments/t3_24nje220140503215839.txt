I was told at my University last week that girls are starting to go into puberty younger than ever before - ages 8-9 is becoming more common than girls our age getting theirs at ages 12-13 (I'm also 20). I had a girl in my year that got her period at aged 10, so I guess it wasn't wildly unheard of even in 2004.
