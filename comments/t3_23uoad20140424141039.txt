Right.  I think we're agreeing but somehow still misunderstanding each other.  Fanperson isn't a term at all - I just made it up to illustrate a point.  I wouldn't expect anyone to use that term or call anyone a sexist for not using it.  But I would still call a man sexist for using "fangirl" disparagingly without mentioning "fanboys" in a similar way - just because our language is (inappropriately and problematically, in my opinion) gendered, it doesn't mean you can use that as an excuse to single out one (already discriminated) group.

Hence why I said the company selling the shirts might not be sexist, the person choosing to wear it almost certainly is.
