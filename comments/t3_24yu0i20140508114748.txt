I am recently divorced, but doing fairly well financially.  I own my home, have a good job, and do alright for myself.  My boyfriend is also divorced, but has enormous child support responsibilities.  After his last relationship ended he managed to get himself into an enormous amount of credit card debt as well.  

I invited him to move in with me, rent free, until he got his finances settled.  It was really, really hard for him to take.  As I explained to him, and I'm sure your boyfriend would explain to you -- We are a team.  We take care of each other.  Right now, the thing I'm getting out of this is that I get to live with you, which I wouldn't get to do otherwise.  I get to have you in my bed at night, and eating breakfast with me in the morning.  I have someone to do yard work with.  Someone to drive places with.  I have a friend, and a companion.  That's what I want.  

Also, from my perspective - I'm going to be paying the mortgage either way.  So either I pay the mortgage alone but have a partner for all the other stuff, or I pay the mortgage alone, period.   The first is definitely a better deal.
