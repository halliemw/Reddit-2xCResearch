My reaction is a resounding "Eh."  I wasn't there, but from what I read, it just sounds like a skeevy dentist who was trying to drum up some extra business, seeing as they charge out the ass for cosmetic surgery and most insurances (in the US) won't cover that.

This kinda seems to cheapen sexual harassment, considering that there are "grab butts and give the ol' elevator eyes" still.  OTOH, if anyone is harassed by their dentist, blogging about it isn't the best option.  Absolutely switch practices, and write a complaint to the local board of dentistry, file a complaint to the local dental professional organization/union or file the complaint to your state.
