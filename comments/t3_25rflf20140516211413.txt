Some boyfriends can be controlling. I dated a girl who once said an ex told her how to dress when going out places, what types of behavior she COULD NOT have around other men at a party, and even how long her skirts should be at particular events/parties.

Sounds like your boyfriend is a low-level control freak, so just don't encourage his behavior.
