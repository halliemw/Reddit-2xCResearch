I have a similar build and had good luck getting dress pants at TJ Maxx. They have lots of different brands so you're able to just try on different stuff and see what works. My workplace is casual so I wear jeans to work almost every day, and the best "grown up" jean I've found is the Land's End Fit 1 cut. I love those jeans because they're structured and have a higher rise so no booty issues, plus more of a boot cut so IMO more professional look. I think they have cords and maybe dress pants in that cut as well.
