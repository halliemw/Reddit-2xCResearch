This sub has a lot of radfems. The fact that you can't stand other's opinions shows you're one yourself. I was mainly speaking about you, not the sub as a whole.

So r/mensrights is misogynist, but 2xc is not sexist? Why? Because feminists aren't sexist but the other side of the coin is? See, this is the entire reason why you don't think radfems are here. You're narrow viewpoint has been protected. Now you're exposed to other viewpoints and can't handle people questioning the borderline sexist views that this sub SOMETIMES has.
