I can understand some of that but what I could never wrap my head around is the physical abuse.  But perhaps I will never truly understand it.

Thanks for all of that, though.  I like to think I never did anything of the sort in my relationships, but what if the guy is not aware thats what he is doing?  Assuming he is not beating in her or anything like that.
