I never suspected the "what's in this drink" line was implying date-rape drug, unless you consider alcohol a date rape drug (which has some validity).  That still doesn't change how the song comes off out of context or even in context.  The wolf wants sex, the mouse repeatedly expresses a desire to leave, he/she repeatedly ignores her/him while plying her/him with alcohol.

Also, that article doesn't even bother addressing the printed score which labels the two parts as "wolf" and "mouse."  Implying that one is clearly an aggressive predator while the other is a timid prey.

The whole thing can easily (especially but not exclusively in the context of modern society) be interpreted as a "persistence breaks down resistance" situation with some alcohol and veiled threats tossed in for good measure.
