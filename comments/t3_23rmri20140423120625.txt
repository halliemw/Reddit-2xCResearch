You're definitely over-thinking it. I'm positive one of those admins organized the event and thought to invite you, and she likely knows who she works with. It sounds like a completely casual thing and if you said no because you insisted you weren't part of admin it might come across as insulting. 

You should especially go if you find all the women you work with "catty" and disrespectful. I seriously doubt they all are. They're giving you a chance to get to know them and you're worried about how it will look? 

Also for fucks sake free lunch.
