I wonder if this could be just her way to deal all those things she sees in her job? My daughters godfathers girlfriend (atleast not her neighbours aunts cat) works in urgent Child protection service and while she is lovely lady, it's kinda creepy how she talks about my daughter. There has been one-liners "it's fascinating that she keeps eye contact with other humans." "Oh, she comes to you to ask help, how extraordinary". These are translations so not totally accurate but you may get the point. She doesn't mean that I'm bad mother and my baby is doing well despite me being in her parent, she just haven't used to be with normal kids. All the kids she see are neglected, badly treated, abused... List goes on.

I try to say that maybe your MIL is just having hard time to grasp that the reality she sees in work isn't the norm?
