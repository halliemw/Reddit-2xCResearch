That's a fair point... I think now is the time to talk about how people get so messed up and to try to cultivate more kindness toward the weak. It troubles me to see people responding to an extremist act of hate and blame with their own brand of hate and blame. But the problem doesn't lie particularly with women... I can see how /u/funroll-loops post might be read as suggesting it is. Sorry, still talking, I'll take this to a more appropriate forum. Cheerio.
