Sorry, I forgot to mention it in the post! I've said it to somebody else, but yes, she is planning on moving to Norway when she's old enough to live with him/close to him.

I'm not telling her how to live her life *at all* either. I'm a worried friend coming to Reddit for advice, I'm not telling her to break up with him or anything, I just wanted a few more opinions.

Like others have said, there is a lot of harm that can be done without actually causing physical harm to her. If you're unaware of that, I suggest that *you* grow up, plox.
