Well, are you actually gaining 20 lbs? It probably just feels that way but it will go away! I just had a particularly rough period and I have found that the best decision I ever made was to invest in some good period-clothing. Stuff that doesn't require fucking spanx (the devil's undergarment) while still looking cute. Im glad for the 90's trend because BABYDOLL DRESSES.
