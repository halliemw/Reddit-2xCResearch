Right. And I'm sick or people defending this kind of thing by saying "it's just acting!!!" or saying it's no different from an American actor portraying a British character or an actor portraying an alien or monster character. 

It's just really disappointing that actual trans actors and actresses have to scrape by on bit roles that usually involve them being a punchline and even when actually decent roles for trans characters show up, they're usually snatched by cis actors and actresses who already have access to so many other decent roles.
