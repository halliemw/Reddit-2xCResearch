I hope you will be ok. But..there is but.

lets say there is a cycle

*a set of events or actions that happen again and again in the same order : a repeating series of events or actions*

That you are repeating over and over again. You feel pretty good than you feel lonely and something is missing..than you have random hook up..than you are feeling relay bad..and than with a time you feel better..and than you fell lonely..and you repeat the chain of events.

You are in the part of the chain of events when you are starting to feel better. But, chain of events continues. And it will continue until you find out what did (in the first place) started this chain of events

You need to find out what have started this chain of events..than you can stop doing it. Find the root cause for this chain of events and correct it

*A root cause is an initiating cause of a causal chain which leads to an outcome or effect of interest. Commonly, root cause is used to describe the depth in the causal chain where an intervention could reasonably be implemented to change performance and prevent an undesirable outcome.*
