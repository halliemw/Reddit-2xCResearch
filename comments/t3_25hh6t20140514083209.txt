I can't stand the personal attacks. If you can't have a healthy discussion or disagree with someone without getting angry and feeling the need to hit below the belt, then you should reevaluate yourself on maturity. I understand that a lot are passionate about things, but channel that passion to good use, not ripping another woman or even another person down for disagreeing just to say "I win".
