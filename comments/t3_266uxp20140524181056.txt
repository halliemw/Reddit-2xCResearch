Thank you for taking the time to reply to this thread. You and my counselor this week recommended "Stop Walking on Eggshells" so I am definitely going to pick it up. 

I have gone through DBT for my issues and found it extremely helpful.(This was before we started dating, neither of us knew each others history outside when we met. We actually met at a Church) She is working on finding a DBT group to go to and is currently working on it with her counselor. She is and has repeatedly shown her desire to work through this with her treatment team. She thankfully is participating in therapy.

To answer the last question. Yes she has BPD and has been officially diagnosed. She is in treatment. Things are improving.

I appreciate your quote "Imagine having no skin. Every touch, every movement, everything, hurts. People with [BPD] have no emotional skin." This made me think a lot in these past two days of how to minimize the emotional pain that I can unintentionally cause. I am working on being more intentional about what I say and how I act. Last night she set some important papers down on a wet towel, and I made a comment about it. Thinking about what your supervisor said made me think quite a bit and in reality what I said didn't need to be said. The papers where fine and it was a simple oversight, she took it hard and I had to explain what my thought process was. Her taking it hard is exactly that, she has no emotional skin, the words hurt because of that. There was no episode that night. 

In all my rambling, thank you for your reply. To put you at ease, I asked the internet for advice but as well talked with my counselor and am researching what to do based on all the input.

P.S. I have lost this accounts password and need to reboot my computer so there won't be replies from OP.
