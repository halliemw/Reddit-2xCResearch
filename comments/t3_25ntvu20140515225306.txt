I would say it's good to get off the internet once in a while. Its one thing to be informed and another to surround yourself with so many examples of sexism that it seems like the only thing men do are grope and create glass ceilings. In reality, you could easily be working for a woman or work in a place where sex isn't an issue. If you don't work in a place like that, maybe its best to switch to a company that cares about women in the workplace. Remember, stay informed, but don't surround yourself with "the sky is falling" type articles.
