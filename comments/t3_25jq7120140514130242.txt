This is something that comes up again and again and I really feel it must be addressed. Saying that feminism is one-sided because the word contains the root "fem" is akin to saying, "What do you mean you under**stand**? You're sitting down!"

And, more broadly, I disagree with your assessment of the concept of feminism, or the idea that, because equality is a good thing, we do not need feminism, feminism is just about female superiority, etc etc. I think that feminism deals with the question of how our conceptions of women and femaleness influence our beliefs about everyone, in ways that we might not notice. And this can have very subtle effects, for instance in your statement regarding how feminism "actually comes across." It would, of course, be more accurate to say that your description is how you *actually perceive* feminism, to put an emphasis on the fact that this is your own, subjective experience in response to it, and maybe it is wrong or stems from particular habits you have in thinking.

Beyond that, however, I think feminism deals with the fact that there are those things between men and women that, sometimes, can never really be equal. For instance, pregnancy is never an equal experience between men and women. Nobody cares if individuals born without a uterus have access to abortion or not. There are issues about gender where the concept of "equality" becomes far more difficult, where we must consider the impact of these things on men and women differently, and so on and so forth.
