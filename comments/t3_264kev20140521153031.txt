It's also important, I think, for teachers to receive training on how to enforce a dress code in schools. I am a corporate trainer and we are constantly going over "talking points." What is the best way to approach a sensitive subject with a customer? What are the tools to use to talk down an irate customer? I don't think this skill is inherent - it is learned and grown through practice. Teachers in the US typically receive development days. It wouldn't be difficult to sneak in an hour for a topic like this.
