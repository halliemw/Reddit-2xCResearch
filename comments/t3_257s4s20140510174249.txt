I actually did it four times. First boyfriend I got back together with. Eventually it was over. The second one was far more manipulative and cold and I dumped him and got back together a second time. It's awful and I feel sick thinking about how the second guy really prayed upon my insecurities. It makes me feel even worse when I hear the "I know how you feel" thing - no one should have to go through this.
