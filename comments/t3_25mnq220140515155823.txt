Hey, different strokes for different folks. As someone without children I can't personally speak to whether or not a woman should breastfeed, but I don't think there's any shame in choosing not to breastfeed. I would imagine there are quite a few women who have to stop taking mood-related medications during pregnancy that would be better off not prolonging the period in which they're unmedicated, especially with postpartum depression being a risk.
