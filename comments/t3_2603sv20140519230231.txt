I used to get all sorts of weird nipple hair, but it went away when I started birth control ... I don't know if that would work for you, but it might be worth considering.

Otherwise, I find shaving with oil to be the best way ... it eliminates any bumps/razor burn/discomfort, as it allows you to get a super close shave but also moisturizes a LOT. Coconut oil is good but anything would work (baby oil, olive oil ... just avoid 'dry' oils like castor). Bleaching could also work -- I only have experience bleaching my lady-mustache, but the stuff you get at the drug store is cheap/effective. Might be worth a shot.

Have you talked to a doctor? 

Sorry that you have this problem and hope you find a solution!
