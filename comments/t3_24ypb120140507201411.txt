Friend of mine had her wedding at a primitive church in Cape Cod. (so check national parks nearby) I don't even think the place had a door, just a little church shack thing. Her best friend got ordained and only like thirty prior were there. They only had today for parking and they played board games after.

You don't have to go traditional. You don't have to have three hundred guests. You've got options. Do what you like, and try to stay stress free. Too many stories about weddings where everything went wrong.  Don't leave yourself wishing you had just gone to the court house!
