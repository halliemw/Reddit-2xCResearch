First of all, I'm *not* downvoting you, so please don't be accusatory, that's pretty darn rude. Second, not all male action figures have a "function" as you put it, many just have an accessory. The point is that there *are* no appropriate girl super hero action figures, period. The ones that actually exits put too much focus on tits and ass. That's why the creators made these more age-appropriate toys. I'm sorry you don't think they are perfect. No toy is ever going to meet every need to be perfect.
