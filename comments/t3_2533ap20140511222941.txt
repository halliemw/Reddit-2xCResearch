That sounds really cool! 

Also, 1 strand of hair you don't have to curl when you curl your hair! ( Can you tell I am a huge optimist? ). I really wish I had curly hair - mine is straight until I sleep on it - then it is just nuts. My sister has something similar, but she has always had it - random strands at the back of her head are curly but the rest is pin-straight. 

Hair is weird.
