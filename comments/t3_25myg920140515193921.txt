I, too, have never heard of anyone becoming less attracted to their partner after taking birth control.

I didn't experience any loss of libido taking birth control.

If anything, my boobs filled out a little more once I was on BC, and even after having two children, and breastfeeding them both, I don't have stretch marks on them.  (Although, since I'm in my 40s, I think I can be forgiven for a little sagginess, but I certainly never had that from BC!)

One thing I have noticed is that taking BC has made me more confident, and able to freely be in a loving relationship, without worrying about pregnancy, and with much lighter (well, for me, now that I have a hormone-enhanced IUD, pretty much non-existent) periods.  No pain, no mess, no fuss.  And believe me, I really suffered with heavy periods and pain and irritability before.

I suggest you give it a trial, and don't worry too much, it really is part of being a normal, responsible woman.  And if you are unhappy, then try something else.
