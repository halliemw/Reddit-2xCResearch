I'm a young professional too, and I find that to be taken seriously, you gotta "fake it til you make it" sometimes!  My advice is that it is 100% how you carry yourself; dressing for the part is big, but body language and communication is WAY bigger. 

-Posture. Get in the habit of using good posture so you're not thinking about it

-During group conversations, you can speak confidently in a soft voice and wait for others to speak. When others quiet down to hear what you have to say and listen to you, you know you're nailing it. Similarly, a leader doesn't need to push a conversation; leaders often step back and let the other person speak first. 

-Humbleness. Like Wilbur the pig.  True leaders strike the balance between confidence and humility - the boss who needs everyone to know that they're always right and they're above the rest, is the boss that's compensating. Treat everyone with the same attitude you'd give a peer - whether it's the janitor or the CEO.

-You ARE GOING TO GET HATERS, and you can't let the self-doubt they plant in your mind grow. I've had bosses call me a slut, ask me if they intimidate me, and yell at me because I am confident, no joke! We live in a society that doesn't always know what to do with an unfaltering confident woman! Be that woman anyway!
