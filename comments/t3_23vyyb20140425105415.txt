I think the school's punishment was too lenient, but without pressing charges, the survivor in question kind of left it in their hands to decide her attacker's guilt and punishment.

Hopefully she does use this incident as a starting point to advocate for more serious punishments for rapists and sexual predators on school campuses, but I could also understand this being a pretty traumatic experience that she doesn't want her life to revolve around.
