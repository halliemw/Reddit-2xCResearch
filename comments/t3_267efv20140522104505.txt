It's difficult to say what it was like before this post caused everyone to go searching for shitty comments and downvoting them, but in my search, it took me a long time to find the negative posts at the very bottom. I found more people responding to the few negative comments I could find that were in defense of the woman than I could actually find negative comments.

Also, I initially sorted by Best, but had to switch to Top to find anything very very low in the thread.
