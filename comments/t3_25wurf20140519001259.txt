Thank you so much for taking the time to share your story with me. I hope you won't delete your account because you've reached out to help me. If you do, I'm very sorry about it.

I am much like you describe, but in some ways not. While I'm definitely not ruling out something neurological, I think any emotional and behavioral issues I have probably stem from my upbringing and past. At least, that's my working theory for now. (Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe those things happened because of something inside me.) I'm in therapy, and plan on attacking the "no friends" thing more after my therapist comes back from a break.

This has given me a lot to think about. Thank you, again.
