That is one of the best things you can do! A lot of people don't realize that this stuff is ingrained into society early, and I think the best thing a parent can do is point it out to little kids. One of my favorite stories is of a dad watching a James Bond movie with his kids and pausing it when Bond is rolling around with a girl who's no's eventually turn into yes's, and he told the kids that was wrong.
