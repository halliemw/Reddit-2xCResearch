I had my ears pierced when I was 8, but they immediately got infected and I let them close up. I never considered getting them pierced again. I love not spending money on earrings and not having one other thing to think about.

The only thing I haven't mastered is how to deal with getting earrings as gifts. I'm always grateful that someone thought to get me a gift, and usually I think they're really cute. I never know how/if I should break the news that I don't have my ears pierced, it makes me feel guilty.

You're not alone! :)
