I agree with her to an extent-- "You canâ€™t be a great mum and keep working all the time." Key words, "working all the time." This indicates an unhealthy balance between work and family life.

Her mistake is prescribing that moms should all take a year off-- something the vast majority of women cannot afford to do without a lot of planning and sacrifice. I chose to stay home full time with my daughter, but this took years of planning for my husband and I to make it work. You can't just go from making $65k to making $35k (which is what we did) unless you spend some real time preparing for it, and make major life choices leading to that goal.

Plus, if you're generally an inattentive parent, then one year at home won't make up for that. Your kids need to know that they are always important to you, no matter the circumstances. They need to know that they matter when they are 2, and when they're 10, and 16, and everywhere in between.
