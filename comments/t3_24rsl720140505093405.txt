Well I'm of the personal opinion that sex has both a physical and emotional component that are important, so I did wait until I was an adult and in love with someone. The sex itself was kind of awkward looking back on it, but at the time it was fine. It only seems awkward now because I know what I'm doing now. 


It really depends on what kind of importance you place on sex. If it's just a physical thing, then it might not be necessary for you to wait. If there is a strong emotional component, then waiting might be better.
