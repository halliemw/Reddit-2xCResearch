Years ago my ex took me to a homeschool prom in the SF Bay Area. I hadn't been homeschooled in years, but he was just prior to going to community college. Either way, the prom had an hilarious mix of censored music, girls and guys giggling "oh man! they swore!" when an uncensored song would play, young teens dressed like low class Vegas strippers, well endowed teens in low cut but tasteful dresses, shirtless teenage men grinding on each other (and women) and full on formal fitted tuxedos & formal dresses.

It was without a doubt one of the most eclectic groups I'd ever been around when it comes to cultural/moral/ethical lines. The best part though was the hyper conservative girls that came alone, but refused to dance with anyone due to the stripper-esque guys n gals in the center of the floor. To be honest, I was rather surprised no one made a scene about it all; it really spoke to the notion that homeschoolers just wanna get along and socialize.
