You misunderstand.  There are multiple different legal conceptions of consent within the common law.

For instance, there are objective and subjective conceptions of consent.  Some conceive of consent as an objective outward expression.  Saying "yes", for example.  Others conceive of consent as a subjective state of mind.  Consent means that you actually want it deep in your heart of hearts, for example.  Then there's varying conceptions of the standard of liability.  From a strict liability standard to a negligence or knowledge standard.

It's much less clear cut then it may appear on the surface.
