Can you explain to me why it is inherently bad for a woman to want to cover up all of her skin including her fingertips? Besides the fact that you personally wouldn't want to do so, what's wrong with that? 

A societal trend isn't wrong just because you, personally, wouldn't want to follow it. And it makes even less sense to say that people's personal fashion choices are wrong. How can a fashion choice be wrong? Short of hurting someone else (wearing a T-shirt with a racial slur on it, maybe), it's all just down to personal preferences.

There's this weird Western idea that we have some kind of superpower that allows us to see the cultural forces impacting our choices in a way that people from other cultures can't.  Yeah, cultural factors affect the choices of Muslim women. They also affect the choices of Christian women, atheist women, Satanist women, and, hey, men, too. That doesn't mean that cultural factors are the only reason we make the choices we do. They are one of many factors that cause us to make the choices we do.

It is dehumanizing to Muslim women to suggest that they are incapable of making an independent decision because they, you know, grew up in a culture. We all grew up in cultures, but we still make our own choices.
