I used a version of softcup, and I hated it as well. I could never tell if it was in, and it would flip unexpectedly...THE WORST. Now I use a cup* (and have for the last 6 years) and it is night and day. I had to wear a pad for the period right after I got my IUD inserted, and it was horrible--the feeling of having blood trickle out was so foreign and..ugh. Yeah, never again. I can't imagine going back to conventional products. 

*Note--I don't remember the brand, I think it was mooncup or luna cup, but it's been so long I don't remember the packaging.
