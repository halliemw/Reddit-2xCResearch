> well lose some weight and stop being so gross and fat!

This depends on the widespread corollaries that: 

* Most persons' propensity to get fat is equally down to individual will; and 
* That therefore most fat people are that way through a laziness that thin people have the virtue to avoid.

The law of conservation of energy might be thrown in (energy consumed must equal energy stored + energy used + energy ejected) as if to suggest that denying the corollaries entails denying the laws of physics.

Edit: I'd love to learn of the basis on which downvotes were issued.
