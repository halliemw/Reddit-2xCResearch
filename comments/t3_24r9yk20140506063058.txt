If only. It's more "yes" then you would think. 

That double checking you are so happy about was either

* **redundant**, in case you were not drunk and thus perfectly able to give consent as usual

* **insufficient**, if you were actually drunk and unable to consent

When consent is concerned, being drunk is the same as being asleep. You cant get a yes from a sleeping person, no matter how well you ask.
