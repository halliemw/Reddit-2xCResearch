Did she at least make an attempt to make payment later?! That is totally insane and illegal! She needs to pay you for your time!!

That being said, I used to be a raging alcoholic (well, still am an alcoholic just in recovery) but I was totally not in control of my actions whilst intoxicated. She may very well not even know what happened. 

Can you subtly contact her and remind her to pay you? Like hey, you said you didn't have it but would get me back today?
