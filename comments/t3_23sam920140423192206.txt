How are those two things the same?  A pregnancy... something caused by 2 people, yet only one person is responsible vs a preventative surgery that benefits one person.

However, if he insisted that I get my tubes tied without wanting to do his part in any way (either by getting snipped or wearing a condom), then I would hope he would be willing to help out.  Obligated? No, because it's ultimately my decision and I could just say no.  I couldn't exactly just say no to getting pregnant.  Yes, I could have said no to sex, but I don't think it's fair that the responsibilities of pregnancy fall on the woman and the woman alone.  Both parties having sex accept the possibility of a pregnancy.
