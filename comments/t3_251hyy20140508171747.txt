Sigh, the argument that some Irish (male) politicians have Mae against abortion is that no one in Ireland needs it. Fine then, legalise it so the rest of Europe will get off your case and enjoy the fact that no one will ever, ever take it up... except the few thousand that come across to the UK every year and pay out of pocket. For fuck's sake.
