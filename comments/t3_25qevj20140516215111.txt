finally some real advice for the women out there. parents don't let their children fail or get hurt when they are young and mistakes are ok. instead the school system is busy trying to prosecute everyone and protect everyone's feelings. this will lead to a generation of wimps who don't know how to take criticism and are not comfortable with failing, getting back up, brushing off the dirt and moving forward. 

want girls to be able to compete with boys on a level playing field? than let your daughter get into a fist fight. let her get beat up. let her date and get her heart broke (just make sure she has condoms). let her fail. quit babying her. when you treat her like a boy, she will be able to compete with boys later on. if you shelter her more than boys you are giving her a handicap in the future.
