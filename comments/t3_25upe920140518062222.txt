I love this thread :) When I had more time I loved to knit. I would knit scarves for myself and for friends. Alas, I don't have nearly as much time as I would like today between work, my boyfriend, and helping my elderly parents. I do still occasionally cook, I make a mean menudo and not the Ricky Martin kind ;)
