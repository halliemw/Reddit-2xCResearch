So, I'm not really a club goer, and can't say I've ever found myself in a spot where there would be a mosh pit. 

Friends do sometimes get their friends to do things they don't want to, or wouldn't otherwise do. We think we know them well enough to bring them along, we don't want to do it and bring them to keep us company, or we think it won't be so bad with a friend there, or we drag them along because they are our friend and who better to try something new with. 

To all of those situations though, there's the don't push me there point. Where you say things like "I'll sit with you and hold your hand while you get the tattoo, but I have enough of them already", or just, "No, let me know how it goes after"  Hit that point too many times with a friend, without respecting that point, and you stop being friends. Great friends are the ones you've talked to about all sorts of limits, or experienced them with the friend, and you start respecting each other and the limits you chose to have.

You need to let them know they hit that point, that you don't like what they did, so that they can respect it. It's not overboard if it's how you felt, even if it's not rational for mosh pit safety, that doesn't mean you'll want to be dragged into the next one either, instead of thinking of the reasons and deciding to give it a try. Respecting a person's need to warm-up to an idea is part of being a friend too.
