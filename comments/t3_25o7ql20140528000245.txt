I am a SMC. By that I mean I used a donor to conceive my son.. I use the addition of 'choice' as I consider single mothers to have conceived when they were partnered and are now not partnered, and conceived the child as a result of sex (however brief the relationship with the other sex partner was) even if the Dad is no longer in the picture. I recognise that often these women did choose to be a single mother, and I only use the term SMC in an attempt to differentiate myself as my situation is so very different.
