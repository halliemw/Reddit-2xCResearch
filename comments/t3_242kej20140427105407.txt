I spend a lot of time reading and watching movies. I'll get into moods where I bake a lot or code a lot. Sometimes I'll spend all my free time studying french. Or I'll pick up my guitar after not touching it for months. Just try to find hobbies that interest you outside of the internet, because much of what you do on the internet only gives you short term satisfaction and no long lasting satisfaction with what you've accomplished. You can look back and say I read these books and learned so much versus I spent 30hrs this week on reddit. 

Ps, I think I'm still drunk from last night's bonfire -- I hope this is coherent.
