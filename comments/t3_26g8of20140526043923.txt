Yes, Penny's comments could be interpreted as attributing a socially conservative traditionalist view of gender roles to Rodger - as saying that he believed in a patriarchal structure for all society. From his own statements however it seems he was incredibly selfish, he only cared about himself and his own status, and had no view on wider society, save that it should be subservient to him.

I think the sick ideas that Rodger had got a hold of, Red Pill-type ideas that we see expressed frequently online, are a perverted version of social conservatism. They're patriarchy as seen from a highly individualistic, alienated perspective. It's patriarchy without chivalry. It says "Women are irrational beasts, inferior to men. Now how can I use that fact to get more of what I want?"

Another interpretation of Penny's comments is that she's saying that there are a lot of men out there with views similar to Rodger's. Even if, as individuals, all they believe in is a 'patriarchy of one' then the consequence of many such beliefs existing results in a collective view that 'women owe men'. Though if we drill down we find that what they each believe is 'women owe me'. I think this would be the right interpretation. Penny is focusing more on the wider context of Rodger's actions and beliefs, than on him as an individual.
