I've been a nursing mom in public and I knew for myself that people giving me judgmental looks were asshats. I didn't need some breastfeeding ambassador to point that out for me. Honestly, anyone who makes a spectacle of it, negative OR positive, is an asshat, in my opinion. If you happen to make eye contact, give her a polite smile like you would anyone else. Otherwise, good lord, nursing mothers don't need you to show your support. Passive acceptance is good enough -- that's what I always wanted.
