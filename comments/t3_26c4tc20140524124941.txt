I have never gotten as psych treatment for it, although I did go through a lot of anger management therapy as a kid (which may have stemmed from the incident). My fears are things that can be brushed off as "irrational", but I know they stem from something deeper - I don't like being picked up in any way, shape, or form at all. I freeze up and won't move.

In all honesty I don't think I need therapy. My best friend is my therapy, she's the only person in the world who can understand my moods and what can set me off. I believe that I have moved past it, mainly because it took me so long to figure out what had happened. I did relapse into cutting after I rediscovered that memory, but that was the worst of it.

But thank you for your advice and your PSA. I appreciate it :)
