I think if you think people should be held accountable for statutory, Hard Candy is the last movie you would want to reference. It does a great job of a potential victim of sexual assault and murder turning the table on a would be predator, which I could see the appeal. In creating the character of Hayley, we are given a character that understands sex, consent, sexual appeal, manipulation with the use of sex, and an all around understanding of human relations that often exceeds that of many adults. Statutory rape assumes that because of the age of the people involved in the sexual acts, they are not able to make an informed and reasonable act of consent. In that scenario, Hayley's character is not capable of being statutorily raped, and by proxy down plays the viability of statutory rape. I'm not say statutory is acceptable but saying that Hayley's character creates the image of young girls being capable of the autonomy to consent to sex there by bringing into question the point at which we age should play a role in what we consider rape.

TL;DR
Hardy Candy is an argument against statutory rape given the mentality and behavior of the character Hayley

Edit: If a person can behave and act in the way Hayley acts, we would also conclude that she is fully capable of consent regardless of the age difference between her and her sexual partner.
