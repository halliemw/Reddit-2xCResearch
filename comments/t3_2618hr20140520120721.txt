I know, right?  Silly me, I don't know how I have never thought about that before.   

Maybe the fact that I was sexually abused since the age of 6, lost my virginity by being raped in my sleep, and the fact that I had to leave my country to escape yet another rapist and his repeated attempts to kill me, might have something to do with why it doesn't easily occur to me to simply "ignore" PMs telling me that I deserve to be gang-raped.   Just a guess.
