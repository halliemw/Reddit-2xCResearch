Thanks for yet another welcoming comment lol. You're right to  some point though, I was mixing assault with harrasement (only one Word for it in spanish) but my point is that sexual harrasement must be done to an individual level for it to be sexual harrasement. If he just thinks ALL women in the office are like that, he is making no distinction, that is more of a political idea that he believes and you cant argue just like you cant argue someone's religi√≥n, however fucked up it may be. If he is saying that say Stacey is a whore and offers her body to clients then he is comitting sexual harrasement.
And yes, im listening you are saying "HOW CANT YOU SEE THIS IS SEX RELATED" I do see it, I just dont think it qualifies as sexual harrasement
