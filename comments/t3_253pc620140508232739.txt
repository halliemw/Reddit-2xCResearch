What kind of diet pill are we talking about here? I have taken ephedrine and amphetamine based pills, and yeah, they work. The suppress the appetite and boost metabolism. For me, they affected my sleep and I had anxiety attacks, but I got really skinny, which was important to me at the time. Once I stopped taking them when the one I took was outlawed (it was OTC and widely sold in gas stations) due to a number of young people dying, the weight came back in like a week. Ephedrine is still sold at drug stores in asthma medications. I've tried it since, but it just makes me sick now. It's probably for the best.
