May i ask, what kind of doctor did you go to to get diagnosed? My family, friends and my husband all have prodded gently that I may have Asperger's because I just don't...understand...things when it comes to people. I feel like a robot spitting out social cues because I've learned that's what you do in such-and-such situation ("COWORKER DID GOOD JOB. PAT BACK TWICE. SMILE."), but it is so mechanical and non natural and actually requires such effort on my part I find being social at all to be exhausting. 

I'm not even asking for me per se, because I've really just given up and say "Here's my goofy awkward self! Hoohoohoo!" But now that I have children I worry they may inherit it or even worse suffer unintentionally because I'm inept. 

Thank you, and if you don't want to share more I understand.
