So I read this and thought 'regardless of the friend's personal opinion, it's totally not okay to say that about someone's wedding dress UNLESS it is so hideous that it is a public service to warn her about it.' Then I saw the picture, the dress is lovely, you look gorgeous in it, so...there is no reason for her to say those things.
