Coming from a police officer's daughter - ain't nothing wrong with carrying mase in your hand ready to use at a moments notice. I currently live in one of the top 5 largest cities in the country, specifically in a fringey part of town. I would always leave the subway and walk home with mase in hand. No headphones in EVER and be sure to keep your head on a swivel. If you notice someone following you, try to jump inside a fast food shop or whatever is open. Alert the clerk if you have to. By making it known that you're aware of someone else's presence, that should help deter their motive. "should" is the key word, since that's not always a guarantee.

I also recently took up boxing at the local boxing gym just to switch up my cardio routine. I have a new found confidence when alone on the street.
