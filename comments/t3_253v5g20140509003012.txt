Dear lord, I'm glad you are already planning to go to the doctor. If you take Diflucan for something besides a yeast infection, it can cause problems by disrupting your body's normal methods of cleaning and healing. For now, I think you should take an extra strength swelling and pain reducer like ibuprofen, eat some yogurt or take a supplement if you have any to start replenishing your bacteria cultures, and put an ice pack, maybe not right on the vag but outside some leggings to help relieve some of the pain. 

Edit: and for the love of all things holy, do not pick/peel any of the skin on your labia, as I'm sure you already know. There's raw skin underneath that will hurt if exposed, plus it opens you up to further infection. And no home remedies! Especially not garlic or yogurt (or anything) in your vag.
