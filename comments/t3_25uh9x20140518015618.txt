Your periods may not be regular for a while, so keep pads and/or a variety of tampons on hand at all times. If you get mild cramps, heating pads and ibuprofen are your friends. If your cramps keep you from functioning and that becomes a monthly thing, talk to your doctor. Also talk to your doctor if you find that you have extreme mood swings or migraines before or during your periods. These are all things that are fairly normal when they're mild, but if they feel like they're getting in the way of you living your life, then it's time to talk to your doctor about it. Exercise also helps reduce cramps, and caffeine can help with fatigue but often makes cramps worse. Mostly, it's about figuring out what works for you and going from there.
