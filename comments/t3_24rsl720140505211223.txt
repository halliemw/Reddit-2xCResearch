1. It's not worth waiting.

2. It's... transformative, to some degree? Doing anything new is transformative. But it's mechanical, more than anything; the transition, for example, from an acquaintance into a more serious romantic relationship, is far more magical, and is not a one time thing either.

Very important to note:

Love is neither required for, nor does it necessarily result in, sex. The two are different things often grouped together, because sex with someone you love *is* very different from sex with someone you don't. But the notion that one has to wait for love to have sex is wrong.

This is not to say that one cannot, but it's the "should" that's wrong.
