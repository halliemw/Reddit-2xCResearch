I started puberty around the same age, I didn't really understand what was happening to my body to be honest. My mom was great though, she taught me about personal hygiene (including feminine hygiene), bought me my first bra etc. and just made it all seem normal.

It is also possible that your sister is just mimicking a behaviour she is seeing on TV from teen shows (the comments about feeling gross and stuff) because from my personal experience I didn't even realize that I needed to shower more often and use deodorant until my mom told me about it. Or it could be both, she could be experiencing these physical changes and she learned how to react to them through the stuff she saw in the media. 

Whatever it is the most important thing is just letting your sister know that these changes are normal and teaching her about adult hygiene. Perhaps get her a nice gift basket with things like deodorant, a nice shower gel, luffa, body lotion etc. And tell her about how to use each product properly, make it fun :)
