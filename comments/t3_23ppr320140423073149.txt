I feel you girl. I usually use an icy cold cloth with ouzo on my belly, and then a reaaaaally hot bath, and then pray and wait. Omg, the pain is truly unbearable, but the feeling when you pass the clot is pure relief and bliss. 

Last month I fainted and banged my head on the drawers :( my SO first freak out with my fall and then with the clot, he couldn't believe his eyes.

Do you maybe know what causing them? I was okay until January, since then it's clotting gallore :(
