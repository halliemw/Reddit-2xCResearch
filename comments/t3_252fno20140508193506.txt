>The out-and-out confrontational confidence of the totally ignorant is, in my experience, gendered.

My experience is different. I have met plenty of baseless arrogance from men and women alike. I can easily imagine the situation where a woman does the same thing.

I would have understood the coining of the term if the book in question was about women's issues, but it's not. 

In fact the article you linked just uses that as an example and really bases itself more on the truly disgusting patriarchal societies of the third world which are not necesseraly relevant to the mansplaining phenomenon as she describes it. The link seems to be tenuos.

People are assholes sometimes and some of them like to pretend that they know stuff when they actually have no clue. When talking about this it's really unhelpful to bring gender into he mix.

Unless there has been some stuff pulished in psychological journals about manspaining I think it's coining is a result of some preconceived bias about men or the projection of personality flaws (it seems likely that someone who easily transforms into an ingenue about a topic they have authored numerous books may have issues with their confidence) and it's use in conversation is because it's a great tool for connecting a bad thing to a gender which annoys the speaker.

I think condescension is not gender-specific.
