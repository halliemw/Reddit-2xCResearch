Give her lots of hugs and tell her you love her.  Can you go with her to the appointment?  If she hasn't done this already, you could make her a care package with things she'll need after the procedure, like tea, her favorite pain reliever, a heating pad, maybe some chocolate, etc.  Can you spend much time with her in the days after?  Just having someone to sit with her and listen might really help.  And reassure her that it's okay for her to feel whatever she's feeling, and there are no wrong emotions.

And don't forget to take care of yourself.  It's okay for you to be sad, or confused, or relieve, or whatever emotions you're feeling.  Lots of men have a hard time with their girlfriends'/wives' abortions.  It's okay.
