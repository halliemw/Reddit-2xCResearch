How tall are you? 150 pounds is not automatically big. It can be a very healthy weight for a taller girl. 

Personally, I have been roughly the same weight since I was a teenager for about 10 years but ever since switching jobs I have increased about 10 pounds. I still look fine but I am trying to be more conscious of my food choices and perhaps lose half of that. Not all. As I was quite slim before and I have a different muscle mass now.
