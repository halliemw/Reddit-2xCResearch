Your daughter sounds just like me at that age. I'm 17 now, and have found peace with my body.  I think my main concern was that everyone was shorter than me back then in the middle school days. Boys and girls I was the tallest in my group of friends for a long time. In 8th grade, I had to go to the high school to take math, and the first day I walked in, I was hit with such relief when  realized that everyone was taller than me or around my height. Patience is truly a virtue. My advice to her is just to be patient. She's not going to feel tall and awkward forever.
