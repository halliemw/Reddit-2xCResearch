I would give her a call! Tell her how much you enjoyed the shower but that you haven't received your formal invite yet-- if she's not planning on inviting you, she'll definitely have a good explanation; if she is planning on inviting you, which I imagine she probably is, she'll probably be mortified and send you an invite right away!
