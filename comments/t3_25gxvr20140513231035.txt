I watched that episode just the other day.  And the subsequent one where he takes that knowledge and raids an Army base for a weapon "not forged of man".  Not sure he's still anywhere on par with Fury though.  Not even with the eyepatch. ;)

Have you ever checked out /r/Buffy?  You might like it other there.  Really great bunch of people who love to pour over the finer points of the Buffy 'verse.
