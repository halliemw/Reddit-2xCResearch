I think I sorta love it. The first time I ever blew a guy, he went down on me as he gently fingered me back there and I found out I absolutely loved it.

Since then, I've had one another partner both finger and rim and it drives me nuts. The idea of what comes out from the ass still grosses me out a little but I have an overwhelming urge to finger whoever I'm with's ass during foreplay or sex. Sometimes they react like I just electrocuted them which is sad because my mentality is "oh try it once, you might like it!". However another partner I tried it on went absolutely nuts so it's all a matter of the person involved.
