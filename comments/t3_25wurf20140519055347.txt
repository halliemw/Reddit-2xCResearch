Wow, this is eerily similar to what I've always felt. 

From the time I was a teen, I've always wondered if I might have some slight bit of asperger's. I work as a teacher, and am in front of students all day, have great presentation skills due to it...students love me...but one on one, or in a social group setting (groups of peers) especially if I'm with someone(s) unfamiliar, I have bouts where it just doesn't 'click' and I become an awkward, fumbling idiot (at least in my mind). Mostly this is when I'm not wearing my 'teacher hat' or my 'spouse hat' (as my partner and I have great communication skills, and I find it easy to relate what's in my mind). Due to this, I find it very difficult to initiate social contact. I find myself worrying how others will respond to me. Stress seems to be a trigger too. The more relaxed I am, the easier I find it to get out of my head and pick up on the clues. Needless to say, I'm quite the loner.

I play a lot of strategy games too, and I absolutely love challenges which make me use my problem solving skills. Reading is a sincere pleasure as well. 

Another MoO fan? That's something I don't see every day. What about Master of Magic? Cheers on playing my personal favorite strategy game of all time :)

I do have a question for you though, from one gamer to another. I've noticed more and more that I'm having a bit of reluctance when it comes to trying/starting new games. I've felt a bit of fear at having to overcome the learning curve. Older, familiar games have felt safer for me, when before I'd dive into a new challenge. Have you experienced this at all (since you mentioned old games you love to play), or is this something that is just me?

We ARE everywhere, and we can have very social work lives, where we understand the relationships between ourselves and those around us, and therefore function perfectly.
