I would avoid anything on craigslist. And as for being "small and fairly naive", I'm a 6'2, 200 lbs male and would avoid craigslist roommates at all costs.

People who put out requests on craigslist usually do so because they couldn't find anybody to room with them otherwise. Which is usually not a good sign.
