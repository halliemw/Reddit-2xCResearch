It takes a while. And different parts of your body and yourself may take longer. Body hair took me LONG time to get over, but now I'm totally comfortable with it. And now that I've put on weight (due to now MUCH healthier eating habits than when I was younger and underweight), that's the thing I'm working on. You are a work in progress. So learning about yourself and becoming comfortable with yourself is a process too! Hang in there!
