Some GPs and clinics in the Uk will give a six month, two-tier prescription. It depends. 

It actually doesn't have to be refrigerated (I asked in the US at Planned Parenthood before travelling). The main issue is if you leave the ring in direct sunlight, or in a hot car, or carry it around at a rock festival in summer or something. Room temperature is ok.
