I was absolutely terrified of having this procedure and I also did extensive research and never stumbled on anything related to this, so I can't really weigh in much, but I'd say if this was something serious, the oral surgeon (who does this all the time) would have mentioned it. 

BUT! I do want to say, I was absolutely TERRIFIED of getting this procedure done (I put it off until the pain of them coming in was unbearable) and the procedure/recovery was a piece of cake. However, unlike most people, I did not sleep all day.. I guess I have the opposite reaction most people have to anesthesia. Just follow post op instructions and you should be good to go. GOOD LUCK!
