tastemymango  Sorry to read about the physical abuse you had to go through in your past, But I was happy to read about how you found love and now have a happy and healthy life! However you described my feeling to a tee!  I feel like I love him and I'm wishing this different or that I could "fix" this.  I keep coming with reason this could be all my fault!! CRAZY its not!!
I  keep thinking about the hooker and how utterly worthless I felt at that moment, He always told me I was not good enough and its just makes think  its all true. I'm mad that he would not be sweet, loving man I thought he could be, I was not worth being treated with love and respect (feeling down today).  
Sorry your mother was not supportive, only one person attempted to victim blame me. His friend said it my fault because I knew the relationship was abusive and I can't be hurt or upset him for being human.  However she did this on FB and my friends put her in her place I just blocked her from contacting me. not as simple when its your mom. 
I really enjoined your story!!  It good to know others have gone through this and these feeling will pass.  It's my choice how I allow this experience to impact life I can grow or wallow right?
