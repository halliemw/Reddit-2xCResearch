I AM *SO* THERE WITH YOU. People straight up evangelize The Miracle of the Cup because it supposedly makes your period so much better. Let me tell you that I have experienced NOTHING but frustration and disappointment. 

Over the past year, I have purchased three different cups and practiced ad nauseum and have had zero success. They seem like they are sealing but constantly leak, the tails and/or grip ridges rub uncomfortably, sometimes they press on my bladder and make me feel like I have to pee, it takes me 10-15 minutes to insert every time (inserting and reinserting to make sure it seals, which apparently it is never sealing hence leaks), underneath my cuticles gets stained brown from fishing around in my bloody vagina so much despite thorough hand washing, I think dumping out and wiping a bloody cup is totally gross, I hate having to bear down so hard to remove it that I inadvertently fart, I could go on and on about how much I hate these things.

And yet I still keep trying because everyone says to keep trying. Fuck that.
