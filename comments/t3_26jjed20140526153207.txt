Both are illegal in my state. (NY) 
I've been thinking on it, and I'd be ok with owning a hand gun, but I need a permit for those in my state. I can get a rifle or shotgun without a permit, but  even the sheer size of them makes me uncomfortable. I don't really see the point in taking a course if I don't own a gun...
