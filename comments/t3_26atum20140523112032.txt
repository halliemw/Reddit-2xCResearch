I was in that girl's awkward spot yesterday when a man sat down next to me and decided it was fine to elbow me, talk to me in "babyspeak," and ignore me repeatedly saying "not okay, not okay."
My friend did the same thing for me that you did for that girl and bless both of you for it because seriously wtf is wrong with people.
