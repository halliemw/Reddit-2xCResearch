Ive had this problem my whole life. As a kid at home I hated wearing pants and would walk around in a tshirt and undies until when I was about 12 one of my brothers friends made a comment and my parents told me I couldn't do that anymore. 

Most of my close friends, male and female, have seen me naked. That being said, it was usually in MY room or dorm suite or walking around my apartment topless. I made sure it was in my personal space occuring before assuming it would be okay to be naked or change in front of someone in their room. There is nothing inherently wrong with being naked and being naked in front of other people, but not everyone is comfortable with nudity. Some of my friends can handle it, some of my male friends can't. It makes some people uncomfortable, and I personally think if me being naked/topless/shortless makes someone uncomfortable I am close to, if not actually, sexually harassing them. It is all about the audience you are with.

 Obviously, this guy wasn't leering at you as you changed, didn't try to make a move, and isn't treating you differently so he doesn't mind. The "man friend" minds and that is just going to need to be a discussion in your relationship. My boyfriend knows I like to be naked around other people and am naked a lot in our house so our roommates will see us; however he doesn't really feel comfortable with me being topless in the house if a new person who may not know me is there because it has made some girls uncomfortable, and some guys will give me looks or say things when I leave the room that he doesn't appreciate. He doesn't tell me I can't be topless, just that some of the immature guys (we are 21-22) can't handle it and he doesn't want me to be disrespected and out of respect for him being uncomfortable I don't do it. Relationships are about communication and boundaries, if you are serious about this person and they don't like that action, then you need to compromise.
