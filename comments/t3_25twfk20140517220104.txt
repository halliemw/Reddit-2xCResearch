I was talking about RachelGarcia84.

I've been here just a long as you, albeit on different accounts. We must be looking at a very different subreddit, I completely disagree with you about the hostility towards men. There is definitely hostility towards a certain *kind* of man, that is the "not all men" man, the "devil's advocate," the one who thinks he's so important that everyone simply *must* know his opinion and that it is a MAN speaking such opinion.

Comments identifying onself as a man should for the most part be downvoted if gender is not relevant to the discussion which is the point of the downvote arrow, by the way. Hostility =/= downvoting. I would say 99.9% of the time gender is irrelevant, and thus gender should not be mentioned. Women don't go around to the rest of reddit saying things like "as a woman," because it just doesn't really have anything to do with the conversation.

ninja edit: /u/hailtunrida's comment summed it up nicely. Just don't be an asshole.
