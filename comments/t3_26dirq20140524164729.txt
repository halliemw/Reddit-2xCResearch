I think her point was that Playboy traditionally has the women displayed with shaved genitals, (in modern times anyway), and does not really have unshaved women in the pictures (which some people find unfair to women as it can make women feel like they MUST shave their genitals *for men*, even if they don't want to). So she was calling them "pussy shavers" i.e. calling them misogynistic.
