It's called knowing a person and discussing these things with them over a long period of time. I know that's impossible when you're just looking for random sex in a bar, but the OP's been married to this guy for 19 years - that's more than long enough to know someone if you bother communicating.

Btw, I like that you didn't read beyond the first line. Very impressive.
