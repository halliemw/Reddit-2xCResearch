I really wish that people would learn more about Native American culture because statements like this, "“56 million acres of U.S. soil that happen to be called Indian Country . . . Constitution-free zones where due process and equal protection rights as interpreted and enforced in U.S. courts — do not exist.” from a US Representative are so ignorant. These are people living in your country and your decisions affect them, at least take *some* time to learn how their legal system and cultures work.
