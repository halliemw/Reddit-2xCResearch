I think you're doing a really good job. This, though:

> as a Mother I'm so confused, emotionally, that part of me is infuriated, disappointed, but as I said, I'll help her get through this.

It's probably best for both of you if you can keep the fury and disappointment to yourself for at least the next few weeks. Probably channeling it into helping her get hooked up with reliable birth control is a good idea.

The amount of judgement, blame and outrage society has programmed her to expect is probably already quite enough to be dealing with when you need to go get a medical procedure done, don't you agree?
