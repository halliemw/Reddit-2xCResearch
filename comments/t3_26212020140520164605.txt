You can't have the former without admitting the later.

Part of what is at issue in discussions is whether responses are constructive. Even poorly made responses can nevertheless contain something that aids discussion, solicits a further response that clarifies an issue or illuminates a truth.

* Feelings can be wrong.
* Anecdotal evidence can contradict universal claims.
* There may be some pertinence about an experience had as a man, just as there may be some pertinence about an experience has a women, even if the originating topic chiefly goes to the experiences of women.
