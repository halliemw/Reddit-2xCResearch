Sorry, but isn't this how reddit works? You make a post that a lot of people like  it gets upvoted. If people don't like it, it gets down voted. Why should it be different for /r/TwoXChromosomes? The majority of users in the sub are women here for conversation about being women or women's experiences, not gender debate, so if you post about gender debate and it gets down voted, doesn't that make sense? 

This would be like being upset that a post about iPhone vs Android is down voted on /r/BlackBerry. Sure they're somewhat loosely related, but it's not just off topic, it's sort of contrary to the mission of the subreddit.
