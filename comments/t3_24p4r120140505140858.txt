I'm sure everyone's advice is coming from a good place and what worked for them. However, I personally wouldn't try an "elimination" diet where you stop eating a particular thing. This won't last and become a lifelong habit for you. It is ten times more important to reduce calories, even more important than exercise (at first). So if exercise is daunting or painful and you have difficulty doing it, that's fine. Work on reducing calories in. Track them every day. You most definitely will see a marked improvement.
