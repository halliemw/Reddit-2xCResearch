I audibly gasped at the part where you still have cancer inside you. I'm so sorry. 

HOWEVER it's awesome about your mom. I laughed out loud picturing my mom watching me "roll around in bed like a pill bug" because that's totally something I would do while sick. I wish you the very best of luck in your treatment!
