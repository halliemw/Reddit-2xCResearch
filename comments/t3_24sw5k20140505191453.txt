Something else I forgot to mention: he probably seemed perfect. Something that ex of mine mentioned was his ex had told him he'd be a good boyfriend to anyone. I'm not sure it was necessarily co-dependence, but he didn't have enough personality to stand on his own. You're so much better off without that.
