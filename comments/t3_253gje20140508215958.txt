I had a boy really bother me when I was about 10 years old. He would follow me around and sit with me and touch me even when I asked him nicely not to. Most of the adults at the school laughed about it and didn't do anything to help. And he basically ignored me asking him to stop, so being 10 and athletic I beat the crap out of him. Unfortunately I'm not 10 anymore and can't just beat the crap out of people. But the real problem is that his parents didn't teach him that that wasn't okay. I shouldn't have felt like I had to do that. Of course we both got in trouble but at least he left me alone.
