Its worth considering the point of natural instincts and clan tendencies. What I mean is that while we are sleeping, we are at our most vulnerable state so it can be logical to assume that with your SO out and intended to come back at an unspecified has left you subconsciously wanting to protect your sleeping space from an intruder. A sort of "keeping watch" reaction, if you will, where you develop insomnia in order to insure your and your SO's safety. 

My suggestion would be to definitely talk the issue because communication is a necessary in any relationship, but to offer the experience of having him give you a set time he will be back such as 2am and see if knowing when he is due to return allows you to fall asleep. 

Of course, I'm not an expert or a professional and I could be entirely wrong, but I think its worth trying. It's important to note though that the ETA is not a curfew its just an ETA. The idea is that a timeframe for expected noise and entrance might help to calm your subconscious and instincts for survival. 

PS, I have this problem too. My SO is involved in political student group and is a night owl (I'm not) but I find having a timeframe of arrival puts my mind more at ease.
