My wife (then girlfriend) saw a health adviser (masseuse with an ego) that told her to put her two types of birth control in her hand. They were still sealed in the bubble pack mind you (not that it would matter anyways); whichever one felt heavier would be the one to take.

This was such unsound medical advise (Quackery) I told her she should talk to an MD and not some dude who massages on people and believes in Chakras.

**EDIT** I don't mean to put Masseuses down btw; I go to a massage therapist quite often and it helps with my lower back pain (Though my therapist doesn't believe in chakras, thank goodness).
