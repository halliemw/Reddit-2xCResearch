I think the mods should never have agreed to let us be defaulted. They basically threw all of us long term users to the wolves for the sake of getting new users and theoretically, maybe someday, helping reddit be less skewed toward the masculine perspective.

I don't think that's going to happen. The young, angry, white men outnumber other sorts of users so drastically that the result is my favorite sub turning into a cesspool of trolls, mainsplaining, and downvotes for perfectly acceptable posts.

I'll probably be unsubscribing soon.
