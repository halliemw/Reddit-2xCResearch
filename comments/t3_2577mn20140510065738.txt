You can be perimenopausal (WTF. My spellcheck doesn't recognize perimenopausal??) at 41. Are you happy with your gyn? If not and if he/she isn't respecting your complaints/issues, it might be time to find a new one.
I am also in that fun perimenopausal state at 41. But I was warned after ovarian cysts at 29 that I might hit it a bit early. That said, my sister also started peri at 40. It happens. ANYWAY ... Keep on trying the herbal/natural remedies. It may take awhile for your hormones to figure themselves out.
