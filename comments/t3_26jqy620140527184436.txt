My only other suggestion for anyone new to the cup would be to frequently empty it your first few cycles until you really learn (yes, you should really look at it) how much your cycle fluctuates. It's amazing how much we think is coming out when it's really not.

That way you know when you can actually use those 12 hours or if you may need to change a little more often.
