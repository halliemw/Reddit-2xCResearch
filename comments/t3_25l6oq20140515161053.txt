I know! It's like your womb is all like 'Lady, I can see you've got enough on, how about you don't go through a period this month. Did I do good?' NO, UTERUS, YOU DID NOT.

As for changing, unless you're getting some dodgy side effects it's worth leaving it for a while. The changes you've noticed might just be your body being stressed rather than the pill you're taking, so allow things to settle after graduation before you decide. :)
