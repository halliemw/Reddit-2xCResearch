so this is embarrassing.. i created a throwaway account and totally forgot the password (i blame the receding hormones). but thank you SO MUCH to the wonderful support and virtual hugs. 

In regards to rosesnrubies, I did look up Project Exhale and I am totally interested. I live in TX so I emailed to maybe volunteer via email/phone etc. It's funny you mentioned the project because when I was being a chatty cathy to the staff, they expressed their sadness to the closing down of their clinic (due to the new law passed). They were so great to me, and it makes me so sad to think that this support I had might not be available to other women. And on top of that, I feel a need to give back, in any way I can. So thank you for your suggestion.
