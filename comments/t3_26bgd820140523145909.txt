I agree with what others have said about focusing on yourself. My boyfriend passed away last year, which I know isn't the exact same situation, but either way I ended alone. The best thing for me was to have people around, so I'd suggest hanging out with friends, family, or even coworkers/friends as much as you can until time passes and you've reached a new "normal". Or even trying new hobbies or something to keep yourself busy and possibly finding something you never knew you really liked. I'm really sorry this happened and I hope anything I said will possibly help you. I know it doesn't seem like it know but like the others said, you will get through this.
