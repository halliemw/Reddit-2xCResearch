Small update: I got pumped full of fluids and some painkillers for the cramps.
My hemoglobin was ridiculously low and that was probably the main cause of being dizzy. Yay iron deficiency!

I guess going from the patch to the pill basically throws your body out of whack completely and its normal to experience big changes in the first few months. However, my situation is still a little extreme and I'm seeing my women's health doctor in the base hospital on Monday morning and getting a slew of tests most likely. I was advised to not use tampons for the next day to monitor how much I'm bleeding/how clotty it is. 


I'm going to try and not get overly worried about the what ifs and just be happy that I can lie down without being in extreme pain. I'll definitely update after I see my obgyn.
