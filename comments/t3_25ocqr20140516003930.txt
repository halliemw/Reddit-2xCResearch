No, this is not a political forum. Many of us choose not to identify as feminists but rather as egalitarians. We hate terminology like "mansplaining" due to the fact that it is bigoted, feminists use it to dismiss an argument that they disagree with on the basis of the speakers gender/sex and not on the merits of the argument. There are center left, moderate, and conservative women on this subreddit. Not all of us are left wing extremists. Quit trying to push your political agenda on this subreddit. This subreddit should be about women's issues and not about "progressive politics." If I wanted to read about progressive politics all day I would go over to r/politics.
