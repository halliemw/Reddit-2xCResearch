This is a great book and actually gave me the ability to sit down and talk with my husband and document the abusive things he was doing. He had bipolar disorder manifest a few years into our marriage and became very abusive. Because I was able to show him it wasn't "just me", so to speak, he was able to become self aware of his change in behavior and get help.
