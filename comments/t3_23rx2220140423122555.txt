Thanks, this actually motivated me.  I've been back and forth about going to a coworking space but the lack of work content has made me not want to spend the 100eu/mo.  I have been thinking about learning a new programming language or other skill so I could do it there.  I occassionally go to coffeeshops to work but I always feel so awkward- its not like starbucks where I can sit for hours with other students, I stick out like a sore thumb for being there so long with my computer.  At least at the coworking space I might be able to make some friends.

Next task is to finally buy a bike, since that place is a long walk.  sigh.. I will work on it.
