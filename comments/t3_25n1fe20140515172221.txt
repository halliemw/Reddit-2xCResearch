> In that moment, Brumfitt decided not to go through with surgery, and instead, she would learn to love what she saw in the mirror without changing a thing.

Since when is "loving your body" equivalent to not changing a thing? I love my body, that's why I live a healthy life. I love my mind, that's why I continue to learn new things and exercise my brain by thinking. Of course I'll try to improve the things I love (or motivate them to improve themselves as I haven't quite mastered the art of remotely exercising other people via telekinesis). 

Loving something means caring for it and making sure it's in good condition. If someone loves their car, they won't accept a dent or a scratch, they'll fix that. There is not a *single thing* that we can love that we won't try to improve or where we wouldn't accept an improvement. Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream can always have just a *little* more chocolate chips.

But this idea that we should let our bodies go because that's what you do when you "love" it is ridiculous. This sounds more like "giving up" than "loving" to me.

> Women are always being told to change or be different -- lose weight, fight aging, smooth your skin, get rid of cellulite, I mean really, women are such amazing and dynamic creatures can we please change the conversation from this bullsh*t to something with a little more substance?

We're also being told to read more. To learn more. To travel more. To *do* more. Why is the body, the bag of flesh you rely on to do *everything else* suddenly not substantial? What exactly is the metric for "substantial improvement?"
