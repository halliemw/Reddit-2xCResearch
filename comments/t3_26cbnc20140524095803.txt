Tattoos don't even look or feel like needles though!! It looks like a pen, and buzzes like one of those swirly writer pens from the 90s. I'm not the biggest fan of needles, but getting a tattoo was nothing for me. Feels uncomfortable though, like having a sunburn and then having someone scratch it with their nails.
