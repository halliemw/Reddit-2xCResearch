I have a couple of friends who spent their 20s "husband hunting". You sound kind of like me, I didn't sweat it and in fact... actively avoided too committed relationships because of issues. Well, I'm 30 now and getting married while my husband hunting friends are still looking (and I feel so guilty about it because I feel like they would deserve to get married and not me!). So no, I do not think you made a mistake by living the life instead for preparing for marriage. Also, I have a friend who's a couple of years older, single and.. she does not lack admireres. Some guys have even said they viewed her being older a big plus, others have not cared and no one did mind.

The thing is though, would you have married a redpiller in your twenties... what would you expect to happen when you grow old? Yeah.. no fun times ahead. In that sense, much better to either be single OR get together with a man who values you beyond your percieved fertility. 

Start/keep looking, stay awesome (sounds to me like you have a balanced life you enjoy) and see what happens?
