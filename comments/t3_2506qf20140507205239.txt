I'd love to have been taught about how terrible crazy diets are for you, and the truth behind anorexia(that it's not once you hit a weight you're cured, you're not even cured after a coma and weighing 85 pounds in 8th grade. ) 

I also would have liked to learn how to respond to the negativity adults give you if you weigh too much/too little in their eyes.
