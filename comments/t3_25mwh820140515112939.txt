I once had a girl shoot at me with a water gun as she drove past me. Or maybe it was a dart gun. All I know is that she was in the passenger's seat, and as the truck drove past me, she pulled a brightly colored fake gun out, pointed it at me, and pulled the trigger.

Not long later some guy flipped me the bird as he drove past. That one didn't hurt as much, but considering I waved at him, and that was the response I got, it had more of an effect on me than it would have otherwise.
