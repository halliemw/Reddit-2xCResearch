De-lurking to post this. 

I disagree with the posters suggesting that he was being blunt but kind. I would be VERY hurt if that came from my literal brother, in no way is that an acceptable thing to say, even if he's concerned. Unless he is massively oblivious, that is very clearly a hurtful thing to say, and he did not take your feelings into account. 

That doesn't mean you can't forgive him and continue your friendship, but your weight is, frankly, none of his business. If he is truly coming from a place of concern, I'm sure he would appreciate you letting him know how hurtful that is. 

OP, you are absolutely not being foolish, and your feelings are 100% valid. He is the one who should have felt shame, not you.
