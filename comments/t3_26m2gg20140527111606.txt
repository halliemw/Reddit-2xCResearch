At some point you have to realise you are not responsible for your mother. My mum is a very similar person, and I found that seeing a counselor is helping me work through these issues. It's so hard to accept you don't like a parent, and it makes you feel guilty, but if she is making you unwell, then something is wrong and you are not the one to blame because you're obviously not making yourself ill!
