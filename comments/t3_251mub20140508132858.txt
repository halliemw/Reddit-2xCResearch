It's nice and tidy, but it's also oversimplified to the point of being inaccurate. Feminism is not a single thing or ideology, it is a broad spectrum of ideologies. 
Asking, "what is feminism" is a bit like asking "what is conservatism" or "what is liberalism." You can only really define it in very broad generalizations about the schools of thought. When you actually look at conservatives and liberals, you recognize that the variation within the ideologies is so vast that it's impossible to nail down specifics of what they believe. Ex: some conservatives just want lower taxes, others want to overthrow the government. Likewise, some feminists just want equality, others think that sex between a male and female is always rape. 

What Quouar described is the most mainstream and palatable version of feminism, but it is by no means the single definition of feminism.
