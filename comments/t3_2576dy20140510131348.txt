> someone who lives in the West where female circumcision is extremely rare

What about those of us in the UK, where FGM is actually more common than male circumcision and also *far* more traumatic? We are in 'the west' too you know. I strongly recommend watching [this documentary](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-cruel-cut/4od) to see exactly why it's so important to fight FGM and why it makes sense to target these issues seperately.
