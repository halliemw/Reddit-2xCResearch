I've gotten one every year since I got my first BC prescription at 18 and I'm 25 now. AFAIK I've always been told yearly, but that might be because I haven't had a doc who will write me a BC prescription without a pap smear and I've done a lot of moving for school so I've rarely been to the same doc twice.
