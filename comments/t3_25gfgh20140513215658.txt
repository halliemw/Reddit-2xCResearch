I'm paraphrasing the line... but I'm curious how 2x feels about the line near the end. "I don't want to get laid. Any girl who is willing can get laid." I feel like this whole monologue is very human and very honest. Especially when she says you wouldn't date a fat girl because you might start to feel that you *should* be dating a fat girl. It's very introspective.
