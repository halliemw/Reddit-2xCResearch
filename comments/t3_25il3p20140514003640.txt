My insurance shows up with the name of the clinic and/ or doctor. I do not know about meds though. If you don't want it showing up on insurance then I would talk to Planned Parenthood or another community clinic. I would emphasize that your parent's "disagree" with you being on birth control. In such a situation they should be able to help you as a cash pay patient and get you cheap BC or an IUD.
