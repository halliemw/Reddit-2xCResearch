I still got chub rub when I was a size 2-and by that I mean my waist was less than a zero, while my hips were between a 2 and a 4. I guess I technically could have lost more weight but my top half looked like I was a concentration camp victim, and finding clothes was impossible. My legs were solid muscle too-it's just the way I'm built. I'm way healthier and look better at a size 4/6.
