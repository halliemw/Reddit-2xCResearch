Same here. I have a hard time standing up to people even when it's important. I don't know if it's related to the way I was taught as a teenager (that women are supposed to be meek, quiet, and submissive), or if it's just in my nature to shy away from confrontation. I am still dealing with some baggage where clothing is concerned...there's still some guilt involved if I wear something like short shorts, or a skirt that hits mid-thigh, or something that shows a lot of my shoulders or back. And I often can't work up the nerve to wear them in front of my parents or in-laws because of the inevitable judgment. Which is pathetic, because I'm 30 and have been a wife and mother for *years* and should by now have the stones (ovaries??) to stop caring about what they might say or what they'll think of me.

One thing is certain, there's no way in hell I'm doing that with my daughter, nor will I be teaching my son these things about women.
