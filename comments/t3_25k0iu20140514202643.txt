I don't see anything wrong with what she did. Healthcare workers inform their patients on these issues all of the time. I'm sure no one wants to hear someone talk to them about personal problems that may offend them, but these are the difficult conversations that need to happen. You may understand the diseases and risks associated with multiple partners, but not everyone does. Would it be better if she didn't discuss this topic with any of the patients who come on because it's "only their business"?
