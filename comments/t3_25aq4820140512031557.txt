you could grab some baby shampoo from dollar tree or the like for about $1. i've personally been using a bar soap from a hotel that is specifically a "moisturizing face wash" and it works just fine! as long as you rinse out all the soapy residue, i can't imagine any harm can be done. *but i'm not an expert*
