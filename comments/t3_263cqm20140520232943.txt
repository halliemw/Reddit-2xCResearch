If you are open to abortion, I would suggest considering it. First (coming from a single mom of two boys, that would be the same age difference should you carry to term) it's the hardest thing you can imagine. Actually, scratch that. Imagine the hardest thing ever something that you can never overcome... THAT'S what your life would be. Single with one is so hard,single with two?  That's altogether different.

You get no time.  NONE.  And the time you do have without them will be all about earning money to support them.  Family that used to support you will start to be few and far between... Soon you are paying more than you spend in gas for a week just to have a night out, wondering if it will ever be easier. It won't. 

Obviously the choice is yours. But do keep in mind that you HAVE a choice.  Right now, at least. 

I wish you and yours the best.
