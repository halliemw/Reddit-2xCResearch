I see a lot of people saying that this has become a thing since becoming a default, but I have to say I disagree. I left this sub a Lon time ago, and it was because of the weird down voting thing here and repetitive topics. I'm not dissing the sub, and I'm sure it has gotten worse since going default, but I don't think we can blame it solely on going default.
