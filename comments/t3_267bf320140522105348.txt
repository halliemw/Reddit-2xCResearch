Really? You think that the majority of their exposure to men upon which feminists base their views is through media, and not through their interactions with men every day of their lives?

Its possible for redditors to meet/interact with feminists in their daily lives and not know that they are feminists for the simple reason that many don't bring it up every 5 seconds. Thus their views of feminism come from instances where it is clearly presented as such - media. 

It's not like feminists are walking around all day oblivious to the fact those around them are men and then come to reddit to get information to form their views of them haha
