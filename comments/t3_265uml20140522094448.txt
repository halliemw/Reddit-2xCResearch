> he told me that if I were to acquire birth control against his knowledge, he wouldn't be terribly upset not to have another baby, as long as he didn't know. (If he doesn't know I'm taking birth control then he isn't sinning if he has sex with me)

That is really, really hypocritical, and he's putting an immense burden on you to maintain his sense of moral superiority. You two need to have a conversation about it because while I'd bet he'd love it if you could "force" him to have to go along with your abortion too, he's also putting you in the position where he has set himself up to get mad at you or think less of you, if he changes his mind, by holding the higher ground.
