Depends where you are in the company I think.  If you're a geophysicist doing fieldwork personal appearance isn't going to matter much.  

However, if you're going to be interacting with the client or customer at all then it's definitely important to present yourself well.  If dealing the client is your job, such as a sales position or something like that then I think it's absolutely worthwhile to have mandatory training for the entire sales staff on personal presentation and styling.  Making it mandatory and for the whole staff avoids singling anyone out, and makes it fair for everyone in the position. 

If your job is to be the face of a company, I don't think it's over the line for your personal appearance to be part of your training.
