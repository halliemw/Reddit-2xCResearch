I've actually heard opposite rumors; that birth control makes you gain weight and your boobs bigger. I can say from experience that it transformed how painful my periods were and improved my skin. It did not change how I felt about my boyfriend as far as I know. 
However, I will say it made me extremely emotional, because of the dose of estrogen in the pills. I take one that is a low amount of estrogen but it still takes time to get used to, similar to any other medication. I would recommend trying it and giving it two or three months. Especially if you're still in school, you could have the summer to see if it works for you.
