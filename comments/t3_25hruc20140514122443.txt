I'm a year younger than you and have found myself planning my life with a younger, brilliant, sweet, hot boyfriend who is deeply in love with me. I'm not trying to brag, just to point out that I would have missed out on the best man I've ever met if I just gave up. I'm smart, successful and I think attractive but I had failed in the dating world drastically prior to this (one psycho bf and then a series of really bad choices).  I WAS thinking about giving up on men all together but now I'm so glad I didn't. Sometimes I look at him and wonder how this happened. It just did. Age doesn't matter. 

The truth is that it will happen when it happens, just as you say. If you are content being single then just continue what you're doing. But it doesn't sound like you are, and that's okay. If you want to date more then you could look at online dating and tell your friends to set you up. But it's even better to just go to social events. Meet new people doing things you enjoy and you'll make more friends in the process. Find a group that does activities you like or go on meetup.com and find a new hobby. Don't stress, we are still young and you should be out enjoying life :)
