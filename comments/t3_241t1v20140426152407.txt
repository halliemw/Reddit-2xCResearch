Lol.  I'm 40, and I'm the youngest director in my company. At 30, I was a basic hourly employee.  There's a whole world out there that's over 30.  My grandma and grandpa went rafting in the grand canyon in their 80s. If you set some arbitrary time limit, you're wasting the majority of your life. Frankly, I'm getting bored of my job and my husband and I are looking into starting our own business. Striving for success, and being successful, never ends unless you let it end.
