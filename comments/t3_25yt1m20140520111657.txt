While I get on well with my mother, my (maternal) grandmother was a key person in my upbringing (much like a second mum) and I feel a few of the things you're saying. 

I love her to pieces, and I have no idea what I'd do without her, but my god she has a way of driving me up the wall. I think the main problems are the generation gap between us, the very different ways we were raised, and who we are as people. 

My nan was (and still is ) a very beautiful lady. She was a glamorous department store lady, often did modelling work, and ended up marrying a fireman (my grandad). She has very precise ideas on how a lady should look, how we should carry ourselves and behave etc... which I perfectly understand. She is entitled to think those things, as that was the culture she was raised in. My mother somehow ended up the exact opposite of what my nan wanted in a daughter, and thus I became a little version of my mother. We're tomboys who wear stompy boots, swear, drink excessively, eat excessively....

So while both my mother and I love my nan, we can't be close to her like a friend. We just cannot fundamentally agree on things, so having deep conversations about our beliefs just end up with offence all around. We talk about the weather, about what we've read in the newspaper, the neighbours, and our work. We aren't friends, but we're family, and that's all that actually matters. 

And I will never EVER enter a clothing shop with my nan. It's a contest between herself and herself to call me fat as many times as possible while we're in there. Gotta love her.
