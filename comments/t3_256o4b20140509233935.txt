yahh.... I would be kind of worried that her medical knowledge isn't up to par on other things as well.  A doctor once told me that the hymen is far inside the woman's vagina and that only a penis can break it.  I was 16 and I thought "excellent, this doctor just let me know that she's an idiot - how kind of her.  Time to find a new one before she screws something else up"
