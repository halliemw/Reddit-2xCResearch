Its up to the OP and what she thinks is important, but we should accurately lay out the consequences for her.

Her marriage will be over if he finds out. You simply don't stay with your spouse if you think she has murdered your child. On the positive, she will respect his free will by giving him the truth and won't have to carry this lie for the rest of her life. I am not say she should or shouldn't do it. Just laying out the facts.

If people think she should do it anyway, they should give realistic advice on how to handle the situation. For example, she should definitely talk to a divorce attorney and develop an exit strategy before talking to him. There will likely be a messy custody battle(as he considers her a bad influence on the kids) and she should prepare for that.
