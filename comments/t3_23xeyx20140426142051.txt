The worst part of being depressed was trying to do all of the things you said.  I could hardly get out of bed, let alone eat a perfectly "clean" diet and exercise. I just felt crushed with this guilt and shame that I wasn't eating perfectly and I believed my depression was my fault for not taking perfect care of my body. My life and overall health improved enormously with the introduction of an SSRI.
