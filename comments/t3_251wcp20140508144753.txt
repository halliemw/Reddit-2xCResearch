Another fairly-large (~20k members) sub that I'm on has done a series of demographic surveys and found that the membership is predominantly (70%ish) ladies, and each time it's been surprising to some members.  Often the poster is assumed male for no particular reason.

I don't have many thoughts about why this is, but I could easily believe reddit overall to be 30%-40% female.
