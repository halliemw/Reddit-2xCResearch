Seriously? This is not a time or a place to ask that question. OP is venting and looking for support about an entirely different matter - not to mention that question seems rude and triggering.

There are plenty of other places on the Internet to research that question rather than asking in a thread where OP has made it very clear that her sister's rape was extremely upsetting.
