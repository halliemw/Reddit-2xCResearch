Honestly do whatever works best with your schedule. Medical will be crampy and slow, like a period. So if you have a job where that might be an issue you should consider surgical. Plus it sounds like you might be worried that it won't work, which you wouldn't know for sure until you retest some weeks later.

The good thing about surgical is that it's super effective, you usually get sedation so the pain is minimal, and the outcome is known right away when you get the ultrasound afterward. It's just one day at the clinic and you can resume all normal activity the next day.

Personally, I would get the surgical termination. It's just cleaner, faster, and gives more peace of mind. But in the end it's up to you and what works with your schedule. Good luck with whatever you end up choosing!
