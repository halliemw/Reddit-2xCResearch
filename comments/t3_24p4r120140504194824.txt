You might want to give lifting a shot--Starting Strength is a good program for beginners.  The confidence boost alone is an amazing thing--be consistent for a few months and you will definitely notice changes!  Even without other cardio (which I hate--I've never been much of a runner) you can lose weight/fat with heavy weights.  (I challenge those who don't believe me to do barbell complexes, or very heavy back squats for more than five reps, and pay attention to your heart rate!)  It's nicer, too, to be able to tell yourself you're doing something active for the purpose of getting stronger and being more badass, instead of just to lose weight and become more attractive.  Lifting progressively heavier weights, over time, requires that you take care of yourself, and even though you're using strength as a goal, you'll end up looking pretty amazing too.  /r/xxfitness can tell you more if you're curious or apprehensive about starting.

Also, since you have 100 lbs to lose, you'll probably find that you can squat a metric fuckton once you lose some of it! :)  You can do this.  It's consistency that's key.  Stick with it!
