> I posted to point out that pro-life posters are disagreed with far more than pro-choice activists, when in this sub both opinions should be equally respected and seen as equally valid.

But... this is how it is everywhere? Some opinions are more popular than others. I get very little, if any, cirkeljerk on my opinion over that I think it is strange to put tons of money on a wedding and that for me, my wedding day is not the happiest day of my life and that I don't really care about the dress and the cake. Most people disagree with me on this.

However, Disagreeing is not the same as disrespecting. If everyone agrees there is not much of a discussion and hence less popular opinions will generate more opinions and hence more discussion.
