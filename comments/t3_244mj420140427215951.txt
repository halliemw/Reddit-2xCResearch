I have two questions, one may be dumb, but I don't know so I'll ask. 

Can you still get pregnant yourself if you want to? Like I mean does it take a while after that or would you be able to get pregnant right away?

And would an overweight woman be able to do it, if she doesn't have any health issues other than being overweight? I'm very interested but I am bigger and I don't know if I would fit the criteria.
