Yeah, I understand the difficulty of being able to see the acceptance of others. I was once in a place where I felt abandoned by so many friends. I now realize that they were trying to reach out in their own ways, but I had difficulty seeing it because my perception of what was going on was so incredibly skewed. That makes it difficult for all involved.
