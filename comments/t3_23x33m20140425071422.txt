I'm not a member of TwoXChromosomes community. Talking from personal experience, this is what I would have done in your place:

1) drop charges, do not include authorities,

2) email your family that you are well and want to try living on your own,

3) if possible, leave your stuff at home, don't go near the place. If *really* necessary, *ask* them to pack your things and have someone pick them up while they are home,

4) try keeping casual contact. Ask someone to accompany you. Choose a neutral public ground not suitable for long talks that you can leave at will. You can start with the rest of the family, but I would include your father eventually,

5) *do not* ever mention the incident, don't justify yourself, if the conversation starts, politely excuse yourself and leave. The time to talk will be in months or years, not now. On the other hand, find a person you can confide to. Preferably an older person or a non-biased professional. DV experts are risky though - to get a good one,

6) make rules and lines you are not willing to cross (moving back, being alone with your father, taking money etc.). Even if it seems alright in the moment, give it another month or two.
