Oh of course...

If someone simply takes and takes, without an ability or desire to give back, then there is a devouring quality in the receiving rather than joy and appreciation. 

The person who only receives and doesn't give to others has a sense of entitlement based on deficiency rather than self-worth. They can seem selfish or greedy, and incurs resentment in those who continue to give.

Receivers seem to fear that they will become empty or lose part of themselves if they give too much. So instead, they tend to hoard what is brought their way.

Yes my husband and I have gone through therapy =)  It is the only reason we have been able to remain married for 29 years.
