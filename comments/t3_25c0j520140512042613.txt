People act like children when they break up. My college ex and all his friends (some of whom were over thirty at the time) went on a FB campaign about how awful I am. Then it switched two weeks or so later to how awesome his new girlfriend is, when he'd told me we were 'on break' and not seeing anyone new. 

I was 22 and felt like I was taking crazy pills.
