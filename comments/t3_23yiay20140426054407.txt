What app do you use? I can help you out if you need to figure out how to read a sidebar if it's Alien blue or Reddit is Fun. Possibly Reddit by Brian as well, although I'm not as familiar with it.

If all else fails, if you ever want to see a sidebar or need to do something your app is capable of, don't forget about using your phone's browser! If you get a message about using reddit's mobile site for easier viewing or whatever it says while you're in the browser, I don't recommend it. The reddit mobile site is kinda limiting :P
