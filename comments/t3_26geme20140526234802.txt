You're not that far off base, I've taken different kinds in the past. I tried Zoloft, hated it- ZERO sex drive. Lexapro made me feel weird without much positive effect, my friend killed himself nearly immediately after he started taking Paxil. Maybe not related, but I wouldn't take that last one bc of that. I started Wellbutrin awhile back because it had worked well for me in the past without negative sexual side effects but it didn't really work well this go round. 

I dunno if those are the right option. I am gonna look into the kind of talk therapy my insurance covers. I would really like to deal with things and not have to go through the antidepressant rigmarole. 

Glad yours are working :) having a balanced mood would be nice
