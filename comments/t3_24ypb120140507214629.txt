Congrats! 

I don't know your style of course, but I went to an online store called Holyclothing and got a beautiful dress for about $40. Mine was grey and silver because I didn't want traditional white, but I'm sure they have white too. Their clothing tends to be both simple and fancy, like velvet inlays and embroidered ribbons but not super floofy. I also made my own garland and bouquet from fake flowers which we still have (we hang the garland as a wreath sometimes) 

Our wedding ceremony had my husband, his immediate family, his best friend (and his wife), my mom and sister, my friend who was officiating, and me. We had it at a state park where my husband had proposed, then we went out and ate barbecue, haha! It was very small and we even wrote parts for everyone so they felt included in the ceremony.

For the reception (which we had a day later) guestbook we bought a cheap scrapbook and glitter pens and then glued all the cards we got inside so it became a keepsake.

Our centerpieces were glass bowl with matching floating flower candles. Super inexpensive and pretty.

I even designed and had the invites printed, pretty much everything was handmade.

We gave everyone disposable cameras instead of hiring a photographer.

In the end our only huge cost was food and cake. If you can find some family members who can make a roast or veggies this might help.
