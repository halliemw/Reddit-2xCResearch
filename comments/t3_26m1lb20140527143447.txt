I think part of the point is that it's mean-spirited behavior. You're totally capable of doing this, but you don't get a hall pass on it being mean-spirited to participate in this.

Additionally, you're warranted to be attracted (and not attracted) to anyone or anything you please, but it shouldn't be seen as default that anyone but you cares or thinks that your judgment carries any legitimacy as default.
