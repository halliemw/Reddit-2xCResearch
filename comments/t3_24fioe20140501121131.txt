whew, I feel your pain. I've had similar issues and am now taking 19 credits. I also work two jobs, and after such a crazy semester, I've just lost steam. I've always made Dean's list prior to this semester, and now I'm just so tired of working so hard that I want to say 'fuck it' and turn in crap work.

But, I don't want to limit my grad/law school scholarship opportunities, so I really need to maintain an awesome GPA. I hope it pays off :/
