I'm all for whatever brings less stress to mothers - whatever they choose. 

I breastfed both mine for 18 months, but I could sleep through it. For some women, it's stressful and painful, and having babies is enough of that. 

I think we should stop pressuring mothers either way. My mother-in-law is a breastfeeding advocate, and she put so much pressure on me to breastfeed - even though I had already decided to give it a go - that it almost put me off. She even wanted me to force my kids to keep feeding after they'd weaned themselves because "You really should breastfeed until they're two!"

There's no reason to push stressed out mothers over the edge by dictating something like this. It doesn't make you a better mother, and I read a really interesting article about [fat-loving toxins in breastmilk](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/16/breasts-breastfeeding-milk-florence-williams) - there's a downside to both choices.
