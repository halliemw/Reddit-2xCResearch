Don't listen to anyone who tells you to carry a gun in this thread. An incredibly bad idea. Most places do not have the same gun culture as the US, and you could go to prison for a LONG time. 

I'm a fellow solo female traveller, and have travelled solo in Europe, Asia, and South America. The most important thing is to have your wits about you at all times. Do not put yourself into a situation that could turn bad, and always have an escape plan. Don't feel bad for missing out on 'authenticity' if you have a bad gut feeling. 

And since few seem to have mentioned it: Traveller's health insurance. Get it. It's really important to get a policy (and it will be heaps cheaper than US insurance normally is). Carry the card and information with you at all times, and make an emergency contact card with the contact information of a relative or close friend that you carry on your person. 

A final, favourite tactic of mine is to lie my face off. Are you alone? Nope, my husband is in the truck! Where are you going? Insert some place the complete opposite direction of where I'm going. What's your name? I'm sorry, I speak no language in which we can communicate. Don't feel bad misrepresenting your situation. It can keep you safer to not tell strangers your plans.
