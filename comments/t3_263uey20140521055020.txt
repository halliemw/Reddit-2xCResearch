He was a dick and took advantage of you. It was cruel and callus of him, but don't value your self less because of that. Your not worth less because your no longer a "virgin" and your not damaged goods. You can still wait till marriage to have loving consensual sex with someone. Perhaps speak to a councler regarding your feelings and emotions about this. The idea of virginity is a curious one and frankly I think can be framed how ever you want eg: if I suck 1000 Dick's but never put one in my vagina does that mean I'm still a virgin? What if I have anal sex with those 1000 men but no penis in vagina? Still a virgin? What I'm tryin to say is this doesn't make you "less" one asshole forcing himself on you when you were too drunk to stop him doesn't mean your no longer able to have that special moment you wanted to save for your wedding. You just need to take care of your self now and continue to seek help for your depression and perhaps extra help dealing with this. 
Best of luck
