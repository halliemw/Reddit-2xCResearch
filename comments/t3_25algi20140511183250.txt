It sounds like it could be endo. I'm no expert on it, but I do know that with endometriosis, you can get endometrial tissue growing in places it doesn't belong, like for example in your Fallopian tubes or around your bladder. They do have to do laparoscopic surgery to diagnose it, so that information was accurate. The bad news is that endo affects fertility somewhat. The good news is that some women find their endometriosis much improved after giving birth. 

There could also be something hormonal going on. Make sure your thyroid hormone gets checked, because thyroid hormone is involved in every process, including reproductive ones. And if you plan on trying to conceive soon (once you have this figured out of course) make sure your endocrinologist and gyno know everything that's going on. Hypothyroidism in early pregnancy can be pretty bad, so getting your doctors on board and making sure that's well under control before trying to make a baby is absolutely necessary.


If you can afford it, go to Germany where you have a doctor you trust who can treat you. Write down every symptom and the timing, and get all your records from your Caribbean doctors. Take them with you to your German gyno, and then go from there. You might need to stay there a while to get everything figured out, though, so be prepared for that. When you make an appointment, let them know what's going on and if possible, you might ask to speak to the doctor so you can estimate how many appointments you'll need and how long you'll have to stay.
