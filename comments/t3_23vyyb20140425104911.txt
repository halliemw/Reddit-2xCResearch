I agree, but often there's not a lot of evidence to decisively say who is right in a he said, she said situation, particularly when it's handled by a university that doesn't necessarily have professional criminal investigation staff on-hand.

If there's definitive evidence that there was rape or violence or sexual assault, yes, the perpetrator should be expelled or at least suspended for the entirety of the victim's time at the university. If there isn't, it's not as clear-cut whether it's a case of sexual assault or a false accusation (which I realize is much rarer than actual sexual assault).

The same issues can occur if you report to the police, but they at least generally have better resources for investigating.
