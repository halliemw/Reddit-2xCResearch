I think that is really great advice. I am 27 and most of my friends are either married or engaged. I definitely need to pick up some new- social- hobbies. I spend a lot of time reading so unless I am doing it in a coffee shop it is pretty solitary.  I think trying to find new friends is a great way to go about it- especially because we have so many mutual friends from the relationship and right now i'm feeling like only a few have been very kind or loyal to me in this situation.
