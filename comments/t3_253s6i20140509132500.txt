He wanted to show them the baby. He wanted to show everyone the baby. He still wants to bore people silly about both the babies. It's cute, except when I can see people shuffling uncomfortable and bored and he's still talking. The swift kick under the table doesn't work on him either, both times I have tried it he's yelled, *Oooow why'd you kick me?!* and my cover is blown.
