Wow, obviously I've been misled! I was surprised at that price too (a guy told me the â‚¬20 thing)! My Scandinavian friends would rather go to their respective home countries and have the whole thing taken care of by universal healthcare (aka free abortion). Abortion was one of the first things I investigated before moving here, and I found a website that will send you the medical abortion pills (i believe free-of-charge but this was a few years ago). I didn't want to be unprepared. Luckily I haven't needed it, but I did buy a pack of 50 pregnancy tests from amazon just to be sure. Better safe than sorry! Normal tests are so fecking expensive.
