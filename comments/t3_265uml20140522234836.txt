This is true, Though pregnancy can also alter periods, so depending on how OP wants to go about informing her husband of what is happening to her body now, she may be able to explain the change in her periods should she try other forms of birth control.

There really is no good way to go about it. Its a difficult situation for OP and her husband and no solution is going to be an easy one because of the personal morals they each hold.
