Like everyone else said, keep the police informed of any time she makes contact with you. I'd also keep a journal or some other personal log too.

I'm willing to bet that your ex got caught talking to you and tried to cover his sleazy tracks by saying that YOU were the one who contacted HIM. That's why she thinks you're the problem, not her husband. Still it's a totally inappropriate way for her to act!
