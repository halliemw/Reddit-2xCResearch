I would call your doctor, the most common next step for this is a colposcopy and perhaps a biopsy if needed for abnormal cells, which are common.  The most common reason for an abnormal pap test is HPV, which is ridiculously common.  If you do have a biopsy and nothing is wroing with the abnormal cells, typically there is a 6 month check up pap smear.  Of course, IANAD, and you should talk to her.  Since you will be out of the country, they might think it will be ok to wait until you return for the 6 month follow up.

Tons of women on this sub and others have had to deal with abnormal paps.  It never fails to make you worry what if.  I would just talk to your doctor tomorrow.
