So maybe your bf just says those things to appear to be manly to his fiends. Maybe he was joking. But if you do want to say something you could tell him to stop being a jerk and take an active interest in the relationship. And tell him what that means to you: for example you want him to enjoy hanging out with you. That's if you think a kick in the pants kind of convo would help. 

You could also have a firm convo with him abt your needs. Let him know exactly what you're looking for in him and ask him if he can deliver. 

In any convo, you're going to have to come from a position of power and lay it out for him.
