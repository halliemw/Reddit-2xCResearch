Speaking both as a man and as a photographer, you look fabulous. The 'perfect body' is an illusion, don't subscribe to it. While no one likes to be insulted, think about where the insults are coming from: negative people who delight in dragging others down. Don't give their words power. How they act is on them, how you react is on you. Everyone is unique and different and that's what makes us amazing. Revel in it.
