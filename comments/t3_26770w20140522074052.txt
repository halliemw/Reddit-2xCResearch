What is their problem? Are they concerned that having that photo in the yearbook will be seen as condoning or celebrating teen parenthood? Because it's really just about basic decency. It's about not ostracising someone who's made mistakes and is dealing with the consequences in the best way she knows how. 

So do they think teens are not smart enough to understand the distinction, or are they too lazy to explain it?
