I had a vacuum aspiration abortion in 2010 and wrote this on my LJ (hah) back then, but have since made it private. I think it still works as a telling timeline of events. 

**The tl;dr** - it was a rather uneventful procedure with limited drama, but plenty of cramps and emotion afterwards.

Background: I have an 8 year old son and the terminated pregnancy was unplanned. Only I wanted the abortion, but my husband supported my decision. We don't talk about it anymore. Probably not healthy, but it is what it is. Do I regret it? At times, yes. I carry some guilt with me and will continue to do so always. But again, it is what it is.

Sorry about all the tense changes. I wrote it in a frenzy.

9:15 a.m. - Husband drives me to West End Women's Medical Group (Reno, NV). We try to avoid the two creepy older male protesters and somewhat succeed. Luckily, Husband is a crazy driver and whipped into the driveway before they could a) run up to us and throw literature at our truck and b) block us from entering (which they're not allowed to do, but do anyway I hear). We sit quietly in the car for a few moments, then venture inside.

9:20 a.m. - The inside of this clinic is pretty much amazing. First off, you can't just walk in off the street, you need an appointment. You ring a buzzer to be granted entry (only after they confirm your appointment verbally). You pass through 2 sets of double doors, both electronically locked, both with the ability to be quickly locked if they sense a threat (thus trapping you until the police arrive). The glass is all bulletproof. The walls are solid cement. It's basically a jail. Reno PD have all but confirmed that the clinic is more state-of-the-art security wise than the correction center... so yeah. The doctor had his offices firebombed 3 times previous, so he got fed up and constructed this from scratch.

I checked in and sat down in the waiting room. There were 3 other couples there, all younger than me. The TV screens played interviews and news specials about abortion doctors being attacked, about Dr. Tiller's death, about the Pro-Life organizations that threaten them and about the clinic's doctor's firearm proficiency. Yes, his proficiency. Only in Nevada, I suppose. I'll be honest and say it was a little much. Not that I'd prefer shows about puppies and regular day-to-day life on TV, but for people like Husband (who was not in complete agreement about me having this procedure), it was too much. He put ear buds in and tried to ignore the commentary.

They took the payment ($600) and asked me about my medical history. Then we waited for my name to be called. I was under the assumption that I'd be called in twice, once for a "counseling session" and another to have the procedure. I was mistaken, so when they called me in the first time, I didn't say goodbye to Husband or even look at him. I feel very bad about that. I basically just left him there. :(

9:30 a.m. - An assistant promptly takes me back to a sonogram room, where she confirms the pregnancy, prints out a couple pictures and gives me a rundown of the procedure. I was surprised how fast this part went... there was no delay, no lecture, no "you sure you want to do this?" I guess I appreciated that, because I just wanted to be done. She explained that I'd be given a shot to "make me feel like I've had about 10 glasses of wine." I declined. I have control issues and I'd rather just be awake for the whole thing. I was fully awake for my wisdom teeth extraction, so... whatever. She said that was fine, flipped me some shit (in jest) about being a control freak and we moved on to the room where the procedure would occur.

9:35 a.m. - Strip from the waist down, put this drape on and wait for the doctor.

9:40 a.m. - Like a Surgeon by Weird Al came on over the speakers. I lol'd. Come to find out they play rather loud music in the clinic because the protesters outside often have boomboxes that preach their message. They need to drown it out for the patients.

9:47 a.m. - More Weird Al. Made a note to ask about the odd choices in music.

9:55 a.m. - More waiting, more odd songs. By this point, I'm getting nervous. I just want it done. I'm also rationalizing the long wait, thinking that because I didn't get the shot (and they automatically play to give everyone the sedative), they're off schedule and that they'll just make me wait as though they were letting the sedative begin to work. Bummer for having control issues, I suppose.

10:10 a.m. - The doctor comes in, along with 2 assistants and a visiting doctor from Australia. He had a fantastic accent and I made a point in telling him. He blushed and explained he ran a clinic similar to the one I was in and was visiting to share procedures and such. It should be known that the doctor performing the termination has basically written the book on the method of extraction. Literally. Other doctors use his book as a reference. I'm oddly proud to be able to have this done by the best.
