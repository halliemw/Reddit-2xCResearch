Hey honey, I send you hopes that you can continue to just let yourself fall back into the warm loving arms of family and friends. How relaxing it can be to let go into that warmth and to let your strength refill from there.

I send you thoughts of courage and toughness, lots of laughs and gentleness. Rest up, fight tough, and do let us know how you do.

We love you.
