What you don't seem to get is that rape prevention education is pretty much universally geared at the victim first.  Don't do this, don't do that.  For other crimes, the opposite is true.  Programs are geared first toward changing the attitudes/circumstances of "at-risk" youth, for example.  The perpetrators are the first ones targeted to change.  In rape, as a society, the victims are the first ones told to change.

Secondarily, the "advice" given is often absurd and gender based.  As one example, don't wear short skirts.  But you don't see a lot of advice geared toward men wearing shorts, even though there's male rape victims.  Don't go out alone.  Don't this, don't that - and much of it is stuff that goes beyond basics like dark alleys and into things that make it difficult to just live a normal life.  The "prevention" is both gendered and different than other crime prevention initiatives, and that's why there's going to be a negative reaction to what you may just see as "sensible" advice.
