I love this! I worked in historical conservation, and did most of my work restoring old cemeteries. It always warms my heart to see an old cemetery looking so well cared for and respected. The plots look lovely and those clean marble stones do as well, takes a lot of effort to get them looking so good. I just hope there's no powerwashing going on!
