It's funny how you compare someone being uncomfortable with breastfeeding in public to homophobes and racists. 

My whole point was to try to give a different perspective so people aren't vilified for simply finding something unpleasant, but that is exactly what you do. There is no attempt to understand or think of ways to help them get over their initial reaction, but comparing them to bigots works?

Do you ever think of bugs running over your face at night and feel uncomfortable? What about seeing puss running from an open wound, or snot running out of someone's nose? Do you think feeling uncomfortable about these natural things is somehow completely and utterly different than seeing someone display the transfer of body liquids to another person?

Some people have hang ups about bugs, germs, rodents, body fluids, and any number of things that can gross them out, which might normally be met with support groups and sympathy if it's severe or common enough. But because there is no diagnosable disorder they can point to and you don't like it, you don't even want to think about what they might be going through or if they can be helped.

Learned and defended hatred for some group is one thing, but a common aversion that might be built into some people is different. There is actual scientific evidence for natural aversions to different triggers, and bodily fluids is one of them.
