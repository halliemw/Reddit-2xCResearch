If we agreed to be exclusive and he wasn't, then yes I am mad at that. We talked about being open and decided we didn't want it. Yes, we don't live close to one another but seeing him once a week was more than possible. And yes it bothered me when he ignored me, especially for days on end when we were supposed to hang out.

ETA: As for being clingy, I don't know. He started off really strongly with me as well. We were both really into one another. 

I don't think anything gives him an excuse to treat me and talk to me the way he did.
