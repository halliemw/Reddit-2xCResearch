Hormonal birth control isn't really used in Japan.

Norethisterone is a "1st generation" progestin, while Desogestrel (used in Marvelon) is a "3rd generation" progestin. Norethisterone is the Progestin used in the first birth control formulation. 

The "generation" of a progestin is meaningless - [Public Citizen asked the FDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desogestrel#Controversy) to ban 3rd gens (Desogestrel) because of increased clot risk. Public Citizen advocated for 2nd gen instead of 3rd gen. 

tl/dr: Lunabell is probably reasonably-effective for preventing pregnancy, if that's why you're taking it.
