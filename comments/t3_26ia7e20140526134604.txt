No bra for me. I am a petite woman, on the smallish size, definitely a B, though. I've been bra-free since my mid-20s (about 5 years), and I love it. I don't wear thin see-through clothes. In the summer, I wear a light tank and usually a t-shirt over. I look smaller without a bra, and I am fine with that. I honestly think I look weirder with a bra than without now. Yes, I have nipples. Who doesn't.
