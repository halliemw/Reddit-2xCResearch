  
I see now it was poorly written. I agree fully that the handsome normal looking guy that everyone likes could be a rapist. Even a boyfriend could do it. There should definitely be more focus on attitude campaigns against rape or unwanted sexual attention, and making it as easy as possible to come forward to the police after the fact. I think luckily, the law is starting to understand more that all it takes is one no after a hundred yes for it to be rape.  
        
  
When i said normal i meant in a statistical way, as in i think the percentage of men with a bad attitude to women is like 5-10%. But i have no source. Still, doesn't help the situation like you said. And of course, even 1% is too much.  
  
  
Regarding; ""she's on her period", "don't try to understand women, women know women and they hate women", "I'm not like other girls""  
  
These excuses exists for both genders, and to reduce people to just one thing, to put them in a box is of course wrong.
