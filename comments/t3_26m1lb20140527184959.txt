I honestly don't understand this. I've worked with multiple guys who where around my height (5'3") that got gorgeous women. And not just one, consistently. Actually now I'm thinking, my aunt is taller than my uncle, my step mom is taller than my dad. Try not to get a complex about it.

 But as a woman with super tiny boobs, I feel your pain. Sometimes we're just not that person's preference. But you have to realize there are many people who will not care.
