Here's my boy kitty giving you [kitty hugs](http://i.imgur.com/Wx1SUpr.jpg). 

And whenever I'm feeling down, * ~~[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwAxIbQApXI)~~ never fails to cheer me up.  It's a fanvid from Kingdom Hearts set to a song from a Sea World commercial. 

This vid might remind you that all of us have a [big damn hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSn1oZ73n34) lurking inside.  Plus... Firefly in a condensed version.  What's not to love?

And if you still need a hug... [The nicest place on the internet](http://thenicestplaceontheinter.net/).
