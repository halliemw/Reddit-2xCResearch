Personally it doesn't bother me, but I can understand why it makes some people uncomfortable. 

Some people don't view it as purely a natural action but see it as sexual display, even though it's not. More likely guys would see it this way since they might never have thought much about it or been exposed to it in their memory, even if they were breast fed themselves. Because breasts are so sexualized it isn't unreasonable for some people to connect that thought to breastfeeding as well. They might compare it to couples groping in public or anyone else revealing normally hidden body parts, instead of the natural process it is.

That's not to say they should have a right to object to the practice on legal grounds, but it's not as easy to just ignore it like you suggest.
