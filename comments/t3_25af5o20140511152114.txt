I'm sorry for your loss :( I am lucky enough to still have my mom in my life, and am quite grateful for the fact. I have been living halfway across the world from my parents for the past year, and today is the first Mothers' Day without my physically here with me, and I have to say it's been tougher than I thought it would. I'm lucky to have the conveniences of modern day technology, but there's nothing like physical presence.
