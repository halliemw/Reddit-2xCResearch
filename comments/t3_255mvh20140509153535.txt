I especially love it when new people come over and assume it's all my boyfriend's.

I got really into olympic lifting a few years ago before I moved states, but I couldn't find a regular gym around here that had it set up and I don't crossfit, so obviously I had to put together my own :) 


I've got:

* Power rack and rubber floor mats  
* 2 x 45lb bars  
* 1 x 33lb women's olympic bruiser bar for oly liftin'  
* 230lbs of rubber coated bumper plates  
* 250lbs of steel plates (probably a little more, I somehow ended up with a ton of 5lb plates)  
* Adjustable bench (to be replaced soon with a flat bench and a nicer adjustable)  
* Misc dumbell stuff and a curl bar

Lots of stuff I still want to get eventually, when the budget allows (decent dumbbell set, the benches, nicer ezcurl bar, mirrors for the walls, wouldn't mind a lat pull down for the rack...). But this does me pretty damn well already.
