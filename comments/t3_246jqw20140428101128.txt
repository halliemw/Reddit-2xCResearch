I am so lazy when it comes to the gym but I still end up there 3-4 times a week. 

- find yourself a gym buddy. Someone who will meet you there at a specific time to take a certain class. If you don't do classes, make sure to map out some sort of workout so you two don't just mozy around the gym for 45 minutes and stare at all the hot men haha. 

- depending on your budget, pay for a handful of 30 minute or hour-long personal training sessions. Once you make that appointment with your trainer, it's hard to back out. Plus if you do they'll call you out on it.  You can find a trainer inside or outside the gym. If you find one outside, you two can always go to your local park, etc, and do a great workout outside. 

- if all else fails and you have to go at it alone, go to the gym RIGHT AFTER WORK. Change into your workout clothes at work if you can, or right when you get home; stretch, then make a beeline for the door. Once my booty hits that couch there's no turning back so I don't even let it get there. 

- so your already on the couch, now what? Change into your gym clothes and tell yourself you only have to stay for 15 min to do some quick cardio, weights, stretching... Chances are you'll stay longer because you're already there. The hardest part really is getting to the gym, I promise. I pull the 15 minute rule on myself all the time and end up staying 45-60 minutes each time. 

I hope these help, and good luck!
