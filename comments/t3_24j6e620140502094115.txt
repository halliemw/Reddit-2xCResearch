It's beautiful.  Setting the stone in the middle of a flower like that is a wonderful effect.

What kind of stone is it?  How did he make the ring?  Was it all fabricated, or was there casting involved?  What kind of tools does he have in the shed?  Does the color or the flower have special significance to your or your relationship?

I hope all my questions aren't overwhelming!  I recently made engagement/wedding rings for me and my partner, so I have a special interest in homemade rings right now.
