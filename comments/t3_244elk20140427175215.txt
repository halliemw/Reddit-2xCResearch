With stuff like this, yes. She said that UTI was God punishing me for having sex. (I was 18, it was my first time, and I was peeing blood, vomiting, and had a fever of 103.4ÂºF and she had the guts to say that to me!)

She is generally supportive and is fond of my SO and whatever, so it's not like she's terrible at everything.
