Reckless, this story is good news: If you got out of this bad relationship once, you can do it again. It's not easy - it's never easy - and you've seen the lengths he'll go to to convince you to stay. However, if someone is willing to do as much damage to themselves as jumping out of a speeding car, how much compunction do you think he has for harming other people?

You already know what you need to do. Is there any chance you can ask your parents for help again, on the condition that you cut all contact from this boyfriend? If not, are there any craigslist or roommate.com listings for your area? Getting out of his and his parents' house is a must, and maybe you can find someone in need of a roommate to move in with. 

As for feeling guilty if he should commit suicide - well, that's exactly the emotion he wants you to have. Threatening suicide if someone plans to leave is a form of emotional manipulation and abuse, one that you don't have to put up with. Whatever happens, whatever he decides to do with himself after you leave, he is responsible for his own choices and reactions to the world. Suicide is a choice that he makes; not something you caused him to do. He's 26. He's an adult. He's old enough to know how to respond to adversity and curveballs in life. He chooses not to. That's his choice and *not* your responsibility.
