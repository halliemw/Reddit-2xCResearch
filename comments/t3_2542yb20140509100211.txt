No dude, you were just surprised by how reasonable all the responses were compared to yours from left field. 

When my SO has the flu, I don't think it's special treatment to bring him medicine, soup, and a bucket to puke in. That is love/standard human compassion. 

When I'm in nauseating pain from cramps, medicine, chocolate, and a back warmer are also signs of love. Not special treatment or whatever weird sort of sexism you were reading into that.
