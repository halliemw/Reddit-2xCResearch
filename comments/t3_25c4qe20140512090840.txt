There's definitely a link between policing people's bodies and consent, which is this underlying feeling that people should please us rather than a more practical and useful outlook that we shouldn't be so reliant on other people for our sense of well being. However, commenting on other people's bodies doesn't mean someone believes they are entitled to an explanation. It's okay to have preferences and talk about the life you see around you. We are all entitled to do that.
