If she loves him, and he lays off drinking, I dont see why not, she said he wasnt anything like that sober, the only problem is when he gets wasted, why throw away a good relationship because of one drunk night? He didnt abuse her, god stop calling abuse everything, she hit him also. What if after ending it they both regret it for years? It was a bad night, the guy is stupid and he fucked up badly, they both hit eachother, no one got harmed and he is a good and peaceful man sober from what I can read, things need to be worked out and he has to promise a lot of things, if she is happy with him abd the only problem is only one night under the influence of alcohol let them be happy together, darn I bet you guys have more problems in your relationship than one awful night. Please stop getting things out of context, if your partner slaps you one time it doesnt mean he is abusing you.
