It tends to be a little...sensitive sometimes. In theory it's a great idea but in practice it gets pretty hostile on both sides. Which then gives a bad name to everyone who ever has a problem with things. (I can't count how many sarcastic "you have now been made a mod at /r/ShitRedditSays" I've gotten.)

Pretty similar problem with modern feminism actually.
