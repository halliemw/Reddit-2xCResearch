First off, what happened to your friend was inexcusable. The victim is not just her but you as well. If you are the one she is relying on then you are just as much in the thick of it as she is. 

It's important to remind her that just because one person said it was not rape does not make it true. She will have good days and she will have bad days. If you're willing you should be there for her through it all. 

I feel for her with the nightmares, if she lives alone or is "single" as in sleeping alone, that is going to be the most difficult time. Being alone is when the mind starts to think without bouncing ideas off another person. If this happened recently I assume she is probably a mess even if she seems "normal" during the day. You should offer to stay over with her if you are able especially when you know everything that happened. Maybe when she does wake up you can be that person who help talk her through the issues. Sometimes just a hug/hand holding/lap to cry in can mean the world. Be respectful of her when having males around or making jokes as that might get upsetting. Help her avoid situations that remind her of what happened. She may seem like everything is "fine" but it's probably not. 

There are so many phases of grief and everyone deals with it differently. I think therapy is extremely important but do not push her until she is ready. Rape hotlines are helpful but it can get tiring to not be consistently speaking to the same person, and when it comes to rape the less strangers she deals with the better. 

I have been in your position before, when you both get through this your friendship will be that much stronger and you'll come out an even better person. Good luck to you both.
