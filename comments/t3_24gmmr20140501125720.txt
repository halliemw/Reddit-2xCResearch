I get that it might seem like a shitty position to put a boss in, but come on, this is a minimum wage job. Employers who pay minimum wage are fully aware that their turnover is going to be high, and sometimes their employees are going to quit with very little or even no notice. They should know how to deal with that quickly and efficiently, without overburdening their other employees (who will also have motivation to quit if their job gets significantly worse). That's the sacrifice you make when you use a cheap workforce. A business that wants their employees to stick around and develop loyalty to the company will pay more than minimum wage.
