My parents are like that. I was the result of one unprotected sexual encounter (very, very unplanned) and my brother was planned and they got pregnant immediately. 

I don't want children at any point in my life and I figure that means I'd get pregnant from the one time I screw up, because yes life is out to screw with you.
