Ok I'm going to be honest - My first reaction upon reading your heading was "He is sooo cheating on her!" 

I hope I'm wrong, but I've been through something similar before. I've also been through that stage of denial that you are in now.

I've seen you say throughout this thread "How could he have a GF that was ok with only seeing him once a month?"

There are any number of lies he could have told her...or maybe it's not one girl, it could be one night stands or even prostitutes.

Also all males know women talk, perhaps he's worried if you do meet his friends SO's partners they will tell you something. That's how I found out. 

The whole "Silly, you can meet them any time." is a much too flippant response for something that obviously bothers you. It's manipulation. It's making you feel crazy for questioning him, when in reality, he's the one who's not acting normal. This thread should have proven that to you.

Acting a bit different around your friends is not something you hide for six years, one night stands etc are... 

Some cheating tell tales to watch for:

Does he have an "old broken phone" which he hasn't got around to throwing out yet, that lives in his nightstand top draw? 

~~Does he let you have access to his facebook?~~
Is he super secretive of his facebook world?

Does he take his cell everywhere, even into the shower with him? 

Do you do the accounts, what are his bills like when he does go away? Does he go where he is saying?

Have the conversation, but be prepared for what you might find out.

My gut feeling is it's not going to be good news.
