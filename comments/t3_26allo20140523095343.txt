I hate wearing shoes without socks unless they are sandals so I definitely prefer it. Get nice socks and it really helps keep your feet cool and dry. I find without them my feet get kind of sticky, too.

They are more common than you'd think! They're just hard to see because of how they're cut. And you can get lots of different colors to match your shoes so if a little bit of the sock peeks out during the day it isn't noticeable.
