I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that I think I am "holier than thou". I'm actually the total opposite. All of my replies and responses are open and honest and clearly state I would not stand in a way of a woman wanting an abortion. 

The need to belittle me and act so rude towards me in all your replies do not have a place on a feminist thread either, as we should be supporting each other and respectfully disagreeing with opinions that aren't of our own. 

You don't have to agree with me, hell I don't even agree with somethings I think sometimes, which is why I created this post in the first place, to walk through my thoughts in what I considered a "safe" place. 

I'm open, and respectful, of everyone's opinion on abortion. If that isn't enough for you, than I cannot really change that nor would I try too.
