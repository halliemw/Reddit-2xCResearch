Ugh, no contact is so hard. What helped me (granted, not married) was write letters I feel he NEEDED to read and put them in an envelope, in a box, in the cellar. :D If you're still feeling like this in a year (no chance in hell) go through the letters. I was happy at how far I've come, how I just kept trudging even though I was so sad.

chin up, you *will* get through this.
