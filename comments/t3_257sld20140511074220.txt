I'm a professor. My sense is that it is certainly proper to address a professor (male or female) as Professor So-and-so, especially at the start of a conversation. But if you're in the middle of a conversation, it might get clunky to use that over and over, and switching to sir/ma'am should be fine. As in:

"Excuse me, Professor Johnson, I have a question about the midterm."

"Please come on in. Is it about question 2? A lot of people found that one tricky."

"Yes, sir/ma'am. I didn't understand ..."

When writing an email or a letter, NEVER address is to "Dear sir/ma'am" -- that is inappropriate. In fact, it is not really appropriate to address is to "Dr. So-and-so" either, because that title is for anyone with a PhD; someone who achieves the status of professor expects to be acknowledged as such.

(Note: I am in a field where faculty and students routinely use first names. But even so, email and verbal communication should typically be formal until a lower level of formality is established.)

I would not expect anyone to use "professor" or "Dr." outside of work, or work-related events.
