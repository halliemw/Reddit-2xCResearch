But did you have a close relationship with her before hand, or did you go so far as to tell her you loved her? I can understand the desire to get past a lack of physical attraction, but it's hard for me to grasp how the solution to that is to have sex with someone over and over again, all the while with them thinking there is nothing wrong.

I'm not trying to say that this guy is a bad person because of what happened. But I do think he did bad things, and the way he handled the aftermath was callous. If you were in love (even though I admit that in this case the word love was used way too early) with someone, met them for the first time and proceeded to have (what I'm assuming was successful) sex for an entire day, only for them to end it by saying that they were never attracted to you in the first place... wouldn't you feel confused, shitty, and used? Not to mention angry and heartbroken?

I would have a hard time believing that they did it all for me, and I'd also be incredibly offended by that attitude. Not to mention the damage to my self-esteem, which is OP's main focus. She's not even really talking about the guy, just giving background info on how she came to feel so insecure.
