Selective noticing is the tactful way...it's also helpful to casually mention your relationship wherever it fits comfortably....it's a graceful way of indicating that you are not available....  Oh I love that place, Todd. ( my boyfriend) and I went there last year.   

That's not to say that you should tolerate bad behaviour towards you ...if they are more forward than, in my opinion, you should be equally assertive and polite that you are in a relationship and not available.  

My 2cents ....social / business networking has lots of layers :) 

I don't think there is anything wrong with being attracted to someone and potentially seeing if you can get together....as long as it's respectful.
