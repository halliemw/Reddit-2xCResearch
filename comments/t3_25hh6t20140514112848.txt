Don't worry, I'm not offended :) As I've mentioned in a different comment, we started dating when I was 17 and I'm 22 now, and we were close friends for over a year by the time we got together. It'll be 5.5 years of being together by the time we tie the knot, and it'll be after I graduate college (he'll probably have one more quarter left..) We realized how good of a match we were well before we started wanting to go farther :) Heh, if we wanted to rush for the sake of lust, we'd have probably gotten married already.

(talking about my relationship now, and not anyone else's) To bring in my own views, I don't think "God" has a problem with desire, and I don't think he "designed" us to be in long-term relationships without sex (using that loosely, since I'm not keen on the the 7-day creation thing). I *do* think that at least for me, sex is something that is an aspect of an ultimate commitment to another person and should follow the 'filling up' of friendship and affection. When the rest has built up, as it has in our case, desire is a natural result. If I force myself not to feel it now, I'll be trying to force myself *to* feel it later. In our case, we've used this opportunity to talk about how we'll ensure sexual compatibility and to get over any sex-negative feelings we had from our social conditioning.
