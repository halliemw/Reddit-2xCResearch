Frankly, this is why I carry a gun and train with it. I hope with all my heart that I never have to use it on anything other than paper, but if someone ever attacks me, my right to not be raped is more important than my rapist's right to live. That person gives up that right when they decide to attack me.

This is why everybody, not just women, needs feminism.
