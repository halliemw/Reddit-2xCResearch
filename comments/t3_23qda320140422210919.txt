Yeah, as I said, I felt like I was being so selfish but my friends, family, etc. were telling me that he was in the wrong.  My dad is mad because I'm his little girl and wants me to be the highlight of my boyfriends life, because yknow. Dads. And my mom is more upset with his parents, not him, about the whole contradictory thing between this year and last. She didn't appreciate them ignoring my request of not feeling ok about the whole other date thing.
