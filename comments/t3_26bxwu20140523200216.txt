I am very sorry this happened to you. I hate that it happens all the time everywhere. I have no good answers to your questions. Please try not to feel embarrassed or ashamed, as it was not in any way at all your fault. Not even in the smallest way was any of it your fault. You did absolutely nothing at all wrong and your contribution to their actions was a big fat zero %. Be well.
