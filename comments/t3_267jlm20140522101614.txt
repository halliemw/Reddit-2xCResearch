Get your husband or hers to read up on St Thomas Aquinas (biggest philosopher who made the Christianity what it is today) and more importantly his critics. Religion is just philosophy double think used against someone looking for easy answers to the human condition. If she really wants him to wise up, find out the main reason that brought him there and offer a better version of it... there are many.
