Not a doctor, but in my experience with my IUD....

25/F. Got my IUD early 2012 and for about a year I got consistent, and (thank goodness!) lighter periods that just got lighter and lighter (though I had a heavy flow so still needed regular tampons.) Then a little over a year after the insertion, I got started to get that brown period thing, but it was lasted for two or three months straight. Then, my period disappeared forever and ever but I had really bad cramping randomly for the next 6 months. But now for the last 8-9 months things have been clear (no period, no spotting, no cramping.) I never once visited a doctor for anything, well, outside of insertion and a follow-up, I just make sure it hasn't moved every 2-3 months (I forget to check monthly.)
