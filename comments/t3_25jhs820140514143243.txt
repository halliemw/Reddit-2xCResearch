Honestly, I am astounded at the fact that this post got replies at all. I mean, i'm a total n00b, or whatever the terminology is, but it seems to me that if you ever feel really lonely and you need to reach out to someone, reddit is a pretty good place to do so. It seems like the twoxchromosomes subreddit contains a pretty amazing group of supportive people, willing to share stories, offer advice and just listen. Please remember that you are NOT ALONE.
