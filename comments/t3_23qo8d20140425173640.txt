You look beautiful. sure, anyone can say that... well, let them. Because it's true. Your eyes, your smile, your open manner. And more important, it's a self-determined beauty. It's YOUR beauty, this is who your soul has wanted you to be and your being brave enough to actually bring it to life. Thoreau was right "the mass lead lives in quiet desperation" but you've decided there's something better.

I know this is a bunch of rah-rah speak, but take it as sincere. There are photos of a beautiful woman on this site- they're yours. I can't imagine how tough things are right now, and it's possible that some things will get even harder. But there will be breaks, there will be surprise days and the right thing said at the right time, and ... well, and it's spring, Easter to be more exact, time for renewal. Time for beauty to emerge, time for the soul to arise, time for life to meet the sun. I'm not much of a religious man so I'm not preaching, I'm saying that to point out that nature agrees with you- nature is on your side. 

I know it's tough, but stay strong, reach out to some great people here, I am not part of your community, just an admirer, but I've met some great people here and they offer a lot of help. You deserve this, don't let neigh sayers and the condemnation experts sway you- if they have problems, it's a reflection of them and we should feel sorry about all the colors in the world they don't get to see. 

Take care, have a great weekend.
