I'm not denying that there's people promoting it. My point was that we're in TwoX and the topic was female circumcision and it feels like a bunch of guys came into the thread to derail. But honestly, I see what's happened to TwoX. Have fun arguing about male circumcision in a women's subreddit. I'm out.
