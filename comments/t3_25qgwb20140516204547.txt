Me and my sister used to share a bedroom with an ensuite bathroom, and we would write messages to each other on the walls in our hair. Like, "hi there" or hair-art of our dog...

I have super freakin' thick hair (and not like, Pantene commercial thick hair; the kind that takes an hour to blow-dry and another to straighten) so when me and my boyfriend moved in together and we first showered together, he ran his hands through my wet hair and ended up with a fistful of it. He thought I had some kind of condition. I only wash my hair ~once/week and it's too thick for some of it to fall out naturally so I lose a *ton* of hair in the shower. I had also just dyed it black so it looked like more than it was. Now he's used to finding masses of hair stuck to the shower walls when I forget about it. It's like The Grudge.
