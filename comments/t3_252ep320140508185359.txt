I was 14 on a French exchange trip, I had felt this weird 'empty' feeling in my stomach all day but put it down to being sat down most of the day while travelling. Luckily my host's mother was a nurse and it didn't take too much pointing (I was terrible at French why on earth did I go) to explain what happened.
