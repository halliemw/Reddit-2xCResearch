This is dumb, but I try to imagine every person I know who gets a job is one less person on the job search market. It's hard not to be bitter, especially when you go for an interview for a dream job and then a few weeks later see a person post a picture of the great office and you realize they got that exact job instead. It's not possible to get every job you apply for, just like it's not possible to end up with every person you date forever. But you'll find one that's for you eventually. 

Sometimes I funnel my frustrations into something productive and that cheers me up... if a friend starts bragging for a job, I'll apply for a job. Or think of ways I can build my linkedin profile and market myself better. Or go to an extra networking event. I don't expect any of these random moves to singlehandedly snag me a job, but I try to remind myself it's a journey and no single thing is going to throw me a job and I have to play all my cards.
