Except most men here *don't* act like they have superior knowledge. It's not "silly women this is how it really is". It's just someone trying to be helpful. And just because it's not from the perspective you want does not mean it's not relevant to the discussion.

And honestly, the men "mansplaining" on rape posts is something I hear complaints very frequently but something I've never actually seen in two+ years of being here. And using that as an example is taking your points to the very extremes.

I just don't think that TwoX should shut itself off from men simply because they didn't grow up as women. "Sit back and listen" should *not* mean "you can read but don't you dare speak". I think TwoX is often a bit too sensitive and interprets a lot of what men post as "trying to tell me I'm wrong" when it's just trying to provide another perspective.

We allow it from women why can't we allow it from men? TwoX is not a "girls only" club.

>The downvote button is to denote that something isn't relevant to the topic at hand, you can call it hostile all you want, but that's what it's for.

Very few people actually use it like that and you know it. Downvoting to hell is actively discouraging people to not post again.
