There's nothing wrong with you! Chemistry isn't something you can fake or force. If it's not there, then don't stay with a guy. You're doing both of you a favor to end any pretense of a romantic relationship. 

If it makes you feel better, I've meet a couple of awesome guys that I felt nothing for romantically. After a "cooling off" period where we didn't see each other for a while, we ended up being good friends. I've been friends with one of these guys for like 15 years now. I went to his wedding, love his wife and dog sit for them when they go on vacation. He came to my wedding, plays poker with my husband and gave me some great job advice recently. Sometimes NOT dating a guy is the best thing you can do.
