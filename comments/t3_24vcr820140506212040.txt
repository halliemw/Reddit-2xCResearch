Check out [extrapetite](http://www.extrapetite.com/). She is something like 5'0" or 5'1" and is my favorite fashion blog. She offers lots of DIY tutorials to tailor outfits, and regularly gives links to petite pieces that are on sale. As a 23-year-old, I love how mature her look is to me and I'd like to look just as polished as she does when I'm in my upper 20s.
