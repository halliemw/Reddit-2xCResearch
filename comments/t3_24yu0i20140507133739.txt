Sooo... Being temporarily employed is the gateway drug that leads to a life of stay-at-home wifeying? 

You'll get a job. The economy is crappy so it might take a while, but you'll find something. In any case, there's no law that dictate that you procreate nor stay in just because you happen to be unemployed. Volunteer. Pick up a hobby. Make friend. Offer to babysit. Do something to make yourself feel useful and fulfilled.
