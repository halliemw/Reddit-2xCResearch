I remember when I was 20, I was asked by an older woman how I could be pro-choice. I explained my reasons, and her only response was a condescending, "welllllll, you'll think *differently* when you're a mommmmmmmmm."

Well, now I'm a mom. And I am as pro-choice as I ever was- I don't think I could be more so. I love my child more than my own life- but that has nothing to do with women's rights to their own bodies and life decisions. Emotional reasoning can't be used to restrict the rights of others. And not everyone feels the same way about their pregnancy.
