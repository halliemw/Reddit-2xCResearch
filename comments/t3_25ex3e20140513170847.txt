"He stormed off and started walking home, till I picked him up."
That's where you became completely manipulated and the guilt turned on you. I used to be in a relationship with a guy who used to walk out in the middle of the night and make me feel like crap to turn some issue I raised back on me. It worked, I would always go after him. Don't. That's where you are back to chasing him and you lose your confidence. Leave him go, carry on with your daily routine despite that horrible anxious feeling. Try to identify when an issue is being turned on you out of manipulation. You simply don't trust him as a direct result of his actions and shouldn't have to unless he proves to you that you should with more than words.
