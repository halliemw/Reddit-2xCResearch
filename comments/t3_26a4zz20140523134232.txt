I don't need to prove that I'm an awesome girl that dudes should want to hang with. I have no drive to do that. If I'm a "bitch" for not standing for being insulted... well, it turns out there are plenty of guys out there that are willing to be friends with a "bitch", and the ones that aren't, aren't for me.
