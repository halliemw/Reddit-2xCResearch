I think one of the most important things is to take it slow and have lots of foreplay. if you're not wet enough it can be painful/uncomfortable. I have only used lube maybe twice ever..but I used wet platinum and it worked well.

another thing to keep in mind is that your first time isn't likely to be the most amazing sex ever. it can be painful, awkward, and your guy may not last long. do not be disappointed by this though! it can take a while to build up stamina so the more times you guys have sex the better it will likely (hopefully!) be. with all of that said...even if it's not perfect or what you imagined...it's still your first time together and will be truly special in that regard. 

and yes..pee after sex. that's the only thing I do to prevent UTI's and I've only had one of those and it was during a time I wasn't sexually active. I guess an obvious thing would be to make sure his hands are clean before he touches you? I can't think of anything else to add at the moment. relax and have fun!
