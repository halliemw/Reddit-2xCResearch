You've done all that can be reasonably done not to attract unwarranted attention. But those changes you mentioned are external. And there's no amount of physical changes that will ever stop all the assholes.

Can I suggest something like self-defense classes? Not so you eventually become paranoid and want to handle all situations with physical aggression but so all this negative attention becomes little more than a minor annoyance that just rolls off your back because you are confident that if it really came down to it you can and will defend yourself. It's not fair that you feel this level of threat just leaving your home, but I'm confident that you can beat this if you channel the spirit of Foxy Brown who is sexy and feminine and doesn't take shit from anyone. Chin up and eyes ahead.
