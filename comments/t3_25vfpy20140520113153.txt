Well in cases like this, when the kid has pretty bad issues and has no chance to have a decent life, it is plain cruel. It was't her kid to make decisions for, she didn't plan on taking care of it. Even if it were her kid, it's awful to choose to have a heavily disabled kid. Very cruel and selfish. 

As for the fathers, if a woman is pregnant, and the father does not want the kid, then the woman should have the kid only if she is okay with raising it without the father, and not asking for anything from the father.

If a woman doesn't want the kid, and the father does, well then she aborts, because it's her body and her choice, and I respect that. 

A woman should never be forced to have a child against her will. And a man should never be forced to have a child against his will either. (doesn't mean the woman has to abort, she just has to respect his decision to not to get involved)

Anything else would be heavily sexist-> child support for kids not wanted since pregnancy (it is okay when the kids are of the both parents and all that)

And I would argue about that, the kid is not hers, if it were inside of the mother, she would have all the power, does she lose her claim to her child, just because it is not inside of her?

There are different factors here, the surrogacy and the kid being disabled
