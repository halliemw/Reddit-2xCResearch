Yes, this.

Sometimes I don't understand the intentions of the catcaller. Sometimes I think they're corporeal trolls, just doing what they do to spread unhappiness.

I wish I would magically get a matter of fact explanation from people who behave like this for why they do it. What are they hoping to accomplish? What would compel a human being to act like this?

Because seriously, I don't really look good. So I know it's not that they are overcome with desire and have to be vocal.
