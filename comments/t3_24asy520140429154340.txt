Be loud. When creeps like that touch you, say something along the lines "Uncle X, why are you touching my thighs? I didn't ask for your touch!" BE LOUD. I found that when you're loud, exposing him to the men and women around, he'll be less likely to touch you, he'll be embarrassed. However, if he's too far gone creep, that won't work... I was loud with someone, he never touched me again.
