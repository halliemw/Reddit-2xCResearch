I don't see this relationship working this way on the long term.

You have made up your mind you don't want another kid. You seem like you have a plan on  how to obtain an abortion, so make this plan come true.

Now, the issues I see:

* you hide around your husband that you take daily medicine. He should know of your medication (and vice-versa, and you both about your kids medication) if only for emergency situations.
* You hide from your husband that you pay money for things he disapproves of (and since you are a sahm, I suppose you have shared finances)
* You don't honestly talk about birth control with your husband, that should be a topic where a couple (regardless of married or not) come to a consensus
* Your husband doesn't respect your wish on using any form of birthcontrol, I don't see any chance to make this survive a relationship in the long term

My stance on the matter (not catholic, but christian) is that you should come to a consensus for birthcontrol and use some form or another. Not consenting to any further sex before you got to an agreement might help persuade him NFP is a viable option even for a catholic family (look into what the new pope said about birthcontrol, I think there is some serious reform on its way). Most catholic couples I know used some form or another of birthcontrol at one point or another of their life. 

So, get your abortion, talk with your husband about you needing some birthcontrol and try to come up with a plan which suits both of you. (even if you do nfp, you could just deny sex when you are fertile, but it works best with involvement of the male partner). In the long run you have to decide if you want to continue living with these lies (there are quite a few years for you till menopause), try to reconcile things with your husband around birthcontrol or ultimatively leave him if he won't respect your bodily autonomy.

Your relationship can come out stronger than before from this. Finally talking trough this issue and coming to some sort of open agreement will lift a weight off your shoulders and help you model healthy relationships to your kids. They do notice you sneaking around your husband. Do they see fear from your husband in your actions (and think it's ok if a wife fears her husband)? Do they see disrespect in your actions (and think respect isn't important in a relationship)? Please, come to term with your husband on the isssue of birthcontrol for your kids and marriages sake
