I've definitely done this before. Over the last decade++ I've tried every trick in the book. She throws tantrums constantly. Heck, the first time my current partner met my mother, she stormed off from the kitchen table, crying. My father and I kept eating and had a "regular" dinner-table meal and discussion while my partner was very confused and asked me "shouldn't you do something about this?"
  
Yes, I've tried numerous unemotional conversations and trying to teach her why what she's saying is offensive and how she shouldn't behave that way to me (or anyone). She's pretty much ostracized every member of the family, and any friends she's had before. I seriously haven't found any method that works, except for not talking very much and agreeing with anything she says even if I disagree with it. I have no fight left in me and no patience to deal with her. It's frustrating because she treats me like a walking wallet, and is only nice to me when she thinks she'll get something out of it. I believe most people in my situation deal with it by going NC (or no-contact). Shameless plug for /r/raisedbynarcissists for anyone else going through similar circumstances.
