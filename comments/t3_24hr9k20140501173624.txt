I'm not single but have a long distance boyfriend, so I have a lot of lonely days.

I'm slowly making close friends but few are weekend hangout worthy, and that's ok. Why does Saturday have to be a social night? Nothing wrong with staying in and watching movies, I'm CS major so I spend a lot of nights programming. I'll go buy myself a cheeseburger and eat it on the couch with no judgement. I do my deep cleaning on Saturdays sometimes or take care of my plants. I'll text long distance friends. There's a Saturday night board game club I've been meaning to go to. I'll enjoy my introversion, not loathe it. I'll pick up a video game off of steam or go to the gym and have a long, low intensity work out. Find a hobby you like and go for it. I'm busy almost all the time so alone time for me is excellent. Its only bad when I'm idle. Get to the point where relaxing by yourself is a treat, not a bad thing.
