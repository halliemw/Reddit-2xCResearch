I get both interchangeably. Neither bother me, it is just a term of respect to substitute for not using a persons name. I have a coworker who calls me Miss first name but he's an older gentleman, so I think that's just his thing. 

My use of miss/ma'am goes both ways, now that I think about it. Other mom friends are miss first name to the kids. If someone is older than me and in a service position, I usually use ma'am.
