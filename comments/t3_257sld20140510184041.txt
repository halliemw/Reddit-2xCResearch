Infantilized? The word has no connotations that would make such implications. It is just a neutral word for people to address strangers, and nothing more. I cant imagine how you could find offense in such a plain thing. What word would you prefer strangers call you when addressing you? 
And yes, we all have problems, debts, things of that nature. That doesnt explain how "ma'am" or "miss" is insulting. The truth is they are not insulting words in the slightest...perhaps you are nitpicking for things to be angry about
