I was on hormonal BC for 6 years before going off of it, always a combination pill. I tried a few types during that time at varying levels, but I think most were a combination of Ethinyl Estradiol/Levonorgestrel, aside from when I briefly tried Yaz (Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol). Most of the time I was on Aviane.

Some side effects were worse than others...for instance, I cried constantly on Yaz and was very irritable...I just felt crazy hormonal. Aviane started out great, especially in comparison. However, a while in I had tons of problems. However, I didn't realize they were due to my BC because when I talked to my doctors about it, they always dismissed the BC as a possible culprit. Finally I found a doctor who recognized what was going on and insisted I go off of it and onto hormone replacement therapy. Thankfully she turned everything around for me.

**Some issues I had on BC (Aviane):**  
-vulvodynia (usually caused by natural hormone depletion/vaginal dryness) and then vaginismus as a result  
-migraines and other neurological pain  
-emotional difficulties-- crying easily and jealousy

One thing that thankfully I did not have to deal with, which some woman complain of, was weight gain. I also remember much lower libido on one type of pills, but I think on Aviane it was only lowered *slightly*, so this wasn't my biggest issue.

**Some positives to being on the pill:**  
-Regular and lighter periods, less cramping  
-Not having to fear pregnancy  
-Better skin and hair

I've been off it for four years now. 

**Pros to being off it:**  
-My boobs got bigger (most people experience the opposite)   
-Extremely high sex drive  
-More natural lubrication  
-Vulvodynia and migraines have gone away  
-I feel more like "myself". I almost never cry now. I feel like I can think more rationally  

**Cons:**  
-Having to use condoms and more worried about pregnancy  
-Heavy, irregular periods and cramps  
-Bloating when I go awhile without getting my period   
-Skin is more sensitive and prone to breaking out

Personally, I prefer to be off of it because vulvodynia was not worth it and the migraines put me at a health risk for stroke. But I would like to find another BC option where I don't have these problems, so I am cautiously considering Nexplanon (IUD implant that is progesterone only rather than the combo pills I was on in the past).
