I got off to a rocky start at my current job, because our company is laying off employees and replacing them with dirty, stinking contractors (like me).  

Anyway, the best thing to do is let other people talk to you.  Ask them about their plans for the weekend.  Then ask how they went the next Monday.  Try to do 25% of the talking in every conversation.  

Oh and for god's sake don't tell older women they look really pretty.  There's a girl in my office who tells me I look pretty every day and I want to punch her in the face.  It's so fake.  Today I'm literally wearing my PJ top under a cardigan.  Be honest with people.
