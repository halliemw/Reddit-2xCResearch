You did not fuck up! It's embarrassing, but everyone has moments like this. I don't know what your apartment layout is like, but see if you can figure out where sound leaks out the most (walls, windows, doors) and get sound dampening curtains like they have in recording studios. When I was dating a screamer, he'd put on a loud movie to mute some of the noise. It didn't quite work, but it was the thought that counts? Anyway, see if you can go to his place instead if you want to be loud. It happens to all of us. You'll be okay.
