Guy here, unsure if that matters. I would say give him a chance to make it up to her. At the very least acknowledge and accept her feelings about it. She miiiight change her mind if he can prove himself not a douche after a heart to heart talk, but since he was her ONLY boyfriend and he broke up with her, most or all of her romantic hang ups are centered around one dude. I understand you're in a societal and idealogical impasse. That liking someone else during his relationship with your friend though- that's kind of a huge deal. It kind of makes even the nice memories she had with him turn sour and gross. if you wanna duck the guilt of uninviting him, you can do your best to open up about exactly what is bothering her, whether or not she could forgive him for this kind of big day, and kind of shift the blame onto his moderately shitty actions and leave it up to him whether or not he can make nice to your friend. "Hey dude, she's broken up about the past, can you make it up to her? You guys used to like each other!"


She might also just want the experiance of rejecting HIM. Which might be healthy. I dunno I'm just a guy. 


Either way, be nice about either action you do!
