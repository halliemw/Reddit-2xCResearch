I fully agree that the term "aggressor" is the core of the problem. In its definition, our opinions seem to differ, which I don't entirely understand. To become an aggressor, in my opinion, a person must be able to be aware that he/she is acting against the will of another (either by knowing him/herself, or by getting told). This simply is not a given, if he was too drunk to realise what he was doing, and she kept silent.

As for the lack of consent: There are two ways of showing acceptance, namely verbal and via gestures. If she didn't say anything, but got herself into a position for intercourse, he may have mistaken that as a physical cue, and thus was not aware that he was overstepping. In my relationship, for one, we don't ask each other whether we want to, but once we position ourselves accordingly, we rely on body language to see whether the other is willing. (Yes, I'm wildly speculating. It seems reasonable to me that the situation may have spun out this way, but I don't want to fixate on presumptions or to be an advocatus diaboli. I sure may be erring, in which case I acknowledge her lack of consent: If she was just lying there, not playing along, and he inserted himself into her without her acting, I take back everything. OP understandably didn't elaborate, so to us, there is no way of knowing which version is true.)
