You have to do you a 100 percent. Even though I felt pressured I feel okay with it now because my SO's parents are quite old and they never would have been able to meet and enjoy our son if we had had him let's say 10 or 15 years down the line. You are in a pretty huge situation and you need to weigh sacrifice, your happiness, and everything else. It is definitely not something to quickly disregard. And if it helps, I'm avidly involved in my schooling along with being a mother. It's stressful, but certainly doable with the right partner!
