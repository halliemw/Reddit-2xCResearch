Stories like yours are heartbreaking. I fucking hate it when you see places like states in the US trying to make abortion illegal when it is already legal. Outlawing it doesn't stop it from happening, it just puts women and girls at risk when they don't have the option to go and get it done safely in a medical setting.

I think you're really brave.
