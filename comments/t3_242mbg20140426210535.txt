Yup. They numbed up my arm before they cut it open and fished around to retrieve it. Apparently it was snuggled on in there quite snuggly with a bunch of scar tissue. I ended up with two stitches. From the numbing (which took a while) to getting me all sewed up it probably was 20 minutes. When I went home I took two Aleve and other than being marginally sore for a while and the ridiculous bruise I had for weeks after, it was probably less painful than the experience of when I first got it.

Immediately (like a few hours) after I went on the Nuva Ring. I have not gained weight since then. I haven't noticed a negative difference in my eating habits and I certainly am not retaining water since getting it out.
