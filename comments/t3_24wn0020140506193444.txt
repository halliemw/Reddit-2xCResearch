I'm glad you're feeling pretty good! I felt 100% right after getting it inserted, but my first period post-insertion came with some pretty gnarly cramps.

If you weren't taking birth control right up until you got the Mirena inserted, don't be surprised if you experience some (or a lot of) spotting while you body adjusts to the hormones, too. I had daily spotting in weeks 3-8 post-insertion and it drove me nuts, but it was so worth it - I love my Mirena!

I'm glad you had a great experience with PP, too :)
