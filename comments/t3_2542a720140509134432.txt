Yes- I think as a whole regardless of your beliefs/etc. we need to show that that kind of behaviour is not okay. By not disbanding them/ordinances/etc. we are showing that it is okay for them to continue what they are doing. On another note- my dad who has been a nurse for over 30 years is fighting for the extension of medicare and is working to get meds to people in need- he almost got arrested for his protesting- I think it's appalling how backwards these two situations are. 1300 people in SC are going to die this year without this medicare extension :(
