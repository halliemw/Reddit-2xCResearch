I can get that some lesbians who might be considered butch wouldn't necessarily want to be called butch, but are they still against the word? I don't view "butch" as a word that only refers to lesbians. I do typically think of it for only women, but I think that makes sense.

I view "dyke" as a derogatory term towards lesbians, that I would never use outside of reference to the word.
