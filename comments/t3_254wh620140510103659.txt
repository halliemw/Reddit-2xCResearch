Funny, I was going to expand that particular phrase with a very similar comment! I just didn't want my comment to be aaaall over the map. Yup, I generally speak differently here, less formal, because I don't feel like I need to gain anyone's respect here in order for my comment's contribution to be validated; I know I'll be accepted and respected here on at least a basic level.
