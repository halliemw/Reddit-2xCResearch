Set a reminder alarm on your phone to take your pill. I have been doing this for the 14 years (off and in) I've been taking BC pills, and it works. 

Additionally, my doctors have never mentioned anything about weight and effectiveness of pills. It's possible that new information is coming out about it, but wouldn't this be accounted for when formulating the medications?
