Hey, I'm a girl in a committed relationship that has lasted since I was 15 years old (I'm 29 now).  We struggled with this issue a lot until we finally decided to explore an open relationship.  We were both needing variety.  I am not a fan of monogamy.  I think that if the lines of communication are open, and you discuss *literally everything* (boundaries, specific persons, situations, etc) it works out well.  Or, at least it has for us.  We both know that we are not going to be a life partner with anyone else, ever, and we reserve all of our deepest emotional sentiments for each other, our hopes and fears, etc..but, we can't help that we just want to fuck lots of people.  That's just a thing we do.  As long as our partners know that we're committed to each other and not looking for anything substantial, it works for us.  Maybe give it a shot?
