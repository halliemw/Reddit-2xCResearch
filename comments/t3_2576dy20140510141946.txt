OK...I guess I should not have bothered telling you that downplaying the ordeal on any side is a bad idea. 

By what magic does male circumcision not involve intense pain? Babies feel pain even more than adults do and it interferes with their brain development as the levels of cortisol ( stress hormone) do not go back to normal for 6 months after the operation.Would FGM be ok if it was done when the girl is "too young to understand"? These are NOT valid arguments! ANd muslim boys are cut anywhere between birth and 14yo so they are certainly old enough to understand. At the end of the day you are still [deprived of the most sensitive part of your body](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847) whatever your age during the procedure.

As for what you say about pleasure, both practices are engineered to reduce it, and they both stem from patriarchy. 

Here is a scientific study that has been done on the issue of FGM and pleasure

>The group of 137 women, affected by different types of FGM/C, reported orgasm in almost 86%, always 69.23%; 58 mutilated young women reported orgasm in 91.43%, always 8.57%; after defibulation 14 out of 15 infibulated women reported orgasm; the group of 57 infibulated women investigated with the FSFI questionnaire showed significant differences between group of study and an equivalent group of control in desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction with mean scores higher in the group of mutilated women

See? And you will NEVER See me using this to say "oh FGM is not so bad, they can still have fun". So don't do it, especially as someone who is intact, it's insulting and does not further your cause.
