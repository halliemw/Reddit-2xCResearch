Yep that's how I felt. So to replace the action of playing/twirling my hair I would run my hands through it which resulted in either gray hair or really messy hair. There is a series of pictures from a party I was at where you could tell I was nervous abd ny hair goes from normal regular old pixie to I just duck my hand in an electrical outlet for the post three hours. Pretty funny actually
