There is nothing wrong with wanting to go No Contact with someone. In fact, it is very healthy to cut such toxic people out of your life.

>I think she needs to move beyond it now

Whether or not she moves on with it (and also the criterion) is not up to you. You are impressing your beliefs upon her. Even if there wasn't all of this history with this guy being an asshole/weird, her not wanting to is enough; she doesn't need a "good" reason. This is a huge lack of respect for your friend.

She doesn't want him there, she made that clear to you, and you aren't respecting her wishes.
