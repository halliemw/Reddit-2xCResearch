I supect  that I have some form of mental illness.

However I believe society actually sucks k-18 we are forced in an environment where's it's unambious the school and society only value us among our peers. School tells us what to think, and more pointiedly tells it's okay that they have the right to tell us what to think. I think in the future we will find the way they teach students now to be barbaric. In fact I feel that we as society hate our kids. I mean we have media outlets like fox news spreading propaganda about how video games generate violence. We hate the music kids listen to, we hate comics, and video games. I mean I don't get it why have a kid if you don't want to teach them? Why do parents let teachers have more time with them? I think teen angst mostly comes from being surrouned constantly with individuals who don't have a full sense of self yet and just being judged by people who don't even know themselves.Getting validation from the blind so to speak.

 I'm not an emotionaly senstive person, I once got arrested for simply not answer cops questions(not illegal), where I was then interrogated for two hours with them asking me questons like "are you a pedophile?", and "are you a terrorist?", but I never so much as spoken a word. The thought of going to school for a day even now is extremely emotionaly draining.

This shit is all very fucked up and we internalize all this shit. I mean were exspected to work more then  have fun in our lives. What about [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjOtxviwmw) This shit isn't up in the clouds or metaphoricaly a problem its real In fact most of the thing alan watts say are relevant to my point
