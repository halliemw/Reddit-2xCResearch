Yes, what your friend did was inappropriate, and it put your boyfriend in an awkward/non-consensual situation. I'm trying to put myself in your shoes here to see how I'd feel, and "livid" isn't quite it. Irritated, maybe. Just have a calm chat with your friend about boundaries and how/why what he did wasn't cool. This doesn't need to be dramatic. Yes, it was a violation, but most likely it can be resolved in a quick, mature conversation.
