You don't think of it as 100 pounds. Did you know that 5% weight reduction is considered clinically significant? So if you're 250 pounds right now, losing 12.5 pounds will improve your health a lot. 12.5 pounds is doable, right? You can lose 12.5 pounds. And then when you've lost that and you're 237.5 pounds, you recalculate. Now you have to lose 12 pounds. You already lost 12.5 pounds, so you can lose 12 pounds. You know you can do it. 

As you lose weight, you'll notice yourself feeling better, especially if you have PCOS. Weight loss will really improve your symptoms, so that will also be motivation as you start seeing results. You might find that eating a keto or generally low glycemic index diet will help you feel better and lose weight as well because it will make your insulin resistance less relevant. And since PCOS is partially caused by defective insulin signaling, you may find some of your symptoms relieved to some extent just by a diet change.
