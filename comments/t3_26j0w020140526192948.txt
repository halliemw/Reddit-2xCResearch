I strongly disagree with this. Should his mental health be discussed and viewed as problem that needs fixing? Yes, absolutely, mental health is being horrendously neglected.

However. His misogynistic ideals were part of who he was and shaped who he went after - he was stopped by the lack of answer at the sorority, otherwise who knows how many women he would have killed. This needs to be discussed as well because misogyny is a problem that's very prevalent in our society.
