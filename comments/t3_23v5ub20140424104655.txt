I may be in the wrong subreddit (stumbled upon this via search), but here's my two cents as a guy...

Sounds like the only thing you did wrong was falling for two jackasses in a row...

First thing you have to do is get away from the ex that you're living with. That is never going to get any easier...
Second, distance yourself from T and W too.

T is moving on, and #2 is abusive... you have no reason to keep either of them in your life.

If finding a job at home is hard, why not look further afield? You've pretty much said you have zero ties... this could be a whole new start.

It may be a childish way to put it, but the logic is sound... every princess is going to kiss a few frogs before finding her prince.
