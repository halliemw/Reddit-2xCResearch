I don't think you should be as angry as you are with the doctors who refuse to sterilize you. While they shouldn't try to argue with you, you can't be angry at the fact that they care and don't want to be the reason for your regret (not that you'll have any, just that they can't see it from your view). It's like a tattoo artist refusing to tattoo someone for something that they want - they just don't want to be part of what they think is a bad decision (not that it is).
