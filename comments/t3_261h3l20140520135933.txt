WOW, just wow. That quote is just my personality made a quote :O
I tend to nostalgia a lot, I feel nostalgic about past times that were just average back then, but from time to time I crave them , I adore them, even though I have a better life now, and have that urge for everything new. I recall, 5 years ago or so, when I was at a college trip at london, I told one of my teachers "I have nostalgia but... about the future. is that even possible?" And he told me "nope", but it is possible indeed: "we are homesick most for the places we have never known." touching, really.
