I'm not going to say therapy completely changed my views on life or anything like that but they certainly were able to pinpoint some problems with OCD and anxiety that ended up answering lots of questions that I had never considered before and it has made me a stronger person because I understand now that a lot of the issues I have deal with OCD and it is easier for me to notice the issue and push through the problems by convincing myself my OCD is acting up and have power over my own thoughts instead of raising my own anxieties out of control.  I am also on medication for depression and before the meds I was so depressed I barely wanted to get out of bed. Every day was a constant struggle. Some people may be against medication but I don't see how I lived without it before.
