For me at least it is akin to having the flu for the first couple days. I get terrible headaches, my entire body aches and I just want to sleep all the time. It isn't sexist to look after someone who is feeling ill, just being a decent partner/ friend. Calling it "not the most comfortable time" is sexist as you are essentially telling all women that what they go through clearly isn't actually bad at all because you totally know some women.
