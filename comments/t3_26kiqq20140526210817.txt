Adding to this, my aunt was told to place a dab of personal lubricant in the vaginal canal and on the tip of the plastic applicator. 

It worked like a charm for her though the first two months were tough.  (I don't know how to properly talk about this in English! 'First two menses/menstruations/cycles?')

Myself, I discovered it wasn't a period, that my vaginal canal was deformed and perforated from assault, and that NOTHING fits in there. 

We can only assume OP (not eve-, OP) is telling the truth, but i had to add that I didn't tell anyone I was assaulted when I posted to Yahoo! Questions over a decade ago either. 

I just talked about menstruation and Tampax light plugs not fitting. And no, I wasn't trying to put it in my urethra either, but that DID happen to a friend of mine. 

Good on you, eve- I just thought my opinion could be helpful to OP or anyone reading your own great post. 
Avaginogenesis is real too.
