Exactly.

I lost 50 pounds last year. I can say "you're not alone" to the person trying to lose fat. I went from minimum wage job to tech industry and I can say "you're not alone" to my cousins finishing college and not able to find work. I can reach out and tell other human beings "you're not alone" on a ton of other struggles in life.

But a woman trying to feed her child in the face of a judgmental public I cannot stand next to her so she is not alone because boobs.

And supposedly I'm the one with the problem.
