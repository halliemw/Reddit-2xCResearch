Assassin's Creed: Liberation (Liberations? Something) had a female lead, if you've got a PS Vita or PS3. Also, I thought AC4 had some pretty awesome female characters in it, though the lead was male. 

Yeah, I actually literally just had this debate with a friend, pretty much the only recent-ish games we could come up with which featured female leads were Portal, Metroid, Tomb Raider, and games where you can be either gender.
