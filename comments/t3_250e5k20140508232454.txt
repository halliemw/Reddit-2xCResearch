Actually it's NEVER EVER enforced, but women aren't allowed to bic their heads.  They can use a clipper with no guard (called a 0 in the army because you use 0 guard) but they can't shave it with a blade.  

I've literally never heard of that rule being enforced though.

The only time you even hear about it is when women put a shine on it, and men aren't supposed to do that either, because it's fadish and standoutish and against the concept of uniformity.
