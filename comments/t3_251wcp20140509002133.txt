One time in a thread, everyone was in a tizzy about girls "all wearing the same leggings and tall boots outfit" and being mindless, vapid, fashion-slave dummies.  I mentioned that many girls wear those clothes because they're comfy, and pointed out that this was a double standard because men often wear the same t-shirt/jeans combo but don't get called "vapid, mindless fashion-salves" for it.  Then I got alllll sorts of "watch out, here comes the FemiNazi brigade!" and "why are u so sensitive, it's funny lol, calm down" and "clean the sand out of your vagina" comments  :/

EDIT: Did some re-wording for clarity.
