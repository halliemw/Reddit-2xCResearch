It wasn't too bad actually, It was pretty numb during the first few days of recovery just because the blood supply wasn't fantastic. After that it hurt, But I have other chronic pain issues, and they hurt more, so I barely noticed my clitoris hurting. I probably should of complained a bit more though and tried to get some pain releif, because I think that would of been nice to have.
