lol, i just feel like everybody is talking about it as if Aerie's campaign was about "Real-sized" girls. I mean, the tagline is "Whether you're flat as a surfboard or curvy like coconuts..."

we would really be talking about the coolness of the non-photoshop, but everywhere in this thread is "real sized" offense or bra-pedantry. 

totes weird. CLEARLY its a sunday and we are all tired and bored and dreading work on monday :P
