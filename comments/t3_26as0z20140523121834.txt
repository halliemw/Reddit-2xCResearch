OMG...so this!   So many little things that can be resolved by actually speaking them out loud to the person (or people) involved.


Teamwork.  That's a key too.   Be willing to speak up and say "I really don't like cooking but I don't mind doing the dishes, want to swap those jobs on a semi-permanent basis?"  Find the jobs you're willing to do regularly, find the jobs your SO is willing to do regularly, negotiate on common jobs, and keep the lines of communication open.
