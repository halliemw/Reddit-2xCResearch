I have been wondering the same thing! I grew up in the Southeast and I live in the Southwest right now. I have been catcalled twice that I can recall while in these areas, but neither time was anything more than a whistle or a "hey baby!" from a car.   

When I went to Lincoln, Nebraska last year, however, my female friends and I got both whistled at and yelled at from a car, "I can smell your cunt!" and we were only there for 4 days.
