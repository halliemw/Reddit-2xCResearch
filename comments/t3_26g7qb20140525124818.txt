I'm feeling your pain now sister! I completely missed my period last month and then yesterday it started and you know what for the first time in 11 years I thought it was going to be good, sure I had cramp but I wasn't hormonal, crying or had cravings I even managed to cook a slap up meal! 

Today...oh god... I spent most of the morning in bed because it hurt so bad, I got drugged up and got in the shower and I was so dizzy I had to sit down! I've spent the rest of the day in tears, getting upset at everything ( I cried because my chicken nuggets were too crunchy) when my boyfriend left for work I sobbed for 30 minutes straight. 

Right now I'm curled up on the sofa with a big fluffy blanket, craving chocolate and just wishing I never had to have another period again.
