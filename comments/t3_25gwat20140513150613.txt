I'm just so confused. We are friends. I didn't think he would do that. I know he was really, really drunk, and I just didn't think he would try anything simply because of Kristen. Also, the way I handled it wouldn't make any sense to anyone. I just let it happen, feeling disconnected and I closed my eyes at first. I felt so heavy and wanted to crawl into myself. But I didn't shove him off, and I didn't say stop right away. He's really big and was on top of me and really into it, and the few little motions I did to push him away were like nothing until I finally said stop. Like I said, he kept going for a couple minutes because I guess he was trying to finish. I just kept pulling away but without making a big struggle of it. The worst part is between all the shock and paralyzed feelings I did moan a couple of times because of the way it felt. I feel like that makes it not rape because I enjoyed some of it even though I wanted to disappear from the room. I know it is just a normal response of the body, but it makes me so confused. I'm so depressed today that I can barely walk around or type this message. I just want to crawl into a hole.
