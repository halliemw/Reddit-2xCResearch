I would disagree with you on that. The subreddit was relatively "safe", meaning that **for the most part** if you came to it you didn't really have to see nasty degrading comments. Of course there would be trolls/occasional assholes, but generally by the time you get to a thread they would be heavily downvoted/deleted by mods. It was safe in the fact that for the most part you didn't really have to worry about being downvoted simply for not being conventionally attractive. I doubt not conventionally attractive people will be upvoted past the new queue at all now. On the flip side of that coin this sub was also relatively safe for conventionally attractive women to post without worrying about receiving hundreds of nasty/sexual private messages about their appearance.

Obviously it is never truly *safe* to post your picture on the internet (I personally wouldn't do it either), but compared to other subreddits, this was a much better place to share a picture that you like, and is important to you, without worrying about getting the kind of reaction you would get in other places on reddit, and I think that is what everyone means when they say it was a "safe space".
