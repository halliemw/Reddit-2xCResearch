Hormonal contraceptives can increase the risk for blood clots significantly.  So your friend's story regarding the embolism is plausible.  Happened to a friend of mine a couple of years ago.

Edit: since I'm being downvoted... [source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2014-02-03-media-hype-blood-clot-risk-of-birth-control-pills/)

The risk is still minimal (pre hormonal BC the numbers are ~2 in 10,000 - post hormonal bc the numbers are ~12 in 10,000) but it is increased.
