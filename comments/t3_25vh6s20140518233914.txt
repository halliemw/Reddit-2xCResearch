In no way, shape, or form. The number of standing military attacks on the US (or on USSR) stands at zero throughout the history of the Cold War, thereby clearly indicating that the number is insensitive to military strength (which varied significantly throughout the Cold War).

That was the primary reason for USSR's collapse, and one of the major reasons for why US could justify getting involved in several wars of aggression - for which the nation is still paying, primarily economically.
