Oh my goodness.  You're just not taking my point.  

This:

>I am talking about how clothing and skin is interpreted and what expectations there are around that as to what's "professional" for each gender.

Does NOT mean "I take a piece of clothing off of x person's body and put that exact piece of clothing on someone else's body and see what happens"

Try to focus on the point I'm making.
