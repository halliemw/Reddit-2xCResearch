I think this is a fantastic idea. It reminds me of things I've seen where safe spaces are offered to LGBTQ teens who get kicked out of their houses, but having never participated in one I'm not sure how they operate for the safety of all involved. Would it be helpful for me to do some research along those lines, see if I can find any information beyond the 3 ideas already being discussed?
