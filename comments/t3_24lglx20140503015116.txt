The first step you should do is to research what is available in your area for treating eating disorders, whether he can afford them and how to get an appointment for an initial assessment.

Then you need to speak to him about your concerns, without him being able to put you off or delay the conversation. 

Tell him how worried you are about his health, and about the dangers of purging. If he is purging multiple times a day, that can cause dangerously low levels of potassium in his blood, his teeth will be getting damaged and may eventually fall out and there is a risk of tearing his oesophagus when he is having forceful vomiting that could lead to life threatening bleeding. See if you can get him to agree to go with you to a doctor to check out those things and assess him for an eating disorder. Just because he is purging, he doesn't necessarily have bulimia, (purging can be a feature of anorexia, bulimia or something called purging disorder). 

This will be a difficult conversation. It is likely that he does not want to talk to you about this because his eating disorder knows when it is being threatened, and it does not want to lose its grip on him. You just need to be persistent and know that you are being a loving girlfriend who is looking out for him, even when he might be calling you a busybody who should mind their own business. 

All the best.
