I call to mind no examples of outright sexism in my own life. And absolutely no sexual assault of any kind.  
  
but i do agree it seems i'm in the minority. i don't go to bars much, don't have enviable tits, and seldom find myself alone around strange men. also i have a shit, flaky memory so maybe i've blocked something out? idunno. i don't take much credit for my good fortune, it definitely seems more likely to happen to any given person than to never happen. but i try to speak out against and fight it when i see it!
