You continue to ascribe to me thoughts that I do not hold and have not expressed. I must say, a lot of this thread has been stimulating, but this is well below the level of discourse I've previously found on this subreddit. Perhaps I just chose an ill time to try and contribute.

My concern is entirely for the people here. You actually capture it correctly in your first sentence: I care about how people here *see*. I'm trying to encourage moderation in thought and action. I think that when we as humans allow outrage and bias to rule us, when we ascribe incorrect probabilities to events, we inherently reduce our own and others' potential for happiness. And yet, I argue that based on the information we have, the probability we should ascribe to this man having undeleted photos of OP is more like 80% instead of 100%, [I'm accused of flying to his aid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_excluded_middle).

I haven't needed to express additional sympathy for OP because TwoX is slightly more sane than most of reddit and I haven't seen many comments that need correction on that degree (I assure you that in AdviceAnimals I would have a lot of downvoted comments explaining why it was wrong and how much sympathy OP is due, forgive me for thinking that that was unnecessary here).

As I've said before, of course it's a terrible thing to do. But the thoughts behind an action have a lot to do with how somebody should respond to them.
