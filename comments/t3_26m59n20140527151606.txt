I had a room mate do this. Her BF was all of a sudden just there. Constantly. He had food in the fridge and sat on the couch playing games all day. Our electricity bill went up like $45 and he used all the hot water. I talked to her and "oh no he lives with his parents he just likes spending time with me" then some new furniture appeared and that was it. Called the landlord and told him to start paying utilities and work out a rent with the owner or GTFO. I should also explain he went on a drug binge while she was at work and left a bunch of dishes around the house. They were mad for a bit, but once he started helping out everything was fine. He vacuumed and cleaned house, made dinner ect. It was all around not so bad. He also stopped doing every drug under the sun in the house.
