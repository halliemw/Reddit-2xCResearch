You're absolutley right. I guess it was just bound to happen and we couldn't avoid it. He was living a fantasy world, I just hate how bad it hurts. 

My brother (hahaha) is in an overly crowded house with 4 other not uber good looking males. He also sadly doesn't have much money to share either. But I do have a super cliche tattoo that says: "This too shall pass." I guess it's time I listen to myself and my tattoo and stop worrying.
