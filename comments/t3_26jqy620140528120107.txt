That and since it feels like SO much I waddle around like a penguin when I have it because I'm convinced I'm going to stand up and blood will just pour all over the place. I think if I saw how much it actually was I wouldn't be so worried about moving around and being around people when I have it. For the most part I hide in my room under the covers when I have it. It's probably because the first few times I had it were REALLY heavy and I changed my pad every two hours but it still leaked all over. When I had to go to school I'd wear like three pads, 3 pairs of underwear, stockings, shorts, and than my skirt. (I went to a Catholic school and we had assigned bathroom times and we could only go that one time a day.)
