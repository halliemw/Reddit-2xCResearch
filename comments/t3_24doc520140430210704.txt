I want to repeat what Lil_Boots said in a reply so that you get proper treatment.

You have what is known as PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome, or PCOS.  It is a metabolic disease for which the biggest symptom is multiple cysts on the ovaries.  These cysts affect numerous other hormones, which is what caused the acne.

PCOS most likely affects one in ten women, however, because it often goes undiagnosed and is still largely ignored by the medical profession, it's hard to know what an accurate number is.  Personally, I was diagnosed at fourteen, but wasn't told that I was diagnosed until I was in college.

As Lil_Boots1 said, BC is often given to help regulate hormones, which the cysts throw off.  Some women with PCOS, however, feel that because BC does not solve the problem of the cysts, that this is not an ideal treatment.

PCOS has a strong correlation with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.  There is some evidence that treating the insulin resistance will result in reduced cysts.   These women eat a low-carb or diabetic diet, exercise, and take extended release metformin, as well as seeing an endocrinologist for treatment instead of just a gynecologist.

You can find reproductive endocrinologists who specialize in treating PCOS, however these doctors sometimes focus on women actively trying to get pregnant.

It should be noted that some women eschew medicine altogether and try to treat their PCOS solely through natural means.  I did this for several years when I was without health insurance.  However, now that I have insurance, I've been shopping around for a doctor that I feel comfortable with.

I hope this is helpful to you.  You can find more information and connect with other woman who have PCOS at [/r/PCOS](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcos) and [http://www.soulcysters.net/](http://www.soulcysters.net/)
