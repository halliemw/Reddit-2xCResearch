If you haven't yet met someone you wanted to marry, going husband hunting at 22 wouldn't have helped. You're allowed to be picky, but note that the people you know who have great relationships could probably have great relationships with a bunch of people who aren't their current SO. Nobody will admit that, but a lot of people are just easy going and fall in love really easily. There's nothing wrong with having a harder time falling in love, and having higher standards, but you'll have to expect that it's going to be harder to find someone. Just don't beat yourself up about it, and don't think that age factors into it that much. Your requirements for a husband are likely just different from your friends'.
