"if I could just fix him"

Right there.

You know those girlfriends made fun of in comedy for staying with an asshole because "I can change him"? That's us. We know we're better people and we can see the potential in these guys, but they are the only ones who can change. There is no putting up with it until they get the message. You have to leave. That sends a message. I was more likely to hear about how other women are sluts and whores than how proud he was of me for my accomplishments or how attracted he was to me. He wanted trust and honesty and unconditional love, but he never gave any of that to me. I put up with it because I felt sorry for him. There's a disturbing cultural message that we have to love people "no matter what". You do not have to put up with abuse because they're too weak to take care of themselves.
