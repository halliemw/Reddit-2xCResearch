It would definitely be helpful for those of us who feel strongly about being able to help, but don't have a fixed address, a living situation that allows guests, or wish to remain anonymous. 

Having something like this could also allow for smaller donations from those who want to help, but can't afford the total cost of a hotel, bus or plane trip... I guess a kind of fund a portion of the total cost kind of thing?
