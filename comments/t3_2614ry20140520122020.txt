I wish their were more girls in physics. I had some tough times in uni and I was motivated by a certain female professor. 

People will ask me about being a woman in physics and its like "Why do I have to talk on behalf of all woman?". 

On a side not, those equations are kind of meaningless but I think they are from electrodynamics and possibly quantum mechanics. I see a hamiltonian and maxwell's equation, but also some other stuff that I don't recognize.
