Three days out and cramping a lot is okay. As rootless says, if you're having pain that's not taken care of by OTC meds, call the doc. Otherwise, it's your body getting adjusted to the IUD. 

I had my first one put in at the age of 32, without having had kids, and I cramped for a solid week. Twelve years later, I still get the occasional cramp before my one-day period. The second Mirena, btw, did not cause as much cramping as the first, but it was still noticeable. 

Scary things to see the doc about immediately: pain not controlled with OTC meds, sudden severe bright-red blood (more than a pad an hour), suddenly spiking a high fever (over 101F/38.3C) without other causes. It's *highly unlikely* that anything bad has happened; this is just a belt-and-suspenders list.
