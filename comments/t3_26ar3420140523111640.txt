I have half sleeves in progress and wear those boat neck tops with sleeves that stop right above the elbow, whenever I have to cover them. I also have a collar bone/upper chest tattoo that peeks out a bit too but it's never been a problem... I've worn a scarf or chunky necklace in paranoid situations when I wanted to be safe, though.
