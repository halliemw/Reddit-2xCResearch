Ugh, PREACH. 

My mom introduced me to it via the old serials (Tom Baker <3) before it premiered again with the new series in 2005 and we haven't missed an episode, except now that I'm at college without BBC America. 

But man, if people didn't make fun of me. Now all I hear about is how everyone loves 11 and 10 was ~so emotional~ and I'm like YO, HAVE Y'ALL EVER WATCHED AN EPISODE THAT AIRED BEFORE 2007? NO? OKAY, BYE. 

...except I can't even do that because then people mention the Tumblr fandom.
