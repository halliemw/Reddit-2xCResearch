Um. I've been a subscriber to TwoX for a good two and a half years now (it was actually one of the first ones I subbed to) and I can say with complete honestly aka not a blatant liar that the women here (not necessarily feminists) as a whole are very, very hostile to men.

Unless the comment/post starts with "I am a male feminist" or something along those lines, any comment identifying themselves as a man get immediately and heavily downvoted. Some are definitely deserved, some are definitely not.

But saying that TwoX has always welcomed men with open arms is a pretty extreme fabrication.
