I cannot imagine anyone, guy or girl, dressing like Hannah does in Girls and being taken seriously in the professional world. Even in this day and age, people need to care about their appearance to some degree- I certainly wouldn't want someone working for me who looked like they couldn't be bothered to spend 10 minutes making sure they look decent.

I'm overweight myself and all about loving yourself and your body, but I really don't think Lena Dunham's Hannah is an exemplary  role model for the real world just for that reason.
