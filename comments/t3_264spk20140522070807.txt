It's funny, your daughter sounds exactly like me in High School. I had grade issues, was bullied, no self-confidence, in the closet. I'm in college now and the fact that she's starting to change the way she views herself now is huge. I realize I'm just a stranger on the internet but, if you ever want insight from a similar perspective, shoot me a pm. You sound like an an incredibly supportive parent and like other commenters said, the fact that you knew about her sexuality before her friends is huge. Congrats and keep doing what you're doing!
