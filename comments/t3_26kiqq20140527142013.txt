Ugh I totally understand. I used to be in tears trying to get the damn things in. Pretty much only used them if I was gonna be swimming =\ 

Try different angles. Like the leg on the toilet pose. Also I found that once I pushed past the pain, it kinda went in ok. Removing it was equally painful however /sigh

I hope you have better luck than me.
