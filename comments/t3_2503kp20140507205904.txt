Sorry just used baby as a catch all term for zygote/embryo/fetus/unborn entity not trying to make a statement about whether or not you should have an abortion or not.

It's your decision and you need to do what's right for you, but if I felt the same as your boyfriend it would be a difficult blow to recover from.

I hope it works out for you guys, that he understands that the abortion is necessary and decides to support you.
