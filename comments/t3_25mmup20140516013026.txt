They can, but the school has the ability to greatly hinder or greatly help the police in their investigation. If all they were doing was helping the police, their role would be much different. But since Title IX requires them to do their own separate investigation, and will actually punish schools who are seen as "not doing enough" separate from the real legal process, they end up running a parallel investigation to the real police that they are neither qualified in nor do they really want to do. 

What it usually ends up doing is making the police investigation more arduous and muddying the water.

Good luck getting a rape conviction if the school's broken process doesn't result in expulsion. No jury is convicting somebody that a school let walk.
