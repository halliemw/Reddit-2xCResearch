Similar to mansplaining - the most recent occurrence for me was a few weeks back. One of the little windows in my apartment hasn't shut properly since I moved in seven months back, but I'm able to stop any draft with an inner window panel that slides across. I'm only going to be living here for a couple more months so I'm not that bothered.

My nan however is weirdly obsessed about it. Every time she comes over she's asked me if I've 'had a man' come to fix it. A few weeks back, my family came round for my mum's birthday, and my nan told her brother about the window. I explained to him that not only is the lock broken (a key has been broken off inside it) but the hinges are broken too, so there's little that can be done without getting a lot of stuff replaced. He didn't believe me, so he came into my room and climbed up on my bed (with his shoes on -_-), fiddled with it for 5 minutes, before confirming exactly what I said. Only then was my nan satisfied.

I know it seems silly and minor, but it just irritated the fuck out of me that no-one would take my word about the state of my own window in my own apartment until a man came and confirmed it.
