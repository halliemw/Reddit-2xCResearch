I'm someone who has actually worked in HIV testing and care, and I want to tell you both that you are totally not alone in feeling this level of anxiety and that you are very, very unlikely to be HIV positive (but you seem to know the latter already). 

You said this to some extent, and it sounds obvious, but I think it's still helpful to reiterate: you can't get HIV from someone who doesn't have HIV. This guy might have friends recovering from heroin, but that doesn't mean he's a heroin user. Even if he is, he might never have shared a needle. He might not have HIV. He probably doesn't have HIV. And you USED CONDOMS. Which is awesome and the right thing to do. Oral sex is so unlikely to transmit HIV that people are generally willing to say that it doesn't happen unless you have open sores or are bleeding from your mouth. Again, not relevant if he doesn't have HIV. 

All that being said, it is not unusual to be really scared and no amount of logic will slow your heartbeat until you get your result. When I get tested for anything, it always feels (in my head) that the chances of having it go from almost zero to, like, 50/50--as though the act alone of being tested has brought additional risks with it. Have I ever had any reason to believe I have TB? Nope. But every time I get a TB skin test I suddenly become convinced that it will be positive. It's normal and human. That's exacerbated if you are feeling vulnerable because this panic has resulted from being intimate with someone who you now know is untrustworthy. 

It's great that you're taking a friend with you, and I'm confident that by the end of the day you will be crying to her out of relief and not out of fear. If you have more questions today or tomorrow, feel free to PM me.
