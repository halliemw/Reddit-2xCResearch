Op, Eating disorders are not about what size you are. You do not need to be a certain weight to have an eating disorder. Bulimics especially can be any weight during the disorder.  I really really think you need to get some help. University counsellors are a great start as they are free and usually have a good understanding of a wide range of issues.

   I don't know if you should go on letting people have these unreal expectations of you, while hiding your own pain. I really hope you can find the strength to tell your mother what your going through, then maybe she will see that 'being thin' is not worth it, This is not worth your health and happiness.

   You mother sounds like she may have some mild food issues herself.
