Let me start by saying that it sucks that this happened to you, and the feelings of shame plagued you for so long. It sounds extremely stressful for such a young child to have to deal with. Also, I have no idea if this is considered molestation or not. What I can tell you is that it's pretty common for kids to experiment this way. A cousin of mine used to do something similar (albeit much milder). I've also heard (anecdotally) many stories that run along the same lines (a slightly older kid or a kid of the same age instigating sexual play). I'm not saying that any of this excuses what happened or should invalidate how you feel. All I'm saying is that it's very common and you shouldn't feel ashamed or alone!
