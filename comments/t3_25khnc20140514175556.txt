This a is a very good point. If a statement is to be made, it should be made about the ratio of men-to-women in software development. 
Why this is important:
If the TOTAL number of people in software development has increased by 300%, and the total number of women has only increased by 81%, that means that women now occupy roughly 60% less of the software-development field than the did in 2001.
