My suggestion is to ask your friends for help. I was incredibly blessed that my friends and family donated their talents to me as their wedding gifts. A friend of mine did some basic Save the Dates and invitations. My cousin is a hair dresser so she did my hair and my mom's hair while one of my brides-men's dates did my brides maids hair. My best friend did my make up (which was pretty basic as well but still beautiful). I got my dress from a David's Bridal sale and it was only $250 but I felt like Cinderella. I wore Converse Allstars which I got for like $25 at TJ Maxx. A family friend is a DJ so he did the reception at no cost. I later found out he usually charges $700 for weddings. Another family friend donated my bouquet. I also got extremely lucky because my aunt's best friend donated her home which is like a million dollar house with 5 acres, a lake and it was at the base of a mountain. Best friend made my cake which we got for $2 at the grocery store (funfetti because that shit is delish).  My grandparents paid for the alcohol which we bought in bulk when it was on sale. My family set everything up the night before during our "rehearsal dinner." We rented chairs and tables from a church. There are ways to cut expenses. You just have to figure out what's important to you.
