*Why?* Why don't women like it? Why aren't women good at it? You need to contribute something better than that. The point of these threads is to challenge these assumptions, don't just accept them. If you want to contribute to this subreddit, you will need to question why you think like this and *should* you think like this?

For example, as someone has helpfully pointed out below, the industry requires long hours, and as women are more often the primary carers for children, it's harder for them to work long hours. They "choose" not to go into the industry, because they don't really have a choice. If we lived in a society where men were encouraged to take an equal share of child care, we'd see more women in roles like chefs. Our society discourages men from going into childcare just as much as it discourages women going into jobs which require long hours.
