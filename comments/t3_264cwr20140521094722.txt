Ask yourself this: Why is he deliberately hurting you?

Because he is. He could want to sleep with 500 women, and just keep those desires to himself. But in stead, he chooses to tell you. The only thing he gets out of that telling, is hurting you.

And then there's the sexism... I don't need to tell you why it's bad.

Basically, he is working quite hard to destroy your self-esteem, and seems to take great pleasure in hurting you. It's abusive behavior.
