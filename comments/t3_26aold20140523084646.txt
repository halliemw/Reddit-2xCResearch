I had the exact same problem until I became comfortable with my own life. I think the best thing you can do is honestly ask yourself where you don't feel satisfied in your own life and work on that, the jealousy you feel when hearing about another's success could be coming from your own unsatisfaction. Might not be the case for you but it certainly was for me and it allowed me to have much more positive relationships when I was truly happy with my own life.
