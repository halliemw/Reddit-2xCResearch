Hahahaha, thank you for sharing, your embarrassing hospital period story makes me feel much better about mine! 

I'll keep a good thought for your dad. The hospital DOES get super depressing. One thing that my sister did for me that really helped was to bring me a new volume in a book series that I loved every time I was admitted, so I had something nice to look forward to instead of just misery -- I don't know if your dad is the kind of person who would appreciate that, or if he's got too much chemo brain to read, but it really helped me get through the cycles.
