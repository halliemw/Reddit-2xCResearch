It took me several years and a few different doctors to get mine. Hormonal birth control does not work well with me due to several unpleasant side effects. I finally found a nurse midwife who approved of it. She told me that IUDs are made differently now and that the ones they were using in the past carried an increased risk of complications (infection, perforation of the uterus etc.)

When I went to have it inserted, the person who was supposed to do it was not in. The lady who put it in was very negative about the whole thing. She threatened me with infection, possible infertility, and pain, "You know this is going to hurt, right?" (It wasn't terrible.) She was opposed to the whole idea because I wasn't married at the time, young and had no children. 

Despite all of that, I am extremely glad I got mine. I don't have to worry about taking a pill every day or the side effects that come with it. Plus, it lasts for 10 years (for the non-hormonal kind) so I don't have to worry about birth control for a very long time. 

The best thing for you to do is research, find the risks, acknowledge that you understand them and keep trying for a doctor who will allow you to have one.
