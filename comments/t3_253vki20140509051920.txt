I'm always embarassed when people holler for ladies, and I'm a man. I suspect some men play a statistics game where their pushiness works on 1 in 100 women, so they don't mind offending 99 because it still raises their probability of success (unless we progress to a society where their 99 missteps are more clearly punished). There's the old adage...

"The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt."
