> Women are the largest voting bloc in the west. If anyone is elected it is by their blessing.

Yeah, no. I'm not even sure what "voting bloc in the west" is supposed to mean, given that the "West" in comprised of several independent democracies, but it would be more correct to say that women are *seen and treated* as a voting bloc. And that because our interests, even our basic rights over our *own fucking bodies* are considered to be up for question. This is yet another facet of the same phenomenon: men are the default human, women are a weird aberration. A *type* of human, comparable to the various types of men. In the Smurf village you have Papa Smurf, Lazy Smurf, Grouchy Smurf, Brainy Smurf and Smurfette. In Western democracies, you have the religious right, WASPs, POCs and women. Men are not a voting bloc because your interests that pertain to simply *existing in a male body* are never under threat. 

>Wouldnt that be like a man going onto an all girl's university?

As a Greek woman, a) it's a peninsula not an island or a town and b) no, it would fucking not be anything like that. Unless all-girl universities are religious leaders who present themselves as god's representatives on Earth, whose word is only challenged by the morally corrupt and which are responsible for disseminating the prevalent belief among society that men are *quintessentially sinful creatures* who not only must be forbidden from studying at the same institution as women, but cannot be allowed to even tread the same ground as those seeking communion with god because they will inevitably lead them astray with their dirty, sinful bodies. 

So, yeah, no. Moving on?
