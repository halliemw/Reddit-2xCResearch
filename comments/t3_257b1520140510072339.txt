We don't want to get rid of every male viewer. Many users are worried that men will take over, and are posting more TMI posts than normal. 

The angry posts should clear up once the trolls get bored. The TMI posts are already starting to dwindle, and more of the usual posts can be seen in /new. The strength will return with the usual type of content.
