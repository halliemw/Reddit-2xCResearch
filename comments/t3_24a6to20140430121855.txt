Ugh I am a grad student at the same school you're graduating from now. It was funny that I was able to guess where you went before clicking on your username. 

I think it is SO weird that we only have 1 giant ceremony. At my undergrad (1/3 size of here so still not tiny) we had a giant outdoors commencement but then we had individual department commencements that were indoors - that way if the big one had to be cancelled, you at least had the little one!
