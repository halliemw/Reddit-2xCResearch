I've been mostly keto my whole life. Probably less than 100g of carbs a day. So that's four pregnancies on a rich diet of animal fats from my mother. I will have carbs but I'd rather they come from baby spinach leaves than crackers and chips. Last pregnancy I also gained like 45lbs so the next one I wanted to not gain so much.

I really wish they would do a study. I'm tired of added sugar in everything.
