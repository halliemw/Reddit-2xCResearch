Maybe your dad just wanted to let you know he was worried about your health, but wasn't sure how he should do it. It seems that since he waited for your significant other to leave the room and said you were "both getting chunky" he really is trying not to hurt you. 150 on a 5'4" frame is getting into overweight territory, and if your dad is just trying to get you to watch out for weight gain early-on he really does have your best interests in mind.
