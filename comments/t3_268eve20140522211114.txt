Yeah, I guess I just wanted to kind of back you up?  Like I definitely think he was aware that I was out of my mind (I remember him saying something comparing how I was to being drunk/high), but I don't think that totally translated to understanding I couldn't consent.  Maybe it had something to do with his Asperger's.  Or maybe he was just enjoying the "touching her there = more crazy phrases" too much to consider it.
