i hear you. i have nothing kind to say about my hair, especially now that i'm older and it's starting to thin out (even more!) around the temples like i'm some soon-to-be-bald old fellow. 

as a daily ratter (i, too, suffer from flat-melon), i can recommend a flat brush. it helps cover the teasing without taking too much hair out to do the covering. still have to be mighty gentle, but it's better than nothing. i am already considering wigs for later, and i'm not even 50 yet :/ i'd love to have a brow lift, but one of the possible side effects is loss of hair at the incision (temples). boo. 

ps: unlike you, my hair isn't straight. it's curly on the underside, flat as a board on top, and frizzier than if i'd stuck my finger in a light socket. i was over the moon when flat irons were invented. so yes, i flat iron, then tease the hell out of it! i'm sure people think i'm ridiculous for wearing hairbands every day (at my age), but it adds a tiny bit more lift to help give shape around the melon.
