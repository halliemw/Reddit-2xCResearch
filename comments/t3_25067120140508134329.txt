If she's wanting something as birth control and she can't be dissuaded, suggest the option of the depo shots or implant. The depo is only 3 months or so, but would mean she'd be checked up on by a nurse every three months, so even if you can't give her advice, someone can. The implant was pretty common at my high school, partly because most doctors think it not the best idea to use a IUD at 13-14 so went for the implant instead.
