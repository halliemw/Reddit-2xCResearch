You're right, but I thought you were criticising me for only dealing with the male assaulting female case as the basis of my article? The Amy Schumer link was really interesting though. I'm not pretending that other forms of assault don't exist, they just weren't the focus of the article. Although such consent workshops are equally important for all genders.
