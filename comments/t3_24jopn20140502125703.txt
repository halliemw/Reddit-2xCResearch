Yes, I think it's a pretty rude thing to ask someone in a work place! Even if I were her daughter, why would it matter enough to ask in the first few minutes of us walking into a meeting? In the context of a workplace I am an employee, not someone's daughter. I guess I am just afraid a hard "no" might rub my boss the wrong way, otherwise that would definitely be my response!
