>Someone telling you that evolution didn't happen is not anecdotal evidence. Your analogy is flawed.

Sigh. Fine. Let's get pedantic.

More specific: if somebody told me that their pastor had told them that the human eye was so complex that it couldn't have evolved on its own, I would have walked them through the supreme complexity and the evolutionary chains of eyes, as I had studied them.

The point is that it's absolutely correct AND appropriate to educate people in areas where you're an expert rather than dropping the conversation to their level. When you do that, you let them think that anecdotes are as relevant as study itself.

I'm not certain why you think people who bring up a casual anecdote about something they never studied **deserve** to get left in the dark. Basically you're saying that if people are wrong, they aren't worth your time and attention.
