Ew. This is beyond disgusting. I hate that this seems to keep popping up in the news. Rape and assault are violent crimes. They should NOT be met with slaps on the wrist. 

Judges have too much power. Perhaps we should start having juries decide on punishments. Or, y'know, just follow what's written and the norm. "Each of those charges normally carries six to 20 years in prison." That sound perfectly reasonable for what this guy did.

I don't want to call the judge an idiot, but this was a seriously idiotic move. It's disgusting and disrespectful. What if it had been his wife? Or his daughter or his son?
