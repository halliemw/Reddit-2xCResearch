You sound like you've got a really lovely bond but please make sure you're not being the replacement relationship. I've had a parent replace a partner with me emotionally in such a way that any emotion (non-sexual!) they felt for this person or about themselves was transferred to me. I was too young to understand and it's a tough thing to bear.


That being said, I'm best friends with one of my parents so I completely understand if it's not like that and please disregard prior writing. My best wishes to your family.
