I have a SPF face cream on the way and I am looking for an SPF lip balm, I also make sure to throw away lip balms immediately upon outbreak and purchase a new one once outbreak has finished (who new herpes was this expensive?!?)

It's been a really rough year thanks for your help, I'm taking a look at all your advice and it seems really possible... I'm gonna run an experiment when this outbreak finally goes and try to work to prevent outbreaks and will experiment, thanks for giving me some preventative tips! Hopefully it can start having some control again (outbreak frequency was around every 4-5 weeks before prophylactic treatment, and well, one week after I stop, it's magically back, so I may see if I can go back to them for a while! But thanks for your tips on the potential for prevention, I'm doing all I can.

The fear of it passing to my lady bits makes everything so much worse, I haven't dried my face with a towel in over a year.
