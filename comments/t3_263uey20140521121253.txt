This will for sure get deleted. 

Everyone here is assuming the ex had 100% control - when in fact maybe he didn't intend to fuck OP, but fuck.. he was as drunk as fuck, just as the OP said (WE had way too much). 

Drunk young men are always horny and will always ask to have it. They may respect your wishes when they're sober, but why is there a double standard that they are able to disengage (even if you want to engage in sex) while you're both intoxicated? 

Someone please explain this logic to me
