Man, you lucked out on not getting pain!! I was given 3 doses of morphine before I would even lay on my back. And I have zero tolerance for narcotics. That shit sucked. Though even after they found it through scans, they couldn't feel the baseball sized tumor doing a regular manual OBGYN check. Weird huh? Did you have anything cool in your tumor? 

I lost mine because it lost too much blood. If you look at my post history I put up pictures a few months ago. 

Coolest thing I learned in the process though was that you can be fully fertile with only a thumbnail sized chunk of your ovary still in place. Periods every month, no hormones for daily life or even for conception. The body is a weird freaking thing.
