Everyone is obviously their own individual person. None of these things would bother me (other than you not feeling welcome in your own home from not being there as often, I can't imagine why that would happen). 

Walking on eggshells is really on the person doing it, it's their own behavior. Some people really can't be reached, and will retreat, but assuming every quiet person is difficult to live with is ridiculous. We're all different.

It's pretty unfair to label slightly less social people as passive aggressive with communication issues. Like I said, everyone is an individual and while it's valid to notice patterns in people, it really isn't fair to judge a stranger based on past experiences with completely separate people.
