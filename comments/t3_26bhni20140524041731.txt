Other people are different from you. I'd drop my boyfriend like a hot pancake if he suggested to open our relationship, but it doesn't mean that somebody else wouldn't jump and shout "Hurray!" in the very same situation.

TL;DR - as long as everyone is happy, safe and consenting, what's the problem?
