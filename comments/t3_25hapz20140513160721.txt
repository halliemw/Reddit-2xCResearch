Hello, hope it is OK if I weigh in as I am a guy, and have a lot of experience in various car hobby's.  I am a big fan of cars, I have build show cars, my family used to race cars and I like keeping up with the car culture.  Motorsports as a hobby is a great thing, you get to meet a lot of people and build some great relationships, but that isn't what I really wanted to say.  I would say your BF has a problem, I have seen it a lot in the car culture and it is an easy trap to fall in to.

My biggest concern is this statement:
> This is money he sets aside from his paycheck plus he has taken out two loans against his 401k. 

Setting aside funds from a paycheck is good, two loans against your 401k bad.  Any type of motorsport hobby is a money looser, you will never make back what you put into it.  All of the stuff you see on TV, the famous guys, they make money off of sponsorship's. If he is spending that he doesn't actually have to pay for his hobby, that is sign of a problem.  Either the hobby is becoming an obsession, or he has poor money management skills. It is understandable that you are rethinking your future with him, both of these are things that need to be addressed.

Your later comments concerning his time commitment to the sport instead of you, his forgetting about your anniversary, etc. makes me suspect that this is an obsession.  I agree that you shouldn't say it is his hobby or you, but he should be able to take some time from his hobby to spend with you.

That is about all, best of luck to you.
