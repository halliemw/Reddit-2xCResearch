I never even thought about nipple hair until I read some internet story of a dude FREAKING OUT when he saw some on the girl he was with. I was fairly young so I also got super freaked out and have been shaving them ever since. I feel like shaving doesn't help much since they grow back overnight, so just yesterday I plucked a few. Super painful, but maybe they'll grow back slower.

Also, does anyone experience less sensitivity? I'll be honest I don't know if it's related to the lack of hair, but I can't feel anything unless they're getting tugged/squeezed/bit etc.
