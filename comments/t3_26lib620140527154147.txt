Exploring your sexuality is of COURSE okay! But doing it with a young friend who doesn't understand and isn't really consenting- that's not okay. Little boys aren't allowed to pull out their penises in front of their little boy friends if it makes the other friend feel weird or uncomfortable. If they are both interested in exploring, by all means, go for it.
