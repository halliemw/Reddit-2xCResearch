nice troll work.  but you are the reason schools have to deal with all this sexual assault on campus. for thoughts like, "you followed it with heavy kissing + alcohol.. which renders whatever you said irrelevant."

i've read and re-read the original post and at no point did she say she consented.  the most she said was, "i was unable to say no."  that is not consent.  and no, before you get all dude-ish, you don't need a written consent form every time you want to have sex with your girlfriend.  but when you have a woman who is so crystal clear (when sober) about what her wants and desires are, you had better make damn sure you get her consent before you do anything with her that conflicts with those wants/desires.    

So yea, she didn't consent.  and you need consent. always.  consent takes many forms and, as any adult male should know, Yes doesn't always = consent.  If she were underage, "yes" means nothing.  if she were drunk, "yes" means nothing. If she were mentally challenged, "yes" may mean nothing. you need consent.  it's really not that complicated.
