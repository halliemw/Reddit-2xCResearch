>  Are you the person who is going to be there when things get really tough? Can you take it? The last thing she needs is a person walking in and out of a relationship with her, but you have to worry about yourself too. 

I'm just projecting here from very little info, but I'm actually wondering whether OP would give himself permission to leave if it became necessary somewhere down the line.  I know a couple of very codependent couples where one partner's stuff is frankly out of control, and the other partner just sits there and tolerates it because that's just how things are.  It can take years to get to that state and then you don't realize how much you are putting up with.  ("We can't have people over because it upsets Dad to have people in his space, and then he will yell at us" -- this is not the kind of thing normal people think, but it was absolutely status quo in my family.  I still can't believe the kind of crap I had to deal with, and then unlearn as an adult.)  

OP -- I'm not saying my experience will be yours, but wanted to mention this stuff so you know to look out for it.  Please don't find yourself 20 years down the road delicately picking your way around your wife's triggers.  I truly believe both of you can commit to avoiding this outcome as long as you are both frankly and openly on the same page about it.
