Not well. At least at first, I was pretty jealous. I think my jealousy (obviously everyone has their own issues) stemmed from not feeling secure in our relationship. When we first got together my bf had very recently been sleeping with a mutual friend. He did not want a relationship with her, but when he and I started hooking up it became clear that she had feelings for him. We both felt very awkward and I found myself getting uncharacteristically jealous of her. She would pursue him in public (because at that point, we hadn't told any of our friends that we were getting together), and I would basically fly into these crazy rages. He did not reciprocate her advances so I had no right to feel this way, but jealousy is weird like that.

4 years later and we are in a much better place! The girl and I are actually very good friends. I think for me it was just a matter of time and building trust. We are actually working on opening our relationship up to other sexual partners. I don't find myself feeling jealous at all anymore, because I know that we can talk things thru. He knows me really well at this point and deals with my bouts-of-crazy like a pro.
