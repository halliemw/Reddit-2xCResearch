I second Dragon Age: Origins—which is a great game even if DA:II was a disappointment (though still an option, I suppose)—and the Fallout series.  Most of the female-specific content in F1 and 2 is for sex, predictably, but if you use a certain famous vampire hunter's first name as yours in F2, you'll get a pretty cool Easter Egg when you reach The Den :)
