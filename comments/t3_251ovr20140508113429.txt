Making this sub a default will not give Reddit the female voice you think it needs.  Instead it will strip this sub of its voice and culture.

I'm personally not interested in a discussion about your first period.  I'm a little offended by videos of a live abortion by pro choice advocates.  A lot of people are like that.  I'm not trying to justify it as right or desirable.  But it's the reality.  You'll be outnumbered, and the content of the sub will fundamentally change.  You can already see the change in downvotes.

The entire purpose of this subreddit is inherently incompatible with being a default sub.
