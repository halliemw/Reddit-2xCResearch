I highly recommend the work of Charles Stross. One major step towards acceptance of otherness is to stop coming up with excuses for why we ought to be allowed to change it to suit (har har) our own preferences. Subtle mob rule is still mob rule.

A hundred years ago "professionalism" and "decency" meant a lot of insidious things for women in particular, even if we only restrict our analysis to personal appearance in public spaces and/or privately owned work/school spaces. As you said, we're all entitled to our opinions, but yours seems awfully myopic of recent history.
