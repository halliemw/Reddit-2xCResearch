Thanks so much for taking the time to write all that out! It's not possible for me to move out there and since he would be moving four provinces I wouldn't be able to see him very much at all. My program is going to take five years. So it would be about time to call it quits. Which was kind of hard to admit to myself at first and probably difficult to sift out of my wall of text. Fortunately it's a very exciting new opportunity for him and one that's a natural progression so I don't need to keep him on the level like you had to. I think I'm mostly just going to not think about it as much as possible which will hopefully even it out to a normal amount instead of the emotional carousel that is my brain right now. Hopefully you'll figure something out and leave limbo soon! I've never been long distance for as long as you guys have so I can't say whether it gets easier but I hope it does!
