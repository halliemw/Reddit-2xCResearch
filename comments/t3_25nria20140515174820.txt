I do agree with you for most issues. In this case, though, I see the message of this movie as more harmful than helpful. When I see this, the only message I get is that it's important for women to be seen as sexually and otherwise attractive. I think every girl and woman has the right to feel beautiful and have self confidence. But if women think that the only way to feel beautiful is to know that strangers want to ogle them on a magazine cover - I don't think that's how we should be judging beauty. This movie isn't necessarily a bad thing in a vacuum, but in a wider cultural sense, I feel like way too much media attention is given to this issue at the expense of issues that matter a lot more than this. Now, I am not the arbiter of social issues, so maybe it is actually that important and I just don't see it. But on the other hand, I don't think you'd *ever* see this much attention being given to a campaign to make all men feel beautiful. To me this feels like a distraction to keep women's worth centered around how pretty they are and away from the real issues.
