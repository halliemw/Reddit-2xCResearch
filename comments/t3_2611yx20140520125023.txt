English is actually not my first language. I speak it quite well but still have mistakes. I meant "opening up" as in just talking about myself. I'm actually a very private person! But this is why this situation is such a problem - nothing I say is ever too personal, yet they find a subtle way to show how much they disagree with 99% of what I say. My only thought is, why do they ask me in the first place?! They also sometimes just make comments, without me saying anything.
