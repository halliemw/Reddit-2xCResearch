I'm sure this has probably already been said, probably multiple times, but come over and hang out at /r/loseit. Swing by at least once a day, particularly during moments of weaknesses. It's so damn inspiring. Plus the people there are so supportive. That sub, as well as the "fitblr" community, has helped me lose nearly 25 lbs. since Thanksgiving. You can do it too!! :)
