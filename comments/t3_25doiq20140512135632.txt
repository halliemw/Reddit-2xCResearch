Your self esteem may be the bigger problem here? Women with PCOS are still women with hopes, dreams, thoughts, and fantastic lives and that includes YOU. A lot of pressure comes from society to tell us all to be drop dead gorgeous with flawless skin and that will amount to our worth but the reality is that we are all so much more than that! You can still be a race car driver or a doctor, your PCOS doesn't define you! It may feel like a life sentence, but know that you are what you make yourself to be, in the end. If this comment he made hurt you, tell him. Tell him that you are just as much a women as any of us and you're more than an appearance. Do what makes you happy and you'll realize that whether or not you're "magazine beautiful", you're still a catch! Good luck!
