I too notice a different odor after my bf cumming in me. It's not usually til the next morning though. I will always clean up and pee after sex but I think some semen just hangs around in there til my vag gets that self cleaning done. I always thought it was a combo of juices and the funkification of semen over the next 8-10 hours. I think sometimes it depends on how my mans semen is on its own too. Like if it's a little funky after several days of eating bad or being dehydrated I think it ends up smelling worse. That's my own non scientific experience.
