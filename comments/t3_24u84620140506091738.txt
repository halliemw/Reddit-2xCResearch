Exactly. I think a Wonder Woman solo movie would be boring because the character although interesting in certain dynamics is kind of boring. If there was a really great director and writer that could make the world of Hercules and Greek mythology somehow interesting in a new way then it would work but I don't find Ares that compelling as an antagonist.
