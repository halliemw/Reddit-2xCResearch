If someone can't develop feelings for somebody else while you're in a relationship without being a scumbag cheater, you're just asking them keep up appearances. Feelings and emotional connections can't be switched on or off at will. If you're not allowed to explore any such feelings are you expecting someone to just continue dating the same person for the rest of their life? I'm not agreeing with the way your ex did it,  but not every person who meets someone else while they're in a relationship is a bad person.
