We need to separate the expectation from the individual actions. The expectation that women cover their breasts or their hair while men can leave their chests and hair uncovered is sexist, but a woman covering her breasts or hair is not. Additionally, in Western countries outside of abusive families, the hijab is not only optional according to the culture at large, but it's not required by Islam. Whether a Muslim woman wears a hijab or niqab or neither is between her and Allah. It's an option even within the religion, and my understanding is that it's not supposed to be taught that showing your hair is sinful or dirty or wrong. It's supposed to be like Christians wearing cross necklaces: if it makes you feel closer to your God, that's great, and if you choose not to wear it, then that's ok, too.
