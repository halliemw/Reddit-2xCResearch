Just for some interesting numbers, In 2011, 86% of Michigan counties had no abortion clinic. 36% of Michigan women lived in these counties. There are a total of 41 clinics who offer the procedure, only one being in Detroit. There are over two dozen crisis clinics in Detroit. Right now, there are 20 Planned Parenthoods in the state who offer contraception, only one being in Detroit.

In Michigan, the following restrictions on abortion were in effect as of May 1, 2014:
A woman must receive state-directed counseling that includes information designed to discourage her from having an abortion and then wait 24 hours before the procedure is provided.
Abortion is covered in private insurance policies only in cases of life endangerment, unless an optional rider is purchased at an additional cost.
Health plans that will be offered in the stateâ€™s health exchange under the Affordable Care Act can only cover abortion in cases when the woman's life is endangered, unless an optional rider is purchased at an additional cost.
The use of telemedicine for the performance of medication abortion is prohibited.
The parent of a minor must consent before an abortion is provided.
Public funding is available for abortion only in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest.

I wonder - does the fact that poor neighborhoods historically receive less quality preventative care and sex education that this might be a reason for the high numbers? We need more access and availability for every class.
