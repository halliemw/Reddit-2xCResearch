That example doesn't work. Gender discrimination against women at work, telling a woman to make you a sandwich, and shaming a woman for the amount of sex she has, those are all forms of misogyny and sexism. It feels stronger for me to point it out for what it is, instead of calling it something like "sandwichmaking shaming."
