In my field, we're rarely talking about something that isn't gendered, so I haven't paid any attention. And if we are talking about something that isn't gender-specific, it's always a group, so there's also no question about the appropriate pronoun. But when it comes to anything informal, I prefer the singular they and I hope it becomes more accepted as proper English, if only because it's more inclusive of people who are genderqueer or otherwise don't fit into the gender binary well.
