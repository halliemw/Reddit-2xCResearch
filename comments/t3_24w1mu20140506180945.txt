I have moments of pure happiness and bliss (snuggling my cat, laughing with the fiance, enjoying nature, etc) and they are great. But my real problem is that overall I just feel unfulfilled with life. Like I have happy times and sad times and a whole host of other emotions but I guess I still feel like something is missing or like  there should be more or something else... or I dunno. It's hard to describe but I go through the motions at work and I think forward to when I'm 90 and I imagine that I'll have a long list of great accomplishments but that they won't mean anything because who cares?
