My boyfriend says things like that to me, but I'm assuming by your post, he uses a different tone. Like you, I have my 'own' style, that kinda deviates from mini skirts, butt hanging shorts, figure hugging dresses etc, He'll see a piece of 'in' clothing in a shop window or online, and just say "you'd look sooooo hot in that!" to which I'd reply "you know I don't like that style" to which he'd say "but you have the BEST body! Show it off, come on..." I usually laugh him off - "sure, but I still don't agree with the outfit" and he gives up. I honestly think he has good intentions - to him it's a win/win - I get some body confidence and compliments for "looking hot" and he gets to look at me in that "hot" outfit. Being aesthetically pleasing is important to me, and I expect the same from my boyfriend (not talking about looking like a sex bomb - just taking care of yourself). I like turning him on with my body, so I make the effort to buy pretty lingerie instead of wearing ridiculous figure hugging mini dresses down the street.


Is it possible that he is making suggestions for you because he can sense you have body image issues? 

Unless, he's actually meaning it in a controlling way - making you look a certain way and in order for you to be good enough for him - if that's the case, stop wasting time with this douche because it's a horrible reflection of his personality and values.
