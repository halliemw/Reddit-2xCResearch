A colposcopy is pretty simple and will be done in a doctor's office. It's similar to a Pap smear but where they take the sample from is determined by looking at your cervix with a light and using a dilute acetic acid solution to make any potential lesions show up. If anything looks out of the ordinary, they take a small biopsy which I've heard feels like a bit of a pinch. It will probably take longer than a Pap smear because there may be more samples to get, but it's nothing to stress about. You might be a bit sore after, but it shouldn't be anything too crazy.

In case you haven't had a Pap smear before, it's also very simple and I believe in Australia it's typically done in your GP's office. They use a speculum to open your vagina so they can actually see your cervix, and then they just take a little swab to check for abnormal cells. Neither of these procedures is terribly invasive or painful, though of course you might feel awkward or have some discomfort.

If you want to know anything about the ultrasound side of things, I've had that done myself and can tell you about it as well.
