Really? You're really gonna play that? You know what, maybe if black people had done all that shit to me, maybe I *would* try to avoid them at night. But they haven't. *Men* have. 

You obviously have no idea how fucking terrifying and humiliating it is to be molested in public, and no idea why I might try to avoid repeating that experience.
