Everyone is bad the first time. Everyone. There are no exceptions. Ideally this is not a problem because sex shouldn't be about proving anything to your partner, it should be about the experience. Especially while losing your virginity. Anyone who expects a virgin to be "spectacular at sex" is too inexperienced/immature/untalented/impatient to assume responsibility as the more knowledgable and experienced one. I'm not saying it's that person's responsibility to teach you, I'm just saying that resorting to whining that you, someone who just lost their virginity, is bad at sex says more about your boyfriend than it does about you. For whatever reason, your boyfriend cannot assist your learning beyond insulting you. Maybe he realizes this and hopes you do not.
