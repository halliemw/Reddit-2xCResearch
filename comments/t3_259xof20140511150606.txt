Not having a car blows. Like so much. I can categorize my life into two sections: BC (Before Car) and AC (After Car). 

But you have a couple options. You can ask family/friends for a quick ride. You could see if there's public transportation. Or if you have anything of interest or want to plan an event within walking/biking distance, you could set up a Meet Up event there so everyone comes to you :)
