As a man (yes, I begin that way deliberately),  I honestly used to feel welcome here and I'm not so sure anymore.  I am deeply interested in gender issues, sexuality and sociology.  These topics are informed by the female perspective, and 2X seemed like the most reasonable subreddit to hear that opinion.  Even though the subreddit is for the female perspective, it seemed like a very reasonable place that was able to listen to all perspectives on gender experience, while highlighting and adding the unique female aspects of things.

Now that it is a default and afraid of an influx of 'default internet male dominated opinion' there seems to have been a massive circling of the wagons.  We have threads that tell men to 'just listen' and then back-pedaling.  Anything that isn't tried and true feminist orthodox opinion is now absolutely unacceptable and will be dealt with harshly (sexual violence is everywhere and is almost universally committed on women by men, abortion is an absolute right regardless of any circumstance, women are paid less for identical work with identical qualifications).  It makes me sad to see what was a great and open community now feeling like it has to polarize itself and be more extreme in its opinions to survive and be heard.  I too want the old 2X back.
