Are you crafty? Maybe make something for him. I know it sounds corny, but I've made birthday cards for my boyfriend, and he loved and kept all of them. Chocolates and flowers are something all people enjoy to a certain degree, so find out what he likes and get it. Does he have a go-to treat? Bake a cake, have a cool brunch, make his favourite dinner. Choose a theme and plan a day around it together. Have a movie night, complete with popcorn, at home. A picnic in the park.

Other than that: Find out if there's any event where you're living. Student's art exhibition? Reduced admissions to the zoo? A bar that has live music? Do something together, even if it's just a stroll through the park. Go hiking. Go on a treasure hunt. 

More body stuff: Give him a long massage. You can get massaging oils for cheap, and there are tons of videos and 'how-to's on the web. Take a bath together, with lots of foam and some fine stuff to sip on. Roleplay. Strip. Use blindfolds.

You have tons of options. Think about what kind of day/evening you want to have and what he might enjoy. Ask him if he'd rather go out or stay home. Plan accordingly. Have fun!
