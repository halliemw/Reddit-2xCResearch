Your SO seems like a bit of an asshole, but are you seriously accusing someone of sexual harassment just for asking you out?  Sexual harassment means persistent unwanted advances or severely offensive acts.  A single act of groping is sexual harassment (because of it's severity), but when it comes to purely verbal conduct, harassment usually requires multiple incidents over time.
