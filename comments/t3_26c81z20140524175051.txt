Thanks for the tips! 

I actually already experiment with cooking a lot, I enjoy cooking and try and make new and creative things. I browse pinterest a lot and cook things like zuchinni chips, kale chips, broccoli pancakes, cauliflower poppers, etc. I try and make veggies as delicious and interesting as I can, but she still isn't very interested. I usually serve veggies with some kind of protein (usually chicken or pork) and some kind of carb (bread, rice, pasta, etc.). We usually have some fruit for dessert available too.

I definitely cook good meals, she just doesn't eat the veggie portion of them. Or if I make a salad, she'll have a tiny portion. It's less what I'm cooking and more what she chooses for snacks and her other meals (I don't cook breakfast or lunch for her). 

I'm actually already part of a soccer team, and I do have a group of friends. Most of them don't really quite understand what I'm going through, by posting here I was hoping to find people in similar situations and mostly just wanted to vent. Thanks for the support :)
