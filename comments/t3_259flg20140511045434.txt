Funny story, I have a little bit of dark hair on my lip and usually wax it every few months. When I first started doing it I decided to try something else because waxing hurts, so I get a tube of nair like stuff and take it to the cash register all embarrassed like. When I get there the girl starts asking me questions about how well it works and what not, I look up at her and tell her I hadn't ever used it and that's when I notice that she's a very pretty girl with rather obvious upper lip hair, then she says "yeah my mom uses all kinds of stuff but I don't bother, I like my mustache."  Everybody has a different way of defining their own beauty ...
