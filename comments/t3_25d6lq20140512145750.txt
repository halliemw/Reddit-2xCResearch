I agree with what everyone has said about taking the time to think about *why* you want to be engaged so badly.

I was in your position a few months ago, and when my fiance and I reflected on it we realized we wanted to be engaged mainly to communicate to our loved ones just how much we mean to one another.  We already knew we were more to each other, but boyfriend-girlfriend didn't accurately convey it to others.

One thing that may help is to do away with the idea of a big surprise proposal.  I could tell that my partner was planning towards a proposal on our anniversary, and I told him it was honestly stressing me out, both the waiting and the huge build-up (I'm not a big fanfare person).  He agreed and was also nervous about the big proposal, so he ended up randomly proposing during a walk in the woods.  That sort of low-key proposal may end up saving you both a lot of stress!
