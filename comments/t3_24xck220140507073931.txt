Hi, I'm your friendly resident "pro-life [insert slur here]". I find it ironic that this post is downvoted but the same has happened to me.

No matter what anyone says, this IS a pro choice sub, plain and simple. I wish other (kind, rational) pro life people would have the guts to post here. It's pretty lonely.

Pro life is considered anti-women on 2x... But I consider the abortion industry to be anti-women in its own way. Abortions are traumatic and disruptive to a woman's daily life, as evidenced by the dread and confusion that is so often expressed here in accidental pregnancy posts. We need easier access to BC and better sex end. And we need maternity policies in school and the workplace that make having a child more plausible for ambitious women-- we shouldn't have to choose between our careers or education and caring a pregnancy to term.

And I think oftentimes, we forget that so many of these pregnancies *would have ended in giving birth to a girl.* A woman. Is threre anything more oppressive or "anti women" than not even having the chance to live your life?

However, this opinion is not welcome here. It's sad. There are plenty of pro life women on reddit, and most are not backwards, self-loathing, or uneducated. We are intelligent and informed, and we have come to a different conclusion on abortion. But we are always driven away from this sub, either from frustration, or being chased away by direct attacks.
