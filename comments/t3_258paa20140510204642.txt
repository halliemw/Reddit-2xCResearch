I thought I was the only person with this problem and I've always been really ashamed of it. I don't know where it came from or where it started. People are saying to accentuate the positive, but it's hard to when I don't see anything positive at all. I've been very slowly working through it in therapy. Very slowly. 

I don't have a lot of advice but I just wanted to tell you you're not alone in your feelings, because I definitely thought I was and that sometimes made me feel even worse.
