You got most of your questions answered already but here's another couple tips:

- In public restrooms, take a bottle of water in with you to rinse it off.
- After you've finished using it for the month, boil or run under scalding water and scrub with an old toothbrush.
- If the stem is too long and bothersome you can snip it off completely.
- Pinch the end when you tug it out - that helps break the "seal".

Just give it a go and see how you like it!
