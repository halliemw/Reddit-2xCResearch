I guess the definition of taking advantage depends on the level of intoxication of _both_ of you. If he was as drunk as you obviously were, I don't think we can blame him more than you, how could we? Everyone loses their inhibitions.

Assuming you were both equally drunk ("we had way too much"), so drunk in fact, that you couldn't remember to say "no", it seems unfair to expect him to remember you having said "yes means no when I'm drunk" while he's in the same state. If you weren't able to act as you would have now because you were drunk, please don't assume that the ones drinking with you can still make decisions as if sober. 

However, of course, if he had his wits together at the time, he is clearly at fault, just to make sure you don't get me wrong. As to why you got dumped, it seems to me that he may have been expecting sex (as you had been having intercourse once, so why not again?), regardless of your mental state. Now if this was the case, it would mean he didn't respect you and you're lucky to be rid of his arse.

As things are over, I'd suggest you to try and not make this mistake weigh more than it should. Your (sexual) dignity is not defined by your virginity, and if you still feel that you have the same mindset about waiting until marriage, keep it up if it feels right. Make the morality of your sexual behaviour from now on more important than just the absence of physical virginity. There is no reason to change yourself just because things went wrong once. When, in time, you'll for the first time have sex with another man by your own volition, it will again feel like it is your first time, and it will still be special.
