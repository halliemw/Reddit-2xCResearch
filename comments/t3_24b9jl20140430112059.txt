You have about a 2-3 week window where you need the next shot, so it's not like one day specifically.  My OB's office was great, and I'd schedule the next shot right after I got one.  We always went for about 2 weeks before the next shot was due, just to be safe.  Then if somebody got sick, or I had to be out of town, no big deal.  

So it's really more a range than anything.  =)  

And yeah, it was worse the longer I was on the pill, but everybody's different.  I think when we start realizing things are not going well, we become hyper-aware of the issues and that can make things seem worse.
