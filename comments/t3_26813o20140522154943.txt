I haven't watched all of it, maybe GoT does this as well as the sex stuff; but what I'd like to see more of in media, is nudity that's just nudity. Not only in a sex scene, brothel, or something like that. Maybe there's a character that happens to be nude, and whatever they're doing, they're fine with it.

Which seems to be part of Carice's take on it as well.

When a show is designed around only showing nudity in sexual situations, and they are showing nudity, but are explicitly not having nudity where it would make perfect sense to have nudity, that's touching on the fourth wall. And in any case, we could do with a more all-rounded presentation of nudity.
