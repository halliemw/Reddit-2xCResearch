I couldn't agree more. Obviously the people on twitter didn't kidnap those girls, but I think everyone, both men and women, have perpetuated harmful notions about sex/sexual exploitation at least once in their lives. But this is our way of saying, "we're not all like that!" and distancing ourselves from the fact that there is a deeper problem at hand here.
