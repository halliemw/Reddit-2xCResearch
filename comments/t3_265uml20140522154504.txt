If she want's to take birth control and not say anything, I still think it is somewhat deceitful but not the worst thing in the world.

What I was referring to was the actual abortion. I support her right to have an abortion, but hiding it from him **is not fair.** It's her body, but their child and he should atleast know, even if she tells him *after* the abortion. Pretending it never happened will likely destroy their family if he ever found out.
