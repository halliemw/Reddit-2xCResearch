The sad fact is, there are some people you can't have a fully open and honest relationship with. Judging by her (incredibly sexist and antiquated) response, I would refrain from confiding personal information to her in the future. You tried it and it seemed to make you feel worse. If there is anyone else in your life (aunt, cousins, friend...) who is a little more sensitive and forward thinking, I'd make them my "go-to" for honest conversations that are of a personal nature.
