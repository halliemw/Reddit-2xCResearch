Feminist history, how about "women in history." Stop trying to put a political spin on everything, not every women identifies as a feminist. Some of us identify as an egalitarian because we think that terminology like "sisterhood" and "mansplaining" are inherently sexist in nature. Feminists are more than willing to dismiss an opinion or idea on the basis of gender or sex which I find appalling. Modern 3rd wave feminism is sexist and exclusionary. Egalitarianism is the future as it values input from everyone regardless of their gender or sex.
