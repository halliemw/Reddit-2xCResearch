Well, not really in Repunzel's case. Her hair was cut to save her life, it wasn't her choice. She's not a flawed character because her hair got cut right at the end of the bloody film :P She still managed to save Flynn, she was still magical, still the same character. Just minus the titanium strong crazy as hell hair haha
