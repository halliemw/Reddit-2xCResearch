Well, I have an aunt who says she went asexual after menopause and said it was a real blessing. 

But really, it doesn't matter how you feel about it. Feelings are irrelevant. In most species behavior that results in fertile individuals avoiding reproduction is maladaptive in an evolutionary sense. When homosexuality or asexuality increases the spread of an individual's genes, it's adaptive. When it doesn't, it's not. In many species the young of earlier years don't reproduce and help raise the new young, like in wolves and many birds. Certainly ant and bee colonies are made up primarily of asexual individuals. In some species male-male bonds are not uncommon. In black swans a third of all broods exhibit extra-pair paternity. An estimated one-quarter of all pairings are homosexual, mostly between males. They steal nests, or form temporary threesomes with females to obtain eggs, driving away the female after she lays the eggs. More of their cygnets survive to adulthood than those of different-sex pairs, possibly due to their superior ability to defend large portions of land. 

Does human homosexuality result in a better survival rate than with heterosexual pair? Certainly it seems that human homosexuals (and asexuals) reproduce at lower levels than heterosexuals. That's how nature judges it. Not by how we feel.
