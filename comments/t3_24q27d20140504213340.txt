 I was in a similar situation in college. I had a huge falling out with my group of girl friends (its a very complicated story, as they usually are). I became averse to making girl friends after that.

Your problems with G sound very similar to what my G's problems were. There was a specific incident that made me realize that he was jealous of me having male friends. And I flat out told him, to his face, that it's not up to him who I am friends with. It was just one of those things I felt so sure about. 

That was a long time ago (6 years!). We've worked through that, and many other things. We both have close male and female friends now. If you're both open to internal reflection, and honestly communicating with each other, you can work this out.
