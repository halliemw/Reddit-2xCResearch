I can think of at least four women I know who got married after 30. They weren't particularly active on the dating scene either, they fell in love with friends and it went from there. Its utter pigsswill that men only want younger women. Men want all kinds of women, and frankly you are in a better position now to find a man who matches your life goals and outlook because you're more firm in them than you were at 20. 

I want to also say that there is no shame in actively looking for someone to settle down with. People find each other in all kinds of ways, it's all legitimate.  Finding love within friendship is a beautiful thing I'm sure you've seen, but finding friendship in love is just as wonderful.
