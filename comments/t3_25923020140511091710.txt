I was going to post, from a guy's perspective, how body hair on a girl never even registered as a possible turn off, etc, etc, but after reading your post I realized that wouldn't be helpful at all.

This actually got me thinking about my own insecurities and how they're really just rooted in what I think *others* think of me and not in what *I* think of myself.
