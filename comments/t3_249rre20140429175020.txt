When taken out of context it can seem that way. The societies in biblical times were extremely sexist, and it's important to separate culture from the commands of God. 

The verse you cited is interesting. It is only because of Jesus that women were allowed in the temple to learn and worship alongside men... Prior to this, they were not allowed to do so. I believe, and so do many biblical scholars, that this verse is a snapshot of a culture in transition. Women who were previously uneducated were suddenly allowed in! But, they were still lacking in knowledge due to their previous oppression. Therefore the women were expected to learn, and to receive-- not to try to control or to run the show when they were the newcomers. 

I don't believe this standard applies in modern times, similar to other verses that command women to have their heads covered, and men to greet each other with a kiss. Not everything in the bible is a command for all people in all cultures to follow forever and ever. Some of it is historical documentation. Some of it is poetry. And all of it is heavily influenced by culture, which was sexist and patriarchal. But when Jesus came, women were respected and given opportunities they had never seen before. They prophecied along with men. They learned and worshiped along with men. They preached and evangelized. They led house churches. Its all recorded in the new testament... Because in Christ, there is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female. We are one in him! 

That was longer than I intended... Sorry. As a woman and an elder in my church, this is something I'm pretty passionate about. The bible can be used to condone sexism, sure, but I think that in order to do so, one must ignore context and misinterpret scripture.
