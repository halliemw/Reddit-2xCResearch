I've found laser to be pretty good, but not as great as I'd hoped it would be. Definitely reduced hair growth a huge amount, but even after totally finishing the course I've had to go back and get it redone on some areas, generally between once every six months and once a year, to stay hair free in those spots. It's way, way less painful than waxing for me though (I have super sensitive skin that would sometimes actuall tear when waxing), so it's worth it for me. 

And oops, sorry, totaly hit the wrong 'reply' button. I'm going to blame my tablet.
