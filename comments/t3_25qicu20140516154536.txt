if you read back through the comments, you'll see that I didn't insult them. risking the wrath is now an actual risk. The majority of the posts i've seen from men get reacted to negatively immediately. Not all, but most. When you see a forum that has mostly negative reactions, then going there poses some risk of abuse. and that is exactly what happens for the most part.  Trigger happy was the right way to describe this sub right now. The best advice i should have listened to was to never have come here. and that is sad. every post seems to be taken as an attack. Hate and downvote all you like, but this sub has more people refusing to speak rationally than any i've witnessed, though i'll admit that scope is small. i usually don't post on here for this very reason. xD Try opening up to other's viewpoints, exactly what everyone should do. We have to see the posts from here on the front page, so people coming here is a natural reaction. men coming here is a natural reaction. Slamming them for doing exactly what this site is designed to do is ridiculous. But I am now in danger of becoming part of the problem. So I apologize for the attempt at conversation, and I'll leave this sub alone from now on. lesson learned.
