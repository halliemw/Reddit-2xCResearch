I don't think that what funroll_loop says counts as manslpaining. He was trying to describe something from the point of view of a "common" man, something a woman might not readily see. Amd I think that his description was thoughtful. That's not mansplianing in my book. 

I just think that in this context his argument looks odd, at best.
