First of all, my sincerest condolences. I was together with my SO for 2 1/2 years. I can't imagine something like this happening after 7. In my case, she just stopped loving me. Went from being the sweetest, best girlfriend to just straight up not wanting anything to do with me. Asking her why and what happened didn't help. It made no sense to me. I panicked. I lost sleep. I didn't understand how this could possibly happen. We were engaged. We were 3 months away from being married. And within hours, all of that is gone. How? Why? I was profoundly hurt. She wanted me no more. Not for sex, love, dating, nothing. I tried desperately to win her back to no avail. Soon, my feelings of hurt and rejection turned to rage. If she's going to do this to me, then fuck her. The day after she moved out, I picked her up unannounced, drove to the bank, split our finances, and I ended it. I cut off all contact and haven't spoken to her since. I may talk to her again someday. My feelings for her are now more anger than anything. If she begged me to take her back, I wouldn't do it.

OP, I am so profoundly sorry your relationship ended like this. Truth be told, I don't know what happened with mine. I know you feel the same way about yours. How could someone do this to you? Without seemingly a care in the world? After you've known them and their personality for so long, how could they be so cold and so ruthless to you? I wish I had the answer. I can think of few types of pain worse than this. I truly hope you are able to move on from this. There *are* men who are honest and wouldn't do this to you. I don't know what to tell you to look for though. I'm in the same position myself.
