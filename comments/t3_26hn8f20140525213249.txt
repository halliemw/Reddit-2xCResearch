I don't like the chromosome answer, because, I mean, even if you wholly reject trans women for whatever reason... what about women with XY chromosomes but [androgen insensitivity syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome)? They spend their whole life with a vagina, which is the TERF definition of a woman, but they have that dreaded XY chromosome. What about dudes with XXY? They have two X chromosomes, but also a Y, so what on earth does *that* mean, if you're defining gender by chromosomes. 

I don't like using personality traits to define gender either, for obvious, obvious reasons. 

I guess I go the hippie route and just accept it when people tell me what their gender is. If they say they're a woman, cool, good enough for me. If they say they're a man, fantastic. Neither one? Yeah, alrighty, why not. It's not my problem what their junk or DNA says they should be, people have enough problems in life without my cislady ass telling them that they're doing it wrong.
