There are more concerns than just fertility when it comes to hysterectomies. There's a risk of premature menopause even if it's not a radical hysterectomy, and there's a risk of things like organ prolapse and general surgical complications. It's not out of the question, but it's not something to take lightly, either. That said, if you feel your doctor isn't taking your concerns seriously enough, go get a second opinion. When it comes to fairly major medical decisions, it never hurts to get another professional opinion.
