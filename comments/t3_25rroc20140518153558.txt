>Ceremonies have been around since forever

Appeal to tradition.

>and their purpose (to give a public space to celebrate and reward hard work) hasn't changed much.

Begging the question, as is pretty much all of the rest of your post.

>Would you be okay with someone wearing a pro-life shirt at a White House dinner?

I'm not sure why you think that would be my call. Such functions are private affairs.

>Or a gay rights shirt at a funeral?

Again, why do you or I get to decide what's "proper" at a private function? Are you hosting it? Am I paying for it?

>Or maybe Uncle Rickey starting to sound off on men's rights issues at the family get-together?

Do you circulate pre-approved "talking points" at your family dinners? Sounds like a blast.

>The fact that you can't recognize what is not an appropriate setting for certain statements is honestly a little surprising.

Sorry, but pretending that your subjective preferences are just "common sense" is the mark of an un-examined life. Come back when you've put some thought into why you feel as you do, because so far all you've presented to support your position is increasing volume.
