You have to grow a backbone and confront them about this shit.  I'm sorry, but that is the ONLY way to get truly taken seriously on the line.  And you know, they'll probably be dismissive anyway.

You might try telling them "You ever wonder if the reason you think all women complain is because you shitbags give them so many reasons to?"

I know it doesn't help to say, but a person who avoids conflict is a very poor fit for overseeing a kitchen.  You need your boss to have your back in this situation.
