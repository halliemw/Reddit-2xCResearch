I was just telling my flatmate about how unhappy I was about this becoming a default sub. I feel like default subs should be things like r/movies and r/funny which everyone enjoys, not things like this and r/atheism which while promoting debate, are so easy for people to undermine the integrity of by trolling etc. I personally love this subreddit, but when the majority of reddit users are white cis-men, I am somewhat worried that this is going to promote more ignorance rather than the opposite (which I feel is the reason this has been made a default)........

Just to clarify, I do not think that the majority of users will behave in such a way, but it does make it easier for extremist behaviour and trolls to make it into this community!
