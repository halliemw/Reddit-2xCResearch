Okay, well then let me address this::

>Why are his opinions and feelings less valid than hers?

Because it's her damn body. He can have opinions on abortion and whether he is okay with it. He cannot control her choices about her body. Telling her that getting an abortion will directly result in him breaking up with her is at least melodramatic and emotionally immature - at worst, it's manipulative. He could attempt to compromise. He could make a minimum attempt to support her/maintain a relationship with her. Instead, he is delivering an ultimatum with the intent of forcing her to make a MAJOR life decision that has literally nothing to do with his body.
