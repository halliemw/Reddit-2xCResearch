>  "So, why have you gotten fat?"

"So, why do you think it's OK to comment on my weight?"  Or "Wow.  Talk about making things uncomfortable."   

Look.  You really need to sit him down and explain that the conversation crossed your boundaries.  Before you spend time with him again.  His words affected you as it would *anyone else who had gained weight.*  That it was hurtful.  That weight, food, dieting and anything else that has to do with it is off the table of polite conversation.  A good person will say sorry and *not do it again.*  A bad person argue and/or blame you for overreacting.  

The key is to say it in a way that he was not being intentionally hurtful.  We live in a society that says it's perfectly OK to comment on a woman's weight.  It's weird and gross.  It's also the source of self esteem issues that has led to an eating disorder epidemic.

You do also have to sort out your issues about your weight.  It will sabotage everything in your life.  Whether that is therapy, support groups or untieing your self-esteem to the number on the scale.
