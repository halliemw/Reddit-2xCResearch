I am a little late to the party, I do want to add that sometimes it is easy for me to ask my husband to take on some of the more traditionally "female" chores, but I have to make sure I am willing to take on some of the traditionally "male" chores as well like taking out the trash, fixing things, doing household maintenence, cleaning the cars, changing a flat tire, etc etc. Just don't forget that it goes both ways and we just try to find a balance.
