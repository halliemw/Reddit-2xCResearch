I actually disagree with this since the girl has a mother in her life. Most therapists say that the biological parents should be the ones that discipline. If she is too hard on the kids or makes what someone else thinks is the wrong decision, she could create conflict between ex wife and husband. That could then create conflict in the home. And she would lose all credibility with the children
