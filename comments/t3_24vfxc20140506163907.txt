Love it!! I think it's cuddly and sexy. Both my boyfriend and my ex are hairy, and they were both very embarrassed about it when we started dating. I remember my ex got his back waxed as a surprise for me after not seeing him for a few weeks (long distance) and his skin was soooooo irritated looking for a few weeks afterwards-- he realized belatedly that I really liked his back hair, and I did not desire waxing at all. If your boyfriend is adamant on getting waxed, tell him to get his eyebrows done-- then when he's in pain, tell him to imagine that all over his back and arms, maybe it'll deter him! ;)
