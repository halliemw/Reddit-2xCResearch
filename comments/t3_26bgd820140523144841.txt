"You will get through this. You are strong and there are many people out there who loves you (think of your family, your burst friends, or even your pet). Remember you are not the only person in this world who suffer, it's part of life. If you want to cry then CRY let it out and get it over with (don't take too long, time still moving when you stop). It won't be easy but it won't be too hard to handle. It will take a while until it doesn't hurt anymore and become just another story in your life. Everything around you will remind you of the fresh memory but it will pass. 
When you are ready to stop crying get up, go out spend time with friends, work hard (or study) keep yourself busy. Not only it will keep you from thinking about it but it might make you feel good to see the result of work or grade.

I don't know your situation, but I too had experienced break up that I hide in my office bathroom and cry. I locked myself in my room for few days, cried my eyes out. Then it hit me, when I focus my energy on crying and suffering it didn't only hurt me, it also hurt people who loves me when they saw me throwing my life away. When you love someone you wouldn't want to see them suffer, and will never want to hurt you intentionally, and why should I cry and waste my time moaning of the person I love but hurt me how does that call love.

There are many good things, good people around you, try to look on the bright side. Tomorrow is a new day.

Apologize for grammatical mistake, english is my second language. All the best for OP, you will get better.
