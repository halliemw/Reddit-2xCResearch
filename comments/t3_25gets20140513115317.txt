I appreciate your struggle and your sharing it. First of all, I want to say that you can still be hair positive and shave/wax. Promoting positive body love is a verbal thing of acceptance. I think everyone's choice to do whatever they please is super important. Your situation, though, is exactly why I brought this up. It shouldn't be a struggle, and we need to change that.
