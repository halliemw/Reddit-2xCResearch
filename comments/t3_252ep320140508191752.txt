Oh gosh I won the poor timing lottery too. I was on a camping trip with my brother, dad, dads friend, and his two sons. I was the only girl with 5 guys. On the way up I was having the WORST cramps and had no idea what they were. I wasn't hungry, I didn't have to poop, it just didn't make sense.

We stopped at a restaurant and while I was in the bathroom I noticed a tiny bit of what I assumed was blood and was like "oh!... Shit." I was so embarrassed I didn't tell anyone, I guess I kind of thought if I ignored it it would stop? Stupid idea. So when we got back in the car I shut up because I had been complaining the entire time. My dad and one of the sons who was in our car were both like wtf happened you were almost crying now you won't even talk?

The next day I woke up with my lower half completely cover in blood. My super cute and comfy blue pajama shorts that I still miss were absolutely drenched in blood, I thought I was dying for a second because there was so much. I don't know how no one noticed but I managed to scramble out of my bunk, wrap a towel around me, and go take a shower.

I just ended up using toilet paper in my pants all weekend (which did NOT work very well at all, especially since it was a super heavy flow) and didn't tell my dad or anyone. When we got home 3 days later I told my step mom and just burst into tears when she asked what I'd been doing. We're not close, but that was the most welcome hug ever.


Argh such a traumatic experience hahahaha
