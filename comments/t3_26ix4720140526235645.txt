Wow, about a year and a half ago, I was in a very similar situation. I was dating an emotionally abusive, manipulative guy, becoming inappropriately close to my best male friend (we're in school together, but same idea) and realizing how unhappy I was in my relationship. 

What I did was cheat on my boyfriend, although I didn't take it "all the way" so to say. I am not proud of this in any way, shape, or form. I felt ugly, that nobody else could ever be attracted to me, and that I was worthless. It took seeing that somebody else did give a damn, that they were attracted to me, to be able to leave the toxic relationship I was in. That being said, this is not what I would recommend. Because I ended up over my head, oveely invested, and really hurt when it was all said and done. I feel kind of hypocritical offering advice, but I really believe that if I had handled this scenario better, I would have been happier, at least ar the time (although it led to lots of self growth and I'm currently the happiest I've been in years).  My advice is to figure out what you want, and how to get it, and act appropriately, but don't expect to jump immediately into a serious, happily ever after scenario.
