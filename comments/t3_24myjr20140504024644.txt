For me, it was one of those days were I had to release some emotions. 

I like your letter idea. I do that occassionally, reading my letters and birthday cards from my best girlfriends. Or even look at photos of me having a ball with them. Thing is, I sometimes I get paranoid and even guilty because I haven't kept in contact with some of them :/
