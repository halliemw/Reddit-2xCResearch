I think some people are missing the point here. Of course nobody has an obligation to give birth and we are free to do what we want with our bodies. And of course some women unfortunately cannot give birth. That does not take away from your excitement about the potential prospect of becoming a mother.

Congratulations on your self-discovery. Even though I intend to foster and perhaps adopt down the line instead of give birth, I also sometimes experience that same sense of wonder with my body. It is at once strange and wonderful and miraculous.
