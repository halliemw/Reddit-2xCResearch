She is super cute!

I remember when my girls were little. They're 15 and 13 now, and just as much fun for me as they were when they were babies. People will tell you to enjoy it, because it doesn't last, but I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy every stage of her life. There are times when my girls (especially my 13 year old when she gets attitude) get on my nerves, but through all of the negativity they are still the best things that have ever happened to me. I wouldn't trade them for the world.
