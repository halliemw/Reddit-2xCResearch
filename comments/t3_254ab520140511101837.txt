I learned Billings (attended a two-day course offered to couples in my diocese after pre-Cana) and it said nothing about counting semen as ovulation mucus. That's a great point, except even charting that might be too late since if you ovulate within two days of having sex you can still get pregnant. In general, I think most non-Catholic doctors would agree with me that NFP should not be used to prevent pregnancy. 

And her boyfriend is well within his rights to decline sex with someone who is not using a method of birth control he approves of. It's his life and finances on the line here too. I wish more men were so responsible.
