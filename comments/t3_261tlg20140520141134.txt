That goes beyond bullying, that's some serious sexual harassment there. If I were in your shoes, I absolutely would not attend unless there was an apology. I would never attend a party where I would feel uncomfortable, unwelcome and self-conscious.

Ugh, that is so creepy - just because they're women, it doesn't mean it's okay to make you feel bad about your body, it's absolutely ridiculous. They should be ashamed of their actions, not their bodies.


Edit: Also, ask them how they would feel if their husbands had said the same thing to a young male attending the same party, asking him to wear baggy work clothes instead of going shirtless. I would definitely think less of my SO taking actions like that.
