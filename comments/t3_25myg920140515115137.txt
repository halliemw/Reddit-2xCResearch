As your doctor said, side effects are very unlikely. I've never heard of birth control to affect who you're attracted to, but it can affect your sex drive. I'd suggest try the sample and if you suffer with any of the side effects you're worried about it, you can look for an alternative.
I've also never heard of birth control giving you saggy boobs, and I've been off and on mine twice.
I had incredibly heavy periods too, and my birth control is a god send. It really helps, so I'd at least try it and see what you think :)
Good luck!
