It's really really sad that it's one of the most anti-feminist shows on television, and yet it's the only TV show I can think of that features more than one woman protaganist with a PhD (Amy and Bernadette both have them).

Like, it would be such an opportunity to shed the criticisms that it's another typically misogynistic sitcom... but they just use the girls as props.
