Having a thick skin is really just not caring about the opinion of the person insulting you. That comes with time and practice of really knowing your *own* opinion of the subject (yourself and your value, in this case.) 

Hang out on 4chan if you want - but as you're getting philosophical, contemplate why you care about some anon's opinion. Pull at that thread and follow the trail, and figure out what it is that you care about with regard *to yourself*. Eventually, you'll find a little central nugget of self-assurance. Nurture it - find more things you like about yourself - even parts of things! Things you're just working diligently on, things you inherited, things you're totally badass at! - and all their rage-stroking will just bounce off of that golden nugget's hardened shell, or get absorbed like some glorious ever-growing katamari. And you'll recognize that their lashing out has everything to do with their own baggage and lack of golden nugget (usually a rotten core instead) and little to do with you - you're just a convenient target. 

Now let's talk about your boyfriend - *I don't even know you, and I wouldn't let people talk to you that way.*  I would discuss this with him, because he may be unaware that those comments get to you, or unaware that you would appreciate his support in that situation. (He could also be a total jerkface, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt.)

tl;dr - find your inner golden nugget!
