On the pill (Mercilon) now - chose that because I didn't need a full 3/5/10 years of contraception. I'll get a Mirena or copper IUD after I have my children. 

No really negative side effects - it's been more difficult to lose weight than before though which is a bit annoying. 

I have little interest in using the patch as I work out 6-9 times a week and the constant showering/chlorine/movement would probably make it fall off way too early, and just never really considered the NuvaRing.

Cost is not a factor with any method as I live in the UK. *huggles NHS*
