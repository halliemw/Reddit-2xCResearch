I'm 28 and I've never been able to be on the pill for very long- it makes me feel awful. I think I'm a bit sensitive to it, it might be genetic because my sister (25) is exactly the same. I've been using condoms for 13 years, and I've only had one "oops" moment. I did try the injection, but that made me gain heaps of weight and I didn't have a period for a year! I'm not sure that mucking around with hormones is a good idea for everyone, although some people do just fine on it.
