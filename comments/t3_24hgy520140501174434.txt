It made me feel like I had to pee all the time too! I used mine for a couple of years but was getting a yeast infection almost monthly. I suspected the Diva Cup, so I went back to pads and tampons. I haven't used the Diva Cup in a couple of years now. I think about going back to it - but it really did make me feel like I had to pee all the time. Plus, I have no privacy in the work bathroom, so it'd be a pain to clean up.
