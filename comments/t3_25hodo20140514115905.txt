Your girlfriend is so lucky she was diagnosed so young and I send her all my support.

As a fellow endo sufferer who's undergone lap and had serious lesions attached to my bowels, it's a scary disease. Unfortunately, birth control is usually the best route since endo flares with each period and can grow and spread, get into the abdominal cavity and create lesions.

I would suggest that she find a doctor that specializes in just gynecology or urogynecology rather than an OB/GYN. I went through maybe... 3 or 4 doctors before I settled on one wonderful doctor. He performed the surgery and got me through what birth control works best. I don't get my period anymore, and truthfully, I prefer it that way. I understand your GF's distaste for BC. I despise it.. but I also like my quality of life now.
My doctor also got me on pelvic floor therapy as well to help with reserved pain, which has helped tremendously.

I honestly didn't know that there was a subreddit for endo. How awesome!
