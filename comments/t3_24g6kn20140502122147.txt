I'm not arguing against that point. I know all of the things you said to be true. However,when a woman decides that she is going to give birth then since it is going to become a person you should treat it as one. For instance, not getting drunk. Its not a person so your desire to drink is more important because you have personhood,however once you've decided its inevitable for the fetus to obtain personhood women start treating it with person by changing their behaviors and taking care of their body for the fetus.
