I am just going to throw this out there, take it for what you will. I think you think I am debating with you or refusing to debate you.. Not entirely sure. I just don't understand your point of view. I can't properly agree with, disagree with, or even debate if I don't fully understand where there other person. I am completely open to looking into Charles Stross and such. I just, at this time, cannot comprehend your current point of view. Sorry. I am not trying to belittle it or anything, so sorry if I may have come off as hostile? That is why I chose to end my last comment with that it is okay to have our own opinions. Even if I never understand your point of view, even if we never agree, it is okay.
