As others have said, twoX hasn't ever been a place to educate the masses on feminism etc (there are subreddits for that). It's more like an informal support group where people can talk openly without being judged/trolled etc.

When you take that sort of community and expose it to the hivemind, or just people who don't share similar experiences, you are destroying that community by definition.

The mods have too much power when they can make decisions without coordinating with the community. The excuse of "there was no time!" doesn't really pull water; that's just an excuse to make an ill-informed decision. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
