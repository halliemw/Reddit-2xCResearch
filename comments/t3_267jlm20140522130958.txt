I think your post is very sensible, although I don't know about the marriage part.  I teach a course on religion (and have, for 30 years) and have interviewed a lot of zealous converts to one of the two main cult-like churches in the area near school.  Alcoholism is a common denominator for many converts, but, alarmingly, so is pedophilia (and a host of other sexually related problems).  

I have learned that for many of these converts, the alternative (from their way of thinking) is much worse:  they'll become abusive, they'll be pedophiles, etc., etc.  It has made me think twice about trying to dislodge their belief systems (always precarious, always extreme) and when I send students out to observe religious behaviors, I have them avoid these two churches as much as I ask them to avoid Scientology.  These religions may have their uses/purposes, but too many people end up in trouble after getting involved.

In the case of several women (who came to class specifically to deal with issues like this), they found out that their over-involved spouse was still a pedophile, which was devastating.  At any rate, poking around in the minds of the hyper-religious, cult-prone person often turns up some pretty ugly stuff.

If anyone out there has extremist family members, as I do, you might know what I'm talking about.
