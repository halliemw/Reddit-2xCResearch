I'm sorry, not trying to be judgmental, but isn't part of an open relationship being straight forward with the other people you hook up with so that lessens the chance of an emotional attachment and also negating their need to contact you?

Not telling whoever you are hooking up with or dating sounds cruel to the other person since there can be no room for anything other than sex.
