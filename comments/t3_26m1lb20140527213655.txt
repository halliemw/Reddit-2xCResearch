Okay, so I think you mean well and that many of your points are valid, but I also think some of your points are just extremely silly and borderline sexist in the other spectrum, sorry to say. I'll try to go through the arguments you've made: 

- Rape jokes. These are never okay, and perpetuate a culture of rape.

No. No, they actually don't. Do violent video games make people violent? Are people *really* that easily swayed? The fact is that even the term "rape culture" has been denounced by the [*largest, American organization against sexual violence*, RAINN.](http://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf) I think it's a very dangerous way to go if  you think humour (which often by default is tasteless to the majority) perpetuate violent action. 

- Catcalling. It is not a compliment. It is a randomly hurled barb of unexpected and potentially dangerous attention most women don't want.

Agree with you a 90% though I'm not sure if it's dangerous, it's absolutely harassment and should be discouraged whenever possible. No one wants to be yelled at one their way home/work or whatever just because of their gender. Should be, and many place is, a form of sexual or just plain harassment. 

- Talking about "crazy ex-girlfriends." More often than not men use the term to dismiss women, rather than diagnosing a real mental illness.

Not entirely sure what you mean here and I can pretty much guarantee  you that women are just as liable to smear their ex-boyfriend like the men, and I don't think anyone but psychiatrists are very much accepted to diagnose someone's mental illness, so I don't think that's what men ought to do. Some relationships end badly and with bad blood, it's natural that some smack-talk will happen. 

- Using terms like bossy, catty, pushy when women do things men get away with easily.

I think both genders are just as liable to do and be accused by both. It's a cultural stereotype that women are the bosses of the relationship/home, and I can guarantee you that this is a stereotype used by plenty a'women to justify their authoritative actions. Less now, hopefully, but it has a historical reason to be. 

- Saying things like "I couldn't date a woman who doesn't shave." or "Women shouldn't dye their hair, natural looks better." or "She should smile more." These phrases are all about taking away a 

You need to relax with this, because you're going dangerous near thought-police actions and trying to demand people to not have personal opinions. Look, it's entirely justifiable for a person to not date or go out with people who have body hair or something that doesn't appeal to them. Now, don't get me wrong, it's something else entirely to *demand the other person to change* based solely on your preference, but having preference isn't wrong. Many women wouldn't date a man with beard and have their own superficial code of dating but that doesn't make them any more sexist than men having the same type of preference. 

- Implying that women get preferential treatment because of their gender. The amount of shit women have to put up with is in no way balanced by a sexist cop occasionally waiving a ticket for a pretty woman.

Somewhere they do, like in some countries they enforce quota to get a certain number of women into the work-force, but it's just some places. I don't really mind that and think it's been a clever way to force changes in the employment scene. What I'm focused on is that we treat women less like victims. They aren't, they're human  beings and they aren't constant victims of sexism and they aren't evil people hell-bent on global domination. 

- Discussing women's looks, pretty much ever. Sometimes it can sound like butchers sizing up a cut of meat.

With all due respect, fuck off. You **can not** argue that sort of limitation. People WILL discuss other peoples' look and they WILL judge them by it. Women or men, and NEITHER is a sexist, racist or evil act by itself. So what if someone says they prefer blondes or red-heads? Are they not allowed to have preferences? Are they not allowed to talk about them? You do not get to set such limitations. 

- Talking about the "Friendzone". The concept of the "friendzone" is essentially that women don't have a right to choose who they're attracted to. 

Agree with you a 100% -- Friendzone and the whole concept of it is just idiotic at its core. It seems to imply people are entitles to romantic relationship because they've been nice or something and *how dare* the woman just regard that person as a mere friend? Tch. Idiotic. 

- Disparaging women for having many sexual partners. It's no business of anyone's how much sex women have, and it has no impact on their value as a person.

Yup. The sexual relations of whatever person is their own business. Women aren't sluts or whores because they like having sex or have had multiple partners, that sort of moronic thinking is what's wrong with men these days, if you ask me. But that idea of sexual impurity has been propagated by more than just men and religion; splinter groups of feminism has actually been complicit in that. 

- Implying that men have uncontrollable urges. Saying things like "I can't resist" or "I can't be held responsible" are bullshit ways of placing blame on women.

Agree with you again. I've never understood nor supported the idea that men are somehow "horn-dogs" and can't stop themselves. Of course we fucking can and of course we are liable for what we do. That's just idiotic and to be honest it's insulting to men when someone claims that. 

- Belittling men about being unassertive. There is a lot of cultural emphasis placed on men's sexual dominance. This is bad, and trains men to think they should keep trying if women say no. 

If I get what you're saying, that you're tackling the whole "she's just playing hard to get" or "if you just press on it will be bound to happen" then I'm with you a 100%, that sort of idiotic nonsense ought to end and is often given credence in movies from Disney and the sort. 

- When men get more offended at false rape accusations than rape itself.

It's entirely possible and probably probable to be just as offended by both.  It's really not an "either / or" discussion. It's horrible that some people try to falsely claim rape and it's abominable that people get raped. You're allowed to be concerned with either without being accused of diminishing the other. 

- Blue balls. An attempt to place the burden of sexual satisfaction on women, as though they are intentionally causing them harm by not having sex with them.

Kiiiiinda not getting this one. I mean I know the concept of blue balls, but it doesn't imply that women are at fault, just at men aren't getting any sex or such and it's frustrating. That is entirely legitimate to feel that you aren't getting any. But then again it's not justification to accuse other people of doing you injustice. 

Phew. Lots of stuff written here, hope you can forgive me for that. You wrote a lot of interesting points, but I don't think you're hitting the mark entirely and some of what you've written seems unnecessarily aggressive and judgmental towards men.
