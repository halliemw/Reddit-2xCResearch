I'm curious, has your sister considered taking sovaldi? I'm not 100% sure it's on the market yet, and it's made headlines because the company that made it is charging an absurd amount for it. But it's supposed to **cure** most cases of HCV in 12 weeks. Depending on how advanced your sister's disease is, it may be covered.
