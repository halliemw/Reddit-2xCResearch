:/ Sorry you lost him.

My ex was a nurse who would dose me up on a regular medicine schedule so I wouldn't have to remember to take pain meds. He knew my cramps were terrible so he also got me a bunch of chem heaters for my low back.

He'd cut up a bunch of cheese,  pop some wine, and snuggle me under a big down comforter while I sat on Reddit, tearing up over pictures of cute things.

One time he ever bought me the cute thing my ovaries wanted: my hedgehog. 

He was a really good boyfriend even if the only thing he can commit to is his stupid haircut.
