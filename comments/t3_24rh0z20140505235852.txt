That sounded terrible.  Sorry they told you that.  For my prom a million years ago (it seems), I was pretty awkward and didn't know anything at all about up-dos.  So I went with my friend to get our hair done for prom and mine was done up in a very unflattering way.  When I got to prom, one girl (not even a very popular girl) came up to me and told me that my hair looked like shit. Those were her actual words. I will never forget it.
