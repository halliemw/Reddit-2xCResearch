I moved from my mothers house 3 years ago after she became physical with me. It wasn't as bad for me as it was for you but I knew I had to get the fuck out of there for good. Ever since I was a teen she would feign kicking me out, only to physically push me back into our house when I tried to leave. I must have tried to get out four or five times before it actually happened when I was 22. It wasn't easy, I had to stay in really unideal conditions at first, even though I am grateful to my friends for putting me up. My mother would call just to demand that i come home/call me horrific things/try to bargain with me/threaten me. I didn't go home though. Now that I only see her a few days out of the week I feel like our relationship has improved. I have the power to set boundaries. She always held financial things above my head too, I can relate so much to you in that regard. You'll see that being independent is very stressful, especially since your parents seemed unwilling to give you the proper tools to face being independent, my mom would still have me home under her house rules if I let her. Its gratifying to be free, I know that if my mother calls me and demands something, I can absolutely refuse. I couldn't put a price on that, the stress of keeping it together is worth it. You'll be happy soon, you'll see!
