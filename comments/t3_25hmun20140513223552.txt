Exactly this, yesterday after I didn't respond well to his creepy advances a 22 year old guy iv know two days told me he knows more and stripping and the 'sex industry' then I do. Iv been working as a stripper for 5 years. I tried to explain to him how much experience in this industry i have and couldn't he see that anyone working in any industry for 5 years would be more informed than a layman. He couldn't see that apparently. 

This guy genuinely believes he is not sexist and 'loves' women. They are 'goddesses' apparently and he treats them as such. 

The rest of the argument(in which i did genuinely try to show him why his behaviour was out of order and explain Why I felt this way) was him shouting at me and telling me he doesn't want to fuck me and wants to fuck my sister and do I want to know reasons why? I Tried to explain he wasn't seeing me as a another human being but as a purely sexual object and trying shame and insult me by using my sexuality and all the sexist tools society had provided him. I was then told he knew more about women's experiences and feminism then I did because he knew 'people'. 

At this point I gave up.
