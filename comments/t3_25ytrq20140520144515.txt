It's just my personal experience. I can't cite anything. Being male, the experience of having to leave when certain topics came up was so awful. Embarrassing as shitting oneself! Perhaps this is a very masculine view.

Upon further reflection, I realize you are right. The world can simply be more accommodating for her, and more considerate of her feelings. If OP wanted advice on coping strategy she would have asked.
