> I suffered through, and at the very end of third month, it was light someone flipped a switch. The depression was gone, the side effects abated, I was finally normal again. 

The opposite seems to happen to me. I'm on a particular kind for a few months; I'm fine, completely normal, and then someone flips a switch, and then I feel numb. I can't feel empathy, happiness, or anything good. It's like a damp, heavy cloth is wrapped around my head. Everything feels... muffled. Far away. I feel detached and removed. Everything is pointless. "Why should I bother?"

This time is slightly different, because I'm moving directly from one pill pack into another. I didn't wait for the placebo week this time. I'm sure this sudden wreck of apathy and emotion is due to a clash of hormones, but it feels so much more than that.

> You mention having a rough time after your first week of the new pack, so try and tough it out. Of course, keep and eye on your depression all the while. 

I'm definitely going to stick it out for a couple months at the least... I'm really hoping things will get better. It's just particularly hard to deal with this right now.
