I agree. It frustrates me when I'm asked about that and my intentions for children. 

It's not just employment though, it's also health. Marital status? Why? How does that change how you treat me? Honestly, even if I were married I wouldn't want my husband having automatic authority or equal place in my making health choices - in fact, it would be closer to none of his business. And my status is none of the doctors either. One doctor once wrote "not married no fiance no boyfriend/partner single" in my file next to marital status. Do you think he had a point to make?
