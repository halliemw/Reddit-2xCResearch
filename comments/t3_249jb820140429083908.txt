Did anyone else look up the Department of Justice crime survey after watching this? For someone complaining about others cherry-picking data, it seems like she cherry-picked data herself. Sure, maybe there were only 188,380 rapes in 2010, but that figure nearly doubled between then and 2012, to 346,830. That's friggin crazy! Either the Department of Justice's data collection was unreliable in some year, or the amount of sexual violence doubled in two years. Something is weird about these numbers, and though I can't really be bothered to look into it further it seems like this "Factual Feminist" is just pushing her own agenda by cherry picking data herself, and is not painting a full picture. 

To anyone wanting to look into this for themselves, here are the related reports:

Also, if you look up the American Enterprise Institute, you'll find that they are a conservative think tank. They stand for "...limited government, private enterprise, individual liberty...". So I think it's safe to say that they are pushing their own agenda here, and the facts and arguments being provided are going to be ones which serve their purposes.
