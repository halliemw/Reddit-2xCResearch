(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ eyy, someone like me! 
sometimes the second day tsunami is so severe for me, I have dizzy spells. In *fact*, on the two occasions I was running errands when I was hit with a dizzy spell, I almost fainted. Head swimming, cold sweat, disorientation, the works. But I'm countering this by drinking V8 juice now, and things have been smooth sailing so far. I think it's helping. 

And I have to use the jumbo pads that have those sticky wings on the side. I remember the first time a huge chunk came out, I was utterly fascinated. I poked it with a q-tip and wondered, "What the hell just came out of me?" Then I started to worry something was wrong with me. Not mentally, because who wouldn't marvel at their first weird menstrual chunk? So I went to my mom and she assured me that this is normal. 

I can relate to the crying! Seriously, the littlest things start my waterworks. My tear ducts are loaded and working in overdrive sometimes. If I'm not bursting into tears at something, all of a sudden I'll start feeling inexplicably sad and the floodgates open. Watching feel-good movies and getting hugs from family members helps. My periods usually last 2-7 days now, give or take.
