boyfriend;When you don't want to do something I'd like to unless your brother or your friends do it, it makes me feel like I'm not cool enough to even be with you or you don't care about my own feelings and wants. 

edit: boyfriends brother;When you smoke in the house after I told you multiple times how I can't breathe when you do and how everything smells bad (like my clothes and all the furniture *I* bought) it makes me feel so angry I just want to break all of your stuff and move out despite the fact that I pay as much rent as you do and that my boyfriend doesn't want to leave either
