NFP has a lot to recommend it, specifically the points you raise about fertility and getting to know one's body. However, it's still risky for the purposes of avoiding pregnancy unless you plan to totally abstain from PIV sex until 3 days after the woman has ovulated. It's even riskier if the man is not also educated in the same method and totally committed to it, because then you might have some problems negotiating the off-days, etc. I know that if you mix condoms & Billings you risk messing up your mucus readings (not sure if that's a problem for other methods). I'd still say it's probably not a good idea for OP to rely on it if she's trying to avoid getting pregnant. NFP is really more for people who are open to the possibility of having children even if they're not actively trying.
