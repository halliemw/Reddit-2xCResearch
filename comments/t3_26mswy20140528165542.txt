No no, I'm not hating on Marvel/DC or SW/ST by a long shot. Yeah, they're popular with nerds. But the thing is, this stuff is mainstream now. You can consider yourself 100% not nerdy, but still be totally into the Avengers. Because they're awesome, but also because look how much money it made. 

This show kind of looks like the writers sat down and said "how do you set the scene for this group of men to be labelled nerd>  
1. make them terrible with women, because there are no nerd chicks hurh hurh! I mean come on, Leslie Wrinkle showed up pretty quickly, but she wasn't really a geek, more just 'love interest rival'  
2. what was really, really, nerdy when I was a kid? Uh! Trekkies! That lightsaber kid on youtube! Done.  
3. Everyone is in STEM fields. Not hatin' on STEM, but there's also some outrageous characters typical of say, the social studies department.
