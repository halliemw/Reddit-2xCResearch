I second the lube comment. Lube is essential for keeping condoms intact. But, any oil based product will make a latex condom break. Make sure he doesn't use oil/lotion for masturbation. My favorite condom safe lube is [Wet Synergy.](http://www.condomdepot.com/product/detail.cfm/pnid/214/nid/245/pid/3433)

Here is a [Condom Size Chart,](http://learn.condomdepot.com/condom-size-chart/) so you can get an idea of where Magnum's are on the scale of small to large condoms, and to get an idea of what may work better for you guys. 

I also recommend storing them in a room temperature environment, because heat/cold and sunlight can cause the latex to dry up and become brittle. Hope this was helpful!
