I've never had my ears pierced. Every so often an acquaintance (extended family or whatever) will buy me earrings as a generic gift (Like a stocking stuffer, for example). It's really awkward when I have to tell them that my ears are not pierced. 

edit: not trying to use that as evidence for why you should get your ears pierced. You shouldn't, because you don't want to :)
