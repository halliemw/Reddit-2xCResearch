Honestly the first thing I saw on your skin was the adorable beauty mark on your cheek! So cute, they are my fav. The chin isn't a place most people focus on when looking at you. Your eyes and lips hold the most attention when talking to someone, and with where it is on your chin it's really not particularly "in your face" for lack of a better term :p

I agree with most other people here that if it would make you feel more confident, go for it, but if you're on the fence I would leave it be. I have a lot of noticeable moles on my arms, and as a kid they were always pointed out and even poked at, so that's where my self consciousness came from. Now that I've had some years of living with them, I feel more comfortable in my skin, and I even like them more than dislike. Either way, I truly believe the only person who will notice/be aware of it is you, so do what makes you happy!
