I have these little satchels of talcum powder/baking soda my aunt makes for craft shows, they are shoe deodorizers they last for about a month (for gym sneaks, probably longer for simple shoes). Super cheap and you can make em yourself. You can even sew them to fit in your shoe. Silica gel balls are great too. Those little things keep the moisture from collecting while you store them.
