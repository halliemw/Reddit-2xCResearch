> I’ve heard Elliot Rodger’s voice before. I was expecting his manifesto to be incomprehensible madness—hoping for it to be—but it wasn’t. It’s a standard frustrated angry geeky guy manifesto, except for the part about mass murder.

>I’ve heard it from acquaintances, I’ve heard it from friends. I’ve heard it come out of my own mouth, in moments of anger and weakness.

Really? Cause I also read that manifesto, and while it's not incomprehensible, it is *packed to the gills with madness.* Sane people do not spend years trying to win the lottery with power of their subconscious. Sane people do not attack happy looking couples because they are insulted by their presence. Sane people don't suddenly decide that their little brother is an 'enemy' because someone mentions how charming he is. Elliot Rodgers does all of this, and worse, and well before he gets to the 'mass murder' part.

Maybe I just live a very sheltered existence, but I don't know any men who have ever expressed anything like this. I don't doubt some exist - you can certainly find them on the internet, but is it really that common? Because if Elliot Rodgers (minus the mass murder stuff) really represents a substantial proportion of geeky young men these days, then we're raising an incredibly dysfunctional generation.
