Neck wrinkles. Don't ignore that neck while you are young!

I think the weirdest part of aging for me, is that my metabolism did a complete nosedive almost over night, it seemed, at around 35. One day I was happily eating whatever I wanted, not exercising all the much, feeling smuggly happy about my "genes," and the next I couldn't fit into my jeans. Then my blouses were too small, my arms became big old sausages. I should have known, all the women in my family had the same thing happen to them when they hit about 35. It was a reality check, for sure. I DO exercise and eat right now, after an initial period of saying "fuck it, I'll always weigh at least 150," but working hard produces results and I'm back to a nice, manageable low 120s range. And I definitely don't get to stuff my face like I used to be able to. Sigh.

It's odd when people stop calling you "that girl," older ladies at the store no longer call you "sweetie," and instead people start calling you "that lady" and "Mrs ___." That's when you know you are getting older and everyone else knows it too.
