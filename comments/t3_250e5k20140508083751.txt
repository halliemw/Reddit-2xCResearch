They're completely right. They've only "faded in and out" for white people, and they're a "trendy fashion statement" for white people. Would you say this is trendy?

No, it's not, it's one of the few standards of hair available to black people in America that doesn't involve abusing or hiding their hair. Would you argue that the afro is trendy? Extensions and straighteners are more trendy than dreadlocks. 

I don't think it's wrong to ban dreadlocks (or at least severely limit the size they can be with specific measurements) but your argument of them being "a fad" is a little gross.
