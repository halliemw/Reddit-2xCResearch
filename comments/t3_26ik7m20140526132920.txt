I don't know if it's an American thing, as that seems a bit pejorative in this context, but I also wouldn't care if someone was shopping in a bikini (though I live in a beach town so ymmv), and certainly most gym gear covers just as much if not more than shorts and a tank top.

I am all for wearing appropriate clothes in certain cases, like not wearing this to work unless it's at a gym, but if you're just going to the store or the movies, who cares? Why does it matter if I'm shopping in yoga pants and a tank top, a binkini top and shorts, or whatever? Why does it bother people so much?
