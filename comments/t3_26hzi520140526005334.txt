You need to pick *where* you live in the city very carefully. It's possible to live in a city with a high crime rate and have few to no problems if you have the luxury of picking your neighborhood.

Get a taser if you want (and it's legal where you live). But I personally think making some strategic choices and being aware of your surroundings are more important.
