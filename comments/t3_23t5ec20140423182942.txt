Everyone is different, but cumming usually entails a body high. Losing control of your body/"convulsing" and then becomming exhausted isn't the primary definition of cumming, just sensations which usually accompany cumming but often occur without cumming, too. Either way, sounds like you finally have a partner who cares about your needs!


Are you sure you peed and didn't "squirt"?
