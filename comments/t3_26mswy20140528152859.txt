Whoa, of course you wouldn't blame feminism--I wouldn't either.  Feminism and misandry are not meant to be the same thing, nor even counterparts.

So while Solanas killed for misandry, Rodger killed for misogyny; yet we can also recognize that they were both probably criminally insane.  Their lunacy does not negate their harmful worldviews IMO.  In fact I think that the justifications recorded in their manifestos and proselytized all over niches like TRP are the most harmful lasting element of all.
