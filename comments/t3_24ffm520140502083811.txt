you're making a lot of assumptions. you don't have to be fat to be called fat. it's really not as uncommon as you seem to think. anyway, i'm not trying to turn this into a huge thing, just point out that i don't think the study is necessarily saying "if you call your daughter fat, then she will become obese". i think that's just how people are interpreting it.
