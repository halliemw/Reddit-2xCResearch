I was so worried that you would spout something bad about vaccines as soon as I read about the adverse reaction: you sound strong and patient, and I'm glad you realise that herd immunity is important in these situations instead of blaming vaccines and saying noone should have them.

You sound like you're struggling and I wish you the best.
