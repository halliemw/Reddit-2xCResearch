I'd start by calling her OB/GYN and sharing your concerns. Yes, it may be an awkward overreach under normal circumstances, but PPD is serious. 

Do you have any family or close friends nearby? Ask for, and accept, as much help as possible. One of my clearest memories of the first week home with our daughter was the day my MIL came over and held the baby all day so I could sleep. She'd bring her in to nurse when she was hungry, but other than that, I slept. It was amazing. 

I haven't had the experience of bringing home a baby when I had a toddler, but I'd imagine any extra attention you could give your son would help, as well as showing him how to be a good helper. I don't have a link, but read something recently about the power of teaching toddlers to be "helpers."

And you need to periodically go have some beers or a meal with a buddy or family member, ideally one who also has kids, to decompress. You need an outlet and something fun in your life to help you be the best partner possible.
