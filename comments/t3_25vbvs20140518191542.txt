I totally agree - if the friend was there before she bought the dress and saw her try it on then she could have said something about how she didn't like it ( in a much more tactful/constructive way than she did). But she can't take it back now for a refund so why upset her - especially if she loves the dress. There is a time and a place to be blunt.

Side note : I love the dress! It looks really pretty on your figure and I love the ruching with the lace. It's very unlike lots of dresses and very romantic (I am a wedding dress expert after watching every episode of Say Yes to The Dress (NY & Atlanta) on Netflix).
