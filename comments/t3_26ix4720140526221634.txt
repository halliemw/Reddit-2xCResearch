Social construct: monogamous relationships. You enter an agreement (usually assumed, sometimes discussed) of exclusive physical/romantic relations whose basis is trust. Entering into a relation of that type with someone else is a breach of that trust, which is extremely disrespectful, harmful to the other and the person breaching the trust, and shows poor character.

Putting an end to the agreement relieves both parties from their moral obligation to keep to that monogamous relationship both physically and romantically.

It's just plain respect. Some people have trouble understandig that.
