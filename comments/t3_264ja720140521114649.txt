I've tried home remedies, but they don't eliminate the fungi once and for all, only keep the symptoms slightly dimmed. Right now I am financially incapable to afford any kind of medicine. The internet tells me I should have oral pills if the yeast has managed it's way up to my hands, so I am at loss here because I cannot acquire them without a prescription or currency.

Thank you for your suggestion.
