I've spent the last five years of my career in a tough inner city school as a high school special educator, and I can not imagine moving to work in the suburbs. Sure, kids get arrested, into violent fights, shot...but this all (most) happens outside of the school. The relationships I've built with my kids are strong, and it's been really wonderful to see them progress and graduate and move on to college/the workforce. Now that I'm pregnant, they are more sensitive to me than anyone else I've interacted with (seriously- I have bodyguards in the hallway and they act more excited than my siblings. It's hilarious/adorable). Your boyfriend can't make you do anything. Think about whether or not this is important to you. If it is (and the idea alone of having minimal or no student loans is a pretty serious perk), then you need simply to tell him that.
