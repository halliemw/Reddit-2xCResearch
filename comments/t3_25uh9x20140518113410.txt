And keep extra undies and pants/other bottoms in your backpack/locker/car/whatever. You or a girl friend will need these at some point, it's always better to be safe in this situation. Also, I always always keep extra tampons in my purse, even when it's not that time of the month, in case I'm ever in a public bathroom and a stranger hollers from their stall for an emergency product (it happens! It's like girl code, we've for each other covered.)
