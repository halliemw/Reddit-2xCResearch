Approaching a much younger women in a parking lot to strike up a conversation is creepy.

I've had perfectly reasonable conversations somewhat like this one with men in public places: the difference being that they didn't approach me when I was alone.  Striking up this sort of conversation while on a train or waiting in line is normal.  Approaching a young woman when she's alone in a parking lot is a way of getting a date, not having a conversation for the sake of a conversation.
