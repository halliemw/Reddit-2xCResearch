My mum had an abortion when she was pregnant for the third time. She had already given birth to myself and my brother and she just didn't want to have another baby at that time in her life, didn't want to try to cope with being a single mother looking after two children while being pregnant *and* working full time, our house was too small for three children, she didn't have enough money to give all three children a reasonable quality of life, and she wasn't in a very secure relationship with the father. So it was a simple choice for her I think. My mum is very pro-choice, and doesn't really have any religious beliefs so I can't really apply that to your situation I guess.
