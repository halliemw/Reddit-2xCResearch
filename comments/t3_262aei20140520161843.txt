My mom's always sort of thought the same way that you do now. She sees herself as pro-choice but not necessarily pro-abortion. She believes that women should have the choice and that it's their choice to make, but believes that she herself would NEVER get an abortion and she does judge people that do. 

There's nothing wrong with thinking this way, it's your life and you can choose to think however you want.
