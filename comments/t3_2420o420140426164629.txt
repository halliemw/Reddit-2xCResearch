This is always the right answer!  Along with Angel, Firefly, and maybe Dollhouse.  Possibly Agents of SHIELD.  That one's not on Netflix yet, but it's streaming [here](http://www.cokeandpopcorn.ch/watch-marvels-agent-of-shield-season-1-online.php) and I'm sure it's totally legal and legit in whatever country is hosting it.

Also on Netflix with strong female leads is Charmed, Alias, Orange is the New Black (though that may be a bit hard to watch, it's good, but also heavy and kind of depressing), Parks and Recreation, and Pretty Little Liars.  (Okay, PLL isn't exactly "good", it's totally unbelievable, but it's compelling in a stupid, fluffy kind of way.)
