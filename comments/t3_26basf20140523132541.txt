I have move with my boyfriend and 4 roomates, all guys, for about a month, and all is doing smoothly. I was worried about living with my boyfriend, about living with the other guys, I was afraid that I felt left out, but no! I'm playing videogames with them (even if I'm not a hardcore gamer), they are super sweet with me, one of them even bought me chocolate when I was on my week. So, my life in this moment is pretty much that:
