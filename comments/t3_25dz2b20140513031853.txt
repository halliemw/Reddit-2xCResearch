It was 5:30 AM and I was on the tube, going to my shitty job. I was sleep deprived, cranky and wearing my "don't talk to me" armour (headphones ans face deep in a book".

So these two guys get on at a stop, and they start approaching me with sort of cooing sounds like I'm some escaped cattle, **all while talking among themselves about how they 're going to pick me up.** my eyebrows jumped up into orbit and I ostensively  put the book in front of me. 


At this point one of them takes offense (how DARE I) and touches my hand saying"hey, I'm talking to you". I back away, take out my headphones and say clearly and calmly "I am not interested"


Well fuck, doesn't work and at this point these guys have backed me into a corner. Angry guy gets visibly angrier and starts telling ke I cannot disrespect him, and I am being rude. I say " I am not being rude, I just don't want to talk to you". He continues criticizing my extreme rudeness so I say "leave me alone"


At this point angry guy gets extremely silent and says"how dare you bitch" with  a low tone. "I could smash your teeth in for your attitude. You better apologise or I will". 


So at this point I am like, what the fuck did I do to deserve this shit. I look around and notice everyone is enjoying the show. I make desperate eye contact with several men and they all look away the fuckers. Well fuck you all too. So I look at the guy and say"i am sorry for being rude". Guy immensely enjoys it and returns to "flirting". At this point I am terrified I will be stuck with these creeps until the end of the line where the area was kinda deserted and industrial. So I notice the doors beeping to close and I make a beeline and get out right before they do. The fuckers look in disbelief and I am literally shaking showing them a congratulatory middle finger.
