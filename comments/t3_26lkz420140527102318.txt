I went to China on a family trip and we stopped at the restroom before leaving a temple. One side of toilets were modern 'seated' ones and the other side were the squat, hole-in-the-ground ones. My mother and I came out of opposite sides and I was like, mom, there were regular toilets on this side!!  And she replied, I know. But its part of the experience.
