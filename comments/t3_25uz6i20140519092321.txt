I want to add in the suggestion about lube that: I am a young woman and I use lube very frequently.  I take a lot of allergy medications that dry out my mucus membranes, so I need a little bit of help. Mucinex is one of the worst offenders (for me).

Your hoo-haw is unique, and so is your body chemistry. Some medicines can effect that.

And I'd also like to add that you should find a YouTube video about effective condom usage. There's a ton of ways to mess it up, so you may as well not learn them the hard way.
