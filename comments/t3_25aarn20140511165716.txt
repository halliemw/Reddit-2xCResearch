Agreed. My mom and I haven't had the smoothest relationship, but things have gotten a lot better over the past few years. One of our breakthrough moments was after she'd criticized my outfit (which seemed to be a favorite pastime of hers) one afternoon when we met for lunch.  I usually got pretty upset, but something was different that day. I didn't sulk and I didn't snap back. Instead, I calmly explained to her how much it hurt to hear such constant negative criticism from someone so close to me. I told her that her opinion was important to me and it made me feel like she must see me as a lesser person if all she ever saw was something to criticize and nothing to praise.

The look on her face told me that I had finally said the right thing. She was shocked and sad to hear how her years of nitpicking and criticism had affected me. She was ashamed that she never realized how hurtful she could be. That one moment of clear, calm, straightforward honesty has made a monumental difference. My only regret is that we didn't have that conversation sooner. 

tl;dr : Hold off on sending that letter. Take some time to step back, calm down, and figure out the least aggressive way to express to your mom how you feel. I'm not promising results as dramatic as mine, but it's better than doing something that could widen the rift between you two. And it just might work.
