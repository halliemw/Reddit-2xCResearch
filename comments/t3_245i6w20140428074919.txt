I am 5'10" and I have always been tall. Not only that, but I was a late bloomer so I was completely lanky. It always made me self conscious because I stood out from all my friends. However, in college, I grew into my body. Where people used to make fun of me, I started getting compliments and jealous whines from my friends about how tall and thin I am. My mother was constantly telling me that I'd love my height as an adult, and it never really made me feel better. But she was right. Here are some of my favorite things about being tall:

-Even though it sucks having to buy bigger clothes, people are shocked when they find out my size. "But you're so thin!" It's the best feeling ever when people react like that. Plus, being tall makes it easier to carry extra weight.

-Even though my current boyfriend is 6'5", the shorter guys I've dated have never been turned off by my height. Guys love legs, and it makes me stand out. Plus, normal clothes look shorter on me, which sucked in school (I got dress code violations all the time) but is pretty great now. Sorry, as her father I know you don't want to hear that :P

-When people literally have to look up to you, they tend to take you more seriously. Even though I have a round and young looking face, no one mistakes me for a little girl. This helps with everything from job interviews to arguments.

-I work in a library and I don't have to worry about moving those annoying metal stools around the bookshelves.

There are some disadvantages, of course. Sometimes I look awkward in pictures with my short friends, but if you practice posing you can get it right and look fabulous. My other job is working for a professional wrestling company. I do backstage interviews and that sort of thing, but the promoter is hesitant to use me in the actual show because I make the wrestlers look short and less threatening. It's kind of cool to have that effect though. :)

But the absolute worst thing is bowling. All my friends get the cute neon shoes, and my size 11s usually look like something a clown died in. Plus it's always awkward to follow a chorus of "Size 6 please" with "What's the biggest you got?" But if she can get over little embarrassing things like that, she can handle anything. Confidence is key!

**Edit:** Speaking of confidence, nag her about her posture as much as possible. She'll thank you later. I was always slouching, trying to make myself look shorter. I'm 23 and I already have back problems. Tell her to embrace her height and rock it, head held high!
