Hire a private investigator, get some legal advice. One thing that can be done is having the private investigator look into the IP of the person setting up the fake accounts, if they're using the same computer to set up the fake accounts it then becomes extremely easy to find them and serve them with a cease and desist order, then if they don't you have the right to sue them for everything they own!
