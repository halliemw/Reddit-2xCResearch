>The biggest issue is that women who were born and raised in the Middle East are indoctrinated into those beliefs and that the rest of the world needs to be understanding of that to some degree.

But that's not true of all the women there. Those who choose to not follow the rules or laws are ostracized and attacked. That's the problem.

Simply because something is part of a culture does not make it morally acceptable.

>For women who have been taught their entire lives that their faces are private parts of their bodies, it's pretty scary to be told that you have to expose your private parts to total strangers.

I think most people aren't arguing for forcing women who want to cover themselves to show their face or hair. They're arguing against forcing women to cover themselves (typically far more than men have to).
