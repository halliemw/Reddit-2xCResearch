I shook my head when I read that it's the HR Director.   I don't know that it's a reportable offense since it's a private party off of work grounds, but it is uncomfortable.    Basically, they made it clear how they operate and project their own insecurities with their marriages and such on to other people.   You don't have to play the game; boycott politely and work on finding a new crew.  If they're this catty, I would keep a professional boundary with them to stay on the safe side of office politics and to keep your career drama-free.
