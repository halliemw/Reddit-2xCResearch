I'm proud of you for taking the steps you konw you need to take.

I'm a 50 yr old happily married woman. Yes, I have taken SO to therapy with me, and I have accompanied my SO into therapy.

It has nothing to do with him.   You are asking him to support YOU.  You are asking him to get the tools he needs to have a better relationship with YOU.  

Your counselor should be able to help you open the conversation with him.  Your counselor probably has a handout that you can give your boyfriend that details the type of counseling, the point of the counseling, the types of things that will be discussed.  Ask your counselor.

One session with a particular SO was enough to convince me that it was time to end it (I waited 1 week which was too long -  should have ended it on the way home from the session).   Different types of issues need different types of support.  And knowing what type of support to give helps a lot.
