Eh, some do. Some go out of their way to date "unattractive women" who are "below their standards" because they assume the women will be so appreciative of the attention of a much finer male specimen that they will be much more easy to date (who am I kidding, to fuck). A lot of creeps also enjoy the power play and having a victim to abuse for the fault of being "ugly".

And when you turn them down, it's like the freak the fuck out. How dare such a person refuse... ME? Whaaaaat? They are acting like they're the GREENPEACE OF PENISES and you are a poor 3rd worlds country who refused their generous deposit.
