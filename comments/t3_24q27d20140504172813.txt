It's really cruel of your boyfriend to insist you distance yourself from your male friends simply because they have penises. This all sounds like he's harboring some jealousy issues. 

It also seems like he got with you and then suddenly decided who he got with isn't who he wanted so he's trying to change you into who he wants. 

If you want to make female friends then you don't have to change who you are. You don't have to stop being friends with guys and start being rude to your male coworkers to make your boyfriend happy.
