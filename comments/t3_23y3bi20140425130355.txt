Man, skinny "pretty" people can be self conscious about their bodies too. I have pretty serious scoliosis. It doesn't hurt, but I've thought about having someone fuse a metal rod to my spine just so it will look nice - even though I know it will probably cause me some pretty serious pain down the line. Most people think I look great, but anytime someone touches my back or it's visible to people I just about crawl out of my skin in discomfort.
