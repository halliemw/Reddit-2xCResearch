I was hanging around the house one day, decided to check out some new groups on meetup.com...and one of them was a "Bucket List" group that was going axe-throwing. And I realized that it could make my life complete. ;) (Or at least help me meet new people and release some of the frustration that's built up over a crummy year!)
