It seems like your friends weren't thinking properly and, in that instance, thought you should join the fun too. I don't think they understood your perspective on this (at least during the moment). I say talk to them about it, but don't judge them on what they did. It seems like they treated you like 'one of the guys' and wanted you to have a fun time.  

The girl who rescued *definitely* deserves some attention. So awesome! I'm glad she was there for you when you needed her.
