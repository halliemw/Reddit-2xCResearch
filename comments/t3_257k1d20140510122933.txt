I've been on the pill since 2004, and I haven't had a period since 2012. IT HAS BEEN AWESOME. I would highly recommend (after you talk to your doctor) for anyone taking the pill to consider taking it continuously and skipping periods. It's great. I don't get breakthrough bleeding, no more staining panties. Mini AMA for those interested. :)
