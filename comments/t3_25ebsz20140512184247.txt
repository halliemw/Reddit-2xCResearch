PhD here: a great deal depends on what doubts you are having, and why. I think it's worth spending some time with pen and paper to help you sort things out. (Self-doubt is part of grad school.)

At one point in life you wanted this career enough to jump through a lot of hoops to get as far as you are now. Have your feelings about that work changed? If so, why? I think you should list all the pro's and con's of finishing your degree; of entering the career you are working toward; and of leaving grad school. Putting it all down on paper will help you sort out what parts of this dilemma are deep and perhaps even value-oriented; what parts are simply that grad school is an unmitigated pain in the ass; what parts are pragmatic (are there jobs? where? would you hate those jobs? etc).

The write about what you would really like to be doing with your life, and what steps you would need to take to get there. No sense committing to a career track that would make you miserable. When you are 80 and rocking on the front porch, what do you want to look back and see you did?

It's a normal part of the process, but it's also normal to discover you weren't really following your Most Important Dreams.
