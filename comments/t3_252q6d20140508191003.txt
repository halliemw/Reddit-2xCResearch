I gathered you probably wanted a mod posted and stickied poll, but the outcome would be pretty much the same... excepting maybe some influence from them leaving it longer (maybe that's what they're hoping for, eventual acceptance)...

Overall I agree with you; they need to communicate better. Until then they're going down on this sinking ship alone - I've unsubbed.
