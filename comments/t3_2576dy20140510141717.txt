I don't want to get in argument but there's some factual inaccuracies in what you're saying about circumcision. The vast majority of the world's circumcision (~70%) is done by Muslims who circumcise as young teens, not in infancy. Circumcision is also practiced in African tribes as a coming of age [ceremony](http://ulwaluko.co.za/home.html), and unsurprisingly it is just as unsanitary and crude as African FGM.

I've never heard a mother who did FGM on her daughter say it was to stop her from enjoying sex. The closest they say is it's for "marriageability", but also "tradition", "it's what we've always done", and "i don't want her to be different". Even if the real cause is to stop girls from enjoying sex, it doesn't mean that's what those women believe they are doing. Incidentally, circumcision was historically done to reduce sexual pleasure and stop boys from masturbating, but parents today believe they are doing it for "hygiene and health", which is a myth.
