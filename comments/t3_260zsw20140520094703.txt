I could never fake it - just wondering if it's possible to get to the point where I actually wouldn't be faking it. Can I make myself believe? Do I want to? I'm struggling.

>While dogmatic beliefs can have many real benefits, usually the believer feels justified in making what would be otherwise unreasonable demands because they are in a more committed relationship with Jesus than you, and unless they accept that you are more important than making Jesus happy, they will feel justified in setting conditions on child rearing, your personal beliefs, and church attendance that you as a non-believer would never try to enforce on him for anything else.

Thank you for writing this out so simply.

> if he chooses you over Jesus, then his beliefs aren't matching with reality. So rather than accept reality he has to force you to change or get you out of his life because the fact you can be happy and fulfilled without religion is threatening to his beliefs. 

Gonna think on this one.

Thanks for your time and comments.
