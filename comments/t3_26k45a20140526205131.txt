I swim in tampons but I always bring some to change. For that long a trip, everyone will be sneaking off for potty breaks in the trees or whatever, so you won't stand out if you have to go off away from everyone. Just say you have to pee and then grab your bag and go. Likely no one will notice the bag-grabbing, girls taking their purses everywhere is such a normal sight haha. 

Edit: I forgot to mention about leaking. It shouldn't happen, especially with a light flow, but on the off chance it does, it won't be noticeable until you're out of the water and sitting around, so I'd go and check it or change it after you get out of the water each time.
