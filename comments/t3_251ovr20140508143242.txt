I am having trouble understanding your thought process.

It is possible to complain about individual men, without disparaging men as a whole.

That has nothing to do with reading comprehension, it's a simple fact. 
 
You are either intentionally misinterpreting things...or *you* have horrible comprehension of more than just reading.  Grow up.
