Years and years ago, Bitch did an article on lady beards.

It sparked a lifelong jealousy in me and I will probably never achieve the level of beardness shown in the article, but they were so soft, so pretty, so feminine. 

If I ever grow significant hair on my face, you best bet it's staying. Shit's going to be *luxurious*.
