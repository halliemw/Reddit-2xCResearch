Most people tend to be like their friends at some level.  The day you don't like hanging out and doing the things that they do is usually the day they stop being your friends(and also the day you realized you aren't like them anymore). If you aren't happy around them, you should find new people to hang out with whose company you enjoy. It's not a bad thing to want people around you who share your values.
