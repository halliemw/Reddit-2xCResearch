Interestingly, the term slut has really started to apply to both genders, though it's a recent development. My only concern is that a man who sleeps around is also known as a "womanizer". If you want to drop slut shaming I guess you also have to drop womanizing shaming... There are definitely women who play and equal and opposite role as someone with little or no regard for the human they are sleeping with. A lot of women will sleep with a guy for a chance to get his money/gifts or for their own ego (especially if he's wealthy or famous).... It might be helpful to have a name for people who express that behavior.
