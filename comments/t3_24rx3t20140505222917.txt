I see. So, because a dictionary defines a word, it defines the essence of a political ideology? If that's all you have, then that is just about the single most flimsy argument I have ever heard.  Heck, if all we needed were a dictionary to describe complex philosophies or political movements, we wouldn't need encyclopedias or discourse at all.

The fact is that there are too many loud voices in modern feminism that actively promote hatred towards men to allow feminism any continued legitimacy as an equal rights movement. It has become more of a more rights for women, regardless the cost to others movement.

Your assertion is demonstrably anemic.
