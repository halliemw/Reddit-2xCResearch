That is an absolute shit situation to be in, not because of the period but because of the way a nurse, a medical professional handled it.

I had open heart surgery 4 months after an already brutal double lung transplant. 24 hours after I wake up, I start my period (with a foley cath as well!). This is where our stories differ a bit, it was August, they didn't have air conditioning, they offered me the mesh panties (nonononononono) and instead the nurse suggested that she help me clean up (she got all the materials and I cleaned up as best I could having been cut in half) and then she got two thick towels, put them underneath me and just said "look, we'll change them often and i'll leave some towels here incase you need more and don't want to call for them". 

I'm sorry you got a crappy nurse, one who couldn't deal with a basic need like that without compassion. *hugs*
