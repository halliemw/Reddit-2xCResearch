Fair enough. While I agree the first article was awful, I haven't been terribly impressed by any of the replies either. Both "sides" have done a good job of not addressing each other's concerns. 

Call me when someone writes an article that both sides of the debate can find merit in. Until then everyone is pretty much shouting into the wind.
