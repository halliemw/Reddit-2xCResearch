I love this photo! Good luck with the LDR, I'm in one myself and we've been together a total of 5 years, 2.5 were long distance. It's difficult but so worth it. There are going to be a lot of ups and unfortunately a lot of downs too. Just be confident in your relationship and trust one another and it'll be great!
