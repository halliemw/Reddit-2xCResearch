Yes they can. "Ladies" is a perfectly appropriate term to describe a group of females of mixed ages. Using the term Lady can be attributed to the way you act. "Act like a Lady" as in don't chew with your mouth open or sit with your legs open in a dress...have manners. So "All you ladies can follow me to your table" is a perfectly appropriate way to address them.
