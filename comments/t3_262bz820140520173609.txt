Yeah, it was really dumb. At first I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt and hoped she was just looking for a conversation starter. Then she did it again. They also seemed to purposely try to make her look 'girly' and superficial. All her stuff was pink and cupcakes. Now, I love pink and I bake like mad but if you're going to put that in then you need to balance it with other women that adhere to fewer stereotypes. I mean, at least once in a while. I expect no miracles from the show. There was the one woman who apparently makes things but we never saw that. 

I still don't really get the woman's role who seems to be an assistant to the eccentric billionaire but also seems to be pied piper's assistant. But they have that other guy who seems to be an assistant? 

P.S. I have a problem remembering character names and tend to just make up names based on their traits : /
