Yeah, I agree with your first point.

There's a video on the front page right now that's blowin up about this (boys doing poorly in school).

Interesting that it makes it there so quickly and this article, on a female-positive sub gets pretty much buried.  

I don't think this article is using the wage gap to detract from the issue of boys performing poorly in school, because I think they're very much related, and I think the article suggest that.  

Boys preforming poorly compared to girls in an environment where diligence, subservient and near mindless obedience and demureness is rewarded *is the same problem* as women preforming poorly (read: making less money) in an environment where competition, assertiveness/bossiness, and ambitiousness is rewarded- because sexism exists and enforces gender roles on males and females.  

The whole point of this article is that you can't equate girls doing better than boys in schools to doing better in the workplace eventually.  The problem is that the reaction to the information about boys preforming poorly in schools has largely been "must enforce more gender roles!" to fix the issue as evidenced by that video that's blowin' up.  I think the article's reactionary in that it's trying to say "that's not true!", but I don't think it's detracting from either issue to suggest a solution that will fix both.
