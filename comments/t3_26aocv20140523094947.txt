I'm 5 years older and moved a state away for college. I thought about just giving her a lot of money for shoes or a car whatever she wanted but I don't want to just give her sympathy money. I have not done anything with her for 3 years now and I feel really bad for neglecting her. I now have the time and money to make something happen.
