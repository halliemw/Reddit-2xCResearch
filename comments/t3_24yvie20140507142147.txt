That's a good idea, to file a report. Make sure you chase it up as many of these reports tend to get brushed aside by the authorities. If you have a change of heart, it may well be worth talking to your family about it, though I understand if that would be embarrassing.

On an unrelated note, why are you getting so many downvotes? :/
