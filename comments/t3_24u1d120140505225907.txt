I feel like I have nothing interesting to contribute a lot of the time. The "what are you up to" question is one that I can, really, only answer with "Oh, you know, taking care of the boy, housework... not a lot, really".  
  
Like you, I'm a SAHM. I hopefully will get to resign in September or October.
