>  I always feel like the other woman, like I'm wearing someone else's shoes, and that just makes me miserable. 

PS. This *is* a weird way of thinking, by the way. To me, if two people split up, then they are free persons again. Persons who can then start loving someone else with all of their hearts. True, they will have memories of the previous relationship. But aren't we all shaped by our past? He is shaped by his past (which includes a previous relationship) and you are shaped by yours. 

By your reasoning, if you break up with this guy and then start dating someone else, he should also see you as second-hand and "stained" by the previous relationship. While in reality, you would still be you, and perhaps better aware of what you want and need from a relationship and what you can offer someone else. 

Some of this may be taught to you by your religion, but I would ask you to reconsider. Is he truly tainted because he has loved someone else before?
