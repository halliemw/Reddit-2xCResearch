Yes.  You still need to have annual exams and PAPs as determined by your OB/doctor.  

HPV is one of many things they check for.  They're looking at the overall health of your vagina and cervix, they're checking for infections and things that don't look right, they're making sure you're healthy.

In the past few years it's changed so that most docs won't do a PAP every year.  Most do every other year, or every 3 years, depending on your family/personal history.  However, they *will* still do a basic exam to make sure you're healthy.  

Nobody really enjoys these, but they're quick and necessary.  Find a doctor you feel comfortable with and go for it.  WAY, way better to be safe and deal with the 5 minutes of "ugh I hate this" than let some silent infection rage on in your lady parts.
