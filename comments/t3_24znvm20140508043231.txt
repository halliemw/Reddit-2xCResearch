Looking around it seems like almost all the new default subs don't like the new change. And for pretty good reasons, getting defaulted generally doesn't improve the submissions and posts within a sub.

I think /r/twoXChromosomes is a bit more of a special case though. For example /r/personalfinance, /r/fitness, /r/television, /r/listentothis etc are pretty general subs that can be applicable for everyone. 

/r/twoXChromosomes is a bit more specific. When I saw it in the blog post i thought straight away that it was an odd choice and this change was probably going to end poorly. 

It's not that i think there's anything wrong with twoX or the type of posts here. But it is the kind of thing that can attract trolls that come with the "honor" of being a default sub. Though now that i think of it "I need to lose weight" type posts in /r/fitness are going to attract the trolls too.
