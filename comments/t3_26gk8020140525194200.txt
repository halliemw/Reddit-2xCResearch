Yeah, well, in the places where we are, it's illegal to attempt to fuck a 14 year old. I'm sure there is some other law elsewhere, but that doesn't make it okay in my eyes. 

The laws of my country are not arbitrary. They are in line with the kind of culture I want to live in. 

Living where people get their hands chopped off for shoplifting and you get lashed for not being Approved Religion and all sorts of hideous discrimination is legal doesn't sound appealing to me. That's why I live where ya can't rape kids. That and we have better roads. And sanitary water. And schools. And burgers, the burgers are good here....
