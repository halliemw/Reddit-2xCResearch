That is exactly what i got from OP's post. It sounds like the woman just said that as sort of joke, to, as you say start a conversation. The man just seemed to give a sort of "Well actually..." to her and the reason he didn't reply was most likely because he said to himself "I'm at a graduation party and this person is trying to start an argument with me I need to get away from here ASAP".
