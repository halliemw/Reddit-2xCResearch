Surprising. Would like to read the actual data. In the medical field the word "abortion" is used to describe all pregnancies that end before 20 weeks. Then clarify spontaneous vs. Elective. If the author failed to take that into account 33% of pregnancies ending in abortion wouldn't be surprising at all.
