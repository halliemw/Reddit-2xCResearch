Depends on your friends, but in my observations of friends and feeling of people general e.g. In workplaces, most don't react well to pre considered criticism no matter how warranted.

You can get away to some extent if you frame it in the positive I.e. ' I've really enjoyed hanging out with you, but I have found it harder recently because of...       ..  Is something up? 

This comes from the positive before the negative, and reaches out to engage to discuss
(This may be people manager speak, rather than friend speak, but applicable I think!)
