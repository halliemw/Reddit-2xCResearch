Hm.. I'm not sure I understand your point.

To clarify, I was saying that if the term was "fanperson", this shirt would probably not be sexist.  I was suggesting a way that sexism differs at least slightly from racism, in that it is typically more culturally acceptable to refer to people in gendered terms ("policewoman", "fanboy") than in racialized ones.  This cultural practice is, however, in itself problematic, because it means that if you want to express your opinion about (e.g.) fanpeople in general, you now also have to pick a gender for the term or use something cumbersome like "fanboys and fangirls".
