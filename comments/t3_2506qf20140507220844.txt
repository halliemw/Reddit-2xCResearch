I actually think counting calories is far safer than "moderation." I mean, I see what you are saying, but I just think that "moderation" without explicit quantification is far more likely to lead to excessive moderation (i.e. anorexia) than **measured** moderation.

The focus, the way I see it, should be on **measuring**, not on formulating diets. I.e., give a man a thermometer - he is much less likely to burn himself than if you just tell him "Be careful about touching this (potentially hot) water."
