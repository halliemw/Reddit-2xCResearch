I can give you the perfect advice on how "not" to start a book club. My friends and I attempted to do this last year and we went about it in completely the wrong way. It was called "The Plastered Bastards Book Club" and as you can imagine it was about getting intoxicated and talking about the afore-mentioned book. It was, needless to say, a disaster. The majority of us each had the guts of a half-bottle (35cl) of vodka before arriving at the destination (a bar) and we ended up picking the loudest area of the pub, the smoking area, to hold our "club meeting". We ended up talking complete shit for the majority of the night, with one person eventually setting fire to their copy of the novel (fifty shades of grey). This was the only nod to the book the whole night.
