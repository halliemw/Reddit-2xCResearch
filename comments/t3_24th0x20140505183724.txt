the way your SO comes across is like he himself has a problem with establishing boundaries and seems that in his mind it's OK for a man to sexually attack someone if they were 'led on' (which you may or may not have done, this is beside the point totally). 

Also, apparently he thinks it's your fault somehow that there is a crazy guy at your school who after seeing you 4 times formed some sort of attachment.

I would not want to be with such a man, as I would know he would not have my back when needed but just blame me for other people's decisions.
