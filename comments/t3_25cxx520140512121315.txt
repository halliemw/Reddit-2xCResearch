Oh I feel you. I have resting bitch face in a MAJOR way. I'll be in a perfectly fine mood, enjoying the day, watching the scenery, and get that condescending "SMILE! You're too pretty to be so angry"! It's ALWAYS an older man too. ALWAYS.

Fuck you, you fucking fuck. I WAS feeling just fine, but now you've gone and made me feel inadequate. Guess what? I'm not here to decorate your fucking world.
