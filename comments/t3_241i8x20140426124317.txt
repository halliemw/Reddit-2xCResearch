In the women's shelters I've seen and been to, they usually offer therapy or have access to low income services. Look into it if you haven't already. Try to stop before you break up with him and belittle him, just walking away would be better. Realize what you're doing is irrational, and remember that EVERTIME you think he is cheating. I personally think this is a result of your depression, I've been in almost this exact situation before. I want to help you but I really can't think of anything more to say besides get therapy.
