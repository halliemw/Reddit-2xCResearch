Seeing as you're both older feminists, I'd like to ask if my following thought makes any sense: many of the radical, tumblr feminists these days seem to be white, college-educated/college-tracked women. The wage gap has lessened, abortion is legal and relatively easy to obtain, the choice of a career over staying at home is respected and the men around them are likely more educated in gender equality themselves. Is the online bitching the only thing they have left? Many of the things prior generations of feminists fought for have been achieved, and to them the 'creeper' who makes eye contact on the train or men on the internet who try to talk about feminism are the big issues in their daily lives?
