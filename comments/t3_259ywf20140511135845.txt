Yes! Please call the bride and check. She might have been rude, but it seems highly likely that something happened to your invite. I'm getting married soon and I've definitely gotten a couple of messages to the effect of "Hey, I got the save the date, and the bachelorette party invite... but no wedding invite?" And then I realize that it got sent out, but never arrived at it's destination!
