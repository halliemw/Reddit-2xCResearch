My SO and I met 11 years ago. We dated for 5 years, broke up, did the fwb thing for a few years, dated, broke up, and were in a no contact status for about four months last summer. We got back together about a year ago, and are committed to working out being together, whatever that ends up meaning. He is the most amazing man I've ever met, and we've both grown so much in the last decade. We are finally ready to do this life thing together.
