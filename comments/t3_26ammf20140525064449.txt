Apologies for delay in reply.

Under the circumstances, and given the serious nature of the incident, expulsion (and possibly police prosecution) may well be the course of action. I don't presume to know enough about the man's LD's to say what his level of understanding is with regards to his actions/response to the OP. My post was simply to say that the OP should not hesitate to inform the authorities.

Hopefully then, with a fuller understanding of the man's condition taken into account by the authorities, appropriate action would be taken .
