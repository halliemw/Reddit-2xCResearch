In generel I would say, that if I'm outnumbered I feel uncomfortable. And things that wouldn't bother me if it happened during the day, might make me feel uncomfortable during the night. Thinking about your "You're beautiful" example, if it was just one man and it happened in the day I would just say Thanks. If it happened in the night, I'd probably be a little worried, though not harassed.
For me to feel harassed, it would have to be sexual or somehow insulting.
