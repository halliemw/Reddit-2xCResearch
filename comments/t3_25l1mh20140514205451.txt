A colposcopy is just an in depth magnified look at your cervix.  It should be no more comfortable than a pelvic exam with a speculum.  Often, if it is done after an abnormal Pap test, there might be a biopsy, which can sting/hurt, but nothing bad.

Ultrasounds do not hurt, but transvaginal ones are very awkward.
