To be clear, I expected people to understand the phrase "comes across as" to mean "is perceived by me as" - I believe they are synonymous.

You are quite right, I am talking about my perception.  OP specifically asked for an "insight into other people's perspective" - again, synonymous with perception, I believe.  Sorry if I didn't make that distinction clear.

I absolutely agree with you that the concept of feminism, when defined as equality for women is simply the right way to do things. Personally, I find it absurd, that we should even have to explain that concept to people, when it should just be the natural disposition.  However, that is not the way the world is, and IME, some people who claim to be feminists exhibit bias towards women..  Like it or not, that is how I perceive feminism in *practice* not *concept*  I am not saying it is a good thing or the right thing, or that I agree that that is what feminism *really* is.

Nonetheless, discussing rights in terms of equality is not open to abuse by OP's "all sex is rape" crowd.  Feminism is about "women's" rights, not about "people's" rights.  I do not make any such distinction.  I think all *people* have equal rights.  I do not see women as some inferior subset of humanity who need special protection.  All humans are equal, and have the same rights in my eyes.  The issue of gender in relation to such things as pregnancy and abortion is not part of the equation.  I'll avoid bringing that debate up, but my opinion on abortion, for example, applies equally to all humans, even if the lack of uterus makes it irrelevant to some.
