I understand that, but maybe her father wasn't sure what her biking needs are when he suggested a girl's bike would be better, and choosing a bike based on feeling like she wants to prove that she can ride it is immature and reactionary. In this case, it's a bike, who cares, she'll be fine, but this is an unhealthy decision making pattern and I don't think we should be congratulating OP on "beating sexism" by using terrible decision-making skills. I also never thought I'd be riding a bike in a skirt when I went to college, but around my junior year that changed because I had more professional events and a bike was the quickest way around campus. Considering whether she might want to use the bike for transportation and not just exercise at some point would be a good idea.
