And I think this is really critical. I would say that one annoyed person in a cultural vacuum is much less likely to send rape threats and attempt to hack bank accounts than a group of annoyed people (even if a tiny, tiny fraction of the overall community) riling each other up and convincing each other that they're right.

The internet's made possible many great things, but one of the nasty things it's made possible is allowing hateful people to connect with each other and reinforce each others' hate. We'll never be able to stop this from happening completely, with places like 4chan being a perpetual breeding ground, but we shouldn't stop trying to find ways to prevent this from happening on more legitimate sites.
