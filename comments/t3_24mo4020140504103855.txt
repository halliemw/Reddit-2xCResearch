My therapist has told me the same and the thing is, there is just no talking to my dad. He is a narcissist. To him his behavior is justified and perfectly acceptable when we're "being stupid". He's a man who's had a hard life and because of that he believes he can act however he wants. You could have an entire room of people tell him he's one way but he'd just get butthurt and say you're all attacking him and we're stupid and crazy (I know this from experience). He's the most stubborn person I've ever met and me and everyone around him has given up on trying to change him.
