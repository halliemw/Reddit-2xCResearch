I'm curious, because this is how I react to death, has he experienced a lot of death in his life, or lost anyone really close?

I joke about death now. Losing someone super close is extremely difficult and there are fewer than 10 in my life, so I have a lot of upcoming shit grief to deal with in the next 50 years.  That being said, I have already lost some of the most important and influential people in my life, including my parents, so I don't see death as fearfully as I used to. I embrace their legacy and try to do what I know they would want me to do. In this case, if it were me, I know my grandmother hated working and would absolutely tell me to take the day off whenever I can. Enjoy your life, don't get caught up with the small things. This is not a big deal and had you just taken the day off, you would have spent it together and had a wonderful day. You might be a little jealous that he had off and you didn't. Just maybe.
