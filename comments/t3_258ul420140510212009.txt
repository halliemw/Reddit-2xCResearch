In middle school health at a conservative suburban school, we had a "guest speaker" from one of those agencies that is all about abstinence come in to talk about sex.  

We had all the following metaphor activities:

* cups of clear liquid mixed with other people's, add indicator an the pink ones have STDs
* clear packing tape on student's arms and then when two people want to get married, they don't stick
* folding paper charts that show when guys can still say no to sex due to "biological urges" vs. girls
* personal anecdotes about getting bad reputations
* THE BEST ONE- There was an analogy about a fish tank being the boundaries the goldfish set for itself.  The speaker took it out and had it flop around to show you what your life would be like without boundaries, but the speaker accidentally killed it.  Oops.

Oh, and there were mints that said "Sex is mint for marriage" on the wrapper.
