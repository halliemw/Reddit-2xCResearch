You're right, in a sense. And then they faded out, and faded back in, but they weren't really popular until they exploded in pop culture and became (and remained) just as much of a fad as the side shave or bobs or what have you. In some ways dreads also have a practical purpose as a hairstyle. But they still interfere with headgear, and they're still usually used as trendy fashion statement. Unlike banning cornrows (which, assuming you don't keep them so long that they break the pre-established code, should be fine) banning dreadlocks makes a lot of sense.
