True, but combine "we can't afford kids" with wanting an abortion in the past and there's a decent chance that he's favoring abortion again. Hopefully he's just a little freaked out and meant, "We can't afford a baby living like this so I'm going to take a good look at our finances to figure this out." We won't know unless they have a direct talk about it.
