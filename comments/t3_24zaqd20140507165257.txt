I can't comment on a possible allergy, but I have para guard, and I've always been pretty regular. My cycles were all over the place, I went up to 32 days, then 36, then 48 days between cycles. Then back down to 30 and 29. No idea why they were all over the place, but I'm blaming it on the para guard.
