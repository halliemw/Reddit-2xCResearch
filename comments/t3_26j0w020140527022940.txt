What in tarnation is mansplaining anyway? Maybe I'm in the right places so I've never seen it or I just see no evil, hear no evil, and I try to do no evil since I just talk to everyone on an even level -- yeah, I tone it down if the other person isn't up to speed, but in the absence of real evil it feels like another catchword to discount an honest two cents.
