What you're saying is false for all practical purposes.

Federal law defacto prohibits description on marital status through Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 1964 prohibitions on discrimination based on sex and pregnancy, as interpreted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  

Many states expressly prohibit discrimination on marital status.  

Because the courts and the EEOC and state fair employment practices agencies which enforce these laws *aren't psychic*, they determine the evidence of discrimination based on a protected category by the employers statements and conduct.

Asking for marital status in a pre-employment interview is interpreted by the EEOC as betraying the intent to discriminate.

It is in effect a prohibited practice even though it isn't specifically listed in title VII (though it may be in some state laws).  

>And FYI, the reasoning behind asking marital status is because a young married woman is more likely to get pregnant and ask for time off of work to raise kids. As unfair as that is, it was probably the line of thought behind asking. Women are also more likely to pick up and leave to follow their husband to his job. (I don't agree with these things but that might offer insight into why they would ask).

Yes this is **exactly why its illegal**.  Precisely this sort of sex and pregnancy discrimination is what Title VII prohibits.  


The OP should absolutely lodge a complaint with the EEOC and their state FEPA.  Let them investigate it.
