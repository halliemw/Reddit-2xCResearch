I would respond in the same way. To a certain extent, then, there is this notion that the "normal" state of a society has some number of these particular crimes happening within it. So, how do we make sense out of that notion? What aspects of sexual violence do we determine as normal (type of violence, quantity/frequency, kind-of-perpetrator, kind-of-victim, etc)? I see this complication as being part of any crime, not just sexual violence. I think there is a difference, however, in the way that each crime is treated in society's dominant discourse and practice. That's what I think this article is trying to get at, the *way* that sexually violent crimes are expected to be in dominant thought.
