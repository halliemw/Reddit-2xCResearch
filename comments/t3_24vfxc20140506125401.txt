I prefer less body hair than most women. It's just my thing. To each their own. I wanted to chime in because every other woman posting here said they love it, and not all women agree with that. The man I'm dating now has body hair (which is good) but it's fine and not as voluminous as many of the men I've dated. I'm very happy with it.
