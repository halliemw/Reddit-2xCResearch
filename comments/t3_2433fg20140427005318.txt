Fucking CAR SHOPPING. I will walk out of a dealership when the saleperson keeps addressing everything to my husband instead of me. It was for my own car, not his, and he was trying to demur to me, but the salesperson was having none of that. Happened more than once.

Eventually I found someone who treated *me* as the customer. And sold me the car for less than the other dudes!
