I don't personally consider the question answerable.

The question suggests (actually, states) that there should be some officially-defined "line in the sand" condition, and because there aren't facts and numbers available to measure here, I don't see how that could be possible.  

There are users on both sides of the issue, and it's not a black and white situation.
