> I don't see this as "victim blaming", more of just common sense. Don't put yourself in situations where you are highly likely to be raped to begin with.

That is exactly what victim blaming is. The onus of not getting raped shouldn't be placed on Natalie. You're excusing Jim's actions by saying that it's her fault for being in that situation. Stop telling people to avoid rape, and start telling people NOT to rape.
