Exactly, thanks for understanding! I spend 40 hours here every week, so that's why this is getting to me. I'm "friends" with all the guys but they're usually here for maybe 50% of the time. I'm being my natural friendly, nice self, but still doing my job, which is what they all are to each other (except for me). I do like the job so I will keep holding on.
