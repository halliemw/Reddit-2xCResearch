I'm on my Mobil so I can't update easily. But I talked to Pam and I know  will get paid at least a little more at her store. But I would be managing a bunch of women  twice my age. Its not that I'm uncomfortable doing so but I know there will be challenges getting them to recognize any authority I would have. Honestly, same goes with the clients. They are primary women twice my age and twice my body weight. I am concerned they will be less interested in getting service from me than  someone who can relate to them more. And I know this will make me sound bad... But The company makes clothes in my size too which I would be expected to wear to work. I hate the merchandise. I hope I don't wear that style until I'm older than my mother. My grandmother doesn't usually like their clothes even. Its very frumpy and matronly. I would feel unattractive. I know how shallow that is, but I like feeling pretty at work. I like looking trendy (for once, because I'm typically not very stylish). I like not feeling like I'm wearing a uniform. Which I know is how other job's dress code would feel to me. I agreed to do an interview with the district manager Tuesday. We'll see how it goes.
