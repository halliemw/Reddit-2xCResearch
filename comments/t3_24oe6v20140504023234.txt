I have a career (that requires ~8-10 weeks of travel/year, a kid, a supportive (working) husband (whose job also requires occasional travel), a full-time nanny/housekeeper (I am an American expat, living overseas, where this is common), and plans for kid #2.

No family nearby, since we live overseas.

We didn't hire the nanny/housekeeper until my son was 3; yes, it was hard work. We did hire a part-time cleaner -- in the US, we had one who came twice a month; when we moved overseas, we upgraded to twice a week.

I am a huge fan of outsourcing menial labor jobs. It's good for the economy, and good for your sanity. Occasional cleaning at least should be in reach for most dual-career families -- we hired a cleaner twice per month when we were both grad students paying for daycare. The more menial labor you can outsource, the more time/sanity you'll have for your kids/spouse/job.
