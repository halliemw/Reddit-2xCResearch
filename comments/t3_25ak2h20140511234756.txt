Personally I think for your daughter it is better to know her father, even though he will disappoint her a few more times. I would try to keep him in her life, even though it might mean that *you* will also be disappointed several more times and will have to change your plans too when he doesn't show up. 

I have no personal experience with this, but it seems that children are always curious what both of their parents are like. Having some kind of relationship with her father might be better than a mysterious father who she doesn't remember.
