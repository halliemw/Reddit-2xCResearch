Well, never had kids, but periods are generally not fun.

For me I get like 2 days of mild weird moods as PMS and then the actual period. Imagine a feeling like mild lower-gut upset. There's some cramping, there's some bloating, there's some blood and mucous, but Yay! I'm not pregnant! 

Wearing pads feels like wearing a diaper to me (I imagine - having not work a diaper in memory). Tampons and cups feel like nothing, unless I have the wrong absorbency tampon.

Now ovulation on the other hand - there I sometimes get anti-PMS. Really high energy and the conviction that I am awesome, and everything is awesome, and I'm gonna go do everything right now!
