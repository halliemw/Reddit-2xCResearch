She was 15 and lorded over our dogs with poise and grace and an iron paw. She used to sit on the arm of the chair and swat at them as they walked by just to remind them not to get any ideas above their station. 

She was also a fearsome hunter as a kitten too. When she was a few months old she came home with this huge blue jay, which are quite fierce if you're not familiar with them. She also hunted a banana once when we first brought her home; she was only a few pounds but she jumped on the counter and stole it and dragged it through the house between her legs because it was like 50% longer than her. Such a cold-blooded, brave warrior.

She was a good cat and I will certainly not forget her. I don't think any of us will, especially once the house falls into pandemonium without her leadership.
