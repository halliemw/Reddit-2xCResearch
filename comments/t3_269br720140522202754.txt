Thanks.  That's why I started talking about it in college actually.  It really bothered me that not one person anywhere could name a guy who had been raped.  And I realized there must be a ton of men that didn't know it was 1 in 6 of us, so I decided I had to tell them.

I think I'm going to do an AMA as a man that was kidnapped and raped as a child.  What would be the best place for that?
