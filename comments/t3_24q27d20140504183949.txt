I also work in an *extremely* male dominated field, but my SO would never ever say I shouldn't have male friends because he knows that that's just a cruel and isolating idea. There is never any good reason to stop someone being friends with their coworkers like this. It's not only bad for your social life, it's really bad for your career too.

If I were you I would try to make amends with your coworkers and talk to your SO about his jealousy issues. I don't see why you should feel pressure to be 'girly' when you aren't really interested in that sort of thing, it isn't fair on you. It's cool to try to make female friends, but I feel like that will never work if you're doing so under pressure from your BF.
