It's both, really. There have been some really well-written strong female characters in *some* recent anime: Mikasa Ackerman from Shingeki no Kyojin (the most skilled, athletic, determined, and unemotional character in the show), Misaka Mikoto from To Aru Kagaku no Railgun (an electricity-based Superman who kicks all kinds of ass), Makise Kurisu from Steins;Gate (an accomplished scientist and the main voice of reason in a somewhat-demented ensemble), the whole cast of Madoka Magica (minus Nagisa, who was really only created to be cute), to name a few off the top of my head.

On the other hand, the concept of *moe* is almost *literally* based around bringing the objectification of females to an exact science, and harem and *moe* anime show no signs of losing popularity. Overall, I'd say the anime industry is still intensely sexist, to an extent far beyond the Western entertainment and video gaming industries.
