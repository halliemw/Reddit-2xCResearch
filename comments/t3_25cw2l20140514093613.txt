Learning Spanish is never a waste of time so don't worry about that.. You just gotta give yourself time to heal right now. Jumping into a relationship now will probably only end in heartache.. It took me months maybe even a year to get completely over my ex.. I spent time with the people who really mattered like my family and best friend and focused on all the things I was free to do now that I didn't have anyone holding me back.. I flirted with guys, danced with my friends, took vacations with my family and occasionally I'd miss him and cry. What I realize now is I didn't actually miss him!! I missed being in a relationship! Time will help you heal so you can move on and when you're ready the right one will come along.. One thing to keep in mind.. I went on my first ever blind date when I met my current boyfriend- he had never been on a blind date either.. Sometimes you have to do things a little differently to get a different result than you're used to :) once you're over him just put yourself out there and watch for red flags! Take things slow so you don't get attached to someone you shouldn't trust. Good luck :)
