sadly, I can confirm this.  Their manufacturing quality control is not up to par imo.  We have the spinning machine.  It worked ok in the main configuration, but the tight holes in the spindles were not nearly tight enough on the sticks, and in most of the more creative ideas in the book, and some of my original ideas it just wouldn't hold together.  With two young daughters I wanted to love Goldie Blox so badly and I'm sad to say it's rubbish and sits alone unused.

RIP Benjamin Cranklin.

Very cute pic OP.
