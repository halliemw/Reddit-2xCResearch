One thing I did suggest (which was ultimately ignored) was that people could bring their art and keep it in a closed folder. They would then write out on the folder what the art depicted (i.e., "this is a page from my zombie comic. It shows people bludgeoning zombies with baseball bats."). Then people could choose whether or not they wanted to look in the folder. I think that giving people a choice instead of "forcing" them to look at something that might upset them or act as a trigger for them is the better option.
The only "ban" I'm really in favor of is anything that is hateful...which some of D's art is, as it glorifies and fetishizes violence against women.
