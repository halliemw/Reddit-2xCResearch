NO! They really don't make the Victorian house any more? I was an avid Playmobil collector as a kid, but was just too old for the house by the time they released it. 

Now I have my own kid and I'd say my desire to become a parent was around 95 per cent motivated by the fact I'd finally have a legit reason to get my damn Playmobil mansion.
