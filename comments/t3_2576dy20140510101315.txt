THere are different forms of genital mutilation for both sexes, some very minor that don't remove anything from the genitalia ("nicking"), some very severe (infibulation)

You can't make such broad statements about what FGM is, and what you say about pleasure isn't true either .

>The group of 137 women, affected by different types of FGM/C, reported orgasm in almost 86%, always 69.23%; 58 mutilated young women reported orgasm in 91.43%, always 8.57%

Does that make it OK? **NO** and that is why  the Western anti-FGM discourse is not a good approach in my view, it does not reflect the reality the women affected by it live every day just like many guys here don't understand and get defensive when you tell them their penis is damaged/incomplete. Most female circumcisions are carried out by other women, often from the little girl's family, and they do not see the harm in it. That is the core of the problem.
