I don't owe anyone here anything. If an OP asks for ideas I will give mine. I'm sorry I don't fit a mold of complaining for no reason about anything and the others that agree said behavior is okay. It isn't, it doesn't add anything to society. I have a few feminists in the house that have read the crap on here and agree that it's bullshit. I wasn't judging or being mean before but now you opened the doors.

I'd also like to add only 2 or 3 threads I'm in have negative karma in this sub so obviously some people agree with me.
