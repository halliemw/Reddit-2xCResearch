>And we, as women, need to stop shaming each other for how we react to abusers and harassers.

Totally this. I was even a little taken aback at how preachy this article sounded. Why isn't this an article directed at men who don't take "no" for an answer when a girl says she's not available? If a guy doesn't understand that I have a boyfriend that is not my problem, that is his. If he doesn't take this as an answer, then I can move onto the other, firmer approaches, but in my experience a lot of guys will back off.
