Personally, I don't think there's anything I could enjoy so much that I would give someone my business to be treated like that. I really don't think I could do it, that sounds horrible. I guess your only sure fire option that you could keep going to the class would be to just take it. There's definitely no one else in your area you could learn from? Where is she operating these classes, could you complain to the owners of the facilities you're using?
