> ~~Some~~ *Most* female jobs are lower paid.

FTFY. Do some statistics research. You seem to have missed the point where I was questioning the low value placed on activities which have the most impact on our over-all well-being as a society. 

> Do you think group of women don't do the same? 

No, I don't. Women are very unlikely to stand around in groups catcalling random strange men walking down the street. If this is happening with any regularity, then it's a *very* new phenomenon.

> I ask as its only men who are creep shamed for even simply glancing at a woman, as how dare he set his eyes on her. 

That's bullshit. Men are not "creep shamed" for simply glancing, they're creep shamed for being creepy. 

>  As our population in western nations is uh heading towards declining.

Again, do some statistics research. Maybe you could [start here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vahQwO6iHpE).
