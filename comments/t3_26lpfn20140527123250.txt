I think you need to break the connection between your self worth and work. Your value as a person isn't determined by your schedule or earnings. (That's what it sounds like you're saying to me)
I've had this issue and am still working on it- Even when I was working full time, and completely independent, I still felt lazy/ useless.
I think it's depression that's making you feel this way more than your situation. I think talk to a therapist to unravel all these family and self worth issues.
