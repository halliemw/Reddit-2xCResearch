I found the English info before you, thank you very much. Thing is, in most parts of the world women earn less because it's damn easier to exploit people who traditionally stick with children and have fewer opportunities to earn money. Netherlands' experience is special and can not be applied to, say, US or my country, not to mention that caring for the next generation of citizens is a damn important and unpaid job so it's not like all of your women are "slackers", they just assume the "traditional" role.


Not to mention this:


>I am from a country where people are screaming murder and fire about the fact that women earn less in a month or a year then men.


>Yet the modest working hours of many women have increasingly come to be seen as a problem in recent years, **especially by the Dutch government**. Part-time working also has disadvantages, not just for the careers and economic independence of the women concerned, but also for the Dutch economy as a whole and for the sustainability of the welfare state.


Sounds different, ain't it? Anyway, working less hours and earning less has nothing to do with the initial topic. If you'd care to watch the video provided by OP, it was about women earning less for the same amount of work as a man (as is, per hour). And people in the comments proceed to blame women and minorities for not wanting responsibilities. Than you barge in with "Most of the time it has to do that in a lot of area's woman want the same pay but want work less hours".
