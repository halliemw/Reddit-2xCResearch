I know plenty about Islam and I'm aware there is a wide spectrum of extremism and moderation. At it's most liberal, I have very few issues with it (other than the lack of scientific rigour). However, let us be honest that mainstream Islam, lying between the two poles, tends to be rather patriarchal and conservative. Believing that a woman needs to cover the vast majority of her body for "modesty", with much lower standards for men, is inegalitarian.
