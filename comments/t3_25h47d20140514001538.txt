Don't project your strawmen on me. Instead of summarizing my words into stuff I never said, quote me and let the quote speak for itself. 
I used both "I am not interested" as a normal general answer and "no, sorry" which happens when you get asked "hey, can I talk to you?/buy you a drink" which is a common bar approach. Only you combined them into that forced exchange. 

First of all, your response is highly unlikely if you actually approached the woman in a polite way. By far, as a woman **I am afraid of anything that provoking because it might get me with an angry male in my face and I can't handle that**. By far what I have used was "sorry, I am not interested".  See above.

> that would be incredibly rude

Second of all, it's nice that you assume the men are owed a polite response no matter what the context. Let's say I am on my way to work, I am on my headphones. A guy walks up to me and this exchange happens. Do you not see it how rude it is in the first place to assume this woman busy doing her own thing must now take her time to listen and to respond to your sexual advances? I have been in this situation many times and I still didn't use that short no, as again, **as a woman I am always aware how dangerous it is to piss of strange men.** but I didn't owe them shit, not even a polite no. Because I did not wanted to be approached and they didn 't bother to empathise with me at all. 

But let's look at it not as a male female thing. Countless busy people do their thing and sellers of crap bother them, beggars and so on. People respond in this curt way, or even plain ignore and look away on purpose. And people aren't even expected to dedicate the mental energy to refuse every person who may want something from you ( attention, money etc) because we all recognise that approaching random people is rude. Why? Because they are already bothering the person by asking. You don't have the right to go up to people and the right to be heard and the right to get any answer. It's not a Right. **You can certainly choose to do so, but you are not entitled to getting a polite answer regardless of context.** Is it rude period to approach people? Well it depends on context and social cues. **And this is regardless of gender.**

I expect people who approach strangers to first evaluate if they person is actually receptive to being approached. Are they looking at you, smiling on purpose? Are they making any sort of non verbal connection? Because if not and you are cold call approaching them you ARE doing them a small inconvenience. 

> it's not hard to say "sorry I'm not interested"

See it's infuriating shit like this that makes the women of this sub angry this became a default sub. The sheer lack of understanding towards women. The sheer lack of empathy. It's not hard to say? Are you fucking serious? What an ignorant comment. You know what? I'm not even going to bother explaining that. Why don't you go read through this sub about women's experiences and then try to say stupid shit like that.
