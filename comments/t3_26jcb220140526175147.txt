I would love to be involved. I can't open up my home however because I have children. But I am home all day and would be able to be a coordinator. I would be willing to help get non profit status. We could run background checks on potential hosts and guests. 

I'm also in deep Texas so I'm not sure where I could even help. I don't know where women go for abortion here because they have closed our clinics.
