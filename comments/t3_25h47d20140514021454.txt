Creep philosophy: 

When a woman makes decisions for her life she has no agency. She is just a creature led by emotions and sparky stuff and can only be superficial or deluded (aw how cute she thinks she is a gamer).

When a woman dates, she is a cold hearted,manipulative, calculating House of Cards level boss who deliberately acts to maximize her funds and power and who expertly lies and takes advantage of a guy. She will put down any desire for emotional needs and just act to get monetary and psychological POWERRRR.


Somehow these creatures are the same person
