I've had mine for almost a year now and absolutely love it. I got it in July, had a period in Aug, and aside from that, just minor spotting and some pretty weird spasms around the 9 month mark. No periods, no pain, just love... well, no love either, but if there WERE any lovin' going on, no unintended babies :p
