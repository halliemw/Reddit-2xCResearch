Your mom does nooooot understand how bra sizes work if she's having a cow over D being embarrassingly big or anything. Your new bra I think actually has smaller cups than your mom's 38 C does. 

You don't HAVE to tell her your new bra size. It's not like you're planning to marry the bra. Cut off the tags or scuff it off if it's printed on the bra itself. IF not telling her feels like the best option in your situation, don't feel guilt over it. 

If you do feel it's better to tell her, gather resources on how bra sizes actually work, in case it comes to that. But really the discussion should be focused on *why* it's something she reacted so emotionally to. 

Also, check out /r/ABraThatFits and enjoy being comfortable! Don't be ashamed of your size or feel like it's crazy just because it has the letter D. Because your band size is smaller, the cup is smaller than what people mistakenly believe D's look like.
