She is in treatment for the disorder. Yes she is remorseful and apologetic after the episodes. She is taking her issues seriously, and that is the reason that I stayed early on in our relationship when we were figuring out life. She wasn't diagnosed at that point and it became a little touch and go for a bit. 

I as well lived with a father and to add a brother both with untreated bipolar type 1. It is hell on earth. 

We have talked more in depth about her episodes this past weekend and things are improving. We are in the process of figuring out something better for me to do instead of leave and something good for her to do when she starts to feel an episode "coming on".
