Echoing what's been said here and adding a few more things. 

* Awareness of your surroundings from the people around you to escape routes is indispensable.
* A Taser can only be fired once; after that, you're left with a stun gun. Though the Taser is intended to disable and neutralize the target long enough to for you to run, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. You miss, the target is too close, etc. With a stun gun, it won't immobilize them as much as it will cause them pain, and probably piss them off that much more. Not to mention you'll have to be in close range to use a stun gun, which isn't optimal at all. 
* Concerning chemical sprays, its somewhat the same deal, depending on the type you've got. You've got to be somewhat close, then factor in wind direction/speed, since you definitely don't want that blowing back on you. 
* Don't put yourself in a situation where you are vulnerable. I'm not saying that it's at all excusable to be raped because of x behavior, but to a predator, it's not an excuse, it's a weakness to be exploited. From walking alone in unfavorable conditions (especially in heels so you can't run as fast, being distracted, etc.)
* That said, be able to defend yourself and run. Don't freeze, don't obey: if you get in that car because he threatens you with a gun, it's that much harder to find you or your dead body. Take classes, stay healthy, fit, and alert.
* Overall, with any self-defense item and or skill, it's useless unless you have it in hand and you're ready to use it and use it right, whether it be to cause pain, maim, or even kill (especially with guns). 

Personally, I know I'd forget some night or another to always carry around x thing, and have it charged and ready to go. So for me, classes and minimizing my risk are the way to go.

Due to a statistic floating around somewhere, that most people know their abusers/assault-ers, just be careful, even if s/he's your "new friend"; everyone's got their own agenda. 

**I'd like to reiterate that I do not think and or believe that victims are responsible for what abuse that takes place. The only thing we can *try* to control are the things that lead up to it and decrease the odds to be in our favor :)**
