Poor kid. I know how crippling it is when your parents call you out for being big. It fucked with my mental health, physical health, and confidence in a major way. She needs to get out of there ASAP. Keep calling CPS, maybe see if she can come and live with you now. Give her a small tape recorder so she can document the abuse. My heart goes out to you both.
