That's a good idea, except she already invited him. To tell him she doesn't want him to come now would probably make the situation worse. 

It might be best to ask a friend or close relative to come along as well, perhaps to even talk to him about it, let him feel more comfortable with it, and show how others are supporting her. It might also stop him from bringing up any negative thoughts that could be running through his mind while he waits.

If he decides not to go, then she has a backup without too many hard feelings on the subject.
