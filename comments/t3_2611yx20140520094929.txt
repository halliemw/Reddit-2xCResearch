I wouldn't jump to the conclusion of them not liking you yet. You're new. 2 months is nothing, especially if they have been working together for years, and especially if they have seen a few people come and go. Being nice doesn't automatically justify friendship status, which it sounds like they have. It's just the stepping stone. Time is what builds stronger relationships. To be honest though, they don't sound like the nicest people either.
