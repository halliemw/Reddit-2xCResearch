My gyn had me come in while on my period (cervix is dilated) and full of prescription strength ibuprofen. I've never had kids, I've never been pregnant, and I've never had anything stuck inside my uterus before. I got Paragard at the beginning of my 20th year, no questions asked outside of "so why do you want to switch from pills?"

If there's no way in hell they'll do it for you, there's no way in hell they that they deserve your business.
