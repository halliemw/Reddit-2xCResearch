If it doesn't start feeling better on it's own in the next day or two, definitely see the eye doctor. Scratches in the cornea are not something to play around with!

I've poked myself in the eye with a mascara wand before, but never as bad as yours sounds--with mine, within a few hours I wouldn't feel anything and would have totally forgot it happened. So I would be concerned if I were you, but if it starts to improve on it's own, you are probably fine.

Also I saw you said you didn't have vision coverage--I would just call around different places to get price quotes, and make sure to mention that you don't have insurance and will be paying cash. They can often do cash discounts if you really have the money.
