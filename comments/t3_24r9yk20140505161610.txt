I have one of these good men. We were drinking (either when or right before we started dating) and suddenly he gets sortof serious. He tells me that he doesn't want me to get drunk bc he feels responsible for me, but if I do he'll make sure I'm safe. 

Also, it says a lot about a person who will trade meals with you if yours tastes bad! Wouldn't trade my husband for anything.
