Look, I don't mean to offend you about how you browse reddit. I think however you want to browse is fine. I'm just not that sympathetic or that overjoyed that you now have an entertainment place. To me it's just not worth the price of the trolls that we now have more appreciative and kind but fairly non-active members.
