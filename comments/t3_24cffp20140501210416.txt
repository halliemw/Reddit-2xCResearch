i might get shit for this, but you have to realize that for a large portion of the population, having biological children is a very important life goal and losing the ability to reproduce would be devastating. clearly that's not the case for you, but i don't think you should get frustrated with your friends for making the assumption you'd be upset. it's not that unreasonable. of course, that shouldn't be their *first* concern as you said.

anyway, i'm not trying to attack you, just point out that they probably don't have bad intentions. i'm so sorry you're going through this. having cancer is utterly exhausting. please try to find some sort of support group. being able to share things with people who understand your situation is invaluable. i'll keep you in my thoughts <3
