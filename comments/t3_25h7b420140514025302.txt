I say the worse bit is the ever more fervent fight against preventative measures in the United States. I don't even mean abortion but basic education and access to birth control to the poorer side of the tracks. A lot of states try to shut down Planned parenthood and try to do whatever they can to keep plan b pills from people (I'm talking about social issues as much as political). As much as I get idealism abstinence only doesn't work and neither does our current healthcare system. Okay well maybe it works in as much as donkey with a broken legs an carry your stuff with a broken leg it's dragging behind it as you slowly whip it to death.
