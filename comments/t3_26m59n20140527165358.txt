Wow! What a shitty situation. I would make your friend a new key, as it's totally fair for him to have one if she gets to have one.

That said, I think you are right in that it's probably too late to make a fuss of it now. I would probably just suck it up and ride out the next few months and just break the lease. I definitely think he is in the wrong here for doing that to his kids, but I guess when you're in love, you're in love.
