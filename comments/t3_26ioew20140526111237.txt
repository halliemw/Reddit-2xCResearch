Don't play beer pong for two hours before your regents history exam. Because if you're anything like me you're gonna write the instructions for chicken noodle soup on the essay part and you're going to fail. 


In my defense chicken noodle soup is fucking delicious when drunk.

Also, dont drink at all in highschool. You have the rest of your adult life to delve into it and meddle with the parties. The type of people you could possibly party with at age 16 will provide nothing constructive as you grow into more of an adult. Avoid the douchebags and if you feel like drinking do so with your circle of friends.
