If you go to a specilty sexual health clinic they generally have them on site, and you buy them from the clinic. But if you are having it done at your local doctors office, they can't be expected to just have a stock of them. Regardless of whether you bring it or your doctor orders it, if it gets contaminated you are going to have to re-book and get another one. If its the doctors fault that its contaminated then they send you off with a script that asks the pharmacy to bill the clinic so you are not out of pocket for a second one.
