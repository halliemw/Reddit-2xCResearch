I did read the original post, and I feel like you can't assume that everyone understands her point of view simply because you did. If fredy up there honestly didn't understand, why can't he/she simply ask for her to expand? She doesn't have to indulge him/her, but it's not hurting anyone. I can understand taking issue with the second half of his/her post because it seems judgmental, but I really do not see an issue with the question itself.

I think it may be time for the content guidelines for the sub to be rewritten. I read them and found no mention of this sub being debate-free nor only for women's voices and perspectives. In fact, it says right in the FAQ: "Anything relevant to the existence and/or experience of girlhood, from any perspective". The sidebar also says, "related to gender, and intended for women's perspectives." The judgemental part of fredy's post sucked, but I don't think the first half violated any of the subreddit guidelines as they are written.
