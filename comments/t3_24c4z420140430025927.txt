You know those thick long overnight ones Always has? On the normal/heavy days I wear two of those suckers at the same time to get more coverage. It's beyond awful. Have considered trying out a cup ,but I'm wary about it because I can hardly tampon so I'm uncertain a cup would agree with me.

I swear it either finds a way to spill out way up front or I'll end up with this weird random leak up towards the top of my butt out of nowhere. I just can't win.
