My two closest girl friends I have known since middle school. One woman is like my life mentor, but she isn't a "friend" so much as "adopted family". 

My advice is to start doing the things you want to do with people alone and get comfortable starting the party by yourself. People will gravitate to you if you create a presence: go to a wine tasting, talk to some people, get familiar with folks around your neighborhood. Expand your social circle in general and then keep an eye out for who sticks around.
