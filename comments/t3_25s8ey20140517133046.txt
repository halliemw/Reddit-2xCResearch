As someone with a pain condition often listed as one of the most painful conditions you can get diagnosed with (also sometimes MS related), the pain scale is a joke. You can't say anything higher than 10 because then you wont be taken seriously. People will go in with something like a UTI and say it is a 9 or 10. Yes, UTI's are painful, and it very well may be the most painful thing you have experienced. But my 9 or 10 can lead to suicidal thoughts because it is that unbearable, and if you (Fake UTI person) are using the same scale as your UTI, my pain would likely be much higher. And then you won't be taken seriously. 



Also, if your pain happens to be in your face, let me know!
