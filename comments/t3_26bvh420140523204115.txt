I am XY, and a computer programmer not a physicist, but I have an interest in the lack of women (and diversity in general) in my own field. A good start (at least, for tech in general) is via Ashe Dryden (see: http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/dissent-unheard-of and her twitter: https://twitter.com/ashedryden)  My advice would be to find as many men as you can to speak with you on this subject.  You mention young men doubting your aptitude, and the article talks about  Bernice Sandler counting how many times men interrupt women versus men interrupting other men.  Talk and advocate, but get men out there advocating, too, because unfortunately they will be more likely to get time to speak, and other men are more likely to listen.  There are lots of men who don't realize what they are doing, and won't realize it until another man points it out, but then can come around to a point where they are reasonable co-workers.

On another front, have you looked at the experiences of scientists who have transitioned, either male-to-female or vice-versa?  Looking at their lives gives an interesting before and after perspective.  There was an  excellent article by [Ben Barres](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/12/AR2006071201883.html) (a FtM neuro-biologist) a few years ago.

There is also the physicist [Angela Clayton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Clayton) and the computer scientist [Lynn Conway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Conway).
