My experience has been much closer to the article than it has to yours. I have had many of these things happen to me in uni or in the workplace. I have been asked about my plans to get married/have kids during interviews, I have been told that I'm there to make the place 'look pretty' , I've been told that I should just sit back and let the guys do the 'real work', I have had my contributions ignored and then accepted when a male coworker rephrased them and more. 

I know you probably didn't mean it that way, but when we talk about the difficulties women face in tech and someone insists 'the only thing that matters is what you can do', it's frustrating because it implies that all of the things we encounter are due to not being good enough when that is often far from true.
