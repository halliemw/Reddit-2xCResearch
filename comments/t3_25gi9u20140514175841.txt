I also think it's silly when people then try to justify their love of breasts as something evolutionary (sign of fertility, blah blah).  Out of 130 cultures, only 19 find breasts a sexual body part.  Most think it's strange/gross that people are attracted to something that is used to feed babies.  I mean, it's okay to be sexually turned on by breasts just like it's okay to be sexually turned on by any body part.  But it's largely influenced by culture.
