There are tons of reasons people use BC other then just as contraception. They will put people on BC to regulate their cycle, to help treat acne, to help prevent ovarian cysts, to lessen a heavy flow, or bad menstrual cramps. It may be deceptive to give your mom one of these reasons. That is up to you. But in my opinion, you are 18 and your sex life is your own business. So tell her whatever is easiest and comfortable for you.
