he could read at a college level.  our student handbook pretty clearly forbade using school computers for inappropriate purposes.  he knew that what he was doing was wrong, and the school did nothing but to pat him on the back for it.

to further clarify why i felt he was a creep before getting confirmation, i'd seen him acting shifty (looking over his shoulder a lot et cetera) when using the computers on multiple occasions before i actually caught him in the act.  as far as the personal space violations, all i can do is to tell you that he was putting off a seriously creepy vibe when he was doing so, and would move closer to me when i stepped away.  i tried limiting my interactions with him to simply helping him from behind the front desk, but he kept asking me to come out and help him with things like getting onto the internet and finding books on the shelves -- simple library tasks that he had repeatedly done for himself and by himself on past occasions. i  don't know how else i can clarify it for you.

i treated "normal" offenders in exactly the same manner, and if they didn't appreciate it, tough shit; they were the ones in the wrong.
