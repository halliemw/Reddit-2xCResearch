Yeast infections are a real problem for me. It goes back to when I was a baby and my mother wouldn't change my diapers for days at a time. I get bladder and yeast infections really easily now. I've learned that taking cranberry supplements for my urinary tract helps and garlic supplements for vaginal health. I also have a package of AZO Yeast on hand just in case I start to feel irritation. And lots of cotton underwear. Ugh. Last year I didn't have health insurance and it took two months and tons of boxes of Monistat to get rid of one yeast infection. So horrible.
