Some breasts are just more bumpy than others. I don't know if the pain you're feeling is typical. But I'd say pay attention to whether or not the bumps change. Maybe this is your baseline level? It varies a lot from person to person.

You can always call the office you originally had the ultrasound done. Give the receptionist your questions to ease your mind while you wait for your next appointment.
