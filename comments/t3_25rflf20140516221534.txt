From a guys perspective: It's possible that he just wants you to dress like that every once in a while, even if it's not "you're style" because he just likes the way it looks. Maybe he really thinks you would look good in it, and he want's to see it. Is it that much of an issue to get like one outfit in that style and wear it every once in a while? If my girlfriend kept hinting for me to dress a certain way like that I would take her shopping with me and have her pick outfits out. Even if it's not "my style" I would still wear that shit, just because she likes it. Just like sometimes she wears fishnets just because I like how they look on her.

Like it or not, a lot of guys really like to show their women off when they go out. We can tell when other dudes are checking our girlfriends/wives out and it makes us feel good, for them and for us.
