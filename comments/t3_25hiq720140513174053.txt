Did you have no strings attached sex after abortion?

Edit: I was in a relationship when I had the mishap. However, the guy didn't love me  and was telling his friends that I was "some girl he was talking to" and hiding me as his girlfriend which was really hurtful. I've never been in a relationship in which the other person loves me back which is why I want to give the whole relationship thing a break. I'm not at the point in which I want to invest my feelings to have them be rejected right now.
