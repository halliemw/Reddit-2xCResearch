I'm sure you'll great advice and support from TwoX. :) You don't need to tell anyone if you don't want to, but you might find it helps to have someone in the flesh who's actively supporting you. Your friends can't do that if they don't know what's going on. Either way though, just remember that you're in control, and whatever comes your way is within your ability to deal with.
