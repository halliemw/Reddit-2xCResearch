I keep feeling like there is more to the story.  Where are the comments from the nurse(s) who let the guy in?  This is the daughter of the chief nursing officer of the hospital...and against ICU rules they let in a non family member....a teen who was specifically banned from the room by the mother. To see a patient who was in the ICU for an infection.  Who was caught in the bed with her (who would think any person would be up for sex while in the ICU?) and then still not removed from the room?  

And why would the guy think he could get away with having sex in that situation?  

Was there a nurse that didn't like the mother (and/or daughter) and let the kid in?  There are just so many levels of wrong here it's hard to imagine it was as simple as a mistake on the nurses' part.
