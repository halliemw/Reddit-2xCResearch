Reminds me of [this](http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a7e72a4aa9ff332281e8b9de367109e5) picture. I think it is important to keep in mind that these opposing cultural standards are always evolving and battling each other. In Iran particularly, western ideas and the people who embraced them were quite literally expelled from the country. 

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Cultural_Revolution) happened about a generation ago(30+ years), yet in general in America we are clueless. You can imagine how many young people there are who may have found western culture appealing if they were allowed to experience it. Relativism is important, but contextualizing culture through the lens of history is even more so. When a group of likeminded people make strict rules and impose them on an entire population, there are almost always negative repercussions for those who disagree. This concept is evident anywhere you look. In America, the war on drugs, the occupy movement, the NSA's recently publicized activity, net neutrality, and the costs of t.v./internet are the quickest things to come to mind that are the result of those in power exercising that power in their own interest. This is what happened at this young girl's prom. This is nothing new, it is as it has been since people first started forming collective groups. 

I would be interested to hear how other groups or cultures feel oppressed by "the man".
