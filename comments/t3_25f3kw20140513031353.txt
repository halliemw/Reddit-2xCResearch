The same thing totally happens to me and it sometimes causes issues with my SO. It's definitely a physical "all that energy got redirected into my tearducts" type feeling, and can often come with the (for me, irrational because sex isn't about the orgasm) feelings of disappointment and frustration. The only thing I can say is that it's out of your control, so just talk to him when you guys are in a non-sexual, safe space and try to help him understand that it's purely physical and that you just need the space to release fluids in a different way ;)
