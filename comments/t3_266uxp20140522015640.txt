This might be better posed to r/relationshipadvice ( sorry no link, on mobile).  They're really great over there.  Anyway, my question to you or rather if I were you I would ask yourself, are you staying because you love this person, or because you can't bring yourself to make the decision to separate yourself fully? I wish the best of luck to you.
