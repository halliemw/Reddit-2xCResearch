Sorry for the slow response :s And I was very lucky indeed, though I think all cases should be treated like mine was. I really don't understand how your school thought it was in any way okay to leave this guy to teach kids... Your word against his is a lame excuse. Especially when there were plenty of witnesses to some of these things (kids are witnesses too). The baby comment for example, that isn't something a teacher should be allowed to joke about and in my opinion that alone should get him kicked to the curb....
I really hope your bad dreams and flashbacks will go away, being stuck with something like that is horrible...
