I'm not trying to say that white women don't have a right to feel bad about their looks at all. I'm simply pointing out that being pale as a white girl is not the same as being a dark skinned black girl, because the latter literally has centuries of history and propaganda actively telling her that she is undesirable and ugly. I'm speaking solely about colorism here, I'm not trying to have a discussion on beauty standards in general because of course all women are affected by that.
