Can you talk to your parents about getting on BC to manage periods?  That's totally a legitimate reason to.  If they are very conservative and the answers is "hell no," are you near a Planned Parenthood?  When I was in high school I had tons of friends who got free BC from Planned Parenthood, they just said they were a minor with conservative parents and they gave them free exams and everything, no questions asked.
