I think it took about 3 months. I noticed a huge difference when I switched.

When I first began the pill my doctor told me to start it the next time I got my period. That way being on the pill wouldn't significantly alter my cycle. When I began the row of placebo pills that would start my period it was when I would have been starting my period anyway. My body still functioned 95% the same (100% when I found a birth control that worked for me) as it would have had I not been on the pill.
