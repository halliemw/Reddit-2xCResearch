That is an unbelievably difficult set of circumstances which you have already lived through. You didn't deserve to be raped. Always remember that you are incredibly strong, infinitely capable and powerful. 

I am very glad to hear that your boyfriend is supportive. I hope that you're getting adequate access to the resources you need as a new mother. (If you're not, don't be afraid to ask for help!) The hospital at which you delivered your daughter might have programs that you're not aware of; you might want to look into what is available for you through either the medical system or social services. There are often programs and initiatives designed specifically to help young mothers and new mothers. 

As for being raped: do not be afraid to contact a licensed counsellor. They exist to provide critical support and you deserve all the support that you feel you need. Other commenters have mentioned RAINN, which is available 24/7. There may be other counselling services available in your area, too.
