Hello, You don't sound whiny or venty. I am a guy in college (senior year) and am going through the exact same issues. I am usually lonely months at a time even though I am surrounded by tons of people. You make platonic friends by sharing a common interest with that friend and pointing toward that common interest. For example, don't look at me look at the goldfish that we both like.
