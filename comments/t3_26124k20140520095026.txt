I observed that you could mentally trick yourself into thinking that you are pregnant. For instance, because you think you are pregnant you start looking for symptoms and your body starts producing those symptoms. Also, if you stress about it, your may get your period later than you expected because the stress is throwing off your body. I know it's tough, but try to stay calm. Think of other things to distract yourself. Keep us posted.
