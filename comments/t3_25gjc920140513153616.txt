I saw something on the front page today, a video about "price of admission" in relationships. 

Maybe this is mine/his. 

I think if we can handle these issues that we both have about the idea of sex in relationships we will be able to have a stronger connection. 
We have contrasting views on the idea of sex before marriage, and I think that's fine. As long as we don't do something we will regret we can make this work. There's so many more dynamics to our relationship anyways that honestly this is just a small part. And if it's the only part we struggle with, and the rest is good, I think that works out just great.
