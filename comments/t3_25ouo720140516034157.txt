So my boyfriend is a distance runner, and a year or so ago he participated in a 50-mile race.  He knew another girl there from college meets; he says his 10k time is wayyy faster than hers.  Well, in this race she DEMOLISHED him.  Beat him by a minute per mile.  Our society values strength in a way that makes men indisputably stronger.  But who decided that upper body was like the holy grail?  There are a lot of things that women are really good at, and our world records for things like swimming and running keep getting closer and closer to those of the men.  Women also tend to be more flexible, which can be useful in a variety of athletic activities.  That may not sound like much, but I think female gymnasts are probably pretty thankful for that.

Basically what I'm saying is that a lot of the things we see as disadvantages are actually only disadvantages because society has decided they are.  The issue of strength is just one example of this.  Sometimes I get frustrated, I wish I had the testosterone of a guy, but it helps if I try to remember the things I'm good at.  Just because society doesn't value one of my strengths doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to be valued by myself.
