Victoria's Secrect or Hanky Panky thongs are so overpriced.  I wish I could get used underwear (assuming it didn't look sketchy).

Can I tell you a secret? I found a trunk of my Moms old clothes (like from college), and there was a cute pair of panties in there. I just started using them after throwing it through the laundry.

So um.... what size are you OP?

I'll never have your problem because I wear things until they wear out/start to look grungy.
