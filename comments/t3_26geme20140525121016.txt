If you typically like people being blunt you, what makes this different?  Was it just very out of the blue? I don't think you are overreacting , but perhaps if you usually like bluntness he felt that it would be okay just to say it? Not that he needs to be commenting on your weight, but as a close friend maybe he had good intentions but didn't know where to start.
