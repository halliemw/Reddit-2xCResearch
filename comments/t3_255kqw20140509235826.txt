Mm hmm. And are you *licking* the toilet seat? No? Making any genital contact with the seat at all? I didn't think so (at least I hope not). Skin is a wonderful thing, you know. Unless you're going to run your hands over your backside, not wash them, then eat, sitting on a toilet seat won't kill you. It won't even make you sick.
