i am also a stay at home girlfriend, im not sure what to tell you to make you feel better about staying at home, but maybe i can help with the depression.
how often do you get out? ive noticed that when i get myself to atleast take a good walk once a day, over time i feel all around much happier, and i have more energy. also, going out and doing things with friends or your partner will help alot too; cabin fever is like an occupational hazard of being a homemaker :P fresh air and exercise is very important for everyone, but especially for those of us who stay in the same rooms most of the time
