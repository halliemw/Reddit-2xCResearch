99% chance he's backed up the phone after that conversation. Probably cleaned it up as well if there are others (others of OP or others of other women), so don't be surprised if he's suddenly willing to show you the phone next time.

As a guy I can def see him thinking it was just a playful thing to do. But OP made it clear that she felt very differently. At that point he should have turned over the phone. Serious minus points for not doing so.
