So there are no murders or rapes by the mentally ill or addicted in socialist countries? How utterly narrow-minded can you be? 
Additionally, rape is not temporary. The effects of rape can last a lifetime. Beyond the fact that if someone has overpowered/intimidated you enough to rape you, they could potentially also kill you (there's a reason rape and murder are so often mentioned together in news stories), there is also the potential for a rapist giving their victim any number of diseases, some fatal, or physically damaging them in horrible ways. 
The fact that your advice basically comes down to 'duh, obviously you should let a rapist rape you, rather than fighting back with all you've got' is utterly disgusting and an insult to rape survivors.
