Honest question: what about religions wherein both men and women dress a certain way due to religious concepts of modesty (or other religious reasons)? 

For example, in a variety of Jewish denominations, both men and women have certain religiously-related dress codes. They vary based on a number of things-- a person's particular beliefs and the practices in their community, whether or not a woman is married, etc.-- but it's not like they're restricted to one gender only. This also goes for denominations in which same-sex marriage is permitted, and members of same-sex couples will usually both follow the same practices as someone who is single, or the member of an opposite-sex relationship, so I think it's hard to argue that it's sexist.
