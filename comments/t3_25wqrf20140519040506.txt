this book assumes that the abuser is male and the abused is female. when you read it replace "he, him, his" with "she, her, hers" and vice verse. many women are abusive as well. if behavior is abusive from one partner, than the same behavior is abusive of the other partner. 

abusive people tend to attract each other. this book is sexist, it assumes the problems are male problems.
