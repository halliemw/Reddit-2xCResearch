You should get looked at by your optometrist.  Abrasions to the cornea (the clear, front part of your eye) by mascara wands are pretty common, and it hurts so much because there are a lot of nerve endings there.  Depending on how deep the cut/abrasion is, it could take from a couple days to a couple of weeks or even months to heal completely.  There is also a risk of bacterial infection involved (which can get very nasty!).  Please go see an eye doctor!
