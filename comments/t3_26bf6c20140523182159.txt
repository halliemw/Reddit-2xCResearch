Probably because people are taking it to mean I'm telling them how they should live their lives.  I'm just stating what I do and how I feel and how I think it impacts how my life has turned out.  People have been abused by friends and family members as children, their set of circumstances are wildly different than mine.  Some people *have* to take transit, again, this isn't a world I live in, nor is it one I *choose* to live in.  (I can't imagine not having/driving a car.  It's part of why I won't life in SF ever.  Sure they have a ton of public transit, but I love driving enough to not want to give that up.)

But thanks for the ps. :)  It's a touchy subject and I feel people have some very strong opinions on it and well, our judgements are based on our life experiences as a whole.  I'm glad I could share mine and I'm sad that others find it offensive or demeaning.  (Again, not judging other peoples behaviors!  This is all personal to me and my life.  No one elses!)
