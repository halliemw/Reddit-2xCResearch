I think you are giving these people too much credit with how persuasive they are, you seem to be likening it to politicians when these people aren't nearly as good as politicians when arguing their points. I also think that the more things you give them to argue against, the better it is for those with extreme views, let them explain their basic ideology and people will realise how blatantly stupid it is. Asking questions kindly and showing everyone how awful the other persons argument is saves a shouting match between 2 hostile people that makes them both seem crazy.
