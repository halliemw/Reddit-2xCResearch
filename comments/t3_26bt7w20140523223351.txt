I work in oncology, my best advice for you would be to plan out the recovery stages with the oncologist. The treatments for stage 1 breast cancer are very standard and have extremely high success rates, however the recovery often involves a lot of waiting. Try to plan out some things to do with your mother that the surgeon approves of at appropriate times throughout the recovery. This also gives your mother positive things to look forward to post treatment and lets you both focus on something besides the next appointment. I wish you and your mother the best and hope for a speedy recovery.
