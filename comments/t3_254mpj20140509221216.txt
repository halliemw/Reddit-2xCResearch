This totally this this this! I worked for a hospital in non direct patient care and it pissed me off so badly to witness and overhear mistreatment of patients! Please! Not pulling a curtain shut while working with you is completely inappropriate especially if you are exposed!  And their reaction,  if it is how the story was told, sounds really heartless ie "what do you want to do". Like what did they expect you to say? Please allow me to bask in my menstruation all day while groggy postop? Bleh!
