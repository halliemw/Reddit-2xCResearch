First, a good way to think about this is that you probably aren't really upset about the fact that a person didn't find you attractive or rejected you. Hell I walk past hundreds of people a day who do not find me attractive. If any one of them turned up on my doorstep and had to pretend to like me their reactions would be the same as this guys. However, knowing that is the case doesn't upset me or phase me in the slightest (and im sure it wouldn't you either). Why? Because in those cases there's no emotional attachment so it just doesn't matter, who cares? No, what you're upset about is the same thing everyone in a breakup is upset about, it's rejection from someone that you have intense feelings for and a dashing of hopes and dreams. Now this doesnt make how you feel hurt any less but know that in this way you will recover just the same as you have from any other breakups and your confidence will return in time.

Second, this is the problem with online dating. It may not have even been your photos. I've met people who I was super excited about dating and we really were hitting it off over text and then we meet and boom, there's no chemistry, they're not unattractive and they look like their photo and im certainly not repulsed or disgusted by them, I just know in my soul that I don't want a romantic relationship with them so we have a nice chat over a drink and then never speak to each other again! The problem with your situation was both of you over committing before you meet someone for the first time.
