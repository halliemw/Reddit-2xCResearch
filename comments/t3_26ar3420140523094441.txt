It really does depend on the company.  I've worked at companies that wouldn't care if you had a neck tattoo.  I've also worked at companies that would give you a stern talking to if you weren't wearing either a black or brown suit.  If it's covered by a regular shirt, there's no reason for an employer to even be aware you have ink.
