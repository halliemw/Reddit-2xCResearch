I'll say this: I will say WHATEVER I NEED TO to get out of a scary situation with a dude. I don't care if it's bad for feminism as a whole, although I am a feminist. If a dude is harassing you, it is so much more important that you get out of that situation by any means necessary rather than worrying about whether you educated him or furthered the cause.

And we, as women, need to stop shaming each other for how we react to abusers and harassers.
