Actually, /r/gaming would benefit from a major shuffle to its user base. It's way too dominated by a single group, limiting what games can be (and are).

I think you make a good point about this sub having a female perspective. As men, we can learn from it, and should appreciate that perspective shift and take it for what it is. I understand some people when dealing with cognitive dissonance get defensive, but reddit as a whole might benefit from the new information. I hope the subreddit won't disintegrate because of that, of course!
