Yes its creepy and you should tell him you dont like it. Never be afraid to tell someone to stop touching you in a way you dont like. Your mother should be standing up to him, but since she is failing at it, its up to you to stand up for yourself and tell him to stop. Never be alone with this person, and stay safe. (I had a creepy uncle too. I called him out in front of everyone at a BBQ and he never said anything inappropriate to me again.)
