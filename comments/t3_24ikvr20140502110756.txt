Oddly enough, my worst symptoms occur the week prior to my placebo week, one of the reasons I think it is more hormonally-based. I feel like I'm hitting some sort of low hormonal level that week, while my body is "getting ready" for shark week. Once I'm actually on my placebos, I'm generally levelling out.
