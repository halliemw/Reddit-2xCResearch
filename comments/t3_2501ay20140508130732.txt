Some cops are overzealous. How many of those are men? (I don't mean to be sexist, I just think there is a higher incidence of the overzealous shoot-happy cop among men because that's more of an idealization for little boys, being the hero cop who gets all the bad guys than it is for little girls. I don't think men are inherently more violent or anything).

If she's reporting this where there's a crime it would be through the sexual assault or domestic violence unit, which tend to have more women and fewer cops seeking glory. It seems to be it's the drug squads that get the really aggressive people. And if you're frequenting a place dedicated to showing the worst side of cops, it's going to give you a skewed idea of what the police are like. It's not like you're seeing all the times they do everything professionally or talk down someone violent instead of shooting them.

Yes there are overzealous cops. No, he probably won't get shot for having illegally and/or immorally taken photographs.
