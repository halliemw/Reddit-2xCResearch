I have a defensive boyfriend, and I know he's like that. But it's the part of him that like. Yes, it sometimes makes communication difficult, but  I know what I'm dealing with. We're also very quick to forgive. We get heated and upset, but it dissipates within moments.

For me, it's just knowing what I'm going into and caring enough to change my tact. Going in gently, making it about something other than me. We went on a cruise and he snored the entire time due to being sick. First night I kicked him. Second night I smothered him (teasingly) but third ginger, he waited for me to fall asleep and put a pillow on my head and one on his head to muffle the sounds. Working together. He felt like shit that I couldn't get a good nights sleep during vacation, and I'm sure your bf feels bad about you not sleeping. When it feels like you're being attacked, you get defensive to show that you're sorry, albeit desperately.

I grew up with a lot of hot heads, so maybe I'm used to eggshells and changing tact, but defensiveness is easy enough to get around. My BF gained a lot of weight. He now has stretch marks. But I can approach it one way, scolding at him for gaining weight and calling him fat (even if it's earners, thats how it sounds.) or i can ask if he wants to go for a walk with me or go to the gym with me. There's little use in challenging.
