Items for runner's chafe are suitable for decent lengths of time without need for reapplication; same with arrowroot powder.

There are anti-chafe topical creams like Lanacane, as well.

But, the easiest, cheapest, most awesome thing I have ever used is a drop of silicone based lubricant. You need so little of it; obviously take care not to get any where it's not needed, be aware that silicone lubricants can stain garments. But that shit lasts like 24 hours.
