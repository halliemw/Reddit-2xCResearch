Oh! Oh! I've been waiting to tell this story!

Okay, so last weekend my fiancé and I had a quickie. I have an IUD, so he didn't use a condom, but we do use lube for ease of entry. Also I was already wet so things were slippery.

ANYWAY, we finish and I go to the bathroom to pee and clean up. I was pretty sure I had gotten everything, so I finish my business and walk back to my fiancé's room in the nude. I barely get halfway across the room when I feel wetness between my legs and running down my thighs! I look down and there's giant globs of semen and lube EVERYWHERE. Wtf.

I believe my exact words were, "Hey! I just cleaned you!"

Okay, so I'm not great at telling stories...
