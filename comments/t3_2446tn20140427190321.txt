Hydrogen peroxide has been my best friend through my vag-issues and has saved me well over $300. I just dilute it and douche. If it fizzes way out of control it usually means there is an infection of some sort. I then insert an acidophillus suppository (because the peroxide will generally kill the good bacteria as well) and it's all good within the day.
