1. Just post 'not cool, bro' when you see misogyny/transphobia/asshole behaviour. Saying this in the real world, especially when the affected group isn't around will make it even better. Best way to make someone not an asshole on the internet is for them to not be assholes off the internet. 

2.  Use the report button when you spot something.

3. Be mindful when commenting and ask yourself if it disturbs the women centred dynamic here. 

Other than that, welcome!
