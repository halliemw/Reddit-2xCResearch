Thank you! I've been thinking about eloping but I'm not sure if my fiance is into that notion. It seems way less stressful for me. I will definitely PM you later if the offer still stands, I have to get back to work soon though. I do plan on supplying booze, I could really use ANY advice you have to offer, I'm extremely ignorant about all things -wedding-. Thank you so much again and I'll definitely check out offbeatbride...and I'll probably hound you later for more information :)
