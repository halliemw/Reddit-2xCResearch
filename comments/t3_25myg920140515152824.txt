There are two kinds of IUDs. Hormonal and non-hormonal (made out of copper). The hormonal ones are known to greatly reduce, if not eliminate, your period. The copper ones *may* cause a heavier flow and cramping, but most people find that their periods return to normal after a few cycles.

If you're interested in an IUD I have found [IUD Divas](http://iud-divas.livejournal.com/) to be a good resource for IUD experiences.

I second /u/buttercup_mauler's opinion. You really need to talk to your doctor more in depth because you seem to have a lot of partial or just flat out misinformation.
