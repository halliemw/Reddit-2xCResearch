There will always be stories like this but they are definitely the exception, not the rule. Just like saying someone's neo-Nazi ultra racist uncle could change and become the most loving Buddhist monk doesn't mean everyone should start cuddling up to assholes, one can't take the exceptions as things that assure them it'll work out. That said, congrats on your own love story. Admittedly, I'm jealous.
