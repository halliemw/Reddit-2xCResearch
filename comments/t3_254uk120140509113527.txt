When you go through infertility treatments, you have to use progesterone supplements that are given in suppository form.

The kind that I was issued has the nickname 'spackle', because over the course of the day, the vaginal suppository dissolves and exits your vagina looking like giant quantities of...spackle. It's sticky and mucous colored and gritty and gets EVERYWHERE. 

Tampons won't absorb it, and pads won't absorb it. So really all you can do is wear a thin panty liner and let it just sit on top of the panty liner until you can deal with it. And you get to experience this joy for two weeks every month.
