My main point is that abusive relationships are not that common at her age, so I don't think it should be advice she MUST have over other things such as education, career choices, social relationships in general, etc.

Secondly, relationships are not really well understood until you actually enter one. You can't abstract it and "advise" people against/for this and that before it actually occurs. Without ever being in a relationship or a "bad" one, how can she distinguish an abusive relationship from a simply rocky one? The lines are much more blurry when you're in it rather than out of it.

There is better/more important advice below. In fact, the top commenter didn't even give advice, or it was just so general that it's rendered useless.
