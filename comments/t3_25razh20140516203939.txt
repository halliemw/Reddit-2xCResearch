Just remember to compromise with each other and try to put yourself in his shoes. If you can ever see a situation arising in reverse (you and a guy friend really love to hang out and talk about X which your fiance can't stand or something) then you're not being fair. If there are lines you can never imagine yourself crossing innocently (sharing intimate details of your relationship / expressing dissatisfaction with your relationship to the other person and not your SO), then you can redraw some lines. Good luck to you guys! Navigating relationships and insecurities is crazy complicated... I've been known to be an insecure nutcase from time to time... ;)
