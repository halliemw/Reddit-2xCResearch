Its clear. he loves jesus more than he loves you.  to the point that he sees you as an agent of the enemy of jesus sent to tempt him away from his true love.

ppl with opposite religious views can make relationships work.  its often based on understanding like.  You have your views and I have mine.  lets respect each others and not discuss this topic.  Its different when one is right and the other is an agent of evil.  Dunno why you would choose to be with a person that loves his imaginary magical friend more than the person he can hold onto in his arms.


This life is all we have.  You should be with someone that appreciates you and is willing to make the best of this life with you.  Not a person that will treat this life as an opportunity to score reward points which he thinks are redeemable after death.
