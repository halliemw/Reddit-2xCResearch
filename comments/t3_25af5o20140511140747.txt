Thank you.  

Your parents sound like absolutely amazing people.  My wedding day was an amazingly happy occasion, but I certainly felt her absence.  I think I feel it more though in the every day things.  I got a promotion at work, and after telling my husband, I knew who I wanted to tell next, but I couldn't share it with her.  We are in the process of buying a house, and I just broke down the other day thinking about how proud she would be, and how much I wanted to show her the house.  Every milestone, every question, and I've found that although time helps, it hasn't gone away.  And I don't think it will.  

It has helped me tremendously to talk to other women who have lost their mothers.  Sometimes it helps to just be with someone who doesn't think you are absolutely crazy for crying about something that happened decades ago. Some people think "Why haven't you gotten over it already?  It has been years."  But it is something that I don't think I will get over.  She's gone, and I never got to know her as an adult.  I never got to create that adult bond with her, and it aches sometimes.

Much love to you in return.
