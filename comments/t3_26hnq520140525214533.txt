But, douche is a gender-neutral term, and also refers to something that's legitimately bad! Douches are horrible for your vagina, so they deserve to be a bad word.

Meanwhile, bitch is pretty much only used as a way to either degrade women, or compare men to women (as a bad thing). It's pretty different from something like douche, asshole, jerkface, etc. I guess the closest thing to it might be "dick", though it's not a perfect analogy.
