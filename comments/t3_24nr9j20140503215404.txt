My first time being dumped it took me months to get out of a funk. I wouldn't eat, I cried all the time, my grades slipped right before having to declare a major, and I seriously became a crazy person. Being awake and going to class was the hardest thing to do.

But - each day it got a little easier. I could breathe a little bit better. Then I would be hit with it again - something would make me remember him. I had to start over.

The way I got over it? Honestly? I met my husband. He was my best friend for a few months before we started dating (yes I know... he got out of whatever the friendzone is) but he understood before we started dating that I was broken. That I needed to heal. We took it slow and now we've been together almost 8 years. 

It will get better!
