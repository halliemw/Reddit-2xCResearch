Thanks for the plug!

I'm not entirely sure that /r/FAW is exactly what OP is looking for. While some of our users are happily single, many are not and look for support from other users who are unhappy and frustrated as well. But she should feel free to check it out anyway!

And as a note, /r/ForeverAloneWomen for those concerned is much more moderated than /r/ForeverAlone, and is much more positive and supporting.
