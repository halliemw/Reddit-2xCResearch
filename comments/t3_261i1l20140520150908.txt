And TX just passed a bill a few months back requiring all doctors to have hospital rights.  It shut down about 40% of the clinics so farâ€¦supposed to be upwards of 90% by the end of implementation.  If they can't make it illegal, they are going to make damn sure that you can't get one.  In a place like TX, you might have to drive 200 miles just to get to a clinic, only to have to come back after the waiting period.
