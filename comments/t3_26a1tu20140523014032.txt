Don't listen to the other guy.

"Like guns are dangerous, so like, if you get raped, just like, don't k?"

Jackass. Though he might and probably is, a troll.

A gun isn't a bad decision, provided its legal. The thing no one says about guns, is that you don't really have to shoot anybody. Rapists and really most criminals(Except you know, bikers and sorts like that) are cowards(evidenced by the fact they need a group to take their victim).
Just seeing the gun or having it go off(Where a realistic toy gun might come in handy for now, provided they buy your bluff) should scare them away.

Get the pepper spray. Order from out of state. But run the risk that if you get the gun out of your purse while they are attacking you, the battle is over, you've locked in that they will get the worst of this situation. The pepper spray doesn't, because you will likely have to get to spray them all. Consider a strong taser(Tazer?) too.
