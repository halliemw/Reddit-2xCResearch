The media is now trying to cover up his attacks on women. They say he killed his 3 Asian roommates, 2 women, and 1 other man. I can't find the genders of the 7 other people he shot or, except it was mentioned in an early report, anything about the sorority house he tried to get into. This is why I hate corporate media so much. The censorship concealment and lying.
