Like the other replyer said, use birth control if you don't want to get pregnant.

But just to let you know there are two kinds of abortion. If you are under 7 weeks pregnant you can get what they call a 'medical' (as opposed to surgical) abortion which is two pills that you take. It's like having the worst period you've ever had, but some people find it less scary that a 'procedure' (though I've heard that the procedure is so quick and easy that many people still choose it).
