I think the main reason I want to label it is for knowing how to talk about this with friends, future romantic partners, etc. In that case, I suppose I was trying to decide whether or not I am a rape victim or not, but after thinking it over, I guess I don't really need to say that I am or that I'm not. If I am close enough with somebody to tell them about this experience, I should be close enough with them to give all the gorey details. 

It seems from the excessive downvotes that I am getting that people don't like me trying to decide if this is rape or not. Maybe people think that I am trying to claim myself as a rape victim for sympathy or something...I'm not terribly hurt by the downvotes, though. I mean, this is Reddit, everything gets downvoted...But I hope that people understand that I don't have bad intentions and I am not trying to belittle other people's experiences.
