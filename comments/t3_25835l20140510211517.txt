Former backpacking guide lady here. 

Here's what you need:

* 2 ziplock bags. I will bring extra too because they come in handy in general. Tape duct tape on the outside of one, this will be your trashbag. No one will see what's in it and when it's in the community trash. The other will hold the essentials:

* Tampons

*  Wet Wipes (good god they feel awesome, even if you're not on your period, it's like sweet sweet relief every once and a while).

*  Regular TP. This will probably be provided by the leader too, but if they don't for whatever reason.

*  Advil/Ibuprophen. Your leader will probably carry some too, but I always like having my own so I don't have to explain anything.

*  Hand sanitizer, as suggested by others. This will also probably be provided.

Please don't bury your tampons/TP. I can't tell you the number of times I've seen TP strewn about in the woods when an animal decides your salty pee smells like a good snack and digs it up. Pack it in, pack it out, that's what the bag is for. Especially in desert areas, which can sometimes be more fragile than the woods. If you have bad period shits, make sure you dig a deep hole as fast as you can. Trust me on this one, it's never deep enough.

Also relax! The number one thing people talk about on wilderness trips is food and poop. You're going to have a great time!
