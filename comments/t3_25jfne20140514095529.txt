I'd be down, absolutely, but I'd want to be really careful about preventing it from turning into a place where people go to seek legal advice.  It's one of the reasons I am so reluctant to discuss my profession online - sooner or later, someone tries to hit me up for free advice, usually about something that I know nothing about, and almost always in a jurisdiction where I'm not barred.
