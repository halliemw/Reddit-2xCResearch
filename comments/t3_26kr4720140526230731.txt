I definitely have good and bad days and sometimes I wonder if I might be suffering from some form of depression because some days I don't think about it at all/am super optimistic and other days I feel this crushing sense that I will never live up to my family's expectations or my SO's successes. I don't know if that is normal for people in the job search process.
