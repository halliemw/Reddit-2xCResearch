How dare you use your own boobs for a non-sexual purpose! /s

Also, do people not realize how much of a pain in the ass it is to pump for 20-30 minutes before going out (especially if you're only leaving the house for an hour or less)? Or that some babies will only nurse from the breast because bottle nipples confuse them? Or that some babies will refuse to nurse when something is covering their face?  

Edit: forgot to mention that some people are unaware that if you go long periods of time without nursing, your boobs actually start to hurt. Or you start leaking through your clothes. Not fun. Not to mention that parents already have to carry around so much shit when they have a baby- not having to carry around formula and bottles is a huge help.
