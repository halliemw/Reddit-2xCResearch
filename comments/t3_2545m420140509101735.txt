I would see another doctor. It may not be something to worry about right this moment, but 2-3 times a year sounds pretty abnormal at your age. (I'm 23!) Do you have any other hormonal irregularities like too little or too much body hair, mood swings, or weight cycling? Also something to consider is how much you exercise and eat. Many female athletes and dancers experience decreased periods because they carry so little body weight coupled with participation in such strenuous activity. It could be a sign of poor nutrition. I would just go see another doctor and ask about these things. A second opinion never hurts!
