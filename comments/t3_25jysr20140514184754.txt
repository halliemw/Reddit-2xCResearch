> Growing up with boy cousins, I remember wondering why I always had to be the pink Power Ranger, or the human girl from Ninja Turtles when we played with action figures. 

Huh? Playing with boys, I brought out my Ultraman action figure and hell if I'd let them play with it if I wanted to! I had a Master Splinter action figure and some Ninja Turtles. 

I mean, it's nice to have action figures aimed at girls, but why don't we teach the little girls in our lives that if the boys tell them they have to be the girl, fuck them?

Edit: I also had a Captain Picard action figure! If you wanna be macho Riker, go ahead, I'm gonna be the CAPTAIN. Picard >>>> everyone
