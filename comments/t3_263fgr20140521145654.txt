Talking helps, I've been in serious relationships with women that were abused, and I have a relatively high sex drive. For me, I'd rather have sex once every couple weeks that she wholeheartedly initiated than a deluge of "chore sex". 

Maybe that's just me, but I want engagement and intimacy. I can get everything else online. Take an afternoon (don't know if it's possible for you, work/kids/etc) every now and then and retire to the bedroom, be intimate, spend time on foreplay, talk about what you both like and don't like. THAT helped immensely, at least for all the women I've been with, the open trust and honesty of them knowing that they were there because I loved them and sex was one of many possible ways of expressing that, not a daily obligation. 

tl;dr, open honesty and genuine emotion outweigh a fleshlight, quality over quantity, and take it slow. Hopefully it helps, I obviously don't have any experience on your side of the coin, so I'm doing my best to empathize here.
