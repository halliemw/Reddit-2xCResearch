What you misunderstand is that his "crime" (i.e., misbehavior) HAS been proved. The school is not punishing him for committing a criminal act, although the school can punish someone for doing such. They are punishing him for his on-campus behavior, behavior which just so happens to also be criminal in nature. 
    
If someone is stealing from the campus bookstore, the school CAN refer it to the police, but they do not HAVE to. The school can just punish him. Even though the kid has not been found guilty of a crime in a criminal court, that is irrelevant. The internal school policies are found to be sufficient due process. 
    
You may disagree that the school's internal policies are sufficient due process. But the law says that it is. The school is not jailing anyone, the school is just amending its relationship, so there is a lower due process standard. You can argue that a school's internal due process measures are inherently insufficient and all discipline should be sent to a court of law, but that is a completely different point than is being made here. As far as the school is concerned, he has been found guilty of violating school policy. His "crime" has been proven for the purposes of the relationship between the two.
