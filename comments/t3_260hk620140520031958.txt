I, however, am not going to post under a throwaway. I have never felt safe here. The women here are incredibly rude. If you're not on whatever feminist boat they're currently shipping, you're not good enough to contribute to any conversation they're currently having. I have posted wanting help, guidance, unbiased opinions, just a safe place to rant, and I've been torn down every single time. In a place that I thought women were supposed to build one another up, I found hateful, nasty, self-righteous, mean-spirited women who enjoy making other women feel bad about themselves and who enjoy fear mongering women into not trusting any man who gives them a sideways glance. It makes me sick and often ashamed to be a woman to see how these women treat one another.
