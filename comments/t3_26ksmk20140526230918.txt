I don't! Back when I did, it was because I just didn't eat. Which... is a problem! I'm sort of casually trying to lose some weight now, but definitely very slowly. I go to the gym and lift weights- more because I enjoy it than to burn calories, and try not to eat past when I'm full (even if it's really tasty, which is probably my biggest weakness). 

If you're gonna eat at subway, look at the listed calorie counts. It has the *potential* to be better than most fast food, if you load it with veggies, skip the cheese, do lean meats, etc... but most of their stuff is just as bad as McDonalds, straight off the menu.
