I'm so proud of you! Too many people let their parents get away with abuse because they control the purse strings. Be strong! Paying off student loans sucks, but you know what sucks more? Being stuck in an abusive household. Perhaps this is the wake up call your parents need. They'll be less likely to do something like this again now that they knkw the law is on your side.
