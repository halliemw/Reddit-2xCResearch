I've only seen the episode once and didn't exactly comb it with a fine-tooth comb, but I wasn't under the impression that she was a programmer/engineer. She seemed to be a booth person that was involved with the company in a meaningful capacity of some sort that maybe didn't extend to coding, or not primarily coding. It seemed like her contributions might have been more marketing, since she wrote all her company's tweets. So maybe a little bit more like Jared than Dinesh.

It seemed like an overly contrived plot, which didn't have much pay off in terms of character development or humour, so on that level I wasn't so impressed. (We've already gotten cringe-he's-so-awkward-with-women humour last episode (or the one before that?) with Gilfoyle's gf and this one wasn't anything new, excluding the "you're attracted to my code" line.)

It would be nice to have a female engineer/programmer get mixed in, but it would be important to avoid tokenism. 

The women to date have largely been objects of sexual desire. Gilfoyle's gf as Dinesh's object of desire. The TechCrunch Judge's wife (or wives, although one is only mentioned) as Erlich's object of desire. Blonde programmer with pink hair as Dinesh's object of desire. Women who thinks Richard is obsessed with her, whose only characteristics seem to be a sympathy to gay polyarmous people and use as a potential object of desire. The stripper. Are there any more women?

The only exception to this would be Monica. It's only a few episodes in and she hasn't had much of a role, but it would be nice to get a little more character development for her. So far she just seems nice, friendly, and competent at her job.
