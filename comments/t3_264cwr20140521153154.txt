From what little you've described of him, I think you're probably right.  And I agree with TeslaIsAdorable - I would bet that he'll eventually act on those desires.  Its sounds like he's trying to wear you down until you give him the "ok," but even if you don't, it won't stop him.  IMHO, he sounds dismissive, misogynistic, controlling - and I hate to say it but also kind of emotionally abusive, even if he doesn't realize that that's what he's doing.  Do yourself a favor and get out of this relationship, because I'd wager the chances that it'll get worse are higher than the chances it'll get better.
