>Did they pour cement into the hole?!

They sure did.  I felt like my heart froze when I saw it.  And they did it really really early in the morning when it is more likely they were all in there sleeping.  Calling the Police is the one thing I didn't do because I'm afraid of the repercussions for the professors who fight so hard for all the campus cats. There are many more in other areas.  They neuter them, and release them back on campus, walk all over the campus to the feeding stations, and even pay vet bills from their own pockets if they get really sick.  Since their jobs are at steak, I felt that the decision should come from them, but I can feel they are afraid too.  Also in fear of repercussion for the other cats because the university can simply not allow them here anymore, if they get publicly embarrassed over this.  This is just a cluster fuck of cluster fucks.  I feel so terrible for them all and I can't comprehend how this happened exactly the day before I was going to take one with me to his forever home.
