Thank you. Something similar happened to me and I felt so violated and confused. I have with time decided that it was rape/assault/abuse/whatever you want to call it... but you wouldn't believe the people who told me "Nope, sounds like you just regret having sex with him" -- uhhh, no. He didn't respect my consent and he put my long term health at risk and removed my choice to assess that risk.
