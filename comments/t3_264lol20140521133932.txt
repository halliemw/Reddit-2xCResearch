I'm not saying that something doesn't need to happen, I'm just explaining that your quoted list is not necessarily reliable.  Your company policy is vague, but does arguably have the force of contract.  You could thus potentially sue on those grounds (though suing an employer means you'll never work again).

Harassment law is actually quite focused.  Most companies enforce policies that are much broader than the law (fearful of lawsuits as they are).
