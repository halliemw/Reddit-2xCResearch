She really is an awesome person. She's one of my favourite female comedians - in the UK, it's mostly men on the comedy panels, a lot of the time women are brought on as novelty, or to sit and look pretty without ever saying a single funny thing. She is a huge exception. Love her. She is awesome at her job.
