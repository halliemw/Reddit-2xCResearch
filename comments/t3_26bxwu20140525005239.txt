You see the difference between telling someone what to feel and how to react is:

A person who feels something is the #1 authority on what they are feeling.  You CAN'T tell them what they're feeling better than they can.

A person CAN react improperly to a situation, which you did, and I corrected you for it.  You took anger and misplaced it towards this guy's comment, when it was completely uncalled for.  You have every right to feel infuriated, but he doesn't have to.  To him, it's annoying, because he's not the victim, he's a bystander.

It isn't ridiculous or hypocritical.  You berated someone because they felt something different than you.  I berated you because you had no right to do that.  See the difference?  Please don't respond.  Just try to take it to heart.
