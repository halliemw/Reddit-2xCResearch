This couldn't be more wrong to me.  You ARE unnecessarily putting people into boxes by saying XX ppl are 'real' women and XY ppl are 'real men'.  Lots of XX's prefer to call themselves something else along the gender spectrum, or just straight up male if they are transgender.  Same this with XY peeps.  If that doesnt make sense, yea just read 'Iatemysocks' above me, she pretty much said it
