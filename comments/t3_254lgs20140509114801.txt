YES can we talk about this??

In high school I started growing ~12 long, black hairs on each nipple. I was super self conscious about it, and I worked at an electrolysis place so I considered getting them permanently removed.

I'm so glad I didn't now. I've plucked them out a handful of times, mostly because I kind of enjoy it and I love how smooth they are after. However... my nipples are probably the most sensitive spot on my body. I *love* having them touched and it gets me off way more than anything else. I noticed that when I plucked the hairs, my nipples became dramatically less sensitive. Like, from "ooooh yeahhh I'm so turned onnn" to "meh".

The first time my current SO pointed my hairy nipples out, I wanted to die of embarrassment. But he said he liked them, and we sat there comparing nipple hair for a while (his were *way* worse!).
