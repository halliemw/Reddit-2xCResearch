I don't get it. Why was the fact that it was a man who critiqued the woman author so much the focus of the event that she chose to call it mansplaining? Could a woman not have done the same?

The story of the (not necesseraly professional) critic correcting the author about what they meant is pretty stereotypical and hundreds if not thousands of years old.
