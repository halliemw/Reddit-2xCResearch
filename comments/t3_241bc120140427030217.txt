Ugg. I'm curious on whether this is a factor on why I've had poor luck finding a job, always failing at the interview stage. 

My experience (canadian jobs) and references are impressive, but I got a gap on my resume as I came into the US on a fiance visa and couldn't work while waiting for my greencard. The gap comes up every interview and I tell them about the visa, but also obviously exposes I recently got married. edit: and they don't need to ask the question "are you married" as I just gave them the answer!
