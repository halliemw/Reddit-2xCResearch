Barbies by their own ads from, say, the 1990s, heavily promoted the range of this toy to be a beautiful woman you can dress up prettily -- that wasn't the only selling point, but one they did put in print advertisement. This subtly prescribes a specific type of model different from the creative range of certain other toys. To me, it's all in the mix, and I don't find harm in Barbie being one part of the play room, but I would certainly want to ensure there's a range of toys to pick from... and then let the kid decide.
