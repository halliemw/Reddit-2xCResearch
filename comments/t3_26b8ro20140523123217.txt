Just presenting a snapshot of this week's existing discussion on it.  

From my point of view, I continue to think that the sub being a default is a positive.  It is driving traffic to the whole network of woman-related subs listed in our sidebar, and significantly increasing the visibility of women on reddit.  

Every time there's a post from someone saying that women's issues are "niche" or "special interest" I want to explode, since we're 50% of the population and at least 35% of reddit.  I appreciate that the admins decided that adding women's perspectives to the front page was a good step for the site.
