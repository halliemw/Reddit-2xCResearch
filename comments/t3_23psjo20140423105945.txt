Any woman always has the potential of being a mother, regardless of her history. I had an abortion between my successful pregnancies, and I have never regretted, it was the merciful thing for the fetus and the future well-being of the family. When in a relationship or raising children always think of the long-term. Your future children will have a mother better equipped and supported financially, emotionally and socially. Childcare can be devastating for career/artistic/relationship growth, since babies require intensive care for first 3 years; and the annual cost of quality childcare in the US can be more than college tuition, and then they go home with you. Be a mother when you are ready to love it.

I love my kids, and we paid particular care during the first 3 years, because of our interest in early childhood psychology and neurobiology, and in learning to be a different parent than those that raised us, bringing in our life experiences. It was and is an enriching, bonding and deeply satisfactory experience for our marriage because we waited for so so long, talked and prepared ourselves for its seismic change.
