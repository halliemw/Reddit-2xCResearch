I wuv you!

(My partner is fond of "figures" and had to be taught not to say anything about weight gain...not everyone loves being told they have a "figger" either).

My dad used to have negative things to say about overly thin women (I didn't really get them at the time - they were sort of encoded) and I think it would have been best if he'd just kept quiet.
