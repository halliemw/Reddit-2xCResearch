From the patient side of things, I completely agree with you that it's ludicrous to use the "faces" scale for adults (or at least, for adults who are currently capable of communicating with words). It seems really ludicrous to have to arbitrarily choose a cartoon drawing and a number instead of just describing what is happening.
