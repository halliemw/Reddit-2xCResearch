I am! I do! Ugh You're not seeing my point... Things could have turned out a lot worse than they did. I'm thankful for the fact I am out and no major bodily harm was done and he is in jail.
I just was curious as to why what happened, happened and see if anyone could shed some light because I am confused.
I'm only doing everything I can to heal, and understanding & educating myself helps.
