I used to get this all the time in high school. I have downturned eyes that make me look "sad". I never said anything cause I did not want to draw more attention to myself. My approach has always been to look as though I did not hear anything and go on my way. I think giving attention to the obnoxious person is what they want and withholding it can be powerful.
