Nooooo! That cant be a thing. We watched a scarey movie the other night called "contracted" the movie was meh but she kept waking up in a pool of blood and the dudes I was with were like "why does she not go to the hospital" and I'm over here like "cuz that's normal yall" tampoons + pads  is a normal thing to have to do...it just can't get worse...and why they no teach you this in period class? "Your period will get considerably heavier with age"
