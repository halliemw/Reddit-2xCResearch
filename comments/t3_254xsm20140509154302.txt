understandable --- i think somewhere i discussed that there is always bad with good, and i guess im just optimistic that the good will outweigh the bad in this scenario.... guess all we can do is see what happens!

at the same time, perhaps these tactics scared away trolls, but perhaps they also scared away some awesome people who could have added to the community in a positive way --- i reckon they walked into this dramatic shitstorm and just went 'well i don't need this' and left. When if we focused on a wide array of topics, like we usually do, we could have gained more of these people willing to converse and add to discussion in an appropriate manner
