Just to inject some reality here, often pregnancies are terminated for health reasons. Dead-beat parenting doesn't have that parallel. Bottom line-as pregnancy affects a woman's body, not a man's, the choice to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's choice. This whole 'financial abortion' rhetoric is pretty pathetic, and does *not* correlate to reproductive health.
