It's an unfortunate side-effect of insulin resistance. I was officially diagnosed with PCOS two years ago, but had probably been dealing with it for at least 10 years previous. Over that time, I developed some fairly marked discoloration in the inner cheek/inner thigh/groin area. I found that using koji soap on the affected areas every time I bathe has significantly reduced the darkness. It took a whole bar's worth of soap and about a month, but I've been starting to see a real difference when I check in the mirror. If you have been diagnosed as pre-diabetic, changing your diet can also help prevent/lessen the discoloration. Hope that helps!
