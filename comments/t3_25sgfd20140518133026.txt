Meh.  I look at it as a form of redemption for a beloved character.  It's not that we aren't letting her "just be evil", it's that good characters have better motivations for infanticide than the insult of not being invited to a party.  Maleficent was awesome and powerful and iconic, but at the end of the day she was a ridiculously vain caricature of a woman, not to mention a human being.  She served her purpose in her time and remains memorable, but the shallowness of her Evil For Evil's Sake (Female Edition) is the weakest link in her chain.  Draw comparisons to similar male characters if you like, but if Sauron'd had a  motivation for evil that had been lifted straight from the script of *Mean Girls* I'd want him to be redeemed with a more interesting purpose and backstory too.
