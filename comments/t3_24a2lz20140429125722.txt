I disagree with this statement. I don't think people who have suffered the loss of their moms are trying to guilt moms. I can tell you it SUCKS to be a mom-less child in May. You see mother's day commercials and ads and you take like a whole day in school to make your mom something. Saying "Well just celebrate your grandma" isn't the same. The worst part is very much other kids in school saying, "But Twistedfork doesn't have a mom, what is she supposed to make?" 

I DID make things for my grandma or my dad or anyone else, but this SUCKS so much and people are completely unaware of it. The best time to raise awareness is mother's day.

On top of that my grandma died on my birthday, so every year all of my family says, "RIP MOM, also Happy Birthday Twistedfork!" and it is not at all as shitty as not having a mom on mother's day.
