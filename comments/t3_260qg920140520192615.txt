THANK YOU SO MUCH! I just came back from my appt and the gyno said that the IUD is in the right position. She peaked into the cervix opening a bit and found the strings right there. Apparently my IUD traveled up a bit and the strings aren't long enough to see. I definitely feel alot better now. 

However, I worry about the possibility if it coming out of position and me not noticing since I can't feel my strings. Is this a silly worry? My gyno said the only option was to remove it and insert a new one.
