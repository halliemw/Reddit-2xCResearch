I'd love your thoughts on this. I read about a cemetery in a book that was a "natural" cemetery. Instead of a tombstone, you'd be buried in a biodegradable casket and a sapling would be planted over your body (an ornamental tree since it is a cemetery). As you decompose your body nourishes the tree. I was making my will a while ago and I couldn't find a cemetery like that anywhere in my province (Ontario Canada). I'm not sure where you're based (though with that username...) but I'd love to see this idea become more popular. It strikes me as the ultimate selfishness of capitalism, we suck the earth dry and then when we die we seal our remains off from the world the earth so they can't return to where they belong.
