I never disagreed about Joel being important or not, but:

1) The main story is about and happens as a result of Ellie's condition.

2) The most important thing for both of them is that Ellie makes it to the Fireflies in one piece.

3) Joel would have died in Colorado if not for the superhuman effort of Ellie - Ellie never being in a situation where she would have died for certain without Joel.

4) Joel was a replaceable character, but Ellie was not:

4a) The story could have continued largely uninterrupted if Joel had died instead of Tess.

4b)The story could have continued largely uninterrupted if Joel had died at Tommy's dam or if Tommy had just taken Ellie, as Joel initially wanted.

With those being as they are, I can't imagine any way in which Joel is nearly as important.
