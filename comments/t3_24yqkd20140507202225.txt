Actually to be fair at the end he looked upset when he realised he had no friends. He is scum and really making people's lives worse but he is still a human it personally I think it's fair that he can have his opinions, even if they are moronic. What he needs to do is keep them to himself and not spurt out abuse. He is lonely and is a loser, perhaps he has just taken this "cause" as a horribly misguided way to feel involved in something, to have purpose, even if he goes about it in an abysmal fashion.
