I am a runner, and usually have large groups of middle schoolers to dodge on my way out of my neighborhood as leave school for the day. Kids are oblivious and kind of into themselves for the most part. Remember going to the same building EVERY day, seeing the SAME people, combined with insane hormones, feeling self-conscious, homework, and no outlet or alone time unless it's approved by your parents (in most cases)? Keep this is mind that their world is small. Yours is pretty much the world. Don't let 12 year old girls get into your head, you are a grown-ass woman. If you speak with a clear voice and announce "excuse me" with intent, you will hear your voice and remember you are no longer 12 and being bullied.
