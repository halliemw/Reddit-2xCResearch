This is why I don't understand how some guys prefer to chase one night stands. I feel like mind blowing sex is something that happens when you are connected with the person and you feel comfortable enough to let your inhibitions go. Granted, all of my FWB have either been ex bf's from a few years ago or a close guy friend that I had chemistry with, but nothing has been as good as when I was in a relationship.
