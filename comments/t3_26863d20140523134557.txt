You really shouldn't marry someone whose family you can't stand.  You WILL have to be a part of that family for the rest of your marriage.  It's pretty impossible to expect him to abandon the family that he loves, and what do you think is going to happen when/if you eventually have kids and they want to see their new grandchild/niece/nephew constantly, etc?

I think it's a really bad idea to marry him if you hate his family that much.  If they were just mildly annoying that would be one thing but this is bad enough that I don't think your marriage would have any chance of working out in the long run.
