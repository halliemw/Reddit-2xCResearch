I agree with you on that. After reading the girl's blog post, I'm not even sure any of the fathers actually complained. I'm not saying the dads weren't creepy as hell (it says as much in the blog post), but it sounds more like this one lady being a shitty person and simply using the dads as an excuse to get the girl kicked out.
