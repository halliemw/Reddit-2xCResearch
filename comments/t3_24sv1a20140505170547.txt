I went to my first one this past weekend (Wino de Mayo!) and it turned out to be a LOT of fun. Some of it you could tell were people wanting to hook up, but I feel like a made a few good girlfriends (and having grown up as a tomboy and having mostly man-friends, this was good for me!). Definitely would recommend!
