It takes a lot of practice (and some very patient women) before a man becomes reasonably competent at oral sex. Without sounding snide, that is a complicated piece of equipment you've got there. Especailly compared to the one we're used to working with.

And even after all that, it's still not a 100 percent thing. What women like varies so much that the perfect technique for one of you will leave another anxious to just move on.

What you have to do is communicate. Now you can go the straight-foward route, like you're guiding a carrier approach for a fighter plane (*a little to the left, up some, faster, too fast, no too slow now, there is it... whooops need to switch it up now*), you can do the horse-riding method (use your thighs and your hand on top of his head and basically just push him around), and/or you can use the "pre-game warmup and post-game breakdown" where you talk him into position, then tell him afterwards what was nice and what wasn't. Personally I preferred all three, but this was something I really wanted to learn.

Now some guys will get upset by this. It's possible they'll get so frustrated they just won't want to do it. Be patient. Make sure they know *they're* not the failure, it's just, again, a very complicated skill. Think about how long you fiddled around with your thing before you finally got the fireworks.

But to be perfectly honest, this is a favor that you are doing for him. And you should treat it as such. Don't feel bad, never ever feel bad, about expressing what you like. 

Some of the most powerful orgasms my partners have experiened have come from oral sex. (I've certainly never feared for my life during PIV intercourse, anyway.) So it is worth it in the end.
