What a lucky guy. He got a doormat that also swallows! I think she seems like she wants to keep her husband happy, but she also seems to look down on other women. I want to know if she has a job on top of being the endlessly putting-out, shutting-up model wife with 3 kids that she says she is. That marriage doesn't seem like a partnership, and if she's cool with that, good for her. I hope her husband treats her just as well.
