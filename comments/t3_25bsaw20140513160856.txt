I'm glad you found something in my comment.  I've never had anybody in my life commit suicide, so I can't imagine how you feel.  But I have been in a similar situation as your husband.  Depression can be difficult for people to understand because it's so irrational.  The most accurate depiction I've seen was this comic:

There are times I get depressed when everything else in my life is perfect.  There isn't anything another person can do or say.  The sadness isn't rational so it's not something that you can be talked out of.  And it's not something that other people can easily see.  Unfortunatly, it seems like people who suffer from depression avoid getting help.

As for driving around.  It helped me avoid the situation, which was what I needed at the time.  But what really helped me move on was sharing my feelings with family and friends.  Nobody would blame you for taking some time off or secluding yourself but there will have to come a time when you have to face the situation.  Running away might help for a little while but the pain has a way of following you.  

It won't be easy and everybody grieves in their own way.  But you're strong and you're making the right decisions by asking for advice and support.  It will be difficult but you're not going through this alone.  Feel free to PM me if you ever need somebody to talk to.
