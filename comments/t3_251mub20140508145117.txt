I live in Quebec and we recently tried to pass a "Charter of Religious Values" where religious symbolism was banned in government jobs, schools, hospitals, social services etc. It was largely seen as a move to ban women from wearing the hijab.

Many feminist groups applauded the Charter as a move in the right direction but personally, as a feminist myself, felt disgusted by that notion.

Muslim women in Quebec are liberated & educated women. It came across as demeaning and condescending. Take a Doctor, a woman who educated herself to the highest degree, being told by a bunch of women with B.A.'s that she just doesn't "get it". That they are saving her from what she can't possibly understand. Horribly insulting and quite anti-feminist if you ask me. I don't like the hijab either but I respect any woman's choice to wear one. Who the fuck am I to tell someone otherwise.
