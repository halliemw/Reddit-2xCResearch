I think what he needs to understand (as far as lying by omission goes) is that if he doesn't want you to find out about whatever he is doing, then he really shouldn't be doing it.  That's the way I handle relationships, to be honest.  It has never failed me.  There are no "loopholes".  I remember arguing with people in college who would stay up all night in somebody's dorm "just talking" with somebody who wasn't their SO and trying to say it wasn't cheating.  But they certainly didn't want to get caught at 4 AM talking about deep emotional topics, either.

He needs to understand what your limits are.  I think you're right in that this is a speed bump and not a wall.  You can move past this.  But if it happens again, you have precedence regarding the violation of your feelings and his agreement of honesty.
