Going off of what /u/Jenalou said, perhaps local Planned Parenthoods could agree to maintain a list of volunteers who will be hosts? That way the volunteering and organizing could be done via PP and the woman in need could call the PP she is most likely to go to (say, closest city in the nearest state where it's far easier to get an abortion, or closest city with a clinic) and get a list of people straight away. This is kind of a PP-heavy approach and would probably be really complicated to get all of them on board, and I'm not sure how your site would fit in, but it would be a nice way for those of us without a lot of volunteering time on our hands to still help somehow.

EDIT: I wrote this from the perspective of an Oregonian so I am realizing that it might not be realistic in a lot of states, although I can't say for sure. In light of this I like the "Den mother" idea best.
