Is she interested in any physical activities? Sports, dance, riding or anything? If so, encourage her to be involved. It is a huge help to girls her age to appreciate their bodies for what they can DO, not just how they look. This will also increase her confidence and help her form a concrete sense of self worth. Add in positive peer relationships and role models (this is where you make sure the group she joins provides these), and she should get through the tough years just fine.
