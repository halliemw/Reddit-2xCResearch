The scariest birth control myth I read regularly is the persistent idea that birth control is made with Progesterone. Your Huffington Post piece correctly uses the term 'progestin' for the not-exactly-progesterone that is used in 'hormonal' preparations, but I think a lot of doctors confuse their patients by calling the chemicals in the various formulas 'Progesterone'. 

This myth causes much confusion about the difference between natural hormones and hormonal drugs (manmade chemicals that influence the hormone system). [Real Progesterone USP protects against traumatic brain injury](http://protectiii.com/), while [fake-progesterone/Provera/medroxyprogesterone-acetate causes strokes](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/257k1d/birth_control_and_you_what_you_need_to_know_but/cheng50) (this 2xc poster's mini-stroke was within a week of her depot-provera injection).

Another myth that I constantly run across is that birth control "regulates" the menstrual cycle. It is more proper to say that combined pills work by suppressing the glands in the brain that drive the cycle. But "regulate" sounds nice and sells well, so that's the term that gets used. 

This myth about 'regulation' is particularly tragic, because most young women's menstrual difficulties would respond nicely to an intervention based on physiology (progesterone USP supplementation to treat anovulatory cycles/'luteal phase defect'), rather than pharmacology (birth control until menopause). I am specifically thinking of a woman I met whose doctor started her on birth control when she was 12 years old. Now, at 24, she is on a "4 'periods' a year" product, which is better than regular birth control because she's only disabled for a week-every-three-months instead of a week-a-month. I asked "what was going on in your life when you were 12?" - her big drama then was an emotionally-abusive step father. Stress is a potent hormone disruptor that cannot be addressed with a pill.

You asked, hope this helps.
