This is good advice- my mother had me at a late age and suffered terrible post partum after I was born. She always suffered from depression/anxiety during her life and this just made everything 10 times worse.  I ended up being cared for by one of her cousins (a woman with many of her own children and who ran a day care center) for two weeks as an newborn.  My mom got better, and everything turned out fine, but she told me how much she was struggling to even admit that she needed help or to ask for help- she felt super guilty and it made the situation even worse. So please, do what you can to take the baby for a little bit (grandparents? aunts/uncles?) and let her rest, and make sure she is seen by her doctor if she needs any short term medication to get her back on her feet.
