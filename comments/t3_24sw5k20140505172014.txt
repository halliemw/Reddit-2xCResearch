Thank you. I really hope I come out of this without feeling dampened.  Right now I just know that none of this is on me. I was a great girlfriend to him and he is the idiot who never realized what he had nor the time to value it. He was extremely selfish, and maybe I didn't see it because I was compensating. Either way, i'm better off.  I just have to keep moving forward.
