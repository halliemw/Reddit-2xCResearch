This kind of thing used to happen to me a lot. I act happy, interested, friendly, and the guy thinks we are on to something extra. Then I have to try to let him down gently once it becomes awkward, and it's nearly impossible to be friends after that. Fuck me for being nice, right?

Many different guys have told me that guys are not capable of having a woman friend without the thought cross their minds ... Likely there are exceptions but enough unrelated guys have trusted me with this wisdom that I generally believe it to be true if nothing else as a defense mechanism. 

Unfortunately (or perhaps for the better) I adjusted my approach to be up front that we can be friends and only friends right up front. I learned it was easier to set expectations early on and even be cold because then guys accept me for "that's just the way she is" which is easier than having to break it to them later.

Yeah, it's messed up that I went from a person who is super bubbly and friendly to everyone, to a guarded bitch because I got tired of letting guys down gently which is never easy, but it seems to be easier on everyone this way. In fact, some of my favorite guy friends were made by deflecting flirtation, in that they continued to hang even after I made it clear I was not interested in sex, so they remained friends because they like me, not just want to bone me.
