The money depends greatly on where you live. I bought my .45 glock in Colorado for 500 bucks. A box of hollow point ammo was cheap. No range time required in Colorado, but I have had my fair share. I'm not sure what the ccw permit costs there anymore but its relatively cheap. You can get a decent concealable gun for under 300 dollars. I just recommend it, because the more good people with firearms, means less bad people with them. But they really aren't for everyone. My wife will never pick up a gun no matter how much I try to convince her. Some people just don't like them at all.
