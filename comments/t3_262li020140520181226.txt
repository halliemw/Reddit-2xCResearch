I don't understand why the blame is put on the teenage boys. I don't think they are the ones complaining. I would assume the school got complaints from the parents of both boys and girls. 

Maybe the best way to move forward would to have the student's talk to their parents. Maybe if 5-10 complaints about the old dress code was enough to get the administration to change in the first place, 50-100 calls might get them to reconsider or loosen up in general.

Also, I'm assuming this is a public school? If it's a private school I don't think anything is likely to happen.
