I wouldn't advise you to try and convert yourself: religions are things that fill the holes in your life or something that you're raised into. With my SO, who was religious, we ended up discussing faith issues very openly and without confrontation. This hasn't made us agree on all topics, but we've lost the animosity between each other that used to exist before we had found our ground. This took the better part of a year. I think you should try engaging in more relaxed conversations - exploring his issues that he has with your beliefs. If he's unwilling I can't say I would keep trying in your place. The bit about Satan tempting him with you is cold. To me, it devalues you having your own agency and beliefs and replaces you with a puppet of the devil. I feel like this is a thing that, once said, should be addressed. Anyway, do what you feel is right.
