ITT: people talking about how scars are horrible.

My mother had several moles removed (on her back), and, while there is scarring, it doesn't look bad at all. Scars are just tissue that grew in place of a wound, there's nothing bad or ugly or horrible about them even when they're excessive.

I have scars on my face and no fucks are given here - scars aren't bad. So if you want to remove your nevus birthmark, consult with a dermatologist. They might provide you with much better information than just a family doctor.
