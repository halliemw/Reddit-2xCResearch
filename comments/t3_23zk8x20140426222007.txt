This is great advice.  The internal voice of guilt is such a hard thing for all moms to deal with.  
I would add that if OP can't get away, she could do done things SHE enjoys with her child.  Three year olds love to be included and they are easy enough to take along.  Me time doesn't have to be alone or kid free time.
