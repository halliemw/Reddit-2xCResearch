It hasn't really killed my sex drive (lowered it a bit, but could be stress or other factors as well), but sex is painful on it.  I didn't realize that was a common side effect.  The vaginal dryness is killer too.  What did you end up switching to, and did it go better?  Going to see a new doctor soon and not quite sure what I want yet.
