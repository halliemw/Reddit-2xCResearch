Not all birth control pills are the same and the last week of pills are not necessarily the placebo pills. Read the package insert carefully! Sometimes the last week of pills contains most of the hormones needed to prevent pregnancy. The placebo pills may be in the middle or there may not be a whole week of them. Make sure you're skipping the right pills if you decide not to take the placebo pills.
