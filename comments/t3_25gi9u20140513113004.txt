It's a shame that so many people will fight so hard to keep breast sexualized.  What you are doing is one of the most beautiful experiences a mother can have.  I still have nursing dreams and they are indescribably sweet.  Just keep enjoying your baby and hope that you aren't having to commiserate with someone 20 years from now.  It's time to put this issue to bed.
