If this is the video I'm thinking of, a LOT of my religious friends posted about this recently and were pretty vile. They linked from a website that was vile as well and said she filmed this to show how "cool" abortion is.

I'm as pro choice as anybody here and I don't know if those were this girls words or the nasty site's but regardless, I don't think abortion would ever be considered "cool." It can be a lot of things and it can be a miracle of science and it can be a life-saving procedure and it can be just about whatever you want it to be but cool feels like the wrong word.

Editing to add: I can't watch the video OP posted because it's not available in my country so I'm just going to have to assume for now unless someone has a mirror
