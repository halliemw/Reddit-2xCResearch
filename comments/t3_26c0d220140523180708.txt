This is pretty normal for a lot of kids. A friend of mine and his brother experimented orally on each other, which he confided to me in tears one night. I reassured him that kids are unaware of a lot of boundaries, and being so young and without fully developed sexuality, the intent isn't there from where we are after puberty. I remember the neighbor girl and I (male) mutually doing innocent experimenting. I remember having her touch me because it felt funny, and I was probably 5 or 6, but I can assure you I had NO idea what was going on, it just felt funny. Without the development of secondary sexual characteristics the human brain isn't processing information in the same manner as an adult. To assure you somewhat, a thing to be remembered is the change that happens over time to memories as well. From your description this is something that you simply can't believe/don't want to believe happened, and you have every valid right to your feelings, I simply implore you to let it pass, as your mind over time has also made this situation more vivid and painful than it needs to be. You are normal, and not crazy to feel strong feelings, but I guarantee that you must spend absolutely no more time worrying about this distant memory. Kids experiment, that other kid was terrifying for you at the time, I mean an eight year old from a six year old's perspective is basically an adult! Put perspective on it, this was a little kid being a dickish but normal little kid. I f anything I'd say you got bullied. I have now written far more than I thought I would, but I think it's because of the anguish I saw in my friend when he admitted his experimenting with his brothers. There is nothing wrong with you, nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to extract further from the imperfect human memory, and nothing about this that you should think on critically for one more second.
