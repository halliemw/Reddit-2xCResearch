Our "new" queue didn't used to have downvote/upvote ratios so close to even. That discourages people from submitting posts and decreases their visibility. 

I'm not sure about these googlable results. Maybe the new queue has changed significantly in the last hour since you posted. The questions seem to be about breast tissue in weird places, IUD+sex and grand jury. For all three, they were asking people to share experiences. In the former, the poster actually expressed that she had had difficulty figuring out how to google for more information, and she received information that helped her learn more!
