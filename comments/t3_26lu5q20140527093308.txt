I can relate to this. I'm short and curvy, I have a flat stomach but thicker legs and flab on my arms, I am not toned by any means. I wish I could be that person, the quinoa eating, running everyday person. I also eat relatively well and do yoga, but I like my pizza and my BEER. Oh god do I like my beer. I like creamy coffee and cappuccinos and real sugar. So yes. I feel that way. I feel totally conflicted and I get it. Some days I feel great and other days I wish I could commit to getting in shape but honestly, I'm pretty sure even supermodels feel great about themselves sometimes and other days not so much. Chin up, amigo.
