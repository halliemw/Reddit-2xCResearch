Yes! Well it will make you happy to hear that all of what you said feels very familiar.  I brought myself down a lot too even when i was trying to be positive.  Now I can just be positive and not weigh myself down. It's weird to explain but it definitely made a difference in my life.  It's not like immediate though, you have to give it time. After a few cycles it will start to get better.
