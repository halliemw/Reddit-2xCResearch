Yeah I wish my SO would say something like that to his parents,  but I havent tried to prod him in that direction because they're his parents, his problem. Im okay with whatever my SO wants to do as far as communication goes, and my SO and I have both agreed we dont want our child in their house or alone with his mom. As far as the baby shower goes, he doesnt care either way and said it's up to me.
