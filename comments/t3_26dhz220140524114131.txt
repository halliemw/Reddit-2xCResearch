It's cheating. 

>if he truly loved me he wouldn't have hurt me like this

That is true.

> I don't deserve this and deserve someone who would not even think about doing this to me

Also true.

If you want to fix it, you can certainly try. There are plenty of couples who have moved forward from such incidents. But it's not going to be easy. Relationships are founded on trust and you can't trust him anymore. I would suggest you guys get some counseling.
