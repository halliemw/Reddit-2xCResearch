I completely agree, I don't think one HAS to play with an action figure that is the same gender as the player, although I do think it is helpful to have female action figures that are a positive representation of powerful women.  One of the reasons I find these so exciting is they would be great for boys to play with, and I can totally see one or two of them on a shelf or in a toy box with some Batmans, Transformers, Hulks, WWF fighters or whathaveyous.  Like the [example image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/001/976/270/db1ac1f793c523dae71bfde99264006f_large.png?1399430234) on their kickstarter shows, a lot of existing female action figures are hyper-sexualized with focus on boobs, revealing/skimpy costumes, and makeup. These are not, and I'd be happy to see some boys playing with female action figures that put more emphasis on her abilities than her appearance.
