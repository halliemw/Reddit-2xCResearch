I think this example is different because the person who punched the other person broke the law. There wasn't anything the person who got punched chose to do that caused them to get punched (legally).

Assuming the sex that resulted in a pregnancy was a consensual act, I believe an argument would be that by choosing to have sex, you assume the responsibility of anything that results from that. This would include pregnancy and any complications.

However, a lawyer would be the one to ask since they would have knowledge about CA laws.
