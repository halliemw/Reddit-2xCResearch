Thank you for all the help. I will definitely check out that link. I do believe he needs to get out of the area, convincing him of that may be nearly impossible.

I'm sorry I was unclear, he is her father and not mine. My sister does not trust her father. He thinks that she is making these problems up. When she was 4, she made a comment that he touched her in a bad way, but my mother did not push the issue after reporting it and no charges were made. Her father left the state after this.
The courts still placed her with him because that was not brought up in court due to lack of evidence, and he was a "non offending parent".

I cannot blame her for the pain she feels. She has issues from our mother but at the same time has lost the family she has been near her whole life and essentially has moved with a stranger. I don't know what to do to help her, and it's killing  me everyday.
