The bride put HERSELF in a bad position by sending somebody a save the date card she didn't intend to invite to the wedding.

OP has every right to ask the bride what's going on without feeling that it's an imposition. If the bride didn't want to be questioned about invitations, she should have checked her save the date list more carefully.
