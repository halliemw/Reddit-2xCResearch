Age is one important variable (anyone denying that is lying), but since it is one you have no control over there is no point worrying about it. There are lots more productive things to focus on, and there is *absolutely* a lot of opportunity for someone at 30.

That simply isn't a productive philosophy. There is no 'supposed to' in life. You have to take responsibility and face that you might just happen upon someone who you match really well with, but realistically you can improve your chances. I'm not saying you have to resort to behaviour you don't respect, but you can (and perhaps already are?) do a lot to increase your chances of meeting someone you like.

Keep active. Keep fit (or get fit, if you are not). Don't focus too much on not having someone, but make sure you are enjoying your life with or without someone. If you want to meet people, you need to make the effort to put yourself in social situations. Join a social group relevant to what you enjoy. A hiking club? A book club? Whatever you enjoy, there are surely other people out there who enjoy it too, so just make sure you push yourself to join them when possible. If you find that whatever you are doing doesn't satisfy you, then you need the courage to move on. I know that is far easier said than done, but the reality is that life isn't easy. It's hard and it doesn't always work out. You have (probably) just one shot at it though, so if you acknowledge that you have sufficient reason to go out there and do something about it.

You don't have to do anything I mentioned, and you may end up lucky. But if you do the above then it surely increases your chances.
