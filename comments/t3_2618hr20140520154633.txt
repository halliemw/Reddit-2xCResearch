>  I honestly have never received any sort of mean or negative PMs.

I've only gotten one and it was after the Sub became a default sub.

It was hilarious because the sender actually asked me to send them naked pic and said that they had "researched my posts" and felt like we would "click" and they also tried to "order" me to do things.

IF they HAD actually researched me, they would have found that I am a 55 yr old mother of 3 who needs to loose a bunch of weight.

I got a good chuckle.
