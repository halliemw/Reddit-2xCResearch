I can completely understand where you're coming from. I won't say that every single fashion choice someone else makes makes me comfortable, I am personally fairly reserved in my own clothing choices, but I think If we as a society pick and choose what clothing pieces are acceptable and what is not acceptable, we really can become demeaning and patronizing.

It's also incredibly hypocritical, when certain looks, such as the really high cut short, are not universally hated, but for some reason tights are. I don't get it.  I don't think either should be an issue, but I have seen plenty of girls' butt cheeks coming out of shorts and no one seems to care, but a pair of yoga pants in public is suddenly a major issue? It just seems like there is a huge double standard, and people should just be able to wear what makes them happy.
