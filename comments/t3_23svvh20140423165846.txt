I can understand that but I feel like even when you are looking for casual sex some kind of human decency should still be at play and would increase your chances of actually finding someone willing to hook up with you. I just don't see how "I want to tongue punch your fart box" would ever get anyone laid, that's not sexy. 

Edited to add: Also, I assume since she was on Tinder she was probably looking for casual sex too, that doesn't mean all social graces fly out the window and people can act like horny 4 year olds who have never interacted with other human beings before. 

People go to bars hoping to hook up all the time too but can you imagine if a guy walked up to a girl at a bar and the first thing he said to her was any of the messages shown here? 

If the first thing you even say to a person is "I want to stick my dick down your throat and lick your clit" or "lick it then let me stick it" you shouldn't be surprised when they react with "What the fuck is wrong with you?" 

Whatever happened to saying "Hi" first?
