My favorite to do is when someone says shit like that to me is sarcastically go, "Oh my god, thank you for noticing cos l did all this for you! Your opinion matters to me!"
But now that l am transitioning (ftm), it doesn't happen to me much. It still happens to others, and when l see it happening l give some great death stares.
