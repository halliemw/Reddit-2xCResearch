my pill (gianvi/yaz) has estradiol in it, which has consistently been linked to a little bump in your risk for cancer. my pill is also one that can cause complications to smokers (think circulatory, pulmonary problems). however, like any of my meds, the long-term risks do not outweigh the benefits for me, so perhaps check with your doctor to find out what your specific risks are on all sides so that you can find your best plan :)
