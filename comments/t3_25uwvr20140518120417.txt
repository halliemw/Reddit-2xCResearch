I agree with you, but they have much easier guidelines to follow.  I am pretty much terrified to post here anymore, which makes me incredibly sad because this was the only safe space for me to post about lady things.  I used to love IFF because it was the only place I could post a photo of myself without a bunch of comments about my body or how I look but now, even though those things are being deleted the OP still sees them.  I have self-esteem issues that I am currently in therapy for, so eventually I will have a thicker skin but wasn't that the point of a "safe space"?  

I have been posting here for a few years and I didn't make a fuss when the default happened because I wanted to give the mods the benefit of the doubt, even though they weren't addressing or reassuring the community of how things were going to work like the mods in other subs were.  But this really sucks.  I am still pretty sad.  This isn't a safe space anymore.
