As much as I wish this advice would work, I can tell you from a very lengthy background in customer service it simply doesn't. Where I work, we have a few younger women who've taken this approach. Some of the male customers (who are being flirtatious) decide that being "professional" is the same as being rude and go whine to the management staff about them.

Customer complaints, justified or baseless, can really become an issue if they happen frequently. It's bullshit, but I've seen it happen time and again.
