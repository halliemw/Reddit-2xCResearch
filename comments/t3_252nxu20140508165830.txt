As /u/puya_alpestris commented below, a Trigger Warning is an alert that the post contains references to or discussion of a topic that could cause someone to relive a traumatic instance, issue, or event in their life.  

This is intended to help anyone from people with epilepsy who may enter a seizure from a colorful/flashing video, to people trying to recover from self-harm/suicide attempts/eating disorders/alcoholism, to rape/sexual assault/incest/physical abuse survivors, to veterans with PTSD, to anyone who dealt with a serious trauma they could potentially revisit.  

It is not intended to just keep people from feeling sad about something, being triggered refers to a very traumatic event in itself. So, we try to avoid people having to revisit awful memories/relapse/etc. by giving a warning that a post contains potential triggers about a given topic.
