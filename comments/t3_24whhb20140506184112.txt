I've been there, done that. Honestly? Get the abortion. You will resent him if you don't just to appease him. You will likely break up as a result, even if it's a few years from now. Don't have a baby you're not ready for. If he can't understand that you are not happy to have this baby, he probably isn't for you. It's hard, I know. Stay strong and make the right choice for yourself. *HUGS*
