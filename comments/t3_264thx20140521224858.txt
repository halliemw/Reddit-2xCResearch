I was once married to this total asshole who NEVER used my name and only called me "babe".  He'd spit it, like it was an insult. 

Ex.: 
Me: "I think we should order pizza tonight." 
Him: "Oh, you think so? You think we should just spend some money and order a pizza?  Great idea, BABE, I'll get right on that," 

Being called "babe" sets off alarms in my head to this day, 4 years after I divorced that man.
