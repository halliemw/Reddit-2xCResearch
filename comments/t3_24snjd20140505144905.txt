Unmedicated bipolar disorder is hard to deal with. Like, really really hard. It's ok for you to say that you want him to see a therapist and at least get checked out so you can both be sure this is him and not his mood disorder talking. BPD isn't something that just goes away. It's something you have to manage for life, and I'd be wary of anyone who just stopped taking their medication and wasn't seeing a therapist. He needs to find a system that works for him, that's sustainable and keeps him stable. He should meet with a therapist and a psychiatrist and try to find a combination of drugs and therapy that he can continue for life. It may need tweaking as he ages, so he needs to find people he can build a solid relationship with.
