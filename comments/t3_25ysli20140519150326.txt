Plan B can be taken within 72 hours (decreases in efficacy the longer you wait.)

Sperm can't survive outside of the body for all that long. How long do you think he had sperm on his hands? The chances of pregnancy are so low.

As others have said, the symptoms you have now are not pregnancy symptoms. Implantation of an embryo occurs only 6-12 days after ovulation (5-11 days after fertilization.) The only chemicals/hormones an embryo could produce at this stage are [Early Pregnancy Factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_pregnancy_factor), which is an immune suppressor. I doubt it gives the side effects you're describing, which sound more like they'd be mediated by hcg, progesterone and the other classical pregnancy hormones that are only affected by pregnancy after implantation.

There's such a miniscule chance you would be pregnant - even people who are actively trying to get pregnant can take months to get pregnant. You should still be able to use Plan B, but I don't even know how worth it it would be. Talk to your pharmacist if you can.
