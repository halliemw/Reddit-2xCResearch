Well can you blame us? We have to be simultaniously dressed sexually enough to be found most attractive in our group of peers but not so scantily clad that we appear whorish. We have to behave as ladies and yet if we're too proper we become prudish or frosty. If we express our want for sex we're told thats slutty and we get hit on by creeps and men who veiw us as meat. If we say that we prefer celibacy we become "wife material" and only get hit on by men looking to immediately settle down or pushed into the friend zone never to reamerge. 

We have our heads and bodies and views twisted and distorted and we try endlessly to be what5 we think is desirable. So can you blame us if the only way we know to keep male attention is with a bit of complication?
