Each time a feminist starts overgeneralizing things against an entire gender, just be like "oh yeah I know what you mean, I hate how ALL WOMEN are just opinionated irrational bitches that lack objectivity and think only with their skewed emotions. There's never been one good woman in the lot of them."  
  
Oh wait, thats not funny when the shoe is on the other foot.
