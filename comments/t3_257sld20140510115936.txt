Thanks for your reply. I'm just curious how other women interpret it. To me ma'am = respect, politeness, etc. But to others it it seems to mean the same as calling them an old lady. 

In your situation I probably would have called you ma'am as well, especially since as a store worker you're the one in charge and taking care of things for me.
