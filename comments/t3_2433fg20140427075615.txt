I went new-used car shopping with my dad and it was interesting because the salesperson (a slightly pompous man) seemed a bit flustered about having to deal with me directly. My dad literally just sat back, arms crossed and talked to me while the guy was off doing something about things I should also check about. 

It was a good experience to be all assertive and get the answers I wanted, but also funny. I think his head broke when when we went from best features etc for the money to "yes I see how this car miiight be better, but I love the color on the other one so much more." They were trying to push a particular one on me, and having me not go for it because of such shockingly stupid thing like "color" -- you could see him seriously struggling to not be condescending about it.
