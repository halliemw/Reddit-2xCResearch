Thanks for your response.

At the root of these frustrations, though, are the prejudices that others have toward fat people. In order to make these frustrations go away those prejudices need to be extinguished. In order to extinguish those prejudices they need to be identified.

You might think those prejudices I've identified aren't as fundamental as one might identify, but to call the attempt irrelevant seems ... bizarre.
