As others have said, there's nothing wrong with what you're doing. You're contributing heavily to the household and are definitely not just sitting around all day.

The only thing that concerns me about this relationship is that I worry what would happen to you if the relationship went south. Traditional arrangements with a working husband and a stay at home wife are backed by the formal guarantees for marriage. If one partner does all the housework, thus allowing the other more time to earn money, they're both entitled to a share of the household wealth in the event of a divorce. Both partners are contributing, one through home labor, one through wage labor. 

In a boyfriend/girlfriend situation though, what protects you in the event you break up? That's what I worry about.
