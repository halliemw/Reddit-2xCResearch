Oh, I'm sorry, I don't think you understood my idea properly. "I'm against serial abortions" was in the sense of "I'm against morbid obesity": maybe 1% of the cases are purely genetic cases, but most cases could be relatively easily preventable with the right education. And to be clear, that comparison is just to explain the way I meant my initial statement, and the comparison itself is flawed.

The point is, regardless of my feelings on the matter, being against or for, I would not try to impose my personal views on someone else's body. I would still fight for their right to choose, even if it's irresponsible. Because responsibility might be taught, but it's still best learned with choices and the consequences that come with it. If you force a choice, you're taking away part of the learning.
