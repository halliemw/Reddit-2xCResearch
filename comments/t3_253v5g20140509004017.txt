Yeah, I took them because my symptoms for a yeast infection had gotten so bad overnight and I thought I was confident that it was like what I had last time, but now I have no idea ): I took 400mg of ibuprofen about twenty minutes ago because I'm having some pelvic pain which might be from cramps but it doesn't feel.. crampy? And it's localized to the right side so no idea what's going on.

I accidentally peeled just a little bit of the skin off because I thought it was residue but once I realized what it was I immediately stopped. I'll definitely try the ice. And yeah I definitely don't want to put anything else around or inside of myself :( Thank you so much for your reply though, I really appreciate it!!
