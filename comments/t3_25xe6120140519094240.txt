Mental illness is a widespread and very varying problem, it can be like OP's situation, ten times worse, or ten times milder. Not everyone that has a mental illness needs to be medicated or talking to a psychologist. I have depression and avoidant personality disorder, I don't take medication or see a doctor about either or them because I manage just fine. That doesn't make me undateable. There are probably a lot of people in your life that have mental illnesses that don't take treatment for it.

Op's partner most certainly needs to be seeing someone, however. 

Though I agree on your second paragraph, nice qualities do not outweigh the bad.
