Jeez, I'm 5'8" and am overweight at 180 lbs. 118 is actually underweight for your height according to a bmi chart, so I'm guessing it has to do with your pelvic tilt or something else. Almost everything online says the only way to get rid of it is diet and exercise if it's stored fat but I doubt that is your problem.
