As a female computer science major, articles such as this make me very nervous. I haven't experienced any direct discrimination in my coursework, but I often find I'm the only girl in the room and "bro culture" is definitely present. I plan to pursue software engineering, but I've decided I want to work at a larger company where there is more diversity.
