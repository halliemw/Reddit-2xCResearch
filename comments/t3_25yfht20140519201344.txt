Okay since we are doing spoilers now... the whole game is a tragic father-daughter story, both are hurt and feel like they can never trust again. Joel lost a daughter, Ellie lost a friend. Both of them were surrounded with death and refused to have real life relationships. Joel has this weird business partnership with Marlene and Ellie is just alone.

It is through the hardships they face together, they start to open up to each other and learn that they can trust again. If you think the story is about fungal zombies, you need to replay the game.
