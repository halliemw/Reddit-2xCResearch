Honestly I'm not sure this is the correct approach. I was bullied as a teen and people kept saying "oh they're just jealous" - of *what*? I knew it was bull because I couldn't see anything to be jealous of. I still don't think it's a jealousy thing now. Bullies bully because they are assholes. If it wasn't OPs sister it would be somebody else. Its "fun" and "cool" for them, and once they've established a target everyone else also wants to be "cool" and so picks on her too.

Telling her they are "jealous" probably will not make her believe it. Its the sort of thing adults say. But saying yeah, these are mean stupid assholes, she can believe that. And who cares what stupid assholes think?
