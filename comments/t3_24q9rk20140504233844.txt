Just to throw out something I didn't see addressed in the linked post: sometimes, when a woman tells a man "I have a boyfriend", the guy will back off *because he respects the woman's emotional connections*.  I think it's critical to recognize that the implicit "I am not on the market because I am already owned property" facet is absolutely real and problematic, and the solution - the woman clearly stating *her* wishes - is the best.  But as with everything in life, there are usually multiple, often contradictory layers to every problem.  Thus, to varying degrees, *some* (maybe a small few) men actually respect that a woman isn't interested in continuing with a situation because *she* is happy in her relationship.
