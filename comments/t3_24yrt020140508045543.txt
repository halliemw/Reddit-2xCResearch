I hate to call it this early in the game, but it's a lost cause.

There will be droves of women who still subscribe and post content here. The first twenty four hours will be a nightmare. There will be a bunch of morons parading around causing mayhem and generally being dicks.

In the first week things will even out a bit. It will feel a lot different here but you won't quite be able to put it into words. Where before it was a community of kind and like minded people (as much as anonymous internet communities can be), voting will start to reflect different ideals.

Mods will become overwhelmed with reported comments. A few will start slipping through the cracks here and there. A red piller suggesting the woman was "asking for it". A redditor telling you to calm down and questioning if you're on your period when you write about something passionately. 

It'll piss you off, but you feel like maybe it's only been one week and if you just wait a bit longer it'll go back to even keel.

What you don't realize is that one by one, slowly but surely, the quality people that had originally subbed to TwoX are being driven away. Those little comments that slip through the cracks will start to pile up. It will all snowball from there.

Soon it'll be wave after wave of quality posters leaving for elsewhere and for every one that leaves the ranks will swell with dozens of trolls to take their place.

Maybe the mods will catch on and undefault the sub, but I have no doubt that it will be too late. By that point tons of people will have left for whatever alternatives are out there and the things that once made this sub a safe and supporting place will have long been dead and buried.

RIP, TwoX.
