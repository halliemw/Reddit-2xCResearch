The behavior you're describing is verbal coercion. Here's some research (yay research!) on this topic: a recent study on sexual aggression notes that it occurs when the aggressor overwhelms a partner "with continual arguments and pressure" or by "showing displeasure by sulking, making [the partner] feel guilty, swearing, getting angry, or threatening to end the relationship" (Abbey & Jacques-Tiura, 2011). Unfortunately, this is a common tactic - about 1/3 of the 452 men surveyed in the study reported using verbal coercion is obtain sex. These verbally coercive men were found to have *more hostile attitudes towards women* and scored *higher on psychopathy-related personality traits*. In other words, men who use verbal coercion are significantly psychologically different from men who do not use any form of sexual aggression. 

What your ex does may not be on the extreme end of sexual assault, but he's coercing you into compromising your bodily autonomy. It's not good for your well-being. Oh, and you are *not* overreacting - I know there's a lot of pressure to ignore or "not make a big deal" out of sexual coercion like this, but trust your gut feelings (not the one saying you should be angry at yourself, of course). If you feel like you're not consenting to having sex with him (and by consent, I mean enthusiastically agreeing to sex), then it's not consensual.
