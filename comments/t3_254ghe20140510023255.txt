I don't have PCOS, but I do have some symptoms that are similar to PCOS symptoms, so I feels you. I have under-chin hairs and sideburns that I shave every morning. I can't epilate, though; I get ingrown hairs like a bitch!

I still wear my hairs up, though; I'd have a really rough time of it if I wore it down! It's way too long for that.
