So I briefly skimmed and most comments have been in regards to having periods rather than giving birth. On giving birth, I hesitate to describe "what it's like" because after reading your responses it seems that, at least on some level, you mourn for an experience you can never have? Maybe I'm way off base, but I just don't want to hurt or offend. So, in short: It's stressful, and amazing, and gross, and fulfilling, and exhausting. But, the good news is that the part after childbirth, child rearing- parenthood, you can experience that. And that, too is stressful, and amazing, and gross, and fulfilling, and exhausting. It changes you in ways you never imagined and puts everything in perspective. It makes you a better person. 
Good luck in your transition!
