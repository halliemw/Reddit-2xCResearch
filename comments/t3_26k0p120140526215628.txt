>Does he let you have access to his facebook?

I'm going to disagree with this one, only because I'm married to someone who, if I straight up asked him, would give me access to facebook, but we value our privacy in our messages, so we don't go through it, and he would be upset if I asked for it for no obvious reason. However...

>Does he take his cell everywhere, even into the shower with him?

THIS, OP. And anyone else reading. This this this. If your SO will never even leave their phone sitting on a couch for a minute while they run to another room or go pee, it's a red flag. I say this as someone who used to be a frequent cheater.

And as a former cheater, not inviting your SO to places with you like weddings and outings with friends, or family events, is an sign of someone living a "double life" and/or not intending you to be a permanent fixture in their life.
