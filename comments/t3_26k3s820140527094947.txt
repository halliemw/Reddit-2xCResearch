Here's the thing: 

You need to figure out how to hear a story about a woman being raped, or complaining about getting catcalled, or whatever, and not make it all about yourself and your feelings, instead of theirs.

I understand why you feel that way - I'm a white woman, and when I first started doing anti-racism work, I was really uncomfortable, felt guilty, got defensive, and said some things where I made it all about MY PAIN instead of really just listening to what it's like to live as a black/latino/asian/etc. person in our society. 

At some point, you just have to 
1) realize that it's not about you or your feelings
2) let go and just really listen without getting defensive, making it clear that you care about the issue, and are willing to see their perspective
3) try to live your life in the best and most-self-aware way possible, so you don't contribute to the problem. 

EDIT: 
I feel like I should re-emphasize that the feelings you have are totally normal and reasonable, just not always productive to share in that moment with the woman talking about sexism.

Sometimes it really helps to talk about your feelings with another person from your group who has made more progress than you have (i.e., me talking to another white person who does anti-racist work, or you talking to another dude who's into feminism). That way you can process your feelings without being a diva and minimizing the focal problem.
