I did know of a situation where one friend (K) sent another (M) invites to an engagement party, a save the date, the shower, and a sort of bachelorette party that was well in advance of the wedding. M never acknowledged any of the invites (not even sending regrets), so I think K figured she wasn't interested and didn't send a wedding invite. They were mostly party acquaintances / friend of friends, so neither of them were particularly offended by the situation.  But that's the only time I've heard of it.
