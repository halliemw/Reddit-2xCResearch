A shorter amount of time. I don't want to spend to long time talking online because you won't have anything to talk about in person when you're feeling things out. And when you have nothing to talk about its harder to get a feel for a person, I rather see how they react  in person then trying to guess in text. I always have the first meet at a public place and tell some one where I'm going.
