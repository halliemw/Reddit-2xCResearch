Thanks for the advice, I won't rush. Haha, I still think 93 is a little old to be fathering a child, though maybe this fellow will live far into his hundreds. I'm most concerned I guess with looking at it from the child's perspective-- how much time would the child have with her/his father? How will eventual retirement affect child rearing (maybe it would be positive?). Just things that. My bf is in good shape, we go on lots of hikes and I think he will stay young in mind and body for a while, but I just need to really consider all the factors..
