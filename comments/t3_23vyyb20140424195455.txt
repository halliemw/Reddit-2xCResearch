Isn't the university opening themselves up to all kinds of litigation by kicking someone out when he's not been found guilty of a crime? It opens the door for someone to accuse someone of being a thief, rapist, vandal, whatever and having them kicked out of university without the person actually being a criminal. Even apart from the legal backlash, that would make it so their university is less attractive to potential students if they know they can just be called a criminal and expelled without actually being guilty of a crime.

I'm not saying he didn't do this, but I can completely see why the university isn't just decided to expel him. I'm not sure if maybe she just decided not to pursue it criminally or if there just wasn't enough evidence, but the best thing would have been to pursue it that way. It's an impossible position for the university to be in, they are basically the bad guy either way.
