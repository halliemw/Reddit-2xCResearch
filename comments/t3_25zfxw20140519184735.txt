I'm not a mom, but mine didn't tell me anything. All I knew was what my friends told me. After I got my first period, she called my dad (talk about embarrassing). Then she bought a book and gave it to me maybe a week later. That's what *not* to do.

I think you should open communication lines now. Something like "I know you haven't gotten it yet, but I want you to be prepared" to start. Tell her everyone matures at different rates. Make sure there's a stash of pads and tampons in her bathroom or bedroom, and put a few in her purse/backpack/school locker just in case. I got my first at school and had to ask a friend for supplies.

I love that you already tell her about your period. She needs to know it's perfectly natural and that she can come to you (or an aunt or grandmother) with any questions.
