You seem confused about why you are getting down votes, so I will do my best to explain why this might be happening. 

Since this sub became default, there are many people reading this who have little knowledge about women's issues and the day to day experience of living as a woman in our society. Personally I think this is a great thing, and I am glad that you are here asking questions. The problem is, the question that seems original to you is actually one that many many people have when encountering feminism, so it's not an especially interesting jumping off point for discussion among a group of people who by-and-large identify as feminists. The downvotes you are getting are *not* because you're being perceived as a baby-killing satan-worshipper. It is actually downvotes being used as they should be: "this post doesn't contribute to this conversation". Not because you are evil, but because from how you phrased your question, you don't sound like you know very much about feminism or the gender egalitarian movement. 

The purpose of this sub is not primarily education. It's primarily used as a place to discuss women's issues from a women's perspective. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but if you keep this in kind hopefully the downvotes situation will be less mystifying.
