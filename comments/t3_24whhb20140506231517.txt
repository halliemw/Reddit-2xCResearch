I can't even begin to imagine what you're going through!  

Maybe if you can make the conversation with your boyfriend not directly about an abortion, but about the ramifications of NOT having an abortion, that might make him see it in a different light?

e.g. if you were to have this baby, ask him who he foresees being the primary stay-at-home parent?  I assume that you don't want this responsibility at this point in your life, so therefore ask him if he's prepared to put his career on hold until the child is old enough for school.  

Good luck!
