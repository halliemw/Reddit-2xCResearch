Look, any lady who puts up a profile on a dating site gets guys who respond with dick pics and crude comments. Hell all you'd have to be is a female online and get dick pics and crude comments. I think you're taking this -way- too seriously. 

What she's doing is taking a juvenile request and making a juvenile response. She herself has even admitted it's childish and immature. Is it going to solve the problem? no. Will it change how men and women relate to one another? no. Will it cure cancer and reverse global warming? No.  Do I personally find this one person's response to tacky messages sent to her online personals profile hilarious? Yup! 

I don't think this girl hates guys. She was looking for guys to hook up or date with after all. If you're a woman vulgar first time messages are common, and tiresome, so I get her annoyance. You got every right to not see the humor in this situation though... if that's what you wanna do. I don't see it as anything more than a bit silly.
