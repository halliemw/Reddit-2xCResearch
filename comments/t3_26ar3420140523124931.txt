Totally agreed. Where I currently work there are people with crazy colored hair (blue, pink, whatever), mohawks, shaved heads, etc, giant ear holes, eyebrow piercings and a whole lot of visible tattoos. This is probably the ONLY office environment I've worked in that's like this. Most offices do not appreciate any of the above.
