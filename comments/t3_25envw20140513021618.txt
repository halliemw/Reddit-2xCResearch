I'm a dude and I've been on TwoX for over 2 years now. It's a big place. Some people will say you're welcome, some will say you aren't. Some will educate you about serious, legitimate issues faced by women that you never even considered, others will make outlandish claims and defend them with dismissive arrogance.

Stick around and you'll learn a lot, but most of all you'll learn that the women here are like people everywhere - highly diverse in opinion, personality, experience, and interest in you.
