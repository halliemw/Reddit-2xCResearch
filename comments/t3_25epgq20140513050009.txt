>This happened about two months ago and I let him get away because I thought the police would just dismiss it as nothing

Reading the whole ordeal, it feels like it's not his first try, nor his last, rapists like him believe how they act "a normal behaviour". I don't actually know what the police would/can do in your case, but too many times the people victims of assaults believe it's not worth going to the police because they think the police doesn't care; in fine it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Did you report him or not? I'm not sure after reading your edit. Even if they can't do anything, maybe someone else has or will report him too, and it could help build a case against him.
