FYI: women with endometriosis on average spend like 10 years trying to figure out what's wrong before being diagnosed with endo. Not to discourage you, but you may find a doctor who isn't interested in diagnosing you with endo and will dismiss the idea. As you probably know, the only real way to diagnose you is via a laparoscopy. If your doc seems skeptical or dismissive of you, you should go to another doctor. Since you're having to pay yourself, you may want to pre-screen doctors--when you call to make the appointment, ask if s/he has experience with treating endo, before you ever make the appointment.
