Having overnight visitors in the house right after baby comes home would probably be a hindrance, especially if she's trying to breastfeed (there's a lot of toplessness involved.) I'd tell your brother that you want to see them as soon as it's convenient for them- maybe in a few weeks. Then when you come to stay for the night, bring dinner. People with new babies LOVE when you bring dinner.

Until then, if the budget allows, send a gift, like a box of diapers via Amazon or a basket of baked goods from a local bakery. My brother-in-law never gave us a gift for our baby and I thought it was kinda weird, like he didn't appreciate what we were going through. The truth is he's just socially awkward and has no idea when gifts are appropriate, but it's a really nice gesture.
