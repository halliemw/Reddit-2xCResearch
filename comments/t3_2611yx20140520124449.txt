I definitely let others talk to me and engage in small but genuine conversation (at least from my part). This is when they sound like they're trying to put me down. I don't know how, but they find a way.
I try to be an honest person in general, and only give out compliments when I truly feel the need to (not often), so I'm pretty sure they always seem honest and true.
