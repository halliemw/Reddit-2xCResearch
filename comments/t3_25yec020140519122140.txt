There's an old saying: "If you want to be remain friends with someone, avoid talking about politics or religion." I've found it to be generally true that if you want to avoid drama in casual conversation, topics that can be construed as political like feminism are generally best avoided.

I'm not sure why this bothered you so much, honestly. If there wasn't a need for you to write that paper, you wouldn't have written it. So why be so angry when you run straight into the need for your paper? Why not look at it as an opportunity to teach people about the lessons learned in your paper, instead of writing them off as ignorant schlubs?
