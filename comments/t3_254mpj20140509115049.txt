This sounds so terrible, sorry  you had a bad experience. I know the blood is humiliating when you can't control it and they may have not seen it as priority to take care of the issue. Not as intense as your story since definitely not as medically complicated but experiencing a miscarriage and waiting in the ER I experienced similar humiliation, I had layered many many pads, donned lined pants and was bleeding all over the ER waiting room, trying to change my position so I wouldn't mess through my pants and going to the bathroom constantly and passed out before they brought me in to clean me up and take care of the issue. 

However they probably should have cleaned you up before getting the order to d/c the foley. Shit is bananas, and also respected your privacy
