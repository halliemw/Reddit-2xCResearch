I'm not sure if it was Sovaldi specifically, but I believe she was considering taking some drug that could potentially cure her HepC.  

However, her biopsies revealed significant cirrhosis, so there's a higher chance it wouldn't work, and also apparently would make her very sick for several months?

My sister is a nurse. She does stay on top of her medical options, though she has a bad habit of convincing herself of self-serving bullshit and spewing it as fact sometimes.
