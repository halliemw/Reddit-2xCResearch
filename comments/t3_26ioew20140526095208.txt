Don't spend all your time trying to get a boy! And if you do happen to start dating someone, don't spend all your time with them. I lost some wonderful friendships in high school to relationships, and looking back on it even they say that they wish they hadn't spent so much time together.

Hanging out with "uncool" kids who are fun and easy to be around is so much more fun than grasping onto the edges of a more "popular" group. 

Grades do matter. Test scores do matter. You shouldn't be spending all your time studying of course, but there should be a balance that is slightly in favor of schoolwork. My philosophy during high school was to do all the fun shit I wanted (for example I went to concerts a lot during the school year, even on school nights), BUT during free time when I wasn't doing anything I would get my work done. This allowed me to almost never be caught doing work at the last minute, get good grades, and have fun in high school!
