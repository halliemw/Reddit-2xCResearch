Why isn't there a "suit" for women? Now personally I hate suits, and don't tend to wear dresses either. But for those who like formal wear, or will deal with it when it's expected, what would it take to have the equivalent of the generic suit for women to wear, and not worry about anything other than that it fits their size and shape?
