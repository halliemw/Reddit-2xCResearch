What was suggesting is that it's possible for someone (I hope everyone) to stick up for themselves in a situation like that because I know it from experience, and that it doesn't have to be hard. It shouldn't be something you debate internally for a while, have to force yourself to, or something that you can't do when you're taken aback by something. That is when it's most neccesary. 

Of course it's hard because girls are always taught to be nice and polite so they don't become "stuck up bitches", and it takes some unlearning and reframing for the lesson to become clear, but every single person should know how to say no.
