Don't worry about what people want you to think of yourself and the situation - you don't have to feel and be badass afterwards just because you were able to handle the situation so well. In my experience, a lot of the trauma of assault experiences settles in later, often much later, and you have to make sure to acknowledge those delayed reactions as well. Take care of yourself and make sure to try take time and space to process it all.
