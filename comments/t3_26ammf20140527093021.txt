Quite clearly I didn't say that at all. All I said was that punching a guy in the face is not going to teach him a lesson. He needs to be properly taught how to interact with people, and punished in a way that best gets across to him the severity of what he did.

There is a pretty big gap between 'treat rapists with kid gloves' and 'punch disabled kids in the face'.
