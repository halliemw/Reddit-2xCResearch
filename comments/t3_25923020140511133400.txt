I know exactly how you feel! All my friends talked about shaving for the first time and I knew my body was different. It took until being 18 and intimate for the first time for a gyno to diagnose PCOD. He retired shortly after but I wish I had known sooner or could help others feel okay about their own body image. I have been fortunate with just the occasional trimming but I do feel awkward time to time. Thank you both for the post. I feel much better knowing others rock it!
