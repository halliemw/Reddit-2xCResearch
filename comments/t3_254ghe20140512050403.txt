I've had this happen several times, (I tend to grow fairly long, then cut pixie) and what I've started to do the last few cycles is actually just cut my hair myself and leave a few inches, then go in and ask them to do it how I want it. If it's already short, they're totally fine doing what I want, where if I leave it long, I have to convince them. It's annoying, but it works.
