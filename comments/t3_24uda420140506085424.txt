I agree with a lot of your points.  From my experience a survivor tends to blame themselves enough that we don't have to add to it.  While they do need to change how they see themselves and how they see other people, healthy self-esteem is not the end all cure.    

A lot of things play a part in it.  The way our culture tells women to give the benefit of the doubt.  The way that red flags are not taught until someone makes the effort to learn after they've been through it.  Life changes are another way in.  Mine got to me because I had just started an intensive graduate program as a massive career change and I had doubts about my abilities.
