> We need to do a better job of teaching all men in all societies to humanize women, otherwise the problem will persist without abatement.

You know whats really telling about this is just [two months ago this very same terrorist organization literally burned 50 boys alive and nobody batted an eye](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-26/scores-dead-in-boko-haram-nigeran-school-attack/5284250).  Kidnapping girls is literally worse than burning boys alive, that just played out before our eyes.  Since the victims are now girls and we're doing something; but youre still not convinced we're doing enough to teach men to humanize women?  I dont want to spread a harsh truth here but human trafficking saved these girls lives.  They are not dead, they are not burnt corpses; they are alive.  The issue is not that we dont value girls enough; the issue is we dont value human life enough.  This is NOT a gendered problem and that hashtag is bigoted.
