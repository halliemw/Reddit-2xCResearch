Ha! Yes, all the time :)
I'm a tiny, skinny chick with big 'ol boobs (my husbands epitaph), and I can't really do anything without taking them into consideration. I hated them as a teenager, but my husband is a "boob man" and they play a big part of our sex life, so I guess he has converted me to being somewhat "boob centric'.
So, yes, now i find myself touching them, moving them about, adjusting, squeezing, or jiggling them quite often.


I'll probably regret it when I'm 60
