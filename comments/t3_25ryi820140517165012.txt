I think the faux film trailer for Satan's Alley in Tropic Thunder was a nod to Wonderboys though (for those who haven't seen it, Satan's Alley "stars" RDJ and Tobey who have an affair as priests/whatever, I don't remember but they're religious figures) and was made after the Spider-Man films, so he can't have regretted it that much.
