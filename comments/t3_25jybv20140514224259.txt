Well in my state we have a 72 hour waiting period (that does not include weekends or holidays).  This is an inconvienence because there is only one clinic in the state, which is 5-6 hours away from where I live.  There is only a doctor there once a week to preform abortions.  So the 72 hours becomes 1 week.  How easy is it to get the time off work for that? The gas money for the procedure? The hotel if needed? 

It is a HUGE obstacle.  Its easier for me to travel to another state (its not easy then by any means) to get an abortion.  It would be hard for me and I'm hardly poor.  What of the women who work minimum wage with no paid time off? No sick leave? Who have a shitty car or no car? Who have no one to watch their existing kids? Or where would they stay in that town, provided they stay the whole week instead of using the gas to get there and back only to go again a week later?
