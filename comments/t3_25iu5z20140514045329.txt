Would you call anyone else a slut? Would you think somebody else is a slut? 


If the answer to those questions is no, then don't be meaner and more abusive to yourself than you would be to a complete stranger. By being abusive to yourself you are agreeing that some women can be and are sluts. And that's just lame. 


If the answer to those questions is yes, then ask yourself what is so devaluing and dehumanizing about sex? If you are a slut for having sex with an asshole, what is he? Not as bad? Awkward to be named a slut because he is a man and therefore not negatively seen for his sexual exploits? Women can internalize misoginy too, there is no shame in admitting you participated in it .
