Sex NEVER decreases your value, even if you gain nothing from it. For example, rape will never be a positive, but the victim of rape is not worth less as a result. Let's face it: the whole virginity fetish by the wildly religious is harmful and horrible. Virginity is NOT an important concept. It is an idea made up by men to control women's sexuality and behavior. 

If virginity were really that special, men would be focusing equally on men's purity. The fact that they zero in on women instead tells me everything I need to know about it: absolute bs.
