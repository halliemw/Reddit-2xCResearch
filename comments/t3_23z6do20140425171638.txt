I'll agree, the RAINN statistic is somewhat outdated and it probably has gone down but that doesn't mean it wasn't that bad at one point and that doesn't excuse anyone from laughing at it. I posted this in TwoX because I was hoping for at least the slightest bit of validation that a large group of guys laughing at the fact that so many women have survived rape or attempted rape is really scary.
