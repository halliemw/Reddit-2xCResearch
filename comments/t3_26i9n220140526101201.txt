If you really want to sort this out in a court setting, small claims courts will often steer parties towards (or flat out require) mediation with a court-provided mediator.  The mediator hears both parties, facilitates the discussion, may meet with each side alone to hear any private information they have, and generally guides the parties towards a resolution.  That being said, both parties have to voluntarily agree on a resolution (which can then be enforced by the court if either party fails to adhere to the agreement).  Small claims courts are generally set up to assist parties who do not retain counsel.

You are almost certainly not in a position to receive overtime.  This would be more of a contract violation issue (you made an agreement, she did not adhere to it), not an employment claim.  Note: any of this may change due to local or state laws.  I'm speaking from a majority of states / common law perspective.

I can't guarantee my information is 100% correct, but it's in the ballpark if you're in the U.S.

Please note I'm not really recommending this course of action, just giving you some info if you decide to go this route.
