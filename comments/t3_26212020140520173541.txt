The trouble with electing to use a [Support] tag is that a post then carries the stigma of being "just for support." Don't get me wrong, there isn't anything with wanting support. But what you're doing by forcing a [Support] tag on a post it's akin to having a discussion with say, your best friend, and then prefacing this conversation saying, "I trust you and I love you but you need to be supportive." You're conversing with your friend, support is implied to a certain degree.  
  
  
To put it another way, it labels every post as a "cry for help." I appreciate the thought but I think it will have a dampening effect on the community. Nobody wants to post and have people look down on them because they're always asking for [Support[. What you'll end up with instead is few people using the [Support] tag because they don't want the stigma associated with it. They just want people to be supportive, listen, and so forth.  
  
  
I'm also going to use this opportunity to relate my own experience. I actually found /r/TwoXChromosomes literally just a few weeks before it became a default. I noticed an immediate, drastic change. A negative one.  
  
  
I definitely see the value of having a place for a safe discussion and by making the thread a default sub you make it more visible, increasing the amount of people that can be helped or find a safe haven. The problem is that as the number of people goes up, the post content will also go up, more miscellaneous (and unnecessary) posts clog the sub and result in far, FAR fewer posts being seen. People don't want to wade through the garbage to find the hidden treasures. That's not what they're here for.
