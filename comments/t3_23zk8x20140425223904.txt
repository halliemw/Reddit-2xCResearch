I don't know who the "everyone" is that's spouting all this crap, but they're full of shit.

I was a single mom for a long time.  One of the ways I found time for a social life without guilt was to put the kids to bed, then have someone to stay at my house to supervise while I went out.   The kids were safe, I didn't miss out on any time, and all was well. 

There's no reason to feel guilty about what you're doing.  Consider cutting out the toxic "everybodys" from your life instead.
