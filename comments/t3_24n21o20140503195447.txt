Wow, you could try to actually objectively discuss instead of insulting and patronizing me for having a different point of view, albeit, I might be wrong but that is why I'm discussing and asking questions.
What I think; Sexual assault is a serious issue that women suffer, but some are taking it lightly and calling sexual assault to any negative encounter with someone from the opposite sex. I dont see any sexual assault here. The top upgraders were women so he made those remarks, if they were chinese he would have made a racist slur instead. He isnt out against women (nor assaulting physically or psichologically any), he is out against anyone who is better tan him. He didnt try to approach any woman, I think sexual assault should be used when someone from the workplace makes sexual connotations about certain individual or tries to approach him/her after a negative which isnt the case.
