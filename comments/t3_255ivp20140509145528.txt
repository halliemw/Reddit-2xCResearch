I've seen other people describe it this way before, and I've found it matches my experiences. To become friends with a man, you share a few interested and then share experiences related to those interests. You get to that "friend" point more quickly. To become friends with a woman, it's more based on conversational sharing of thoughts/feelings, and it's a slower growing flame.

And I'll be the first to admit that this is a *way* over simplification. I've had conversations about deeply personal things with guy friends, and thats developed our friendships. I've shared experiences/hobbies with girl friends, and thats developed our friendships. And there's a lot of guy to guy variation and girl to girl variation. But I think this difference does get at the heart of why some women find it difficult to make female friends, or at least why I used to find it difficult to make female friends. It requires more opening up, and that can be scary/difficult.

Just as you've done a lot of growing up since high school, so have the girls your age. If you found it difficult to relate to them then, you may find it easier now that you've all matured. And it is always easier to make friends with people who have similar world views and values as you. Look for women who are involved in similar organizations or activities as you.
