Good for you! I had anxiety over the same thing up until about two years ago and I swore I'd never use them. Then we went on vacation to Florida and it was either use them or don't go swimming or enjoy the waterparks. Turns out I had been doing it completely wrong in high school and it wasn't so bad after all. It can be really freeing to get over that hump.
