This may seem harsh, and I do second all the sensitive advice given thus far about your boyfriend himself - but have you also considered how this may affect your future family's life down the road?  Do you imagine that you will feel comfortable having the father be a grandfather to your children one day or ever let your kids spend the night over there, etc?  Just additional stuff to think about.  Sorry you found out in the fashion that you did, but I am glad you found this out for your own knowledge.
