Same thing happened to me when buying a pregnancy test. The clerk was so rude, its was humiliating. I admire your dgaf attitude, I wish I could be the same. I didn't even think I was pregnant really, but at the time my birth control stopped my periods so I took one once in a while to make sure. After that I'm ashamed to say I stole one the next time. I was so embarrassed. They should really have some sensitivity training or something.

On a funnier note, I once bought one of those cheap vibrating cock rings on a whim for my boyfriend, and went to use the self checkout. It broke. There was a whole deal that had to happen, they tried to fix it and ended up going to the register. The clerk was all casual and chatty and then takes the cock ring out of the bag. Clearly embarrassed, she shoves it back in and just scans it through the plastic. We shared a nervous giggle over that . She was sweet.
