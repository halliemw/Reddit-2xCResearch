I'm going to throw this in the mix, at least where I live. I have a family member who is a detective who works violent crimes exclusively. Here state law dictates that a DV call must be dealt with by law enforcement. There is no need to press charges, if they are called the state files charges whether the victim wants to or not. It's not like a typical assault. Call, Like Goblin said, DV is not something they take lightly.
