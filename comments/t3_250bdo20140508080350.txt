I don't know what you look like, but it could be postural as well. If you squeeze your butt and tilt your pelvis upwards, does it still bulge? Anterior pelvic tilt causes that butt-and-belly-sticking-out look: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_tilt (see first image)

In my case, I have both the tilt issue AND bloat issues - it's a real pain and if I don't watch what I eat as well as my posture, I might as well be 6 months pregnant.
