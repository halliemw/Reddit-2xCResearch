First of all, you look absolutely stunning. 

Secondly, my mom and I share clothes a lot. She's always been very good to me and she'd give me the shirt off of her back if I asked. She travels a lot for work, and I mean A LOT. She's virtually seen the world. So whenever she comes home she'll occasionally have a new piece with her (slippers from Singapore, silk fabrics from the Middle East, etc.), and it's really fun to see what she comes up with each time, and will let me take back home with me. Every time I go to her house she'll even let me raid her closet and take anything I want, whether it's one of her favourite shirts or shoes from the other side of the world, I try not to rob her of her wardrobe though. 

She also made me a Japanese silk kimono for my 20th birthday...it's so soft and comfortable it's like wearing air.
