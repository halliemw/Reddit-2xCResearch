Oh, but it can feel awesome. I'm not all "exercise so you look good for people who have fuck all to do with your life" but I've been walking about two miles a day because I feel awesome doing it even when I don't want to to begin with. And it's very good for my dog, who comes with me.

Pretty much no danger of cup unsettling though. Just a nice walk. Sometimes we see bats.
