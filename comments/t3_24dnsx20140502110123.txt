Well, there are plenty of other options...

* Progesterone-only options (Depo, implant, Mirena/Skyla IUD, mini-pill) are more likely to completely stop periods completely but it's not guaranteed, and some people get unpredictable spotting. Some people continue with their normal cycle but their periods are lighter and/or shorter.
* Combination methods (combined pill, Nuva-ring, patch) can be used to control periods by skipping the break weeks. They also often lighten/shorten periods as a side effect. There are certain combination pills marketed towards people who want fewer periods (e.g. Seasonale and Seasonique which should give you 4 periods a year) but as long as your pill is monophasic then you can do this with any other pill brand.
* The copper IUD (Paraguard - non-hormonal) will definitely not stop your period, and may make it heavier.
