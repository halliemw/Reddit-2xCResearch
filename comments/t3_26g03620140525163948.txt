Am I afraid of what this man is clearly capable of doing? Yes, but please keep in mind that he'll be monitored like no other. It is also important that the people of Los Angeles County also keep track a bit. If I were to see this guy on the street harassing another woman you bet your sweet potato pie I'm calling the authorities and going to try to help the woman in danger.

I hope this man is in the process of reformation. I am hopeful in that he won't attempt anything, but if he does we also need to work as community to protect one another from dangerous individuals.
