I don't really use toys. If you rarely masturbate, I would suggest getting to know yourself with your own hands for a while. Sometimes toys can be too much for me. Perhaps doing some self-exploration will help alleviate the embarrassment? There's no need to be ashamed, sex is a wonderful thing, and making your body feel good is healthy for you. Always gives me a nice outlook on life when I get that serotonin flowing. Did you know the clitoris is the only human organ whose sole purpose is for the enjoyment of sex? It was *meant* to be played with. :)
