I don't really think this is normal from the comments I've read it seems really weird?

Does it make you uncomfortable that they hang out alone? I am for one extremely paranoid and very much a worry wart so I kindly ask my boyfriend if he hangs with female friends for it not to be alone.

Vice versa I do not hang out with male friends alone because it makes me uncomfortable.
