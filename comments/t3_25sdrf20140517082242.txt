I would advise you to talk to a therapist/counselor (particularly ones that specialise in eating disorders or body image issues). They are trained to talk through the issues with you and help you work through them. 

In terms of real advice, one of the things I think that it's important to remember is that the number on the scale doesn't define you, and it's not the representation of your worth as a person. I know that's easier said than done, but I find that thinking about non-appearance things that make me awesome really helps with this.

If you're 1lb up from yesterday, you're not a worse person than you were yesterday, maybe you're just retaining water. If you feel like you're becoming too obsessed with measuring your weight, it might be a good idea to just throw out your scale. 

And remember, there isn't a single woman out there that doesn't have *any* squishy bits.
