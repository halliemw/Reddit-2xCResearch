> But for many of the men I've been with, not so much. When I am honest about never having a g-spot orgasm, many are convinced that "I can ALWAYS get a girl off, you just havent been with a man like me."

Wow, how many times have we heard this? It really sucks how many women this happens to, and it's a real shame that you feel like you have to lie in order to please him. If I were you, I'd probably just come clean. It'll suck, and there's basically no way to do it without upsetting him, but that includes going right back to the start and being honest with him from the beginning because either way he's gonna take a hit to the ego. 

But if you're serious about the relationship then honesty is always best.
