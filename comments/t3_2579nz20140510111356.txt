>Have you never crushed on someone and they didn't know//feel the same way about it?

Yes I have, and when they don't feel the same way, as depressing as it might have been to my 15 year old self, I did not threaten that I would die if they didn't have me, and I did not stalk them or send them poems. No means no, in EVERY situation.

Sure, he might just be an emo tween, but considering how they don't really talk, that's some pretty obsessive behavior... he should talk to someone. 

All in all, if she feels that she is not safe she does need to talk to the authorities at school, or to the police if things escalate. But, it cannot be left to just saying that he is just being a "little creepy" or "juvenile"

He does need to talk to somebody, not OP, not his friends, but somebody who can actually help him.

In the end, it's about her safety. She does not feel safe. Think about that side of things. Imagine knowing that he is there at school and knows where she lives. If she keeps quiet then:

1. things might escalate
2. he will continue to make her feel unsafe and/or will continue his behavior with someone else and still lead to (1)

If she tells the school authorities, for example, he can get the help he needs.
