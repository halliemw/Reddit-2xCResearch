I'm a butcher, a meat-cutter. I'm usually welding a large knife and wearing a blood-stained apron. But I work in the public eye, and I get three responses. The ones I like are those who either don't notice or treat me like the trained professional I am. I dislike the ones who stare in disbelief and horror, and make comments about how dangerous my work is. Like I don't know that, but I show them that I have all ten fingers I started out with. The absolute worst are the ones who suggest my husband should be doing my work (he has his own job as a parole agent) or that my brother should do it (he is my employee and simply a cashier.) There's an awful lot of slack-jawed staring, but nobody seems to find it cute. Maybe if I wear my tiara while I grind burger, cut steaks, or run the bandsaw?
