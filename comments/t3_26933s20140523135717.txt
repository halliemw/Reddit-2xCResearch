I'm 5 years into my IT/helpdesk career and I couldn't agree more. My direct peers are actually great guys who never look at me differently, but other men in IT (I work at a large Uni so lots of other IT folks) either act very creepy towards me, try to discredit me, or try to "bro" me by pretending I'm not a girl. It gets old. I just want to show up and do my job without hearing period jokes or being harassed.

To be fair though, I've had overall more negative, HR inclusive incidents with other women in IT than I have with men. I'm about two poor interactions away from having another chat with HR about a sister departments boss creating a very hostile workplace. C'mon ladies, we need to treat each other better before the men will.
