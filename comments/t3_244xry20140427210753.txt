I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to use that- it has some strange connotations. I mean that Aerie was planning on using models of all sizes and not photoshop out stuff like moles, stretch marks, or natural curves of the body. 

That's the "real" part that I meant to refer to! I am sorry if there was a misunderstanding. I sometimes put my foot in my mouth despite my good intentions :/
