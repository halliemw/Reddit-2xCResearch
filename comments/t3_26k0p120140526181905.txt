As a dude in a committed, loving marriage, who knows many other dudes in committed, loving relationships, yes, that is very odd. I'd assume it is a red flag, but a red flag of what I don't know. Part of being in a relationship with your best friend is that you get to hang out with them when you're with your other friends too. I completely agree that a little "guy" time (camping and other dude activities for me) or alone time are normal and healthy, but this sounds way beyond that. I'd suggest talking to him openly and honestly, with no judgment or preconceived ideas that he's doing anything 'wrong'. Find out his reasoning, explain your issues, and see if you can't work it out. Honest and open communication is key.
