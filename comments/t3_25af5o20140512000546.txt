This day is my absolute worst of the year. I lost my mom 2 weeks before my 13th birthday (now 21), and though I have a lot of old things from her it's still hard and most of my time with her is a blur. To top that off I miscarried a baby in 2011 and had a stillbirth in 2012 just a few weeks after mother's day, so these last 2 have been extremely hard. Not only am I missing my mom but my babies as well.
