Someone who is productive will still be productive after they are pregnant, and someone who is unproductive will continue to be unproductive after pregnancy.

It all comes down to the legality of it. Firing a pregnant worker runs of the risk of them suing for wrongful termination. My advice would be to have IT catalog their computer use (most large companies do this anyway), and keep all records of them not working or wasting time, and once you have at least a month's worth of evidence, then you can think about firing them.
