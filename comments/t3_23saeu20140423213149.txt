I kinda love the cloth pads I have, but I only wear them at night/at home. I use a cup for the day instead of tampons. [This site](http://cloth-pads.livejournal.com/) has good information and "second hand" pads. Some are lightly used or not even used at all. I think it's a pretty good way to get introduced to different brands and cloth pads in general. Different brands absorb and fit differently, and have different fabric types.

They can be bulky. Less bulk and you'll probably need to change them more often. Soaking them in oxy-clean like cleaners helps stop staining. People who only wear pads/wear pads all day would usually have a water proof bag to carry around the dirty pads until they get home. And you'll need to carry clean pads or inserts.
