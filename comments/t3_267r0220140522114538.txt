Yes, I should have also mentioned that he was hesitant about the cooper IUD due to the cysts, as well. And I know with IUDs a lot of it is just how your body reacts and that everyone's mileage may vary. I mean...even with all the horror stories I heard about the Mirena, I went for it because I know there are plenty of women who have no issues at all. I wanted to be one of those women SO BADLY! 

I'm trying harder to drink more water. The other day my back was killing me. I chugged some water and honestly felt better. I'm also starting therapy tonight (it's been a long time coming and I can only break into sobs around my boyfriend so many times before it starts to become embarrassing) so hopefully that helps with things. While I am not convinced all my problems are psychosomatic, I am certain the stress makes everything worse.

I'd love to get back to the gym (I exercised pretty regularly before all of this and it definitely helped with stress) but my body is just not letting me. I can't do much more than 15 minutes on a stationary bike without my knees killing me.
