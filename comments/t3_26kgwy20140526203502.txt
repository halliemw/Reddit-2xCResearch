OP, it's not fair to stay because "you are his whole world". That also isn't healthy. I know it sounds romantic, but it's not ok. A person, especially coming from where he's coming from, needs a support system. Don't live your life like this OP, you don't have to be miserable. Most importantly GET RID OF THE GUN! Why is there a gun in this household? If he has threatened to use it against himself, please remove it from the equation for safety.
