Of course not-two people chose to have sex, and two people face the consequences (obviously this isn't considering rape resulting in pregnancy, as that's a whole different situation.) But, bottom line, since a woman carries the pregnancy, she decides whether the pregnancy is terminated or continued. Ideally, either choice would be made with the man who impregnated her, but things don't always work out ideally. At the end of the day, you simply don't get to dictate whether she aborts or not-I'm sure that's frustrating, but it's the truth.
