I'm glad. As you can imagine, this is something I think about quite often. 

You know I always thought that I never learned how to have safe lesbian sex because I grew up in Texas, where we have abstinence only sex education? But it turns out no one actually learns that stuff in health class. Probably because most people don't even think about gay sex *as being* sex. Unfortunately this is such a huge issue that I have no ideas on how to fix it.
