I can't express how happy your reply makes me, I'm so glad I'm not the only one going through this. My best friend is gorgeous, 5ft 3 and weighs 9 stone, but is getting so obsessed with it all she rang me up crying because she felt like she was going to faint and ate an egg. To her, that was failure. I guess at the end of it all, I'd rather be chubby than that hard on myself. Its just so difficult to get the balance right.
