> The good thing is he was apologetic. Some guys will get defensive and accuse you of female hysteria before you can fully explain why you're upset.

I've known a couple guys and girls alike that are really big on gaslighting. 

Also, it would've been okay if it was a female friend and I knew they had a friendship at all, but I didn't even know they existed, and he didn't snapchat when I was around. All it would've taken was a little heads up, ya know?
