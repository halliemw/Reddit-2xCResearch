You can use cheap foundation primer (it has the same main ingredients as anti-chafing gel). Just get a tube from the drugstore if you can't find the gel (which I've never seen, despite living near a million pharmacies).

Alternately, there is a stick product in stores that is sold to reduce rubbing of shoes and prevent blisters. That also works if it's all you can find.
