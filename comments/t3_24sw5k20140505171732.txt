Thank you. I am really angry right now.  And, let me tell you, that is a hell of a lot better than sobbing and miserable. As much as it sucks to find this out at least I now know exactly the type of person he is. And there is no waiting for him to come to his senses or hoping that he will show me a modicum of affection. At least in my own head I can call it 100% over. That he screwed me over so completely that there is no coming back from that.  I just wish I showed myself more respect earlier on.
