Haha good point :) Actually I don't think the company is at fault here for not hiring female techs I don't believe any females have applied for the positions. I did ask them about that a while ago and they said they would love to but they never had any apply. The population here is only 150,000 and there is a lot of work. They are having a hard enough time finding men to fill the positions.

I was more interested in females being represented in the tech field rather than brownie points for the company. It is a good company to work for and perhaps it would inspire more women to apply!
