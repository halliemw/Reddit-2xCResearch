Treat everyone like they're people. Cashiers, waiters, homeless people, whatever -- everybody deserves a basic measure of respect, unless they make a concerted effort to squander it. 

Also, on the more practical front, she demanded that my sister and I help with housework from the age of 12 or so -- cleaning, laundry, ironing, grocery shopping, cooking, gardening, cutting down trees, changing tires, etc. By the time we moved out, we damn well knew how to take care of ourselves and run a household. 

In contrast, my male roommate is 25, assistant branch director in a bank, and can neither cook (beyond throwing hot dogs on a grill) nor has he ever done a single load of laundry in his life. He spends three times the amount of money on food that I do because it's all prepackaged shit (as opposed to homemade food) and he drags a bag of laundry down four storeys and through the entire city to his grandparents' every weekend even though we have a washing machine in the apartment.
