I suppose I just don't find her story that interesting or unique. More than that, I remember the scandal surrounding their affair, and I remember thinking it was massively overwrought. Sad, yes. But the only reason it's at all exceptional is because the man she had an affair with was president at the time.

I find the idea that her life has "been on hold" waiting to tell this story, sad and indicative that this probably isn't a well-considered reflection. And for some one fearful of becoming an issue during the next election, publishing a book is quite obviously going to make that more likely. So I'm seeing some disconnect between her stated purpose and her actions.
