Totally, dress codes are needed, but the validity of the dress code depends on the reason for banning the items. 

If the school banned all sports wear including yoga pants for being 'inappropriate for the school environment' nobody would be upset. 

A lot of the schools are specifically banning items of the girls clothing for being 'distracting'. This is unfair to both genders as it implies that the boys can't control their behaviour, and that girls are responsible for what people think about their bodies.
