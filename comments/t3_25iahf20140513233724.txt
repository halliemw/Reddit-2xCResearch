No, my background is sound. I was raised a christian but never had religion enforced. I stopped going to church around middle school because I didn't think it was for me. Sex isn't talked about in my family, but we're a pretty quiet family to begin with. I think the guilt of feeling emotionally connected to other people sprung from my past relationships... Both boyfriends were extremely possessive and neither liked to hear when I hang out with anyone besides themselves. They were both controlling and jealous. I knew they were bad for me, which is why I left both of them. Now I don't plan on having another SO until I know them intimately on a platonic level (not sure if that juxtaposition made sense...).

I agree with you that I'm not spiritually well. I have confidence and trust issues. I don't like making "best friends" because of the pressure I feel in emotional responsibilities. I want to love people equally, and to make promises to treat this person more special (platonic or not) is just too much work. I don't like being asked to ignore one set of friends for another. I haven't taken the time to think about why I'm always upset in a relationship until recently so I'm only just starting to make sense of a lifelong dilemma.

I just want to have a great time at a party or having sex. I don't want someone to feel jealous because they thought they had a special thing with me but now I'm having that special thing with someone else. I love everyone and I don't feel the need to discriminate. Is that a bad thing? Should I be ashamed to give myself away to everyone? I don't really know. That's why I wanted to ask here, where more experienced ladies will help me out.
