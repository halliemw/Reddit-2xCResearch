That was my first thought too. I don't know if it's just the country I live in (maybe there's an abundance of men into big butts and wide hips) but when going out with friends to places where one might be looking for something casual (nightclubs and the like), I was almost always approached more than my not-so-curvy friends. Same thing happens to a friend of mine, who also has wide hips and very small waist. 

Plus wide hips don't necessarily mean childbirth will be easier (it wasn't in my case)!
