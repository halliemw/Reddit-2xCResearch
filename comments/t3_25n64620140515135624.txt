That's very true and not really a point I've considered to stop someone, but I understand the social fears. I'm a plus sized woman who carries most of my weight in my belly area. I've been offered seats before (usually by men, though sometimes women), probably on the assumption I'm pregnant, though they may be acting chivalrous. I usually thank them and decline. No one has gone so far as to say "Hey, you're pregnant, take my seat". 

I know I'm fat, and I'm not offended by someone offering me a seat.
