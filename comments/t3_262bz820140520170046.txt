Thank you so much for posting that Q&A! That is very interesting to see. 

I also hope they're working on it, and will certainly give them the benefit of the doubt and keep watching (and let's face it, so will most people, because it airs on Sunday night when nobody accomplishes anything anyway, and right after GoT). I just hope they decide to take things in a different direction and show some more realistic depictions of women.
