Some women find it flattering and a boost to their self confidence. But then you may talk to women like me, who have been mocked and even asked out as a 'joke' in the past or in general had people (of both sexes) be douchey in the process, as in overbearing and pushy... It can become tiring and not something we want to deal with.
