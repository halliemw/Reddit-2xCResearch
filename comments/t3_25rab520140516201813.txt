I don't wear makeup either and have dealt with similar comments. I have a great complexion and a very nice natural look. I also never really learned how to properly use makeup, so on the rare occasions I try some eyeliner and mascara, it just ends up below my eyes and I look like a haggard clown. 

I think a lot of people do think like your FMIL in that they think makeup can improve *anyone*, regardless of natural beauty. Honestly I'd try to just believe her when she said she'd just like to try makeup on you, like maybe as in, you've got a nice starting palette but maybe some eyeshadow would really bring out your eye color. 

I had a roommate in college who always wanted to put makeup on me, but she just genuinely loved makeup and love playing with it. Maybe I'd have been a little more offended if she was like, "you're so pretty, but..." I dunno, I guess I'd give FMIL the benefit of the doubt and assume she meant nothing critical by her comment/actions :)
