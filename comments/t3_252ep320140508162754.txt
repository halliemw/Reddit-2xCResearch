My mom was really open with us when we were growing up so I had this really exaggerated idea of what it was like once you got a period.  You instantly became a grown up sort of, it separated you from the flock and you got some sort of special position in society as "way mature."

At 10, right after the zoo, I got my first stupid period.  Begged my mom not to tell everyone.  I was mortified.

Instead of being cooler and sophisticated and wearing button up shirts and work slacks, I was still uncool.  Only now people knew I had my period and all the little bitches in my class laughed at me for it (wtf you assholes), then that's right around the time we learned that babies can happen after you get your period so magically I also became a slut at the ripe old age of 11.

what the fuck mother nature.
