Hi,
No problem, I wasn't expecting a response, I really just hoped I could help. I love my other half more than I could possibly express, and I read your post and we both felt... a lot of different things. 

In terms of your children, I didn't grow up in a particularly loving household, so I tried to think of things that would have meant a lot to me if my parents had taken the time.

My husband knows how, he's working right now but I'll be able to tap him on the shoulder in an hour or so, and we'll be able to sort out a tutorial of sorts....

May I ask what email client you use?

If I can help in any other way at all, feel free to ask. Truly.

E
