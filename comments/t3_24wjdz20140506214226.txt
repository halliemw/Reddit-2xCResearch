Thanks for your response, that was great! It's really helpful to hear things from the other point of view.

>plan out some signal he might give you which lets you know he'd like to be left alone for the time being

Well, the signal has always been him acting like an ass and/or ignoring me (this is topic that I brought up in the email that I was unhappy with- I was pissed that he was treating me like shit rather than just tell me he didn't want to talk). He will sometimes do the silent thing but mostly he will just treat me like crap to push me away.

This leads to so many other problems. He never will talk about things with me later, I'm not joking when I say that he *never* brings something up that he has a problem with unless it's to counter-act what I am saying. 

Unfortunately I do raise my voice when I am speaking with him (another plus for email), however I have been working on it so that it is more "raising voice" and less "yelling," meaning that I do still raise my voice but it's not as bad. Going back to that email, if it were in person, I imagine being calm and collected for the first email I sent, but then when he responded and we went back and forth and I replied with that longer email *that* is when I would "raise my voice." I'm just so sick of him avoiding everything; the words he was choosing in his reply weren't really satisfactory to me in terms of an agreement so I got pissed because I felt like he was still skirting the issue, even though he said he wouldn't do it any more (which by the way, he still does).

>If he's completely unwilling

The biggest problem right now is that he is 99.9% unwilling and I have to fight for that tiny little percentage point, and that little point gives me just enough hope, I guess you could call it, to keep trying. Sometimes I feel like he is just stringing me along and will never seriously consider changing.
