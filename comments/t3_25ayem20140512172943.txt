If you've never wanted children, honestly I doubt you ever *will*.  Some people do change their minds, but it seems most don't.  I mean, you never hear about people who want kids up until age 35 or so and then suddenly decide they *don't* want kids, so why should the opposite be true?  I think this "You'll change your mind!" stuff is really only so much pressure from people hoping they will be right.
