Just continue being happy with the way your relationship is and don't think about it. Always go in with the mindset "this is not it" and if it does happen, you will be much more excited when he pops the question. Of course you are going to be jealous at your friends getting engaged.

From my perspective and reading your story, it looks like he's probably just waiting for the right time. You have to consider that it takes some savings to get the ring, in addition to figuring out and getting the courage to actually do it. In addition, some people want to be stable in their career and lives to the point where they can settle down, buy a home, make a family, etc. Maybe he just needs some time. 
So my suggestion is just try to not think about it and continue being happy with your relationship the way it is now.
