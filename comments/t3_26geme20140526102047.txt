Well first of all if its something I can change (lazy) then I would be okay with someone telling me this. I probably already know myself and it would make me realize other people can see what I see. Sometimes I think we think we think we see things only in our head.    

However, I am a very blunt person. Facts are facts to me.    

To me this sort of information is useful to have a conversation. I don't want to dilly dally around touchy subjects. But that's me. Op said she is usually a blunt person so I was wondering why this topic made her so uncomfortable.    

Its similar to saying I love chocolate cake. Then turning around and saying can you believe this guy offered me chocolate cake, what an asshole. Not a perfect analogy but good enough. I was curious why it was different this time.     


I can understand why op is upset. But it seems that she's mostly upset because now she knows what she has been seeing in her mind other people can actually see. Its hard to go through that realization.
