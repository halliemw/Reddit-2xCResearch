> I don't have any big issue with people soliciting for money. Everyone has to get by in some way. But when I'm walking alone in a parking lot, and in my car, do NOT APPROACH ME AND ASK FOR MONEY. 

How would a homeless person know that you feel vulnerable in a car as opposed to just walking around by yourself?  If anything, you are more powerful in a car.  All the homeless person sees you is being extremely rude to them, which is probably tough given the life they have to live.
