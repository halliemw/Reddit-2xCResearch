To be honest, if my father asked me which style I liked and gave me a choice, I might have picked the other bike.  It was the idea that I was too incompetent to ride the "boy bike" that made me pick it.  I didn't pick it to prove I could ride it, I picked it to try and show my father that his sexist ideas are ridiculous and unwelcome around me.  Maybe that's a bit immature, but I feel better about openly standing my ground regarding the issue.
