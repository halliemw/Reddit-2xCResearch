I am a Christian but this is just not normal. To me it seems to be more of an issue about men being in charge and women submitting, and less about the Christian view of sexuality. I know as a Christian my dad supported me waiting until marriage to have sex, but I don't think he would have ever actually taken it to this level. It's just weird.
