Sure! It's definitely an example of an issue for modern feminism. Not hard laws like being allowed to vote but cultural expectations that really affect our perceptions and then actions. To the point where people argue women "not being allowed" to work night shifts. Then maybe they wouldn't get selected for the job anyways if they do interview for it. Because the interviewers would go for the safe, culturally accepted option of men, if they had a choice.
