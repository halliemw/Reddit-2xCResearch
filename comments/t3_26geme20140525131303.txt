> Maybe I'm just being a baby I dunno. I just felt like it was something that I've felt powerless to change lately, having it made clear to me that it really is a glaring change, that people do notice how horrible I've become...that is I guess what hurt my feelings. 

I think it's like anything else. You weren't ready to hear it because it's something you're struggling with. He put it very badly but probably no matter how he phrased it it would have had the same effect.

My experience is that 10 people can tell me the same thing the same way but I only 'hear' one of them because I'm finally ready to 'hear' it. Or I'll hear it 10 different ways depending on my state of mind. You know what I mean? I'm not clear on whether I'm even making sense.
