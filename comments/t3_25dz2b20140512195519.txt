Not so much creepy but a, "are you kidding me?"

I had just gotten my wisdom teeth out, went to a CVS to pick up my ibuprofen fix.  Was waiting around and had to go outside often to go spit out mouthfuls of blood.

In the middle of one of these blood puking sessions, a guy came up to me.  Granted, he did seem to have some psychological issues, so I don't hold it against him. 

Him: Hey are you ok?

Me: Mmmhm

Him: That looks painful.... 

Me: ...

Him: What's your name?  Do you wanna grab coffee sometime? I live around here

Stuttered something about a boyfriend, stuffed my mouth full of gauze, and walked back into CVS.
