No-one can tell you if you're going to regret it, we can only share our own experiences. 

I was with my first "serious" boyfriend at 18, and I was in love. It was not the romantic, beautiful moment I'd hoped and I later realised that when I'd been in pain and said no, he shouldn't have continued (the shittyness behind that act probably explains why it hurt, because it shouldn't). Some months later we broke up and the fact that I'd "lost my virginity to him" made it worse than it should have been. I use the quotation marks deliberately, because that's the point I'm getting to. 

It really doesn't matter who you have sex with the first time as long as they respect you and care for your comfort. It doesn't make a difference if you are in love or it's the back seat of a hatchback with a friend. What matters after the event is how *you* think of it. I regret thinking of it as losing something to someone else. No, in retrospect I didn't lose anything - I chose to have sex for the first time, and that's it. 

A decade on and I don't regret losing it to a guy I broke up with. I'm not in love with him and there's been so much sex since then it's kind of hard to remember (except it wasn't that hard, so to say). I think the magical part hits when you've had sex a few times, maybe even had to try a few partners, and you find that sex that makes you go "aha, THAT's what they're talking about!" and when that happens and he cleans voluntarily, you marry it.
