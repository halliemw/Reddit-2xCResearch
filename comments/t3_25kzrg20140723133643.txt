Not all iron supplements are the same. Most iron supplements are made of ionic iron (nonheme iron). Traditional ionic irons are not as easily absorbed as a heme iron supplement, which is why many experience constipation and an upset stomach while taking supplements. Meanwhile, heme iron is the same form of iron that you get from eating red meat. Heme iron is not affected by coffee/tea (tannins), grains (phytates), or dairy. Heme iron supplements also seem to facilitate iron absorption from dietary sources, like from dark, leafy greens and beans.
