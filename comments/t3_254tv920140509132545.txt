I disagree, I think that everyone who has been here knows exactly what's going on. We know these posts exist already, however they are never this prominent/heavily upvoted because this stuff *is* normal to us.

If people were upvoting other posts as they are in the numbers they are with the "gross" posts I wouldn't have a problem because being gross is great, but I would much rather show people the rest of what this sub has to offer and we're doing ourselves a disservice by focusing heavily on one of our many women-specific issues. People could have picked anything and I'd be saying the same thing.
