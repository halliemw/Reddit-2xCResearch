> is society here oppressing women by imposing norms with regard to shirts?

Absolutely.  I think it's terrible that a topless woman (or breastfeeding women, etc.) is considered indecent, when [this is considered alright](http://becauseican.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Fat-hairy-guy.jpg).

>is society here oppressing women by imposing norms with regard to shirts?

Absolutely.  American society is very ashamed of nudity, especially non-sexual female nudity.

>if I decide to wear a shirt every day, is it my true choice, or am I just conditioned to do so?

Since you pretty much admit that you can't go out in public without a shirt, then you're clearly not making a free choice.  You personally may not want to go outside topless, but you should have the freedom to do so.
