I wish more women would realize this. 

I got detention at elementary school once for having an erection. The whole school had only two male staff members, so I was just told I was disgusting and I was thinking disgusting thoughts. My school was very feminist to the point of excess and I was told that I was objectifying women by having an erection. I felt guilty about it for a long time. 

When we get older, our erections become increasingly less random (also less frequent), but all the way into our twenties, we get them completely randomly. After we start puberty it's kind of like how when you smile it releases endorphins that make you happy, when we get them we often get horny afterwards, but it's not always horniness that causes them and we DEFINITELY CANNOT TURN THEM ON AND OFF LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH.
