Oh absolutely, I tried to make it obvious in the post that I do not soley blame him, I participated as well.  That being said, I don't think it is fair to say I rewarded him- I was extremely drunk, there was no conscious though in my actions.  I take responsibility for the fact that I did not drink in a responsible manner, but I think what happened after that was his doing.
