Take it easy on yourself. You don't really know Italian, your clothes aren't as great as you wish they were, you're gonna stick out wherever you go...but hey, this is all temporary anyway. Get outside, meet some people, find people to talk to. A lot of Italians speak English so if you can just get a few phrases under your belt many people will be happy to switch to English to talk to you. You decided you'd be okay not having friends and speaking the language because it's just for a year, but 7 months in it turns out it is not okay. It's not too late to change! And it's normal to feel awkward at first.
