I'm not talking about who stays home and raises kids, heck, I wish I'd been able to do that. Not the issue. The issue is being able to have the kids in the first place. Women have the choice, men have to earn the privilege. If a man gives up his career he loses his most valuable asset in the pursuit of progeny, if a woman gives up her career she still has the choice to have a child.
