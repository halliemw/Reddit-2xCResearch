I often worry I've wasted all of my young years dreaming about when things will be better. I guess my concern is just that, the higher my expectations are for something like that, the more like it is I'll be disappointed. I suppose it'll just take some time to come around to the time that I am "worth it". 

However, all in all, you are extremely right. Thank you, so so much. I really appreciate your honesty and insight, you really seem to understand what I'm feeling. It IS a state of mind, I just need to work at it!
