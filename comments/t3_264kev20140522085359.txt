OK. Why is a dress code in one place teaching women to be ashamed, as is the central point of this article, which you did not disagree with, but a similar dress code in other places doesn't? 

Do you agree with the articles point, that dress codes teach women to be ashamed? I assumed you did, because you wrote the whole reply without saying you didn't.

Kind of confusing.
