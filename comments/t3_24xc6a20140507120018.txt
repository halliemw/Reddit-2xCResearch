Ive dealt with a lot of strays and situations like this and I can almost assure you that when the workers came up with their tools and their loudness that the cats ran away. Also, they probably knew the cats were there, which is why they were filling the whole and shooed them away before filling it up. I don't see how they could fill it up without noticing the cats were there, and if they did, I doubt they would continue-- there would be more than one person working and they all can't be cruel. and it wasn't a practical joke to fill up the hole and cover the cats on purpose.

Cats are very smart. They definitely escaped and found a new hole or hiding place. If you were at your school a little longer you'd probably see them turn up in a couple of days. When I took care of strays and their hiding place got destroyed (my neighbors had to take down/redo their fence) they ran and we didnt see them again for about a week. I think they take time to collect themselves (if cats can even do that) and after theyve settled and found new shelter, they decide to come back to that spot because that's where the good food is.

Breathe. Its ok. Im 100% sure Popcorn is fine. I'm just sorry you might not be able to bring him home with you, because he would have had a wonderful home and life with such a caring and generous person.
