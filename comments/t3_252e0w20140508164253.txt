FWIW I don't like violence in books or movies either. I generally avoid violent movies and TV shows as well as overt displays of sexism. It may be historically accurate or ironic or whatever; either way I still don't care to watch it. I don't think women are "put on a pedestal" but this is a subreddit for women. As a woman I can say that personally violence and/or sexual assault against women is more upsetting to me than male-on-male violence because of how I feel treated in our society. My dad doesn't like to watch Holocaust movies because his family is Jewish and it has a personal significance that makes him upset. A person of color in the U.S. might not want to watch a movie with a racist character because it is personally upsetting. Nobody is suggesting that the books be banned or censored but we are allowed to critique art and I do think that producers of art should consider how it affects our society. Women are hardly a minority and regardless of how men feel about rape scenes, we have a voice (or really voices) about them too.
