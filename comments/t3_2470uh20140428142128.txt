Yep, sharp sporadic pains were exactly how it was for me! I was so worried it was my IUD that had shifted or was expelling or something and didn't even consider the possibility of it being a cyst. And no, I just maxed out on the ibuprofen and Tylenol and it went away in a few days, like right when I got my first period with the Mirena. My doctor said it was just a result of my ovaries actually having to ovulate for the first time after years of being on the pill. I don't want to be the random crazy person giving off medical advice on the internet haha, but if you get it checked out maybe a cyst is a possibility and your IUD is still hopefully in the right place!
