Okay, so first off, in the interest of full disclosure:  I'm male.  But also gay.  

I had something not unlike this happen to me with a previous ex as well.   Basically, after we were together for a bit, it became clear that while he emotionally loved me dearly, physically he just wasn't feeling it.  And that was...painful.   It was hard for me to move on.  But I did; and now I'm seeing someone who genuinely appreciates me, inside *and* out.   

I can't guarantee that you will find such a person.  I can only relay to you that I did, and that means it's possible that you will too.   I also sincerely hope that you do.  If nothing else, take that message from what I'm saying here: There are people out there who will be attracted to you.  

Above all, at the very least be at peace with yourself.  We can acknowledge areas requiring improvement about ourselves without condemning ourselves.   We can love ourselves and still recognize that we are imperfect beings.   

Others can do this too.
