My comment directly pertains to the question OP asked, how is that derailing? And I don't see anywhere in my comment where I made generalizations about how women are acting, but obviously my response was based on the one article since it was the basis of OP's question.  And my point wasn't to tell you how bad other people have it, but to illustrate the nature of the internet as it relates to OP's question.
