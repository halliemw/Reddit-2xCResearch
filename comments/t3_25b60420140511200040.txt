Breastmilk doesn't come out like a geyser. It's not likely a breastfeeding baby will get fluids everywhere any more than it's likely a non-breastfeeding baby will. I'd be much more concerned about one of those baby poops that explodes out of the diaper than I would be able breastmilk.

Edit for phrasing.
