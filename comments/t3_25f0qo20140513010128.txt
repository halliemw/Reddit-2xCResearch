The deal with planned parenthood is that they test someone but then do not even call with results unless the person came up positive for an STD. I wish I would have known when he was going in so that I could have gone with him. I am going to call planned parenthood tomorrow and ask if they will give him anything on paper with results. It is just a weird situation because I believed he went until he started telling me that he paid $160 when their website states that STD tests are max of $106.
