Internalized misogyny. The problem is revealed when you describe your issue with women: "too much drama and bitchiness." Women are no more emotional and rude than men are. But when you're around girls and they act emotionally or rudely, it reminds you of those qualities in yourself. But when you're around guys, you can feel unique. 

The solution has to start with no longer resenting your own womanhood. *There is nothing inherently inferior about being a girl.* Then, you have to understand that you are not better than other girls. Your problem is that you're not being very nice to other girls. But it's really easy to fix! The next time one of your friends brings his girlfriend around, talk to her. Ask her questions about herself and get to know her. Eventually, ask if she wants to go out and do something, just girls. You're missing out on a lot of wonderful friendships with intelligent, funny people by rejecting half the population.
