Superman's origins is very simple though.  He's an alien who crash lands in Kansas and happens to be raised to be a moral person who uses his powers for good. The last Superman movie kind of ruined that though.

Wonder Woman is a bunch of Greek mythology stuff. Honestly I don't think  they will have a blockbuster feature with her. She really does work great in the Justice League though, especially in contrast to other super heroins.
