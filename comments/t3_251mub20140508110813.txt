You seem pretty knowledgeable and passionate about this and I would like to ask a question. I have only ever once been called a sexist, and this was when I told somebody that I didn't agree with feminism for several reason, one of which being the unclear definition and another being how some can get over zealous about it. I told her I am in full support of gender equality, and agreed that women are worse of in most situations, but she and several others were unhappy with this. Is this bad/sexist of me? I just think that gender equality is something more people can get behind and removes a lot of room for error and confusion, so in turn is superior to feminism, even if a lot of the goals will be shared between them.

Thank you for your time in advance and I would love to have your, or another feminist's opinion on this matter! :)
