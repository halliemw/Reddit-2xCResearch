Hm, it's interesting that you are addressed more often than your boyfriend! Maybe people pick up on how outgoing someone is and react accordingly. Thanks for validating how irritating that interaction was. I wish my boyfriend would have said something. Honestly I don't think he understands how it feels. I spoke to him about it and he was sort of understanding but also pretty confused.
