I always get really embarrassed for better or for worse and just walk faster away. I have yelled stuff like "got a boyfriend" or "I'm engaged" before to deter them but yeah, mostly I just feel uncomfortable---but not unsafe.

Fortunately I have some self-defense training and some Jiu Jitsu under my belt just in case.
