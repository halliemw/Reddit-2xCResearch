MORE BABIES! Yay! 

Everytime i turn on netflix downstairs my mom is like "please, no more gossip girl". I don't have much left, and I watched it when i moved back in with my parents after grad school, moving home from a foreign country, and leaving my Fella 6000 miles away in complete limbo... so yeah, Gossip Girl was exactly what I needed.

Congratulations and have fun with the babies!
