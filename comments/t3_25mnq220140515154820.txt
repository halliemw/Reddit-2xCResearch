(never had a child so can't speak to the difficulties or more personal parts but..) Breastfeeding is definitely what's best for the baby. Cow's milk [formula] has different polysaccharides and hormones than human milk and it doesn't have antibodies. Plus breast feeding is the best way to lose the baby weight for mom because your body uses up so much sugar/fat in the breastmilk. But I'm pretty sure my mom breastfed and used formula for me and my siblings and we all turned out fine.
