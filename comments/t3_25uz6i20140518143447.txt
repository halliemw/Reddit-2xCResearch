Communication, communication, communication. Let him know what feels good and what doesn't. Ask him what feels good and what doesn't. Don't be afraid to tell him to do more of one thing if you love it. Don't be afraid to say "Stop, that hurts." You're partner is the one person you should be able to tell EVERYTHING to. Don't be afraid to tell him how you feel. 

Remember, you have your whole lives in front of you so take the time to explore each other, get comfortable with each other and getting to know each other intimately. 

Congrats! And HAVE FUN! Sex can be awkward with fluids and noises and such but don't worry about it. Relax. Enjoy each other.
