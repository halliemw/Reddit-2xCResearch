I haven't actually started taking the new, higher-dosage pill yet -- doc wants me to wait until I finish this last pack of Loestrin (or Minastrin, whatever, its the same pill with a different name). Just frustrating for me to be on a pill for 5 months without any problems and then all the sudden, things get irregular.

I very rarely get sick, which is a good thing, but it's kind of a curse for stuff like this because in the rare event that anything doesn't feel right/happen the way it's supposed to with my body, it makes me very nervous.
