This is a big decision. If you don't invite her, your child loses a grandparent. You cant undo an insult like that. Will you be able to explain when your he/she is old enough to ask, why you decided one grandmother was enough? More importantly will you be able to say it was for your child, without "I wanted" and "your father wanted"?
