Can't agree more.   This is why many men like myself get defensive at "teach men not to rape" campaigns.   Men as a whole dont rape.  A very small subset of antisocial assholes rape, and they don't give a shit about their victims rights, let alone what a poster in the campus center says.   Please don't drag me and my law aiding friends into this.
