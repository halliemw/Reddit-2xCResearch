I'd suggest googling "labia library" or "vulva gallery" (sorry, not sure whether or not links are allowed on this sub). The results will be NSFW, obviously! But hopefully you'll be reassured that labia and female genitalia in general come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and configurations. It's also super-normal for your genitals to be darker than your skin tone. I can assure you that your boyfriend will just be delighted that he gets to be friendly with it :-)
