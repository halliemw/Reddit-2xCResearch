Ugh, I started running recently and I dread approaching groups of people for exactly that reason, so I definitely sympathise there. 'Bullies' may be a tad harsh though - they're probably just immature. I was 12 not too many years ago and I'm ashamed to say I was a bit like that if you got me in a big group of people too. 

I think you handled it well though, hopefully you not reacting will make them realise how silly their behaviour was. 

Try not to let it faze you too much! x
