I have chocolatecovered marzipan. I mean seriously, chocolate and marzipan. Im nauseous and I dont care.


I dont have to go to work today, I did all the cleaning yesterday so I can spend my time mindlessly surfing and drinking tea. My husband will be home early from work. My cat has been sleeping in my lap for 2 hours straight and my hair is looking fabulous for no reason at all!
