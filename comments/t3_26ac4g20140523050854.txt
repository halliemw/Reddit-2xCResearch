Most of the time it has to do that in a lot of area's woman want the same pay but want work less hours because they have to be with their children.

I am from a country where people are screaming murder and fire about the fact that women earn less in a month or a year then men. However they forget the fact the most women don't want to work full time and are more likely to take day off to see their children. Meanwhile if a man wants to take a day off to see his children it's impossible.

This is sometimes a good argument, however for really to know if women get less then their male counter parts we should look at the amount of time they work versus how much they make.
