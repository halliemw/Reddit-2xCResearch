>I don't know how to feed myself a proper diet. I don't know how to tell if something is physically wrong.

Have a look at http://www.fatnutritionist.com/index.php/about/ . In her practice as a nutritionist this woman helps her clients to learn what their bodies are asking for in terms of food at least, which sounds very much like what you say you need in your post.

>I don't know how to search for or vouch for a doctor - I just picked a name out of a book and saw if they accepted my insurance. 

That's a perfectly fine way of doing it. Also remember that you hired the doctor - if you find that they are not the right fit for you, you can always fire them and try a different one. 

Other things you do are Google that doctor's name and see if there are any bad reviews, or ask around and see if anyone has recommendations. If you were comfortable sharing your general location (city) here, there might even be someone local to you reading who can make a suggestion. 

>I need a gyno, but I don't even know how to find one of those, and if I do they have to be someone who can deal with a certain level of crazy I get because I was sexually abused. I have terrible PTSD and can't be touched.

Your doctor should be able to refer you to a gyno, and you can also interview them well before anybody starts touching you. The sexual assault helplines and websites linked elsewhere may also be able to help you find understanding and caring professionals for all of your health needs.
