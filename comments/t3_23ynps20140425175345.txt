He knew I was trans because I had mentioned it, but I had forgotten to say specifically that I was a trans woman. (To me it's obvious because I'm very self-critical.) So I think he read me as female (which is why he wrote "pretty"), but then realized that I might be a a trans guy who had just come out and hadn't started transition. Wanting to be inclusive, he then revised his note for that possibility.

I don't know if that was his exact thought process, but that's how I interpreted it!
