We aren't interested in the fact that not ALL men do something, when the issue is that the number of men who do it is still unacceptably high. If a hundred dudes all slap me in the face, that's still three and a half BILLION dudes who haven't slapped me- and yet I've still been slapped in the face by way more dudes than I would have been okay with.

"Not all men" isn't useful in this case, because enough people are still gonna troll that things will likely be appreciably worse... even if not ALL men are here trolling.
