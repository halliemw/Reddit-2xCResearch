I would say it really depends on the place. Some are super scummy back alley shitholes and some are really high class clubs hiring only the most talented pole dancers. 

I've only gone like four times and it's always been with my boyfriend and other friends. I pay attention to their pole dancing technique more than anything else. I also people watch. there's all sorts there. there's people just there to have a drink and look at some tits from afar, some people there to get some female attention since they probably cant get it anywhere else, drunk chicks there for a "ladies night", guys hoping to get lucky with one of the dancers, and people like me who just get excited whenever they do a really cool pole trick.
