Have you considered staying in a hostel? Unless you're on business or something, I highly recommend it. Even if you are on business, they may have private rooms. I haven't done it in the US, but I just traveled solo in Europe for a month, staying entirely in hostels. I met tons of amazing people everywhere I went and never felt unsafe. I'm planning on doing it again for two months this time. Hostelworld.com is a good place to look and read reviews.
