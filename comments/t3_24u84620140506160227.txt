>The amount of people who go see superhero movies because they've read the comics is negligible. 

Not my point at all. Like in the slightest bit. 

>Majority of people don't know shit about comic story arcs and established villains, they just know about iconic characters and Wonder Woman is just as iconic as Superman.

No, she isn't. People know what Wonder Woman looks like. That's it. They don't know anything else about her. They don't know who Diana Prince is, they don't know what Themyscira is, they don't know who Dr. Psycho is, etc. **Everyone** knows who Clark Kent, Lois Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are. **Everyone**, even my mother, knows where Superman was born and how he came to Earth. **Everyone** knows "up, up and away" and "it's a bird, it's a plane". **Everyone** knows who Lex Luthor is. 

However, you're right. They don't need to know anything about these storylines in order for the film to be successful. But having a developed character, that exists in a developed universe, with developed villains and time-tested stories REALLY REALLY helps. The Dark Knight was an absolute classic because it adapted 3 of the best Batman stories ever told into one movie. It used iconic characters and put a unique spin on them. Iron Man was a classic because Tony Stark is a compelling character, with an awesome, heart-tugging (literally) origin story, and cool gadgetry. Captain America 2 worked because it deftly adapted what is probably the best Cap story in the last 2 years to the screen as though it was 3 Days of the Condor. Wonder Woman just doesn't have stuff like this.  

>How much of a fucking problem is it to reboot Wonder Woman with an entertaining story and make a decent movie?

Pretty difficult. If it was easy then Fantastic Four, Jonah Hex, Elektra, Catwoman, Green Lantern, The Spirit, etc. All wouldn't have flopped. If you notice, none of those stories are based on great, enduring superhero stories. The weaker your character is, the harder it is to make a movie with that character, and Wonder Woman is a pretty weak character, with nothing going on in the way of story. 

I just don't get why you guys are so fixated on Wonder Woman of all characters. It just speaks to the fact that you have no idea what you're talking about and you seem to just want to complain about this issue without having any knowledge about how to avoid situations which make female lead superhero movies like Elektra flop HARD.
