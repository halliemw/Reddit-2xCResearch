This is not the kind of relationship you deserve. You need to find someone who you can level with. Someone who will honor you, respect you, and be mature enough to solve problems.

You can do this!! Just think of the life you'll have beyond this. You'll have a life on your own terms. You'll date, or you won't, but it'll be what YOU want. You are you own best friend. Look out for yourself and you'll feel SO strong when you do. I'm rooting for you!
