For me personally, I'd want to hear that exact question when I'm not having a bad day. I know what helps me when I get sad for no reason, and am happy to explain and give examples. On the other hand, I also get angry for no reason, and I have no idea what helps with that. Still, it doesn't hurt to ask.
