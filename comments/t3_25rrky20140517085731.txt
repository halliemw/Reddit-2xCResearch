Walk confidently and move with purpose. If you get lost, don't show it- you can step into a store for directions if need be. If someone calls at you, not engaging can be the safest option. I went to a college attended by a number of kids with money. There was a significant pattern of kids getting robbed (regardless of gender) at night when wearing their 10 pieces of college branded gear. Don't do this!
