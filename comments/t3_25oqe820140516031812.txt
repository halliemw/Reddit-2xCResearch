I had a close guy friend of a few years who seemed like a really good guy. He got so upset during rape scenes in movies he had to leave the room. So sensitive. He still snuck into my bedroom one night after I had fallen asleep to pull my dress up and look underneath. 

People who violate other people often don't even think of themselves as the sort who would do such things. They don't broadcast it so we have to learn to be careful, read between the lines, look twice. It's a totally realistic response to a kinda shitty world.
