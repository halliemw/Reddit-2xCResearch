This dude is a rapist. He is not your friend, or anyone's friend. He's a predator. He might not realize it, but he is. 

You didn't LET anything happen to you. He assaulted you when you were sleeping and incapacitated, after you had repeatedly told him no. He then admitted to raping someone who was almost passed out. Ughhh. Just reading about it makes my skin crawl. 

What you do now is completely up to you, but if I were in your shoes, I would take that text message to the police station, and then also file a report about what happened to you. If the other girl decides to report, having your info already on file will help immensely. Another thing to keep in mind is that she may not even know what he did to her - she may have been blacked out or completely passed out. I think you should tell her so she can get plan B and and an STD check. 

I'd put money on the bet that you two are not the first women he's done this to.
