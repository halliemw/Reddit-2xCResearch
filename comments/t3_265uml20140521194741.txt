As to your main question, I know someone who did after having two children. They were in a very tight financial situation and she got pregnant immediately after having her second (who was planned). They knew they couldn't afford another child at the time and they didn't want three children (due to concern over population growth and moral reasons). It was the right choice for them and they made it together. I hope you can figure out a way to loop your husband in and have him respect your wishes. Sounds like an unfortunate situation.
