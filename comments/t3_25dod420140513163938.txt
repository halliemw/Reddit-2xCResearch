Crystal Singer, a smaller series than either the Tower series or Pern. 

With Polgara I couldn't explain why I empathized with her but I do remember thinking there was a reason she behaved as coldly; I've re-read the series many times and I've enjoyed it for different reasons each time. She's got an often overlooked type of strength, perseverance and practicality. I appreciated her type presented, she reminded me a lot of my own mother.
