I think there's a vast difference between two parties disagreeing and coming to a compromise,  and one party purposely alienating all her friends to assuage the other party's ego.  Those people were with you before G ever came into the picture and will probably be there long after he's gone, if you don't viciously drive them away.  

Note: what I'm about to say is *totally not* what I would do in your situation. Having any kind of negative attitude towards my friends is an automatic trip to splitsville. On this I am not willing to compromise.  But you asked for compromise,  so here is what that could look like in this situation......  


A compromise is that you'll always tell him when you're hanging out with your guy friends and where you'll be. It may mean not hanging out with any guy friend one-on-one.  It may mean deleting any flirty comments from your guy friends on your Facebook page.  

It does not mean being nasty to good men to drive them away. It does not mean never interacting with a man in public ever again (see the gym incident). It does not mean forcing yourself to keep quiet about your interests because they are not traditionally feminine. It does not mean forcing yourself to be friends with girls you may have nothing in common with outside of a vagina.  

In short. He's being a controlling asshole in my opinion and you sound awesome enough that there should be no reason at all to put up with this bullshit.
