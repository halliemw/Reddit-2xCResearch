It's weird how he thinks that the ex-girlfriend is responsible for making him happy. She isn't, that's kind of the point of breaking up with someone. It's not her problem anymore. Or at least it wouldn't be if he weren't still harassing her two years after their four-month relationship ended.

This is such a twisted way to look at things, it made my stomach turn. Cutting off contact isn't about 'creating devastation', or 'demonstrating power'. It isn't about the other person, it's about doing what is best for yourself.

After I broke up with my ex, I wanted to remain friends but I thought it would be healthy to break contact for a while first. When we discussed things like when to pick up each other's things, I was emotionally distant, and this made him very angry. He said it was "barbaric", that I was being "hateful", and that he wasn't sure he'd want to be friends at all if I didn't start talking to him again. Of course, that just proved that he needed some more time apart from me, and eventually he realised he'd been acting like an asshole and apologised. But yeah, this attitude pisses me off.
