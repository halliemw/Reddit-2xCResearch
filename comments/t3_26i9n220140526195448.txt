Actually that's only if you're a mandated reporter. OP may work for a babysitting company that requires you be a mandatory reporter but if OP's just a citizen and was hired, from say care.com, she/he isn't liable for not reporting suspicions to CPS. Although I'd still encourage all citizens to report suspicions/situations like this, especially as it can be done anonymously.
