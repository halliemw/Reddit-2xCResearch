Thank you for offering this perspective.  This is part of the reason I've been so unsure about how to think about that night - I don't know if I was an active participant, I don't know if I initiated it or anything like that.  I can't imagine how shocking it must be to think you had mutually consensual sex, only to find out the next morning that your partner has no recollection of it because their mind was out of it, particularly when it's a side effect of medicine prescribed by a doctor.
