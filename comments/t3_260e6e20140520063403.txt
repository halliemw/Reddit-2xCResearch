This is exactly right. I work for a defense contractor, and my business unit deals with a lot of systems that have text-to-speech capabilities. Normally we include options for a few different voices of both genders, but a female voice is *always* the default. There have been some studies about female voices being more calming or what have you (relevant for military applications), but the real reason is simply that they're easier to hear in an environment with large amounts of white noise.

To the OP, the fact that they're used in service-type kiosks is because they're the best option for the application, not because it's some misogynistic social commentary. As to having less info on your gps, my guess is it came down to "why bother doing a bunch of work on an option few people will use," but obviously I can't say for sure. You could call the manufacturer's customer support and complain, I suppose.
