I've discovered they usually go quiet (in regards to marriage at least) when I tell them "If this man is the right one to be with, there's no rush because we'll be together for a lifetime - what's a few years to get to know each other? If he's the wrong one, I'll be glad that I didn't rush my decision." 

As for kids, it's more difficult since there are time limits on those happening. I don't want them, so I just say that but it brings up all kinds of other arguments as people try to convince me that it is a horrible decision. Oh well. :)
