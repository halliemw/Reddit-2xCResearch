Anna - long hair. Elsa - long hair. Merida - Had a whole program just to control the movement of her crazy long hair. She didn't care about being a princess, but she still had the beauty aspects, just in an unkempt kind of way. Rapunzel - her whole story was based on her hair! I can't really think of a princess before the CG that had short hair either, besides Snow White, but that was the 30's and I'm just going with that times were different. 
Girls with short hair today are considered edgy and brave for cutting off all their locks. Everyone is so surprised and the media goes nuts because someone other that P!nk has short hair.
