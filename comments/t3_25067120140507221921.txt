Thanks for the input! 

I don't believe she needs to wait until marriage, I just think she needs to wait until she's more mature and responsible. I don't know what her parents believe, but I think they are too realistic to tell her to wait until marriage. I don't know where she got that idea.

I'm sure she's telling her friends about her sexual experiences so I guess I can suggest she doesn't but I have the feeling it will get out anyways (either from her or him). I don't know what else to tell her. "Don't have sex because your peers will keep labeling you a slut"? I don't want to slut shame, either. 

I think her last boyfriend pressured her, but from what I can gather this new boyfriend is fairly innocent. I will definitely ask about her reasons for having sex though. 

There is a lot going on in her life right now and sex is only a small part of it. I'm happy to say she's been in counseling for a while now.
