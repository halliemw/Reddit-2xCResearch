I wonder how much the husband believes the Catholic stance, and how much he just does not want to admit he is questioning his faith.  In a reply in another thread the OP states that when they discussed birth control, the husband said it was a sin but if she uses it he just does not want to know about it.  A pro-life and anti-contraception stance is harder to keep when one is in the position of either abstaining from sex in your marriage forever, or taking on the cost of caring for more and more babies.
