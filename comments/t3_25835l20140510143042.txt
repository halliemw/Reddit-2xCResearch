Personally I'd get on the pill and skip it altogether. Although that doesn't work for everyone! I have basically never had my period on a holiday, festival, prom, wedding - anything vaguely important and I skip it if necessary, heh.

Have you ever used a menstrual cup? I'd look into a cup or perhaps a sea sponge (no personal experience with those). No waste, all you need is a bottle of water and somewhere private where you can rinse it out.
