You didn't really explain anything at all, you just stated it. But note, how it's only to you that I am responding with this, even though *a lot* of people are agreeing with you? But they are not aggressive in the process of doing so (and some, very insightful).

I mean, sure, "I don't think I was being aggressive" is an ironclad analysis of potential wrongdoing. Well, if you don't think you were excessively aggressive, then, you don't. I think you were.
