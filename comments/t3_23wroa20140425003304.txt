I totally understand how infuriating this must be for you. You family is trying so hard to be progressive and understanding that they've done a full 360 and they're back at pinning stereotypes on someone who doesn't fit socially accepted gender roles. 

For what it's worth, I'm totally a tomboy too. Most of the kids I played with were boys (to be fair, I was the only girl my age on the block), I was athletic, I loved to play outside in the woods and catch snakes and insects, I played with dolls but I had an equal interest in trucks, and it wasn't until adulthood that I took any interest in fashion or makeup. I also didn't have my first boyfriend until I was in my early 20s (21 I think). I always liked boys, they just weren't high on my list of priorities at the time. I actually suspect my family might have had similar "she may be gay" thoughts about me as well, until I finally did start bringing boys home. 

I would tell your mom that, although you know she means well, assuming someone is gay because they don't fit the feminine mold is stereotyping and hurtful. It's the same as assuming all gay men must be super feminine, hysterically emotional, and great at interior design. The family thinks they're being accepting, but they're still being judgmental. Hopefully they'll get it eventually, and years from now you'll find the humor in the situation. It is kind of like something out of a sitcom if you think about it. :D

Another thought occurred to me. It's almost like they're excited for you to "come out of the closet". I wonder if part of their willingness to "accept and love you no matter what" is an attempt to feed their own ego. They have a gay daughter that they love, so they get to be the hero in the story who keep a loving family no matter what comes their way. Maybe this is just the pessimistic way of looking at it.
