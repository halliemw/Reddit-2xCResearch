Thanks so much for your kind words!

Yes, he's seen me but I'm not going to lie--only at strategic angles. I've showed him my whole body so it's not like I'm hiding it, but I would never let him see me in an unflattering way. There is NO doubt in my mind if he saw me in real life he would be repulsed. I know he likes girls who are smaller than I am, and he's just... he's tall and athletic and Scandinavian and surrounded by beautiful tall blonde girls all day. Gah.
