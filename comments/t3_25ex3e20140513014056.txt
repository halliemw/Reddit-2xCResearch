Snooping isn't good, but it was probably based on existing (and we can see justified) mistrust.

If your boyfriend ignores your concerns over what is an obvious 'sex' talk with an ex, I would suggest you consider to escalate it and get ready to break up if he doesn't at least apologize and change his ways.
