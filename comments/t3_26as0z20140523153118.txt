My husband is also the son of a hoarder, but came out the opposite; he kept his apartment so clean he lost a couple potential girlfriends over it.  One thought he was too picky, the other thought he had another girlfriend who cleaned for him.  When we met, we both lived in the barracks, where the cleanliness and clutter standards are enforced.  Turns out I'm messier, but am home all the time so I get to do the day to day stuff.
