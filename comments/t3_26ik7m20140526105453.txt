Tights/leggings are not pants. That includes opaque ones as well.

I am still baffled as to why women wear them as such. No matter how skinny, you can still see cellulite through them. Also showing are camel toes. Nothing seems more uncomfortable than a pair of bottoms that get sucked into your butt cheeks while walking.

Also, no matter how opaque women think those tights are, in the blazing sun, I can see through them. Even black opaque ones. 


But whatever, it's not my job to police what people wear. It does give me a good laugh though!
