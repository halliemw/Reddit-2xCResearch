I don't have a specific story to add, though I will say that the fact that your relationship was long-distance for a long time caught my eye- it's my experience that long-distance relationships don't present you with a realistic version of your actual relationship- meaning, if you did live together you could have a very different experience, where you are not always thrilled-super-happy to be in the same room (as happens when you only spend a few days together a month or whatever).
I'm sure it doesn't make this less painful, but i think you made a difficult decision for yourself, and i am optimistic you will fall in love again!
