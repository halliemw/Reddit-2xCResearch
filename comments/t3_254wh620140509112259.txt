As a fellow trans woman I understand exactly what you mean. But I'm trying to look at it from a different angle - sure there are a lot of cruel people in here now, but I'm proud to see so many TwoXers fighting back and sticking up for one another. The community is making me feel like I belong here more than ever before.
