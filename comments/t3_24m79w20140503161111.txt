I think there is a stigma around women who smoke marijuana. IMO it seems like a vice that men are able to speak more freely about than women. That could just be stemming from personal experience, but women who use drugs are more highly stigmatized than men. When a man uses drugs he is labeled a drug user. When a woman is a drug user she is not only that, she is usually labeled with a lot of other negative things too. Anyone else have any thoughts/opinions on this?
