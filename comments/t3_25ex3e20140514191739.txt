Adults are allowed to have conversations with other adults without their partners being involved.

It's about the intention. If he was sneaking around, had a second phone that he kept hidden, things like that, yes that's a reason to distrust him.  Her going through his online conversations is a damn good reason to distrust HER. He has more reason to break off the relationship than she does.

If this was a man going through his parters phone, texts, and online conversations and getting angry with her for talking to a man and making jokes and accusing her of infidelity we'd call that abusive and controlling.
