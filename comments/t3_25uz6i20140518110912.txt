Yes! My mom had a similar reaction when I happened to mention that my boyfriend and I used lube ("What? Why? You shouldn't need lube in your 20s. Are you okay?"). I mean, kudos to her for caring enough about my sexual health to worry about vaginal dryness, but I had the awkward task of explaining the...less strictly practical uses. Haha.
