I disagree and think they work well for the skirt thing. I mean, I wouldn't try to ride them in a maxi skirt or a really voluminous skirt, but getting on and especially off a step through bike while wearing a skirt is so much easier and more graceful than with the more conventional men's bike or whatever you call it. I ride a bike to and from grad school every day, and switching from a women's bike to a men's bike has made days when I have to dress nice a pain. Yeah, I can wear pants, but I prefer skirts when looking professional and I hate having to consider my bike when making my choices, because I'm fairly certain one of these days I'm going to just fall over trying to dismount in a skirt or dress. Now, if you aren't using it for transportation to professional events or you don't like or wear dresses, the frame type doesn't matter of course.
