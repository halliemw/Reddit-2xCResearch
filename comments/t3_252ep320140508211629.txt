Man this is like my first tampon story too... I was like 12 and at my cousin's house and we were on the way to an amusement park. Out of pads, I went for a tampon. I had no idea you were supposed to put the applicator INSIDE, so the tampon ended up being very very far down. Which, as you said, hurts like a bitch. I just kinda figured it was how it was supposed to be, and proceeded to go on roller coasters all day. Which constantly jammed my crotch against the seat restraints. Ouch! I was in tears by the end, and of course the tampon didn't work very well that far down. What a disaster. I eventually bought a crappy expensive pad from the park washroom.

I have recently made the switch to menstrual cup and at first I had that same sensation when it was put in wrong, I had flashbacks. But now I'm super happy with it!
