I almost expect to get down voted, but I want to contribute a slightly different point of view.

My father was also verbally (frequently), and physically (rarely), abusive. Things got better pretty much the second I moved out and started supporting myself. He realized that I had the option to simply walk away if he continued his behavior. And so he stopped. Gradually, over time, I was able to forgive. And now we have a relationship of mutual respect. If I had simply cut him out of my life I'd have missed out on that. 

So, my advice is to focus on becoming independent. Don't put too much emotional energy into your family--right now your focus should be on starting your own life. A little distance can bring a lot of clarity. 

Oh, and your dad knows damn well he crossed a line. The fact that he stopped before actually hitting you shows that. Keep maintaining your boundaries, focus on getting out, but don't lash back at him, tempting though it might be. That would be counterproductive at best.
