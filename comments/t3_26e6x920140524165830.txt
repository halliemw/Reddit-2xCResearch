I've been seeing your posts around here on the last few threads, and you'r behavior is not okay. I only looked at maybe 6 of your recent posts here, and they were all either blaming the OP for a problem they were encountering, or in some way telling them that they are wrong. This is supposed to be a safe, non-judgmental place, and your posts are far from non-judgmental. You're acting as if you're entitled for this community to meld to your own attitudes, when you aren't even a woman. I'm not either, but I try to be supportive, or not say anything at all. You're being rude; you're a guest here, act like one. Otherwise, unsubscribe and move along, please.
