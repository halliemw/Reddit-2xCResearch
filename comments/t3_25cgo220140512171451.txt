14 days left of school,  found out that I'll be teaching Algebra 2, Precalculus, and AP Calculus next year, and was given wonderful compliments by my principal. Today has really assured me that I'm doing what I should be doing and I'm doing a pretty good job at it. Oh and 67 days left till I marry an amazing man :)
