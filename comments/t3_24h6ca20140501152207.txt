I am on the pill. I picked it because it is simple and what I'm used to. I don't have trouble remembering to take it everyday. I use a generic Seasonique and it's free. I like it because I only get a period 4 times a year.

I thought about the patch when I was younger and didn't know how to swallow pills, but then I learned how to swallow pills before I got on BC. I feel like initially I would forget to change the patch after 7 days. I'm not comfortable with the nuva ring. I know how to put it in, theoretically, but I don't like the idea of putting it inside myself.

No bad effects ever. My periods are less painful and shorter than when I was off BC. When I was off it, my cycle was 35 days with a 9 day period. Now, it's about 5 days long. 

Hope that helps!!
