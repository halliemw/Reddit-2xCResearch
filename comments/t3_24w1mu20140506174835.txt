Thanks for your comment anyway! I think volunteering is great advice and I do make a point to give back as much as possible. I used to have a lot more time to commit to volunteer work and I LOVED it but with such a demanding job it gets hard to find the time and motivation to do anything but collapse on the couch at the end of the day. 

I'm going to have to reevaluate my free time.
