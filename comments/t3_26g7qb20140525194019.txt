Oh god. Flashbacks. 

I was at a wedding that required weekend travel. The wedding was gorgeous, the day was beautiful, I was having a blast... And I was PMSing. And for most of the day I held it all off and had a good time. And then after the reception, we were all going to bed, going back to our respective hotel rooms. And for no reason I just started to cry. And my boyfriend asked why, and because I couldn't explain myself, felt really stupid, that made me cry more. He felt awful, which made me feel worse, and more crying. Poor guy. 

I still look back to this and WTF at myself when I recall it.
