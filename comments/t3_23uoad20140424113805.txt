Except the example you used was "black person," which would mean the shirt says you hate someone for a characteristic that they cannot control instead of for their behaviors (i.e., being obnoxious and saying X-BOX IS HITLER).

If you had a shirt that said, "I hate rude people" I think that would be more in-line with the reason for hatred.
