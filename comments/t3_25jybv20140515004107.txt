Waiting periods and other measures like mandatory ultrasounds have been shown to have very little impact upon women's decisions to get abortions. But they do put unnecessary obstacles in their way. Most women that go through with abortions have already thought things through in making their decision.  

These things are also a huge financial burden. By creating laws that are designed to pressure clinics to close, women have to travel out to available clinics and for poor women, having to wait 3 days could be impossible to afford, to get time off from work, to make multiple trips back and forth or to stay in a hotel.
