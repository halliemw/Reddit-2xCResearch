It's hard to pinpoint, it's just one of those things that annoys me. I think it's a combination of things -  Generic. I've always had nicknames for SOs that originate from some kind of funny story or adventure together. - I also think 'baby' is a bit patronizing. Plus there is just something "Kardashian-esque" (haha) to calling someone "baby/babe". 
Also, what am I, Babe, Pig in the City? Haha I dunno exactly.
