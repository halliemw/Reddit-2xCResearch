How is that brainwashing? You cannot force a woman to get an abortion and you cannot force her to carry a baby to term. You can't force anybody to drastically change their body in any situation, for anybody. Period. As far as I'm concerned, when that baby is inside the woman, that is her baby, her "possession", and her choice 100%. 

However, when that baby is born, it is no longer inside the mother and it becomes the product of two participants. So, logically, both of the participants SHOULD be held responsible for the child they created, however you can't force a father to be a father. I agree that OP should make sure she is financially stable to raise a baby on her own, as all women should, because there's no guarantee that the man will stick around.
