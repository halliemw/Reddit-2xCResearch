You might also get some good info/advice if you try asking r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide or r/SkinCareAddiction. Though I don't think the picture you showed me looks bad at all.

(Am I the only one who read the title and imagined someone's under-arm hair becoming prehensile at night, and extending itself out to physically choke her self-confidence, or enter her ear, connect with her brain, and send it telepathic messages to feel bad about it? Like some kind of eldritch entity of body-shaming?)
