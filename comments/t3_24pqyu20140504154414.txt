Note that the characters in Disney movies typically face very serious threats on their lives. When your life has been in the kind of danger that Disney characters face, the trials of every day life are, comparatively speaking, happily ever after. The end of the story isn't usually "we were rich and have everything we want forever" as much as it is "we were no longer terribly miserable and in danger".
