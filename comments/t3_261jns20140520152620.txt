My stepmother came into my life when I was 9.  She had not yet become a mother but she had been in a relationship prior that involved a child.  Not to say she was "bad" at being a mother figure but she definitely lacked the experience of what being a mother meant and how to navigate those waters.  

I am now 34 and she is one of my best friends.  She ended up having two kids with my father and at that point it really clicked with her.  However, some of the things I remember being really special with her was when she would take me for one on one time. One of the best times I remember was her taking me to get my own face wash, lotions, makeup etc at Bed & Bath.  Also we would go to movies and watch "chick flicks" together.  She didn't talk about my dad or my mom.  She asked about me, my school, friends, crushes, etc.

You may not be able to get this family time you are envisioning.  Boys have some strange phases too.  However if you can establish a relationship with just her, excluding everyone else in your time with her, it might be easier come the time you gather as a family.  

Don't try too hard though to be overly nice etc.  Just relate to her on her level.  She is growing into a young woman and probably likes clothes, makeup, manicure and pedicures.  She is exploring her inevitable womanhood early, it is a great time to be a part of that transition and become a valuable resource for her to rely upon with questions and information. 

One on one relationships are important to kids in this age range.  Often they are treated as one in the same, but they need that individualized affection and it is probably more acceptable for you to give it than the parents.
