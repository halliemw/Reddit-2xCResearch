Ok, here's the thing, we've had multiple groups since defaulting trying different angles to get us undefaulted for different reasons. Many of those groups we expected to throw up a fuss. We knew that certain subreddits would be really pissed off that a subreddit dedicated to women was defaulted, and we knew those groups would up the trolling and drama mongering. We've been dealing with trolling from those same groups for years, some since the day 2xc was created. It's nothing new to us. They are still trying, btw, trying to sow seeds of drama and discontent where ever they can.

We also knew that some of our own users would be upset, and we expected that some of those would never be okay with it. Two things we didn't expect (or at least I didn't) that random guys that wouldn't normally be pegged in those groups would be upset because "fairness" or we're "too niche" and that users that have been part of this community would not only lie about the amount of harassment they've received but send others harassing PM with alts as well as upvoting harassing comments here.

Don't be mad at the admins for giving us a better picture of what we're dealing with, they aren't saying the harassing PM's don't real. They even clarified that harassing PM's are happening. Be mad at the people that claimed to be part of this community and made it inherently less safe by participating in what they did. They are the ones that screwed things.
