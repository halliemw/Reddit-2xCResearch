I got hair extensions once. ONCE. They were beautiful, but the total cost (hair, color matching, insertion, maintenance and removal) was $4000 and about 20 hours in the chair at the salon. They lasted six months but probably should have had them out after four. The bonds were annoying, I was constantly de-tangling and I can't afford $8-12K/yr for hair. Sadly, I don't have enough hair to cover clip-ins and my hair is too smooth and thin to braid in extensions. 

I have two purple/silver containers of Got2Be hair powder (silica silylate) in my cupboard. When my hair was extra short I would use it religiously and it worked wonders. Now that my hair is a little longer it just makes it stiff and clumpy so I gave it up a few months ago. :-(  Plus, it takes three washes with mega shampoo to get it to come out.

I have tried backcombing but I have such thin hair there's not much to backcomb nor to cover the knot afterward. :-(
