At this stage, you could still have a medical abortion (take some pills) instead of a surgical abortion. It would be far less costly and invasive. Hopefully your period will come and you'll be fine, but talk to your doctor to see your options.

Also, figure out a birth control method that works for you so you don't have to worry about this in the future.
