I put up with my asshole ex for 4 years. I often think back about any one of a million specific incidents, and wonder 'how was that not the moment? How did I not break it off right there?'

But that's not helpful. All you can do now is move on and heal. Congratulations on being strong enough to break the cycle. A master manipulator got in your head and turned you around so much, you thought you were the crazy one, but you got out. Bravo.
