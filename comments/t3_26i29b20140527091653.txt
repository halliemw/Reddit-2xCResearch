I kinda could tell it was coming a few days prior to him saying it, so I wasn't totally blindsided which I think helped me not say something completely fucking stupid. I told him that I couldn't say it back yet because I wanted to be 100% sure before saying something like that to him especially since it's my first relationship, and he understood completely, which is amazing. It helps that he already knew he kinda had a tendency to fall fast in relationships, so he knew I might not be ready yet before he even said it. It didn't create any kind of negative feelings between us.
