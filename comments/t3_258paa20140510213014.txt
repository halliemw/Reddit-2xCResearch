By 'examining' I mean a kind of weird fixation that stemmed from how horrible I thought it all was. It took up a lot of time, anyway. Maybe I need to back track a bit and first suggest you get comfortable at least with yourself, alone. Not necessarily liking it, but being able to look at yourself and not freak out. Play the eye contact trust game in the mirror? haaah oh, I don't know. I'm not much of an advice person. I'm glad to see at least that your relationship seems healthy and caring otherwise, that will make it much easier to make progress.
