Too many times I have had people purposely misinterpret me for fun, so I'm understandably on edge--especially with your "did you read the article" comment.

You're right. The article isn't clear.

Now, as I see it?

Stuff like this doesn't just happen. There's build up. I'm saying--and please do not misinterpret again--that teachers should take notice all the time because they might catch something before it happens. Not 100% perfect solution, but it's better than nothing.
