The evidence for the mental health treatment system working is bountiful.  You should check out how much better the hospital outcomes are vs. prison outcomes with respect to rehabilitation.  The statistics are very one sided.  The problem is that you are confusing the police and prosecutors with doctors, nurses, social workers, therapists, and various other mental health aides.  The police and prosecutors are not related to the mental health system other than the arrest and transport of people deemed mentally incompetent.  The police can't charge someone with a crime for being creepy.  They don't even have the power to charge somebody.  It seems to me that for you to make this comment you don't have a good grasp on how either the legal system or the mental health system works.  Nobody should get locked up for what they might do.  I shudder to think about how that would wind up.
