Most side effects of the pill are widely variable. That said, the pill is often the go-to method for dealing with people who have major hormonal mood swings or acne or whatever. You would likely see an improvement of those symptoms by going on the pill, though of course there's no guarantee. PMS typically is a result of changing hormones, not necessarily high levels of hormones, so finding the right stable dose can do a lot for you and you can even skip periods entirely on some pills. Weight gain, especially significant weight gain, is actually pretty uncommon, especially with certain hormonal birth controls. For example, Depo (the shot) commonly causes a large increase in appetite which results in weight gain. 

That said, no one can make you take it and you're entirely within your rights not to. Your concerns are valid, and just because the problems you mention are fairly uncommon doesn't mean you should outright ignore them. At the same time, if your SO doesn't feel safe with only NFP and condoms, he shouldn't have PIV sex with you because it's not fair to ask him to risk financial security for the next 18 years or so if he feels the risk is too high.

You both need to discuss *all* of your options. You can add a copper IUD, which contains no hormones, or a hormonal IUD, which contains only localized hormones. You could discuss other barrier methods like diaphragms and caps, which are less effective than condoms but can be combined with condoms to increase your level of protection (this is only an option if you are not allergic to spermicide). I also think it sounds like you are much less worried about pregnancy than he is and maybe because on some level you think that pregnancy/a child would be some sort of just punishment for all your premarital sex? If that's the case, you might want to rethink your stance on that since you wouldn't be the only one affected, and I'm sure you don't think your SO is a bad man for having sex with you.
