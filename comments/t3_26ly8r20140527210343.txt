As soon as he touched you at all you pretty much had the right to destroy him. Good on you for sparing his life, whether it was right or wrong, taking some ones life wouldve weighed on your mind till the day you died... Wtf is with people thinking they can approach other random people in the middle of the night though. I guess some people NEED to be hurt so they realize they can't keep doing what they think is ok.
