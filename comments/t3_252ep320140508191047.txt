I had just turned 12, and I went to take a shower before going to a friends house. Blood. Everywhere. However, in my mind, I was convinced that period blood would only be from my vagina up, so when the blood was all over my butt area, I was convinced I was BLEEDING FROM MY BUTT. I then proceeded to argue with my mother that I wasn't on my period because it was clearly also coming from my butt. She then LET ME GO TO MY (MALE) FRIENDS HOUSE WITHOUT PADS. 

Ugh.
