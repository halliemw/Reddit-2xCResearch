My boy was getting sick of me being on the phone so I stopped reading about halfway through.  So I'm just gonna go head and ask .she goes on about how her big tits make it hard for her to nurse in a comfortable way and she goes on about how it's really difficult for her to cover so much boob in public and that it makes her uncomfortable for strangers to see her exposed .
So my question is , did she ever mention anything about using a breast pump? I always pumped before going out.  Although there were times when I had fed my son recently that I couldn't pump much out. So at times like those I'd pack some formula. Yet otjet times my boobies just hirt so id whip up spme formula. With that being said my son didn't have formula daily and sometimes week's would go by before he would have anything other than my breastmilk. Btw that fact that my son wasn't unfamiliar to formula it helped tremendously 9 months later when it became time to ween him. 
I guess what I'm suggesting is that for any women who have the problem she does or just simple don't want to nurse in public.  Then I suggest a pump or allow that to be the time your child has formula. That's how i did it and my son is perfect.  We both received the benefits for breastfeeding and i never had to feel exposed in public. Btw the occasional formula had no side effects. 
Sorry for typos and spelling
