I'm not sure.  It's not something we can do as mods -- though we did make a suggestion to the admins of what we thought a good PM system might have for options (along the lines of "everyone can PM me" "only friends can PM me" "no one can PM me").  

If the admins like the idea (I hope they will!), it might still take a while for them to implement it though.
