As a mod, I can assure you that we do believe that there has been an uptick in PM activity, and have no reason to doubt particular instances.  

**Please do NOT post harassing PMs to /r/TwoXChromosomes.  When we allowed these posts to reach the frontpage, we immediately saw a spike in PM activity.  Letting the trolls know they're getting under your skin just gives them the attention they want and encourages them to redouble their efforts**

Please report any nasty PMs to the reddit admins by messaging a link to /r/reddit.com , or by clicking "report" underneath the comment. This will allow the admins to deal with this particular user, as well as give us a better idea of the scale (and sources) of the problem. 

If you'd like to share screencaps with us, you can also message the mods by sending a message to /r/TwoXChromosomes
