It all clicked when my mother, a no bullshit type woman, I called her when he was going through a really rough period when his dad was in hospice, he was scheduled for a deployment and we were questioning if I could handle it, and he was traveling a lot as his dad was in the mid west. Seemed like everytime he went out there, in two weeks he had to go back again.... 

So I called my mom as I didn't know what 'to do' for him.... she said "AwkwardBurritoChick... this is an easy one.  What you do is BE HIS FRIEND".   So for us, yes the friendship is the most important a factor.. not "what should I do as a girlfriend or lover" but keeping it real and accepting each other as we are, and genuinely caring and looking out for each other.
