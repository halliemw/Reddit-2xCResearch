Firstly, characterizing any of this as frothy is pretty disrespectful--if you understand why we'd be angry, why are you being judgmental about that anger?  Anger is a useful tool, and this space is a place where we come to vent--I'd wager that most of us aren't angry people by nature and most of the posters are just recalling a time when they felt belittled by this sort of assholery in their lives.  

Characterizing people in this thread as angry, frothy, and using terms like "people like you' are othering, distancing and petty tactics to try to diminish and dismiss the entirely valid feelings the people in this thread who have been verbally harassed by people in the street, on the bus, on a train, in their workplace etc.

If we don't point it out, get angry about it and explain it to other people there's very little that can be done about it.  The truth of the matter is, there's enough people out there who think this shit is "complimentary" and either do it or don't see anything the matter with it that ignoring it hasn't worked, it never has.  And up earlier in this thread you even claimed it was a compliment--are you retracting that? If not, I'd say you're part of the problem even if you're shy.

It's not okay and the fewer people who think it's socially acceptable the better, because one thing that most people respond to is social pressure--and you don't create social pressure without pointing out what the problem is.
