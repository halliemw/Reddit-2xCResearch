Pretty much! just wander in and go "hey, do you guys have an volunteer opportunities?" :D

Depending on their policy there might be an application or a process/training to go through, but it shouldn't be too much. I've found that people who work for the humane society tend to be really nice and helpful and like having volunteers around. If they don't need volunteers at the moment they can usually direct you somewhere that does.
