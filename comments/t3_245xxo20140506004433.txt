I just started using menstrual cups last month -- and I can't tell you how much I love it. I'm also an active person, going to the gym/swimming and running with my dog makes me rinse/shower 2x a day. Literally, change it in the morning and the evening and you'll be good! Before, I had to change my tampon - especially after swimming since I never liked that feeling of having a damp wet string.
Since you're in Australia, I highly suggest you try the SoftCup (look them up in Amazon!). That was my "test" to see if I liked it -- and I'm honestly going to stick with it.
