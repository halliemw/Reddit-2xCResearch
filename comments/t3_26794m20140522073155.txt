You go to work to do work. I don't think this necessarily has anything to do with them being pregnant, and has everything to do with them not being conscientious workers. They waste a lot of time on personal research instead of doing work, and causing a net loss in productivity. Even ignoring the time they're taking off, they're not working as they should be when able, it seems.

So yeah. A new worker to replace one or more of the sisters would be a good thing. They've certainly done enough research, so if they're left unemployed I'm sure they'll be fine enough. They seem resourceful enough for that. I wouldn't really feel sorry for them.
