True, but most forcible rapes are committed by deliberate predators who offend repeatedly.  If someone appears meek or demure, they may seem like an easier target to a rapist.  Someone who's less likely to resist and less likely to report if resistance fails.

That said, social science research of this kind should always be taken with a grain of salt.  You should never draw firm conclusions from a single study.  Especially in the social sciences where methodology is somewhat sloppy by necessity.

**edit:** Can someone please explain why this is being downvoted?  I honestly don't understand.
