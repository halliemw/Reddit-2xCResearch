Sorry; it was in response to the person above me that claimed this was a feminist subreddit.  And as I said, the feminists over at SRS are not for equal rights.  This is the feminism that I have been exposed to.  This is what I am judging the movement on. Egalitarianism on the other hand is about equal rights without the gendered phrasing.
