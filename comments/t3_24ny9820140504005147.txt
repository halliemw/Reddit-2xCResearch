Yeah- pants are gonna be tough. If you have a cup, I'd use that and a maxi-pad. If not, a tampon right before you put them on and a pad as well. You should be fine if you double up- pads are a lot thinner than they used to be.

(Out of curiosity- what culture asks for white clothes to a wedding themed anything? I was always told it was really gauche to wear white to a wedding event unless you are one getting married- NE USA here.)
