Find "common ground", shared interests. Observe others being social and pick up on their "tricks". Remember being social is a skill, it requires practice! Oh and when talking to somebody, listen to what they are saying rather than worrying about what you should be saying... and ask questions/make comments about what they said, or simply repeat a bit of what they said.
