It sounds like you're more bored with your appearance than anything. I would recommend getting new glasses or trying out contacts if you can wear them. Also, a little bit of makeup can make all the difference in the world. If you feel that your cheeks are chubby I would go to a makeup place (Ulta, Sephora, etc..) and ask them about contouring. Contouring can make a huge difference and really slim down your face. Also, try a new hair style or color. I was really bored with my appearance so I cut off several inches of hair and got subtle highlights. A small change can really go a long way and make you more confident. Maybe buy yourself a new outfit. There's all sorts of things you can do to change your appearance you just need to figure out how much you want to change and what you want to change about yourself.
