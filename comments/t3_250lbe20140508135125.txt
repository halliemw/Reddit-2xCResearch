The way you describe your hair is sooo similar to my own. I'm only 20, and my hair has thinned noticeably in the past few years. It makes me worried that by the time I'm 40, I'll just be bald!

You said the extensions were pretty. Why not go back to that? Lots of people have extensions or fake hair for their whole lives. It sounds like that would really up your confidence.
