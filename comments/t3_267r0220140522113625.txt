While I would go with your doctor's recommendation for a hormonal based BC due to your other health issues, I feel like you're kind of exaggerating the effects of the copper IUD, and I really don't want other women to be turned off to it since it is a really great option for some.

It is normal that in your first couple of cycles (and up to a year) to have heavier bleeding/longer periods. Most women report that it normalizes though and become more in line with your original period. I had a copper IUD inserted almost a month ago now, I had spotting and cramping for the first two weeks, but after that it's been smooth sailing. I'll have to see what my first actual period is like though, but I'm hopefully it will turn out as well as the post-insertion process went.

It sounds like you're SUPER stressed. I would look in to yoga, meditation, or some other kind of non-prescription form of stress relief. Yoga might also help with your joints and other pain. I'm turning 28 and have noticed that my joints are finally starting to catch up with all of the sports and dancing I did when I was younger. It sucks. My doctor has suggested yoga and LOTS MORE water to help counter act that. It seems to be working for me.

Have you talked to your doctor about fibromyalgia? Quite a few of the symptoms you're experiencing fall under that.
