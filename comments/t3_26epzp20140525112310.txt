I don't understand why those of you whi are reasonable feminists are so stubborn about using that name today. Sadly, that word has a lot of negative connotations with it thanks to extremists. You create so many enemies that would otherwise be 100% on your side by insisting you be called a feminist. Just seems like a lot of wasted energy to me.
