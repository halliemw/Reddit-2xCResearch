Just say that you can't think of an answer right away and can you take a moment to think about it. I have done this and I've gotten every job I've ever interviewed for other than one (I offended the interviewer, but I stand by what I said! :P) so I presume it is not harmful to do this 

Also if you don't know the answer to a question you can just say 'I don't know the answer to that, but I am going to research it when I leave'. This might be more relevant to me as I work in a technical field where there are questions that only have one answer!

I've interviewed people who have been caught like a deer in a headlight when I've asked a question and some of them decided it was a good idea to talk about something completely unrelated to the question to buy themselves some time whilst they thought of an answer. This is incredibly annoying - don't do this. Just ask for a moment.
