I read this article earlier today, I agree with many of the premises in the article. We are going overboard with the political correctness culture. We've become so oversensitive that we are choosing to live disconnected from reality and we are teaching a generation of weak and fragile minds. This victim-hood complex is being perpetuated by feminist circles and it is getting tiring. I was so glad when I was reading the New York Times to see this article show up, it shows me that even the left is starting to tire of feminist extremists.
