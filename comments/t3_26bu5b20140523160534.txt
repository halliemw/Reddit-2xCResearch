We really need to move on. Don't you realise that un-defaulting is going to cause an even bigger Reddit storm and make TwoX look really silly? The mods have done what they have done, they didn't ask us when they pondered over the decision so it's pretty clear that the voices of the users of TwoX redditors are not worth their time. All we can do now is try our best to help the moderators (by downvoting, reporting etc) even though they have almost "betrayed" us and changed TwoX for the worse.   

**They will never default. They have nothing to gain.**
