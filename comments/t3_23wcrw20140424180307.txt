I only wore sunscreen growing up when my mom would make me and even though I'm still pretty young I can look back and think about how stupid that was! I constantly encourage my friends to stop tanning (or at least decrease it, because I know it's hard to quit completely). 

The La Roche is a bit pricey but it has rave reviews so I might have to try that out. First I'm going to work on getting into a habit of reapplying throughout the day though!
