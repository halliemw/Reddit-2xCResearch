I honestly have no clue! Uniforms can also help out a lot with income disparity issues, because when you're all dressed the same it's hard to get picked on for being too poor.

At the same time, I understand there would be backlash, and kids should be able to express themselves, etc. 

Wish I had uniforms when I was younger simply so it was easier for me to get ready in the morning, haha
