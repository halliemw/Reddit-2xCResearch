>Are these people so crippled with white guilt that they need to put up banners and take out radio ads to convince everyone that they're not the sexist, racist, homophobic dildos that their parents were? Are they so guilty for being assholes to their kids that they're overcompensating by inventing an issue to be not-assholes about?
