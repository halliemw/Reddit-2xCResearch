Have you tried [Swim Outlet](http://www.swimoutlet.com/womens-swimwear-c9326/). The suits for competition-type swimming aren't the most fashionable, but they offer sizing based on measurements. Back in my swimming days, we were always able to find suits for everyone (stick thin, tall, busty, etc.) and the quality is good for several years!

Edit: they do have a fashion and plus-sized section! I haven't tried them personally, so I don't know about the quality of those suits.
