I suggest you start bringing gay comics, and if you're an artist, draw D and M doing extremely sexual things, even if it's terrible, talk about it at length, and in graphic detail. Even just once, it would be enough to give him a taste of his own medicine. Then, as soon as they balk at it, tell them "Well how do you think what you draw makes me feel?"
