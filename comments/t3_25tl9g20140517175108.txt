She sounds rather toxic. All of the things that irritate or stress you out now will be tenfold as worse for a baby. It will be infinitely more difficult to set up boundaries after the baby is born and people are settled into routines, so if you want to make rules - such as no visits unless the house is clean or no smoking while the baby is in the house - you'll want to set those boundaries sooner rather than later. Hopefully your SO can stay supportive. Solidarity will be key to enforcing any rules.

It sounds like you are going to have a full plate. I wish you good luck!
