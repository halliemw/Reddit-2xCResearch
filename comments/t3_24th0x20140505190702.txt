Whatever feelings of insecurity and jealousy your boyfriend might feel, his criticisms of you is absolutely cruel and invalid. Because of his own personal issues he is invalidating you as a person and gaslighting you. And I'm so sorry, but your incident at work sounds like sexual harrasment at best and assault at the worst. And you got fired? And your boyfriend is blaming you for what happened? WHAT A JERK.

Remember this: You absolutely absolutely not at fault for what any of those two guys did. You told them you were taken. They acted in an intensely creepy way that completely dismissed any of your feelings on the matter. They crossed the line, not you. This is fairly common with men, no matter how uncomfortable you are or how much you assert yourself they will always cross the line because your agency as a woman is not something they respect.

I am so so so that you have to deal not only with those assholes, but your boyfriend.
