For us, that just isn't a good enough reason to deny the other person sex. We just put each others needs before our own personal wants. 

Either of us don't want to have sex and just lay around and watch tv because we are very tired, sick, etc? Then we don't have sex. But just because we are feeling lazy? Not so much of a good reason for us.
