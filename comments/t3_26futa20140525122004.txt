I totally agree with you that he probably has had his fair share of rejections and most likely intense periods of self-loathing have been a product of this. Nevertheless, responsibility has to really wholly lie with him; I suppose it's important to make young boys be able to handle rejection and to respect the decision of whomever they've pursued without taking it too personally. A tough task perhaps...
