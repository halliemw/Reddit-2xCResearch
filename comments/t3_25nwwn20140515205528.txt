Oh dear.  Yes, this can happened, which is why I only mention weight to people whom I know well.

I think the take-away is that we need to get to know each other better (harder to do today than in previous decades).

Personally, I never mention weight to people who aren't 1) close family members who have mentioned their weight loss programs previously or 2) very close friends, ditto.
