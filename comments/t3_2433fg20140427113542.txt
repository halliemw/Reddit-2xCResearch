Oh I'm pretty sure the guy was pushing car #1, just to get it off the lot quicker (it was a year older than their inventory goes for), not because he really thought it was really a "better" car. He just couldn't hold it in when my reason for not going with it seemed so frivolous instead of respecting that caring about the aesthetics might be important for a 10k+ purchase. After putting so much effort into evaluating which cars had the best condition for the money I was willing to spend, allowing myself to give up a few miles to get something that I wanted was pretty liberating! 

Good for you for getting what you actually wanted! Yay good deals.
