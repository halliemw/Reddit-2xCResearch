In both cases, it is an arbitrary establishment of a social norm that advocates for the removal of hair from certain body parts according to the sex of the individual at hand. It is obstinate to make the double-standard argument without considering that both sexes have such expectations and that your father obliges his role in the interests of being more attractive to others. If you don't wish to shave, totally your call. But it makes you sound silly to point to someone who does so and reject social norms based on their decisions, when they adhere to the same social norms.
