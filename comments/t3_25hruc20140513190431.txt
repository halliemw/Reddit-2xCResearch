Between 30 - 32 I dated a drop dead gorgeous tall dark iranian prince who brought me lots of expensive jewlary, Then I had a brief fling with a 19yr old i met at a bar with er a lot of stamina ;) I spent a few weeks with a 24yr old carpenter who sucked at mortal kombat & then dated a 31yr old spiritual musician who smoked to much weed but damn was awesome in the bedroom.

I'm not even that gorgeous. I'm cute I think :D Well I can be maybe not all the time :P but the redpillers might put me at a level 6 or something ;)

Now I am 32 in love with someone who loves me back. Don't stress life is to short to be waiting for men and wondering what's wrong with you. Start thinking what's wrong with THEM :D
