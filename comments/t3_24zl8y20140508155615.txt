The difference here is that NFL players choose that career with the knowledge that there is a draft and that they will be rated on their abilities as a player and be ranked accordingly.  This "prom draft" ranks high school girls that (most likely) did not choose to be included in this draft.


> Is someone going to force a "drafted" girl to go the prom with whatever boy "drafts" her? They also have nothing to lose if they choose to say no.

Obviously the girls can say no, although maybe some may feel pressured to say yes because some boys have apparently paid over $100 to get a top pick (see [this other article](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/students-california-high-school-caught-running-nfl-like-prom-draft-article-1.1782971)).  The main issue is the ranking and the criteria that will be used for it (most likely looks and popularity).  Why should girls have to endured being compared to others in such an obvious way.  I know guys compare and discuss girls with each other (girls do the same thing with guys), but to blatantly judge girls in order to rank them is completely different.
