I think it's a pretty useless point to try and quantify how necessary this scene was to characterization with percentages.  You saw a woman cowering next to one of the guys with bruises covering her face before the rape scene.  Everything you "learned" from watching a woman get raped as her breasts and buttocks jiggle In frame, you had already learned from seeing that woman cowering with bruises.
