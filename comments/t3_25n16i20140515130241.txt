I had a similar situation a long time ago. I let my best friend come to me with all her problems, she would call at 2 am crying for me to pick her up just to go back the next day. Any advice I gave her was pushed to the side when she 'fell in love again' with him. It got to a point where it was affecting my relationship and my mental state. I realized I just could not put energy into her relationship anymore and it was completely draining to 'help her' every single day. I told her that I loved her and wished her the best, but that I couldn't have her come to me with her problems anymore. I needed to work on my own issues and focus on helping myself. I asked she stop talking to me about her relationship problems, but that I loved her to death, I just didn't love being involved anymore. She told me he was her entire world and if she couldn't talk to me about him then she couldn't talk to me. A month later after complete silence she texted me asking if he was at my house. I reminded her of our conversation and it ended with us not being friends. We haven't spoken in over two years, but her ex and I are great friends still. These situations are so hard to be in OP and I hope you can navigate it better than I did.
