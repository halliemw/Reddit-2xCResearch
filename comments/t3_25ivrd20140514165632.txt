That's because you have a normal sense of boundaries.  I think the world is in moral and ethical free fall at the moment, and the article shows how far away one person's sense of right and wrong can be from someone else's.  

If I didn't personally know people who hold to similar attitudes, I too would think it's a joke.  Most of us learn these things growing up, either at home or in the schoolyards (or outside in the neighborhood).  But frankly, the writer of the article sounds to me as if he's got an almost delusional or delusional mindset; ordinary thought patterns do not apply.
