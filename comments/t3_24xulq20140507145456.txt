i'll do anything and everything to give my husband pleasure. but he's not a huge fan of anal play (giving or receiving), though he let me rim him a few times in the past. i'm not really into receiving it either. it just doesn't feel great, and his dick is genuinely way too big for us to comfortably do anal without a ton of build-up.
