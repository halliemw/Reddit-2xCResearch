I think you would be surprised. If you are up-front about your weight and actually show that you're trying to live a healthier lifestyle. There are lots of good people online and in real life who appreciate and respect women who are trying to better themselves.

Fuck the people that don't think your a person just because you're overweight. Don't even give those people the time of day. 

You wont be anyone's "horror story" if you are upfront about your weight and your personality. 

As for dating advise, be careful about who messages you. There are men out there that just want you because you are fat and that is it. A meaningful and fulfilling relationship isn't made out of lust alone. Those kind of men are not after you because you're nice and interesting.
