- if someone is always talking crap about everyone else, don't think they're not doing it  about you when you're not around, so pay attention to who you hang around. 

- that change happens when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change (pretty sure that's a quote somewhere) 

- don't respond to someone picking on you, they'll get bored and move on (really helped me as a kid)
