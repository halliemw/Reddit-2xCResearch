As far as anyone else can tell there was one "false flag" and the rest of us suffered the results.  If there were indeed multiple people involved, it's hard to believe that they were women who cared about this sub at any point and more plausible that it's been part of the general attack on women's subs and speech and safety.

There was even a bestof post that lied blatantly and absurdly about a sub I am involved with, claiming that we want to kill men.

The levels of sick that this is in relation to current events.....
