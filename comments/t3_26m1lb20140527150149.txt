> What would you say to someone who has lost friends, a job, money, social status, gotten physically attacked, etc., speaking out and working against these things?

I think everyone here knows how hard it is to speak out against certain things, and by necessity sometimes you have to keep it to yourself (like with the job, at least until a replacement can be found) - but really, if you're so surrounded by toxic people and situations like what you just described, it's time to re-evaluate one's life.

Is this man you?
