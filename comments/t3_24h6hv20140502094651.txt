I know, I have turned down many jobs because of wind mostly. Also I don't go on metal roofs after it snows or rains. I tell the disbatch that I just don't feel comfortable and they say "Ok ill rescedule." no problem. And I didn't think I was tough for almost falling... I didn't laugh about it at all. My best work friend shattered both his ankles. It's not funny. Sorry if I made it seem like I was laughing about it.
