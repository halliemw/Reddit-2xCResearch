When a person shows you who he is, believe him.  I don't know how old either of you are but at any age, a man who shows you and your relationship so little respect isn't likely to suddenly change his behavior and attitudes. Talking about sleeping with other women belies a fundamental lack of respect for women in general and you in particular. He is not relationship material.
