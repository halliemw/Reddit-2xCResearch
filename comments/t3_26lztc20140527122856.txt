>  I guess I just wanted to say that if two people spend a lot of time together and even if they didn't view each other as prospective boyfriend/girlfriend material then they can end up getting attached to one another.

Absolutely true. I'm happily married but am also quite attached to my male friends - I love them like brothers.

Honestly? The best way to do so is explicitly - instead of relying on body language, joking around, or any other such beating around the bush, be clear in telling a friend that you're not interested in anything romantic. You can use body language to back that up - for example, hugging may be fine but choosing not to engage in back rubs, cuddling on the couch while watching a movie, etc - but in my experience it's very important to discuss the issue outright even if it's not the most comfortable conversation. Having this conversation earlier in the friendship rather than later is most likely to keep a friendship together since it heads off any expectations of things becoming romantic.
