Thank you so much for chiming in. I owe you an apology for using you as an example without talking to you first, and I am so glad you shared your voice. 

I totally agree that the mods care about this sub, and I'm sorry if it came across otherwise. Likewise, I totally agree that the mods can do a lot in keeping 2X as welcoming as possible. But I disagree that having 2X has default won't bring in more rabble, and I hope the discussion continues on how to handle that.
