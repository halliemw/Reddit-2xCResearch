The cultural narrative is that only women with low self-esteem get into and stay in abusive relationships.  Instead of: some bad people manipulate and here are the red flags to watch for.  It doesn't just put the blame on women, but it makes people believe they would never fall for it.  It's *other women* that fall for it.  The ones with self-esteem issues.  He doesn't abuse me because I'm not that weak.  It makes people believe they don't have to learn the signs.  

I can't tell you where my self-esteem esteem was at the time.  I thought I was healthy and strong.  For a long time I blamed myself for being weak enough to fall for it.  I can say that after, my self-esteem was at an all time low.  What got me out of it was learning how multi layered abuse actually is, the techniques used and that even people with good qualities can be horrible people.
