I've had a kidney infection once, and I would be terrified if it happened again.

I would send in an appeal. If they don't accept it, I would go forth and notify the media, anonymously if you wish.  Their denying her sexual health is not only unfair, because kidney infections can cause kidney failure. Plus, they cover viagra, so, that is another point to bring up.

Best of luck, and I hope your wife recovers well.

P.S. I take D-Mannose if I feel like I'm getting a UTI. Plus, drinking a lot of water helps. I try to drink at least a glass after sex.
