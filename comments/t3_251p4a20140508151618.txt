I can see your point, though I do take a different view on it. I know for myself when something terrible happens to me I don't want to hear all the ways I could've avoided it right at that moment. However, once some time has passed I always tried to look for ways I could've done something different or better, even if what happened wasn't my fault. 

Perhaps our disagreement stems more from us imagining this scenario happening immediately after a traumatic event vs. weeks or months after?
