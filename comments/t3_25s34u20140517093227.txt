Are the friends you and and this fellow share fully aware of the past you and he have together?  Its seems very bold on this guys part to not only victimize a friend, but to actually place himself physically closer to his victim after the fact, in full view of those that know what he's done. 
At this point i'd to make an assumption.  Your friends don't know all the details as to what happened between the two of you do they?
