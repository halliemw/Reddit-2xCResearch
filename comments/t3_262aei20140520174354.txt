> But then I think, how horrible if I weren't in a position to care for my kids? If I held this baby for a day and had to give her away? Or if I had no husband to support me while I cared for her, forcing me back to work? Or even, if I already had enough children, if this one would push me over the edge of sanity. If this child was not a thing to love but an incredible burden, a person so deserving of love but not getting any from its own mother because of the inopportune situation.

Yes. This. I've found myself thinking that recently.

Thank you for writing your post, I agree, it's hard. Everyone stands somewhere different on the subject, and your are completely right to say that my view may change even further after the baby arrives, whichever side it's falling towards. 

I guess I'll have to wait and see!
