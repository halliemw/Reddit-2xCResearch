I am wondering why you have the need to label it one way or the other.  It sounds like he stopped when you said stop and overall it seems like an ambiguous and unpleasant experience on both ends.

I mean, are you trying to give it a name for legal action?  Are you trying to decide if you are a rape victim?  What are you trying to get out of this?

It sounds like you had a not awesome relationship in general.  I mean, he was constantly groping you in public, etc.

I would listen to the others and try to process the relationship however necessary.
