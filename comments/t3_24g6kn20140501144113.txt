Just to be clear this law does not apply to alcohol, as TN defines narcotic drug as:

> (17) "Narcotic drug" means any of the following, whether produced directly or indirectly by extraction from substances of vegetable origin, or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis:

> (A) Opium and opiate, and any salt, compound, derivative, or preparation of opium or opiate;

> (B) Any salt, compound, isomer, derivative, or preparation thereof that is chemically equivalent or identical with any of the substances referred to in subdivision (16)(A), but not including the isoquinoline alkaloids of opium;

> (C) Opium poppy and poppy straw; and

> (D) Coca leaves and any salt, compound, derivative, or preparation of coca leaves, and any salt, compound, isomer, derivative, or preparation thereof that is chemically equivalent or identical with any of these substances, but not including decocainized coca leaves or extractions of coca leaves that do not contain cocaine or ecgonine;

However, they don't really define what an "addiction recovery program" is. I would think that it would depend on how the courts interpret that phrase. If I was a judge, if someone wasn't using drugs for the last 8 months of their pregnancy, I would find it hard to believe that they hadn't completed an "addiction recovery progam" given the law states no requirements for what an addiction recovery program is. It also states no requirements for "successful completion" of the program. So luckily for the women, the bill is poorly written, public sentiment is against it, and I am sure plenty of organizations would provide a lawyer competent enough to avoid conviction under this sloppily written bill.
