Oooooooh that sucks. I'm sorry.


You 100% have a right to be annoyed, hurt, angry, or whatever else you may be feeling. It's never okay to call up a friend and start yelling at them, especially when that friend (you) would have changed plans in order to accommodate.


You deserve to hear an apology, not the other way around. If I were you I would tell her that I would have changed my plans had she asked me, so the fact that everything got screwed up for her is her fault, not mine, and that I don't appreciate and will not tolerate the manner in which she spoke with me. Don't let her treat you like an emotional punching bag.
