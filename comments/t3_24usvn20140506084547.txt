The boyf has said, that the girl has said "wouldn't it be really cool if me and Poopybum were friends?" and hes replied with "Yeah it really would" yet I still havent ever been invited to their chilled nights, cinema, endless meals out, and just out with them. Not a single one.

This whole situation has caused me to get quite emotional and make him feel bad, he blames it on me being jealous and paranoid (my ex cheated on me) but I trust him.
