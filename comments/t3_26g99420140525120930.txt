The problem is the power differential and the age difference. We're taught to be respectful of our elders and you don't talk back to your supervisor. It's easier to tell someone your own age and level off, to rebuff them. She probably felt helpless and that's not a good feeling. Getting a scarf at the end isn't a good thing because he was clearly hoping for some affection in return and that she would invite him into her life in a more personal way. And he spends time imagining what she would look good in? That's gross to hear. "My imagination is rarely wrong" wtf does that even mean? He imagined she would be bowled over by the scarf and make out with him?
