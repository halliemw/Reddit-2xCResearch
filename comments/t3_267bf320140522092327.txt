It's confirmation bias, plain and simple. Redditor posts link to radical feminist doing/saying something stupid, other redditors mass-upvote it to increase visibility, same redditors in comments wonder why they "only ever hear about radical feminists." 

Good luck getting anywhere near the front page with a link talking about the importance of feminism.
