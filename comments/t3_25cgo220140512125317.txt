Today I'm starting to get on track again to lose some weight. Not because I don't love my body, but I have PCOS and want to be healthier. Also realized I finish off my clinical hours for nursing soon and I'm so excited to graduate!

Edit: also up votes for everyone! So happy today and want to share the love!
