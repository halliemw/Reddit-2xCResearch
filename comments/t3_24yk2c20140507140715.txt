I am not on that pill, but I know when I didn't take it the same time I had spotting issues. I also still had kinda irregular periods? In the sense that they never came the same day in my pack. Often I had what you had, and it was like my body didn't register I wasn't taking the pill until way later(the placebo week). 

I started skipping the placebos and only have a few periods a year. That really helped and it stopped all that weird periods and for the most part spotting. (I'm on Nexplanon now though)
