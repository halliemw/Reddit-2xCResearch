Hello! 

I hope that I will be able to help. I too, am undergoing through a busy graduate school life. I used to exercise at least thirty minutes everyday but since I started school I have little time to do anything.

What I do to try and lose weight is to avoid eating foods that are manufactured by companies ( crackers, chips, etc) the only exceptions are mainly pretzels. I also eat things that are EXTREMELY LOW in calories (wheat bread, turkey, fruits and veggies) and AVOID as much as you can ANYTHING with sugar in it ESPECIALLY Drinks (ie. orange juice, some energy drinks etc). I usually just drink apple juice and water.

Gaining weight happens when you take in more calories than you actually burn. If you eat too much foods, it doesn't matter how "small" the portionn is, if it's high in calories and you don't burn it off, you will gain weight. that's why I try to avoid sweets as much as possible.  However, you can eat something a dozen pretzels and hardly gain any weight. 

It's all about tracking you calories. As orangesqueege pointed out. Just track your bmi and your daily activity and it should work.

Also do as much walking as you can. If you are sitting, try and do some sitting excercises. That's what I do. and don't eat late at night. Try not to eat past five or six. 

Hope I helped!
