That seems like a huge oversimplification. Like it or not, sex is something that is incredibly desired by men and all people value things that they have to work for, that's just how humans work. If she gave it up easy, you probably aren't going to value it much. Is that good? I don't know, probably not, but that's the issue to discuss. When you present it like you did you seem like you're just angry and ignorant instead of having a complex understanding of the issue you're talking about. Slut is a problematic word, but there are real reasons for it to exist and persist in the present day.
