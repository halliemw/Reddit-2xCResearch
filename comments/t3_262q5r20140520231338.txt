Don't tell him if you've already made up your mind. For what it's worth, I think an abortion is the right decision. However, you're under obligation to take this one to your grave. Do not confide in your best friend or anyone else unless you absolutely have to. And, if you do, maybe fudge the details. Nothing good comes of him finding out down the road (maybe nothing bad either, but why take that chance).

And, for god's sake, use a condom next time.

Good luck! It's a shitty situation. Know that you're not the first person that this has happened to. It should just be a small bump in the road.

Also, could you do me a favour. Go defend your friend to the people in this thread suggesting he's going to beat you or something if he finds out. I think he deserves that, at least.
