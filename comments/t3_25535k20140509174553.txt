I think the author actually used that as a straw man argument against the idea of young women being prevented from visiting certain areas of the internet. Not excellent journalism but also not really the point.

I disagree that looking at the effects of children being exposed to the internet as a whole would be a waste of time. I don't think anyone can reasonably know whether a parent deciding to fully restrict internet access would do more harm or good without some sort of study and knowing this would be invaluable knowledge especially for poorer parents who do not have an excess of time to spend policing their child's internet activities. It would also be good to examine methods of changing the general culture that arises in anonymous areas of the internet.
