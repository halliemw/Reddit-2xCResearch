I just wanted to add a different perspective to all this 'traditional' gender roles convo cause I've seen a little too many answers about men knowing about maintenance which obviously women don't know about. I'm sure that's true of many people but it feels like a bit of an assumption when this is a much bigger problem that every woman I've ever talked to about it is willing to rant about

I grew up with a single mother and so did many of my friends growing up, many of them men. Maybe I was blessed in a different way but we didn't have gendered expectations so much, housework was seen as a way to thank your mother and lighten her load. A lot of us did laundry and mowed, and when I got my first car I knew about maintenance or learned to google more and not be ignorant.

I got in the habit of, don't know how to do it? Internet! When my SO and I but heads I really struggle with understanding how he could have never done laundry before or done car maintenance or fixed broken electronics, cleaned a toilet, etc. I understand the frustration he has but I find it so hard to hear the I don't know how to do it, when if didn't always know either...I know to google it. just like my friends and I would ask each other on how to know what was most likely wrong with the car or how to get grass stains out while our parents worked long hard hours and couldn't answer us.

I look forward to seeing the responses you get cause I'm sure we could all learn a lot I just hope this doesn't end up with the assumption that so many of us are comng from these gender roles and don't understand how to live outside them
