OH PLEASE! She broke a legal contract because of her personal beliefs, but she wasn't invested enough to actually take responsibility for the baby after it was born! So she dumped it off on another family who could foot the outrageous medical bills and watch the baby die. 

If she was against abortion why would she have **ever** signed a contract agreeing to have one?
