I know it was a stupid decision to make. The thought that it was broad daylight and that we talked for about 30 mins got him to earn my trust (besides, my car was in the same park, what could go wrong?) He had talked to me for enough time to seem like a nice guy. He didn't come off as a creep right off the bat, the initial interaction was very polite. If he would have given me an immediate creep vibe, I would have never got in the car. It was until he made the 'I'd get you drunk to get you out your shell if I have to" remark that things began to get uncomfortable. He had given me his name, asked for my number AND a date in a polite fashion prior to that. In my mind, he was no longer a stranger but a 'cool new friend'. 

No matter if what I did was naive - getting into someone's car DOES NOT EQUAL SEXUAL CONSENT.
