I was in a similar situation so I asked myself, "do I need to be engaged/married to feel my relationship is valid?"  In my case, the answer was no, it wasn't a necessity. We are since engaged and I feel like if I would have put too much pressure on him, it would have spoiled his plans to ask me, which I think he was excited about. 

On the flip side, can you ask him?  My fianc√© was previously engaged and she asked, so I didn't want to follow the same script, but it may be a great story for you two. Good luck internet friend. Soon the engagement announcements will end, then there will be nothing but baby photos. Baby photos everywhere.
