My fiancee had problems with what seemed like chronic UTIs especially after sex.  She would go to the doctor, get an antibiotic, and it would go away for a couple weeks but then come back.  We tried all the regular remedies of peeing after sex, cranberry, lots of water, etc.  Finally after visiting a urogynecologist she was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystisis (IC) which basically means chronic bladder pain, so it feels similar to a UTI.  

To control the IC (it has no known cure), she was put on a tricyclic antidepressant to calm her bladder.  Some home remedies included pelvic stretching and a change to her diet (every case of IC is different but things like reduce consumption of acidic food/drinks, caffeine, artificial sweeteners, alcohol).  She has minor flareups every so often but they are very minor and careful attention to her diet returns her to normal.
