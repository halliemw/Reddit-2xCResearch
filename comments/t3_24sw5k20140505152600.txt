Something similar happened to me. A friend of mine is recovering from his wife leaving him out of the blue because she'd been cheating with some random dude.

I don't think your judgement was off when you made that judgement, you two just got out of sync and he decided to become an asshole.

Communication from both parties is so necessary to maintaining a relationship--and when someone isn't disclosing their feelings, then it just all goes to hell.

I just hope this experience does't dampen you...good luck feeling better.
