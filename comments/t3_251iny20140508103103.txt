That isn't abuse. If you communicate and agree to behavior standards, you are required to either follow those standards, communicate your desire to change those standards, or break up because their required standards seem unreasonable or abusive to you.

  I don't think it's abusive to require that your boyfriend isn't overtly flirting and snapchatting with other girls. A smile is one thing, checking out a girl passing by is one thing; frequently flirting and calling and sending pictures to a girl who refers to you as her man crush is quite another. That's not abuse to require your SO not to do that.
