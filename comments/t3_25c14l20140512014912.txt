> you're making way too big of a deal about it

Blaming OP for being upset that her friend is apparently unable to control her behavior and respect house rules. OP sounds like she is reasonably upset over the situation and her friend breaking her trust.

> Kinda lame that you told your parents and got her in trouble

Blaming OP for friend getting in trouble for doing things that she knew would get her in trouble. Not OP's fault friend got in trouble for doing things she knew were against the rules. She isn't being a tattle tale. She was honest with her parents when they asked her what happened. Friend clearly wasn't good at discretion if she was noisy enough parents heard. If OP hadn't walked in on her who knows how far things would have gone or if OP's parents could have walked in on them trying to figure out what the noise was. OP's parents chose to call friends parents out of concern. That's what good parents do. It's up to the friends parents if they choose to discipline her or not. OP's parents also have the choice to not allow her friend back in the home unsupervised since she ignored the rules. Also not OP's fault. 

> Please stop making things up, it makes you look bad.

That's just unnecessarily rude.
