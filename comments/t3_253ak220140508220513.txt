I definitely agree. It sounds like you do not have a strong support group right now which may be what you need the most. If you surround yourself with strong, like-minded people they can help to make you feel safe when outside until you feel like you can be on your own again outside. You deserve allies and people that respect what you are going through. Threatening situations like this are not your fault and you do not deserve this harassment. These types of actions and cat calls further perpetuates rape culture. It's time to take a stand and shed light on the power dynamics of gender that we face. I would say joining a peer support group would be great and maybe a feminist discussion group as well. NAMI is a nation organization that has free peer support groups for people in many different communities. I suggest looking it up online and seeing if you can find a group near you.
