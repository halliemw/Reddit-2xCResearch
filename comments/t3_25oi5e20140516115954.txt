I'm glad you and your husband are getting to be better communicators with each other! That gives me hope for me and my boyfriend. I think we definitely have to be committed to communicating, and you're right, it really does suck at first. It's so hard! I'm used to everyone in my family bottling things up until it explodes at some inopportune time. I'll have to remember the keeping my cool thing, too. That can be hard too, but I'll try. 

We actually did the Five Love Languages test a while back! But I think we both forgot what our love languages are. I don't even remember mine. Did you guys take it together? I feel like my boyfriend might find it cheesy if we did it again, I had to convince him to do it the first time, haha. Anyways, thank you for the input!
