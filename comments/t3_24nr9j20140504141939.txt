It's only been three days, and if its your first break up it very well could take a lot longer to get over. But you will. Try staying busy, find hobbies you enjoy and surround yourself with friends and family. Eventually you'll have the strength to tolerate and then enjoy being alone, and then you can begin your journey of finding happiness alone. I believe that in order to be happy with another person you first have to find your own happiness alone again.
