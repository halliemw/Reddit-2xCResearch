I feel like unless the firm is a graphics design firm, her job would definitely fit the criteria of administrative, don't you?  It's about keeping the business running from the inside and doing the monthly newsletter seems like it would be a part of that.  I'm not trying to be dismissive, but what exactly are people thinking admin is? We're not all receptionists and tea-girls!
