I've had *female* bosses coach me on assertiveness. As in, how not to be. "Use 'we' language, not 'I' language," "Your problem isn't with your work it's with your aggressive attitude."

It pisses me off to no end. There is *nothing wrong* with being proud of your accomplishments, or in being upfront about them with your superiors. The fact that I've been forced in my career to "be less masculine" is incredibly insulting on multiple levels, but there's no going around it unless I wanted to get fired.
