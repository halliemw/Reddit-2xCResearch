I agree.  I get what they're trying to do, and I think we can all agree those girls need to be found and saved ASAP.  It's terrible.  

But I agree, the slogan rubs me the wrong way but I can't quite pinpoint...why?  I want to say because we shouldn't make it a gendered issue, but the nature of it completely is.  I think my own brain just instantly hates the "real x is blah blah" type of slogan because, like you said, the "real women have curves" and that type of stuff is total crap. 

Either way, I really really really hope all of those girls get home safe and sound.
