I have no solution or answer or inspiring story. I have not figured it all out and become instantly more productive. HOWEVER, I feel that over time I learned to trick myself into being slightly more productive than I was a few years ago. I assume everyone is different so you have to start recognizing you're own avoidance tactics and start learning how to take advantage of or derail them. Here's some examples

* I love music. When it was very important to me that I go to the gym I would ONLY listen to music while at or going to/from the gym. It turned it into a very positive experience and I would actively feel bad if I didn't do it
* If I am on a computer it is impossible for me to focus. There is no force on this earth that can give me that willpower. If I can work on something with just pad/paper I will. When I need to use my computer I will turn on an extension like "Strict Workflow" or "Stayfocused" that literally blocks me from going to websites for a given amount of time. I will simply not work without it.
* No eating when bored (both for health and procrastination reasons) I realized on day when I'm busy and content it takes me about 5 hours after a meal before I feel hungry again. So on days when I'm lazing about I will not eat until 5 hours have passed since I last ate.
* I totally use to do planning as a form of procrastination. I've realized it and I no longer get satisfaction of "job well done" for spending an hour on a too do list. I feel as lousy as if I'd been watching a movie. Don't fool yourself into giving yourself an emotional pat on the back for not actually accomplishing anything.
