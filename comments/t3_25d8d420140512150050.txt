I love this. I think people often discount the harder side of being extremely flat chested. The bullying. The inability to wear a lot of clothes. 

I don't think every flat-chested woman should HAVE TO go out and get a boob job, but certainly if that's what's going to make her more comfortable, then I'm all for it. Women should be able to feel comfortable in their own skin.
