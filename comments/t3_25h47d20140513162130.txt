I was dating a guy for a few weeks, we were getting to be good friends, the sex was good, but I wasn't really feeling that romantic spark for him like I should. I felt bad about it because I wanted to be able to stay friends with him, but I had been honest the whole time about not knowing how I felt about him and where we were going, so I thought we might be ok.

Once I decided, I decided, and I told him I didn't want to be in a relationship with him. I complimented him on all his good qualities, said that I would be lucky to be with him, but that I couldn't make myself feel what I just didn't feel. I deserve to feel that spark for him just like he deserves to have someone feel it for him. 

Man, you would have thought I just killed his dog or something. He got SO MAD at me, and started turning everything he had been complimenting me on into insults, trying to beat me down. But I've been there, done that, and I didn't let it get to me.

But he went out of his way to keep saying things like "there are plenty of dive bars around the city where you can pick up a bro with a tribal tattoo and a drug problem" and "good luck with average, you are too selfish and lazy to get better than that." He told me that I had "fucked him over" - like somehow me not feeling for him the way he wanted me to was fucking him over, like I left him at the alter or he paid for my car and I bounced or something.

I get that being rejected sucks, but Jesus. I went out of my way to be respectful and nice, because I genuinely liked him as a person. I finally had to block communications with him because he couldn't stop taking shots at me. 

So fucking annoying.
