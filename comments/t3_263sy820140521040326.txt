>With that said: If a sexual partner fails to inform me of their growing feelings for me, and continues our casual-sex relationship in the hopes that I'll somehow change my mind... at what point is it my responsibility to end the relationship?

I'd say that it's when you become aware that they have these feelings that they've been hiding from you.

>Is there some sort of sign I should be looking for, or a particular moral compass I can ascribe to in this situation?

Not that I'm aware of.

>So. Am I a pompous, deceptive ass? Or have I just had bad luck with overly-romantic sexual partners?

Based purely on what you've written here, you're not being a deceptive arse, and you've have bad luck with overly-romantic partners. 

I can only add that perhaps this warrants you paying more attention to any little things that they do that you would expect people who are in relationships to do. That might make it easier to notice when/if this occurs again.
