Yeah. Wanting a better world for everyone is a good thing. I rarely experience sexism directly, but I still want to live in a world where gender stereotypes don't exist, where forced marriage isn't a thing, where sexual harassment isn't excused as "boys will be boys" etc etc. I've experience some privilege myself, but that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to show an interest on the hardships people still face and try to raise awareness of that.
