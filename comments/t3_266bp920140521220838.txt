Jesus people try to flirt with you *at work*?? That is SO messed up, I'm really sorry that this is happening to you. Are you working with 13 year old boys? Because that's the only logical explanation for someone to have such a glaring lack of respect for a coworker.

Do you feel like you can bring this up to your boss? I know you probably don't want to make waves, but most places in the US have "Zero Tolerance" law when it comes to sexual harassment. Maybe you could look up that law for your area and see if what you're experiencing matches up? I can't imagine that being hit on doesn't qualify.
