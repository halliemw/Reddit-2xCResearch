Thank you! I personally try to do this. For some things I definitly ask the father to 'give her a slap on the wrist' but for instance, her father was in another room and she kicks one of her brothers, I'm not going to stand there like an idiot saying 'honey, please tell the kids to stop fighting'... No, I will say to break it up and why it's not ok to do that. In some cases, you can ask the biological parent to be 'the bad guy' but if you do it all the time, you almost ask not to be taken seriously if you'd ask me...
