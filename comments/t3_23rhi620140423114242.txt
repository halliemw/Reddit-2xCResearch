You know that you have to stop  talking to him.  DO IT NOW.  

Don't apologize to him.  Don't give him an explanation.  This is for you and for him and for your relationship.  Cut him off.

And start sharing with your husband.  The grass is always greener where it is watered.  Start working on  your relationship with your husband.  Get counseling.  It sounds like you are depressed. 

This man will not leave his wife for you.  Do not expect that.

If you decide to get divorced, accept that you just may be single for the rest of your life.  If that is preferable to being married to your husband, than maybe divorce is the best option.  but get counseling first to determine that it's logical thinking and not emotional catastrophizing.
