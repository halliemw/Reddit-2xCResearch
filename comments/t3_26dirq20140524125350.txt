I think the first tweet by Playboy saying "breaking the mold of what women in music *should be*" (emphasis added) is where Neko takes offense.  

I think saying Women in...music, construction, video games, etc is okay as long as there isn't a specific idea of how those would should act or dress or live their lives.
