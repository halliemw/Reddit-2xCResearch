I have plenty of scripture  - and heard plenty of sermons in which scripture was read - given that I went to a Christian school from the age of 11. There are plenty of non-scientific things throughout, such as pillars of salt, or men rising from the dead. Even non-supernatural events, such as Jews working as slaves in Egypt, or the massacre of the firstborn, are completely absent from the historical record.
