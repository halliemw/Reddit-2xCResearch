Again that's disingenuous. 

*Example:* Say they have a dysfunctional marriage, they had a huge discussion that got out of hand and *she* turned violent, the guy got really mad and then she calmed things down and had sex with him. 

There's no rape, he wouldn't be being threatening to hurt her to get sex in return but as retaliation to her violent behaviour, and it was she who used sex as a tool to appease him and get away with her actions. 

Now of course this was just some made up scenario. Point remains that in this kind of pools you have a generic question whose answer you assume corresponds to the scenario you're biased towards. 

More importantly saying every survey turns out the same numbers is absurd. There are a ton of surveys and the range varies widely. It only always returns the same numbers if you choose to ignore all the other ones that don't.
