True, but I think the prejudices are already well-known by most people, including OP.  

Maybe irrelevant isn't the right word... but it is frustrating for anyone when you can't vent without either being invalidated (e.g. you're not
fat) or given a solution that you already know (e.g. have you tried losing weight?).  I think OP was just voicing how that part of the clip resonated with her-almost a form of validation. 

I assume you were trying to be helpful or in identifying where the prejudices that lead to invalidation come from, but I don't think OP was looking for help understanding that. I think she was just voicing her frustration and the frustration that many others have but can't often express. Not looking for an explanation or help, but for a place to say, "Yes, this resonates with me and it's hard."

(Again, not trying to put words in anyone's mouth and apologies if I misunderstood and/or did so!)
