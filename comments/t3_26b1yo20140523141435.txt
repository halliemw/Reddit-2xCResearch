I'm sure it's a gimmick carefully plotted out by marketing, but what I love about that quote is that it doesn't talk at all about her looks, even though she's incredibly pretty.  It's all about how talented she is and other positive personality traits.  Even if it was manufactured that way, I appreciate moving away from the "beautiful and successful" trope where women are always described first by appearance, and then by anything else they may be or have done.
