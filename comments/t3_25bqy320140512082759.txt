> more the kind of feeling you might imagine a bullied kid to have when he has to walk past his bullies, maybe? 

That actually makes a lot of sense. I was having trouble wrapping my head around the feeling, but that comparison helped, thank you. 

I can kind of relate to the whole unwanted train conversation thing, I hate when people talk to me, but that is because of social anxiety, not because they are perving on me. The whole jogging thing is just fucked. Who does that (the embracing a random person part, not the jogging part, lol)? If some random just came up to me and hugged me I would flip my shit.   

>Which in turn creates this idea that you can avoid this shit if you do everything right  

This part makes me sad. While it is technically true that you can reduce the risk of being assaulted/harassed by doing "the right thing", even that doesn't eliminate the threat entirely. And it shouldn't matter, because people should be able to walk without fear. They shouldn't have to avoid certain streets, or not wear certain things, or stay in at night. While all of those things will make a person somewhat safer, the tradeoff is freedom, and trading freedom for safety doesn't sit well with me.  

The shit that really gets me is that women some have all these experiences with shitty men, and it leads to them treating all men differently. Others have those same experiences, and realize that it was an individual that hurt them, not an entire gender. I really wish more women fell into the second group. Hate never solved anything, not once in the history of humans.
