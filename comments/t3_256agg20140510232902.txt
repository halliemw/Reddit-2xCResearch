I'm not angry at all. I have no problem with this sub being a default, and I don't get upset when people who are obviously trolls comment on threads.  But everyone else seems to be mad. I think that this sub being a default will be good. Lots of new girls and women will be exposed to it, and most people with no interest will do the sensible thing and unsubscribe. It's the Internet, you can't keep trolls away, you can just ignore them and go on with your life, which is what we will have to learn to do a little more often now. I just think that this community is overreacting about the fact that more people will now know about this single section of an online forum.
