When at least one party is very clearly drunk (in this case OP, as we don't know how drunk Ex was) the lines of consent get blurry. However, OP had told Ex on multiple occasions that she didn't want to have sex before marriage, and not to listen to a drunk yes as it would always be no when sober. With this in mind, Ex was clearly taking advantage of OP - he "pushed hard for sex", OP realised what was going on and shoved him off. 

OP - It's not your fault. In situations like this, it's *never* your fault. You were taken advantage of when drunk. It's not a case of you "should have been able to say no", you said a pre-emptive no on multiple occasions and Ex did not respect you. You could probably go to the police with it if you wanted, unless you want to chalk it up to a drunken mistake on Ex's part (I've no idea how drunk he was - it could have been a genuine mistake, could have been intentional). Either way, he knew your wishes and didn't respect you and you're well shot of him. 

As for whether or not you should wait until marriage, that's still entirely up to you. Whoever you next have sex with will be the first person you do it with *voluntarily* - it's still going to be special.
