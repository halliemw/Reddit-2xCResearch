So I just bought [Stay Here Pumps](http://www.kennethcole.com/product/index.jsp?productId=33039766) by Kenneth Cole. Google for promo codes and you should be able to get at least an additional $10 off. They are the most comfortable pumps I've ever worn.... Their The Delight Flats have the same 925 technology that makes these heels so comfy. I have two pairs of those flats and wear them almost every day.

Other solution: put insoles into heels. Also ups the comfort factor.

I also really like the flats from Naturalizer. You should also be able to find promo codes online for that.
