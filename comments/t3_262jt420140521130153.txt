I work at a pregnancy clinic and see women facing this type of decision all the time. I would never try to convince a woman to keep a pregnancy, or sway a woman in any direction. The most important thing about this decision is that it needs to be YOURS. In order to help yourself emotionally after, you need to fully own whatever decision you make. That being said- in my experience, I have found that women who have children already and women who are unsure about having an abortion are typically the ones who regret the abortion. I have also seen that when women have abortions due to financial reasons, once they are in a better financial state, they may regret abortion. I guess they forget how hard it was financially at the time and think that they could have struggled through it.  I have heard horrible stories of how women who were in similar situations had abortions and then ended up emotionally wrecked. We even have post abortion counseling for women who are hurting from it. I also have frequently seen women getting pregnant and keeping right after having an abortion, perhaps subconsciously making up for the past abortion.  

Again- I am NOT saying that all women or even majority of women who have abortions regret them and have prolonged emotional issues after. This is only my observations in this distinct set of circumstances after seeing hundreds of women facing unplanned pregnancies. 

Bottom line- Thoroughly consider all options and imagine the effect each would have in the future, so that you may fully own any decision you make.
