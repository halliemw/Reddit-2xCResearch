Sorry it took me so long to respond.  Between chemo (really rough week) and mothers day, things have been pretty crazy.

I do want to say thanks for sharing your story with me.  One of the things I was/am really worried about is them doing something that they don't want to because I tell them how important it is to me.  To hear you say that you don't regret him leaving you his wish at all means more than I can put into words. 

The first time I tried to figure out what to tell them, the first time I sat down in front of a camera and tried to work out what to say, it came down to a few simple words: "I loved you, unconditionally."  I know they will figure out the rest - how to shave, how to drive, how to date.  It was just really important to me to let them know that I loved them both more than anything in the world. 

It means a hell of a lot to hear you talk about wanting to know your father, and to hear about the connection you still have with him.  I think I worry a lot that once I'm gone I'll be forgotten.

Aaagh.  I'm rambling here, but what I really want to say is that yes, this helps, to thank you for sharing this, and to say that reading this, as a dad, I would be proud as hell to have a child like you - who cares for others, who is obviously strong and smart, and who followed something they loved.
