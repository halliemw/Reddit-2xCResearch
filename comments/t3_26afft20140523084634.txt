Ideally, I'd prefer it if people didn't feel so pressured to look a certain way such that obsessions about, say, a crooked nose would cause them to want surgery. It would be wonderful if people could love and value themselves just as they are. But since that's pie in the sky, if it really helps people feel confident and happy, then let the vanity flow.
