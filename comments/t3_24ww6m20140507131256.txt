Exactly this. The same thing happened to me except I was actually walking to my car on an empty street in a sketchy area of town at night and the guy ran after me after he called out to me and I didn't respond. I ran away and jumped in the car panicking and locking my doors. Then he knocked on the window and asked me for money. I was really shocked and angry afterwards that some asshole felt like that was okay behavior. I agree that it's not fair to stereotype people, but there are certain situations where you are apt to assume the worst for good and justified reason. Don't chase me down if I'm running away from you. Don't knock on my car if I'm alone and somewhere sketchy. I think it's pretty natural to be upset by and uncomfortable with this.
