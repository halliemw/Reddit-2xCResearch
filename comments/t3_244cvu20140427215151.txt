I didn't know we were citing sources on this sub...the evidence is mostly anecdotal, but since EPO generally doesn't have negative side effects it can't hurt to try.  Perhaps I should have included a disclaimer to do your own research.  Like any supplement the "statements have not been evaluated by the FDA".  A simple google search will point you to plenty of anecdotal evidence, and it has significantly shortened the duration of my periods along with clearing up hormonal acne.  YMMV.
