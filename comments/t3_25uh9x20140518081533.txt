It's okay for your period to be irregular, especially if you're skinny! If you're sexually active, though, discuss birth control with your mom and doctor, and figure out which method will be right for you. Planned parenthood has some great education on your options.

Me personally, I had my period irregularly all throughout middle and high school before going on birth control just so I wouldn't ruin any more underwear, and now I'm on the ring. Find a calendar app that you can potentially set weird repeats on (for whatever reason the stock calendar on my phone won't do every 4 weeks) and set up reminders for your birth control method of choice. Pills tend to be very time sensitive.

Oh, and make sure the granny panties your mom gets are comfy! There's nothing worse than a too tight pair of undies when you're on your period. You may also want to invest in a pair of sweatpants. My favorite pair is made by Nike, and they're lined with mesh and I've never bled through them. Ever. Even when I've bled through jeans, I've never once had blood go through these pants. They're fabulous.
