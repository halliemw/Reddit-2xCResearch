I have nothing to add that will make it better, I can't and no one can say, "I know what you're going through." No one knows what 'you' are going through. All I can say in an attempt to help you on your path, is that sadly some males are disgusting. As a male I do feel sorry for females world wide who have to deal with this absolutely degrading, disgusting behaviour. It is unacceptable.
But there are men out there who still believe that we are here solely to protect and nurture the ladies in our life. You will find sex and affection difficult because it has been used incorrectly with you, ofcourse you have your guard up. Just know that some guy some day will help you bring down that guard. :) 
You are strong. Remember that.
