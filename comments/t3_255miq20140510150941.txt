Your run is going to be great. If it helps any, the strangers are all stoked for you too, even if they aren't running. My house is on the route for the San Diego Rock n' Roll half-marathon and every year all the neighbors come out at 6am to watch & cheer for everyone. 

Thanks for the kind words about my pop :)
