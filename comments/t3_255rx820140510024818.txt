I feel so sorry for you :-( I always missed 2-3 days at school, not because of period shits or pain, but because my menstruation was so heavy I needed to go to the toilet every 20-30 minutes. Your English Lit teacher somehow sounds like an idiot - but yeah, girls are just totally lazy and so privileged for having blood flooding out of your vagina as an universal excuse...
