Well, there are tech programs in community programs in my area (Pacific Northwest) where you can get a transfer degree (in anything or more specifically science tech work) that the University of Washington accepts, and they have this program: http://www.cfr.washington.edu/ it's a non-competitive major, which means you'd likely get accepted if your pre-reqs transfer. It's a good program, I would have done it if I didn't think nursing was the only way I'd be employed. And here is an example of a job that can be obtained with a forestry degree: http://agency.governmentjobs.com/washington/job_bulletin.cfm?JobID=871355 and it doesn't have to be the same job for the rest of one's life, as employees gain experience, they can apply to other jobs.
