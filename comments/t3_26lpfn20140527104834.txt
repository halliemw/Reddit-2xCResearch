I am a childless stay at home wife. I don't have any work or studying to do.

My husband got a job in Spain, where unemployment is 25%, and I don't speak much Spanish.

Here's what I am doing with my time:

*     Sewing, and teaching my friends to sew.
*     reddit
*     Making other things and doing crafts
*     Reading, it's great.
*     I've struggled to find somewhere to regularly volunteer, but I often meet touristing redditors and show them around.
*     I do a larger share of the housework, but not all or the housework.
*     I started renting out our spare bedroom on Airbnb to make some extra money for extra traveling.
*     I've been making bracelets to sell to tourists in the summer. I can spend all day sitting in the park. :)
*     video games
*     I started a garden on my roof. (Attic flat)
*     I meet friends for lunch.
*     I can go to all the special events at museums on weekdays when they are not busy.
*     I am trying to learn French, while not mixing it up with the Spanish.
