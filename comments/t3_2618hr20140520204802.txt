Would it be possible to tag people as troublemakers, masterdebators or trolls so we know what level to engage/feed them?  I've encountered guys that didn't realize they were mansplainin' and have had productive conversations.  Other times I've received nasty PMs.  

Could people who have been on 2xc a while get a tag like "1 Year club"?  Just some thoughts
