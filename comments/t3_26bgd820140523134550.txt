Better now than years from now!  It sounds like there wasn't much for you to go on leading up to this and so *something* has changed or you never knew how big an issue was until today

But something wasn't right and it wasn't brought up in a way to try to fix or address the concerns and now you're going to mourn the future that won't be....  BUT!  The best part is, you can start looking for someone who will work with you, who will talk with you, who will share what you want to do in life more than this person who disregarded all of it.  I've had 3 5+ year relationships at this point and I'm on my second marriage.  I've cried and been sad at the end of all of the relationships that have ended, but honestly, I love my husband and the person that I am with him.  And it's all worth having "lost" those other relationships to get me to where I am today.

It's hard, it will suck...  But there are other people and you have a chance now at a happier life.  When you're up for it. :)  For now focus on you, what you love and what you love doing.  The rest can fall into place when you're ready :)
