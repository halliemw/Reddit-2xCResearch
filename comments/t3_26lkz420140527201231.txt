It's actually a lot of fun.  Imagine someone being an asshole and being able to say "Dude, you're being an asshole. Cut the shit".  Mind you when I first worked in the construction field it was 1989 and I was 19/20 years old, and at the time I was 5'0" and about 110 lbs.  Just maintain your confidence, and if you know some basic Spanish all the better.  If you need some key phrases or advice if you decide this route, please feel free to PM me.  Glad to offer my experiences to the next generation.
