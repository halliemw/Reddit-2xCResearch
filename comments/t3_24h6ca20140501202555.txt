I originally picked the pill because I thought I was more likely to remember a daily routine of taking a pill than I was to once a week remember to change my patch.  I felt like the less regular changing of the patch would mess me up and I'd forget whereas I would internalize the pill schedule.  I never tried the nuva ring because I had trouble with tampons and thought that I  might have trouble with the ring too.

I ultimately switched to the IUD because it was a lot cheaper than the pill.  Since the ACA this factor may have gone away, but I was frustrated by how much my pill cost and the IUD was a similar hormone for a lot cheaper and I didn't have to remember anything.  I mostly liked it, and kept it for three years before I decided I didn't want to be on hormonal birth control anymore.  

I got acne that I think worsened on the IUD, and some hair loss.  These things are anecdotal, but  lot of other women claim to have had similar experiences.  I also felt like I was becoming more and more "crazy" every month emotionally and that the hormones were messing with me in that way.  The IUD also stopped my period, which I viewed as a good thing but not everyone would.
