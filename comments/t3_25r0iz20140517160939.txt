There's a great book called "Personality Self-Portrait" that is basically a mini-MMPI (you can actually photocopy the test page and pretend to be someone else and take it as if you were them - most of the questions are objectively observable).  

It gives great tips on what others can do to help you out, how to change what you can, and how to pick personality types that are compatible.  Something is making you anxious, and unless you have generalized anxiety disorder, it's probably a personality trigger.  

For example, if you are suddenly bothered by something that's ongoing and didn't bother you a few hours before, that's awkward for other people if they're part of the "bother."  Some people strongly expect consistency and see it as the primary sign of love and devotion.  Other people are like that, themselves, so they get it.  Almost any relationship can be worked out if both people want to.
