I missed out the part where I kind of hate her. He has never invites me to parties he has with his friends, yet he is always with me at my parties. So I feel as if he cant mingle his GF with his friends.. 

Edit: she also lives quite a while away so if they ever go to hers, she has to pick them all up and drive them. They're going to Portugal soon because she owns a villa (yeah) and I havent been invited.
