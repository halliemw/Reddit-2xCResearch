Ugh.  I had some friends who went through this.  It was particularly alienating since I have a pain disorder that makes sex, well, painful.  Therefore, their exploits weren't exactly relevant to me.

Anyway, all they ever wanted to talk about were their hook-ups, and kinks, and polyamory, and how they needed to fuck and blow off steam, etc.  They also happened to be around the same age at the time (mid-twenties).  I think a lot of it has to do with forging an identity and the need to assert that identity.  It could just be me, (and nothing against the polyamorist/pansexual community), but I find that this expression of overt sexuality and need to communicate about it incessantly is more intense in these communities.  It could be that they feel ostracized for their lifestyle choices and feel a need to speak up for it, or because it's this "new cool thing" that makes them feel special.  I don't know what it is, but I agree that the phase you are describing is pretty obnoxious.

Luckily, my friends are still poly or in the kink community, but they have calmed down and don't discuss it anymore.  I think they've become more comfortable with who they are and don't feel a need to constantly state their sexuality and justify themselves.  I also think they've come to recognize their sexuality as just a part of themselves and their lives, and it's really just not as significant to them as it once was.  Hopefully, this will happen for your friends and they'll just let go of the constant advertising.

In the meantime, I would probably just keep a bit of distance, or just act really disinterested and bored when they bring up these topics.  You have already expressed that you don't want to just talk about sex all the time, so you could keep reiterating that as well if you really still want to hang out with them.  Hopefully, they'll outgrow it in a couple of months to a year. . .
