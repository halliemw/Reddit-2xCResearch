I agree with your first two paragraphs, but not the third.  Stat rape is a lot easier to prove, since you just have to show that the accused had sex with the victim, wheras with a regular rape charge you have to prove lack of consent.  A statutory rape plea deal is much better than an acquittal.  Ideally, prosecutors would confer with the victims before deciding whether to offer a deal or not.
