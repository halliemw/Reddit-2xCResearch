I admire your strenght in being an advocate. I would have trouble staying emotionally level and just get blubbery (even fictional things make me cry). 

Regarding your job, I noticed this by watching many loved ones overcome their challenges. In the moment, going through all the emotions, they might lose a job, or friends, or education. But it only seems like a huge thing in the moment. Afterwards, years on, they realize how meaningless it all was. Hoe unimportant even a career choice was as long as they came out on the other side of grief whole. It's like a grenade explodes in your house and you fixate on how delicately the china will fall to the floor. While afterwards you are merely happy to be there. 

So congrats on being on the other side!
