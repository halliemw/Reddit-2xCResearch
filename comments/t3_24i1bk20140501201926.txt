My mom and aunt have both had several cancerous moles removed, and there is definitely scarring. On them it's less obvious because of their age and the locations, but with where that mole is and your smooth skin, your doctor is probably right. 

If you really want it removed, then your best bet will be a plastic surgeon rather than a dermatologist. A good surgeon should also be able to give you a realistic idea of how much scarring to expect. Personally, I don't think your mole is very noticeable and when I did notice it, it added character to your face rather than being disfiguring or weird looking. I wouldn't have it removed, but of course it's up to you.
