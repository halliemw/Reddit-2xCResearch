Instead of telling her she's not dressing her body well, maybe suggest a shopping trip where you both get to try on clothes recommended by the other? Make it fun and a game and give her clothes that you think might flatter her to try on. If she likes what she sees, then she might change how she dresses. If she prefers what she wears now however unflattering you think it is, then she'll keep wearing them. Pointing out why her current clothes are unflattering is only going to make her more insecure, so if the way she dresses is something you really think would help if she changed it, you need to just introduce other styles. And you might discover some styles you never thought you'd wear in the process.
