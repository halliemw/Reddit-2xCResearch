This is what I did when I had an infection. As soon as I got home I'd jump in the shower, rinse the area thoroughly, and then go to town once I got out of the shower. It was a temporary relief, but it was relief nonetheless. A little warning though, the masturbation itself is barely pleasurable and I was shocked I could even finish but I persisted as it was the only way to have any discharge at all (I suspect I actually had BV and not a yeast infection since I didn't actually have the creamcheese problem, but the meds worked and so did masturbating)
