To add to this: you need to make sure you are [scooping & swooping](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Scoop_and_swoop) because you very well might have excess tissue that's not getting properly into the cup. Once you get the right sized bra (after following the sizing guide), you will be able to easily scoop all of your tissue where it should be, which in time will be there permanently. Since learning how to do this, I've grown about 1.5 cup sizes. 

And banana, you are correct. There are no non-surgical breast enhancers that work, with the exception of the pill-and that is not a guarantee. The reason you gain boobs with the pill is because you are adding an excess amount of hormones to your body. Boobs are mostly fat, but their size is largely determined on the number of hormones you have. Personally, I have a LOT of hormones, which means I have decent sized boobs. 

Another thing to note about the pill and boob size is that there is *no* guarantee you'll keep the boobs you gain if/when you go off of the pill. Just like there's no guarantee the boobs you gain from pregnancy will remain (many women lose the added boob size, but plenty keep it).
