A friend of mine never made a "big deal" about her ex paying child support. Than she got into financial trouble and needed help. He couldn't help of course but between her, the boyfriend and family she managed. Then she realized that if the dad had been paying all along she could have been saving and building a safety net for her family. She took him to court and won of course, even though he tried to scare her out of it. 

Now he pays every month or whatever it is. She is slowly saving money and doesn't have to worry as much about what could happen. He does have a responsibility to the child even if he doesn't want it. The child deserves to have a stable environment and that includes the mother being financially stable.
