If it is a bartholin gland cyst it might not need surgery. There are ways to deal with one, especially if it's not reoccurring. If the cyst isn't infected, your gyno will be reluctant to do surgery until it proves to be a long term problem, and even surgery is no guarantee.

I had the bartholin gland on my right side if the vagina removed when I was 20 because it caused pain during sex. It came back when I was 28. Same side and everything. It's seems that it should be impossible, but apparently it happens.
