When I said "run away" I meant it more like cut and leave without telling my parents. Mostly I don't leave because I know it would break my mom's heart. She desperately wants to have the "perfect family" but is in denial about my father's demeanor. I love her because she's always done so much for me and tried the hardest, but I also often feel resentful that she never stood up for us or herself. 

I'm currently looking into finding a roommate in another city so my mom could visit me if she wanted to.
