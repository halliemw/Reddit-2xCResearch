How long are your periods normally? How long was this one?

A general rule of fertility is that you are safe for the first five days of any cycle.

Have you checked out some of the smartphone apps for keeping track of things? I have had issues with hormonal birth control in the past and I've not been too keen on trying out different pills again, so I use a "natural method" (which seems a silly label when it involves a basal thermometer and a computer algorithm) which is over 96% effective when used. It gives me peace of mind to know when I am fertile and when I am not. I used to freak out about being pregnant, even on the pill. Now I know when it is possible or not at all possible.

I personally use Ovuview for android, highly recommend it. Kindara I've heard is good for Apple.
