thanks! yeah I feel like she might be pissed, but that's quite immature. Hopefully if I come to her later (fingers crossed that this will happen :P) and tell her I found a job that pays more, with benefits, etc. she won't take it personally. But part of the reason I'm going OH FUCK is that I'm starting to realize she is a bit petty.
