For me the actual collection (where they swab cells off the cervix) is somewhere between weird and uncomfortable, but that's the worst of it.

It really shouldn't hurt. Tell the doctor why you're concerned, ask for a smaller size speculum, and if it hurts speak up. Also before the exam starts consider telling the doctor that you've had some experiences that might lead to triggering. If the doctor isn't open to your concerns and able to put you at ease, remember you can always walk out at any point and find a different doctor.
