There's a reason that so many reddits and subreddits have anti-police stories.  I'm sorry this happened to you.  

We were taught that police are our friends, but my own experience leaves me with doubts.  

It's like we took many steps backwards in time, in terms of rape help (it seems like only yesterday that my community had a rape hotline - but we have no volunteers, no hotline today).  The police where I live are indifferent to all sorts of crime, it's a continuing issue for me (meaning, I try to spend time working to improve policing).  

As to legal action to "file a new police report," how I wish I could help you.  After years of watching things like this happen, I am sorry to say that fighting the courts/police is difficult.  Where I live we do have an elected Sheriff (who can investigate the local police - although "budget constraints" prevent them from actually doing so).  Just 15 years ago, it was not the case.

Austerity measures are profound and affect women.
