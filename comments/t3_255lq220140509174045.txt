My period has actually changed a lot since I was a teenager. The first days were always really bloody, especially in the mornings, so I'd wear heavy pads at night and tampons during the day. The worst was when I'd stand up for the first time in the mornings and, as you put it, "the dam breaks." *cringe*

I was never good at predicting exactly when it would start until college when my pms and cramping took a whole new turn. Seriously, I'd get cramps so strong, I had to sit down right away or at bend over and lean against something until it passed. 

Since then I've been on the pill and my flow much lighter now so I use pads and tampons interchangeably. Cramps aren't nearly as bad (thank God!) and my pms only flares up for a few days before anything starts, usually with me devouring anything chocolate or sugary in sight. I even got my boyfriend to get me doughnuts once. :)

Even though my periods are not much of a problem anymore, every once in a while a heavier period will come out of nowhere. Blood, cramps, cravings, bloating, the works essentially. Not quite as bad as when I was in college, but enough to remind me how much I hated it. Whenever that happens, I curl up in bed with a microwaveable heated bag on my stomach, a bag of fun-sized chocolates, and watch cat videos and old cartoons and anime.
