1) You have a point that I have no call to police what he feels. What I took issue with was his word choice, which is an action. I felt that for such a potentially triggering topic for some people he could and should have been more careful in his language choice.

2) "Berate someone"?? There was no berating. You seem to be feeling some anger, but I wasn't feeling anger. That may be your assumption but as the #1 authority on what I was feeling, I can tell you I wasn't feeling anger at the time. With the current influx of trolls this sub has had, I specifically did NOT want to tear into him because I DID understand what he was trying to say, but wanted to take the opportunity to point out something that could help current and future discussions. Word choice online, where there are no other cues, is important. 

3) Asking me to "Please don't respond" is kind of silly on a public forum like reddit, don't you think? Isn't discussion the point? Or are you just trying to make sure you get the last word? Sorry, I have no reason to recognize your authority in this and am not convinced by your logic to "take it to heart". I am not a child; you are not my teacher nor my parent nor my boss so I don't appreciate that use of condescension to attempt to silence me.

4) I find it interesting that YOU feel so strongly about my opinion and correction of his word choice when the person I corrected had no such problem with it, and responded quite nicely. You're using much more antagonistic language with me than I used with him, and so I find myself wondering why. What's YOUR bigger issue that you're responding so strongly to this? Again, I have no reason to take it to heart because I don't recognize the validity or authority in your accusations.

5) One doesn't have to be the victim to be infuriated by something. If more of us bystanders got infuriated about violence perpetrated against others maybe we wouldn't have so much of it around the world.
