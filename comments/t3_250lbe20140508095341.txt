We ARE hair twins - you nailed it, sister!

I have *absolutely* noticed the trend of celebrities getting short cuts and then growing it back. Jennifer Lawrence, Miley Cyrus, Anne Hathaway (although she got it cut short for a role), Natalie Portman, Emma Watson. Did you ever notice Keri Russell's show tanked as soon as she got it chopped? Charlize Theron. Keira Knightley. Michelle Williams. All growing it out. Also, they are all incredibly beautiful. 

I had hair extensions for a while but they were super duper deluxe and cost and arm and a leg. I also had a clip on ponytail for a while. It was fun and only about $80 - no big commitment. 

It's hard to find a cut that works with my hair, head, face, neck and body. I suppose many women have issues with their hair... am I crazy to think I have it any harder? My boyfriend wants me to dye it black and I'm considering it but the blonde highlights give it more body. 

What do you do with your hair on a daily basis? How do you style it? Do you wash it daily?
