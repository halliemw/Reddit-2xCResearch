I'm glad to hear of doctors doing this. Mine never did, and while I had nothing to hide, I wasn't prepared when I went back to my family doctor as an adult and they were really flippant and judgemental about things I had no control over, like my "hirsuitism" (which if you ask me is not the word to start with with a 22-year-old virgin) and the "baffling" coverage of my hymen. I eventually found doctors who found nice, understanding, and non-alarmist ways to say all of these things.

The thing is that if she had sent my mom out, or if my dark-ages-occupying family had insisted I get a gynecological exam when I first started having period issues at 14, I'd have found out how she was and told my mother, and who wold have gone to bat for me. Then again, she might not have anyway, given what a known hippie my mom is.

TLDR: I'm glad you're having that experience, because I sure didn't a few years back.
