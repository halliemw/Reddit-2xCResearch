I've worked in a sexual assault center so maybe I can offer a different perspective. First off, you're not unreasonable for feeling the way you feel. These experiences were unpleasant and felt violating so you have a right to be upset.

The definition of consent that that I go off of is that it has to be informed, actively, and freely given, mutually understood and can be taken away at any point. It sounds like you felt pressured during some situations maybe you were missing the "freely" and "actively" part, and it doesn't sound like it was mutually understood on your end.

Your sexual history shouldn't have any bearing on whether you were sexually assaulted. No matter the previous roleplay or the activities, the time you didn't feel comfortable should have been respected. (personal opinion: a guy who would have sex with you while you're crying/sick is an asshole)

As for whether you were sexually assaulted, that's ultimately for you to decide. The definition where I live is "actual, attempted, or threatened sexual contact with another person without that person's consent" Do you feel that he had your consent during those times? Sounds like he didn't. 

People who don't know much about sexual assault can be judgmental and victim-blaming. If there are people like that in your life you can choose not to tell them. I don't know where you live, but if you were to try to pursue legal action it might be difficult because a lot of these cases come down to he-said/she-said with no concrete "proof". 
You mentioned having nightmares and sporadic panic attacks, perhaps you could look into contacting a sexual assault center near you? They could refer you to mental health professional that could help you over come those. At the end of the day, what happened to you sucked and you need to find a way find closure for yourself. Your body is your own and no one has the right to take that from you.
