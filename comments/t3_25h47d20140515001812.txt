You know, as happy as I am that this is a default and there will be more men and women here to offer advice, opinions, different viewpoints, etc., it's really not the place to "but men!".  Yes, we do realize here that men have issues, and we are very happy to fight for and promote male equality, but in general this is a forum to discuss women's issues, and I feel like there have been a lot more "but meeeeen" comments lately.

>but you pretend that one side doesn't even exist

Not really true, it's just that that's not the topic of conversation.  

Anyway, sorry for the silly little rant, your comment wasn't actually super obnoxious, but as a woman it seems like any time we try to talk about anything, there's a man jumping in and pointing out how men have it as bad or worse.
