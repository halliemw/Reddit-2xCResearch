I think you're right. I'm now realizing how I never properly worked through the trauma of my son's birth. I also focused almost completely on the physical aspect of the miscarriage while ignoring the emotional and I think that's coming back to haunt me. Coupled with pre existing anxiety and the combination really has me in a dark place.
