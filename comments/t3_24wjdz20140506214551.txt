I just have trouble staying on track when I do this, somehow I always get distracted and we're suddenly talking about a problem he has with me and I have no idea how we got there and I'm even more unhappy than when I started out. It makes me seriously reconsider every time I want to talk with him about something, it's a battle every time and I feel like I just can't win. Even though it's not a "win" or "lose" thing, I just feel like I'm constantly at war with him, if that makes sense.

edit: just spoke with him for 1+hrs and it went really well. A couple times he tried to dredge up the past but I made sure we stayed focused and reiterated several times that if he has a problem, it's his responsibility to speak up because I'm not a mind reader, and that he doesn't get to use "my" time to talk about his problems. He's upset/angry/pissed I think because it seems like he's having trouble letting go/setting aside past things and it frustrates him to see me come to him with a problem that he had/has a problem with me for. But too bad it's my turn! =)
