I'm on the Nuvaring myself and I haven't had any problems, but it's different for everyone. You're allowed to take it out during sex, maybe that will help, as long as you don't forget to put it back in. Explain to your BF what's going on and that you switched birth control and that it's affecting your libido. I'm sure he will be patient. I would say wait for 3 months (I know it's frustrating not being able to get off!) and let your body get used to things before you switch, because the Nuvaring is great for other things and lets you skip your period whenever you want! If after three months there aren't any changes, talk to your doctor about switching to something else :) Also, don't forget to keep your boyfriend in the loop so he knows what's going on, I'm sure he will understand :) Good luck, chicky! I'm sure it will all work out.
