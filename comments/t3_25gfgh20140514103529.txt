Ageism is almost always swept under the rug in real life so it doesn't surprise me at all in Hollywood. I have seen discrimination in both sexes for sure, but being a middle aged woman in the US is brutal. No one thinks twice about comments that start with "this soccer mom" or "this bitter middle aged woman" in any sub I have seen on reddit. It's just assumed a middle aged woman is overweight, rude, jealous, bitter and generally unpleasant all around.
