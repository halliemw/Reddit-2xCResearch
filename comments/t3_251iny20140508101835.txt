I imagine the reason he didn't tell you is because he knows you would react badly either way, even you said essentially "I wouldn't like it". And then things like-

"I must admit it was pretty satisfying watching a 6'2" semi-athletic manly man type break down and throw himself and his future at my mercy"

This is off. You never 'enjoy' watch someone breakdown if you love them. Even if they're guilty. You sound like a control freak. 

PS if you can't accept people's opinions you're just proving their point that you're insecure and only want encouragement and to hear other people say what you say to yourself.
