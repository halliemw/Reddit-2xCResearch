Wonderful :-) My dad went down the 'daddy-track' back in 1990 when I was 5 years old and it was really uncommon to have a stay-at-home dad. He quit work altogether for the next ten years and dedicated his time to his family and homemaking. Dropping off and picking up kids; cooking dinner for his wife when she got home from work; growing veg in the garden and doing the DIY... he really made his role as Dad and enjoyed it. And having him around as my primary carer for most of my childhood was absolutely awesome :-) I honestly think he did a better job of bringing up two independent kids than my mum would've done. My mum OTOH certainly did a far better job of bringing home the bacon than dad did - her highflying career paid for two kids to go to private school and university and cleared the mortgage, although dad quitting work meant making sacrifices on luxuries like holidays and treats. I think my mum made a huge sacrifice in not spending much time with her children but she did it in the family's best interests and I'm very proud of what both she and Dad did for us.
