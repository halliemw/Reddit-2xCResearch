unfortunately, true.  People will forget what you did or said, but will never forget how you made them feel.  That's why fear is the most valuable commodity in the universe - markets use it.   They make people afraid of inadequacy, afraid they aren't living well, afraid they aren't happy or beautiful or  sexy etc etc.  THen they use that fear to sell you crap you don't need.  IF you can scare someone in some form, it's much easier to make them do the things that you want them to do
