It goes further than that... there's no audience because women's sports just aren't as good. Go ahead, jump down my throat, but it's true. They're not as good (and when I mean good, I mean skill and competition level) because we haven't had as long to develop them (men have had thousands of years!). Men's sports get the best of the best. I know a pro football player who blatantly told me he doesn't even follow football, he's a die hard soccer fan but football is his job. As for women, if you play a sport your whole life, land a scholarship, play for a D1 school and get a great degree... well, when you graduate, you're going to make more money with that degree than playing a professional sport. It's nice because there's true passion behind those who do pursue it professional, but passion doesn't mean skills and without skills, there's no competition either.

The saddest part, is that the skill and competition level in youth leagues is astounding. I've seen U11 girls teams who could take on national teams if they were a little bigger, but it dies off throughout the years. It's easy to aspire to be a professional football player, with a mutli-million dollar contract, and hundreds of thousands of fans but to play women's basketball on a court smaller than the one you played on in college with fewer fans.

I will say, it's better in Europe. In Europe, there are sports clubs instead of individual franchises. In the US, it's New York Yankees baseball, New York Giants football, New York Rangers hockey, etc so you have a different team for every sport. If you're a fan of Real Madrid soccer, you're a fan of Real Madrid everything-- including women's Volleyball so the ladies get a lot of support from the crowd, who mostly show up to be hooligans but it's working! I have never in my life heard my male (or female, at that) friends excitedly tell me they're pre-gaming to go to the WNBA game, I have heard it from my friends overseas.
