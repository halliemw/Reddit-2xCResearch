Depending on the size of the wedding, it is likely that there are assigned tables. While this can still be awkward if you don't know anyone, it saves the awkwardness of trying to find somewhere to sit/sitting down alone.

At the wedding, there's at least one thing in common, that's easy to strike up conversation about. "Hi, I'm unfashionabull. How do you know the bride/groom?" That can lead to other obvious questions, "oh, you met them in college, what did you study?" "Oh, you work with him? What type of job do you do?" You can talk about how you are her cousin and feel bad that you don't get to see each other often---that can develop into talking about where you live or the last time you saw her. 


Of course there is always "Doesn't the bride look gorgeous, I love her dress/make up/hair?" "The ceremony was really nice". "They got really lucky/unfortunate with this weather". "The bridesmaids' dresses are nice, I like the color". Random comments about what's going on at the wedding.....mostly positive.


Do you not have any other family going? I went to my cousin's wedding this past weekend and flew down with my dad and brother. I spent a chunk of time talking to my aunt and uncle (the bride's parents) and cousin (the bride's sister) because while they were busy for a chunk, I haven't seen them in years either. 


Have Fun!
