What are your negative associations exactly?

I know some people prefer to call themselves humanist instead of feminist because they don't associate with feminism, but personally I find that disregards the history of feminism. So many women fought so hard for rights we take for granted today - the right to vote, to own property, to have a credit card... it goes on and on.

And like /u/meowmixxed said, gender equality is a goal of feminism, but its an incredibly broad goal. You have to think about all the roles we have - social, economical, political, etc.
