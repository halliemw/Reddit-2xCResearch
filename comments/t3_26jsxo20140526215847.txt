> . The Morality Police are on every corner practically, looking to arrest them. These women are so brave. It just tears up my heart to think of them living under such an oppressive system.


really? The government has been working to defund the morality police and they are practically nonexistent in North Tehran. Being forced to cover your hair when you don't want to sucks and shouldn't happen, but don't have your heart "tear up" unless you do the same for women who want to be topless in the US but can't (whereas men can). This seems more than a little patronizing
