> So now I'm stuck with this surprising normal looking BM that wont go anywhere. Also, I have to say although I'm not much for caring what people thing but there was absolutely NO freaking way I'm letting this attractive boy see this thing.

I once had a girl nearly break up with me over poop I left in my own toilet which had clogged the night before (she was living-in, despite having her own place).  Since I didn't have a plunger yet, I couldn't fix it until the next day, and I didn't have somewhere else to poop before I went to work in the morning, and really had to go so I couldn't wait until I got to work.  

In the 6 years I lived in that apartment, that's the only time it ever clogged, and I thought it might be because of her tampons, but she insisted that tampons don't clog toilets... and then she was so disgusted by my poop she didn't talk to me for the rest of the day.  

Sometimes relationships really don't seem worth the headache.
