Wow. This sounds like my first boyfriend. He'd dated a girl for over a year, they broke up, and in less than a month we started dating, and it lasted two years. Within a week of him dumping me, he started a relationship with another girl that lasted three years. His current girlfriend has been with him roughly since he and the last girl broke up. So.. I'd say less than two months single since 2005. Wow.

I didn't realize how much he gaslit me either before I read this.

Thank you for showing me, even if it's been five years (I don't know if you ever really get over your first love), that it wasn't my fault. :)
