Im so glad its not just me who struggles with maintaining friendships with women. Tbh this has been my core group of friends for about 7 or 8 years now. I want to stress that I DONT mean that EVERY girl I have ever met I dont get on with. I just meant that it is hostile sometimes and I dont particularly trust girls because iv been let down a lot (Men aswell though) but I wouldnt even know the girl - like never met her before yet she perhaps feels that she cant trust me or her boyfriend. I dont know. Thats all i was asking by my post. But yes - you make a lot of sense and thank you for your insight :)
