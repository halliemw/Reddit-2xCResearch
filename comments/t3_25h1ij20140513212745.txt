I agree that moving is very stressful and i hope this crazy snowball of bad events ends for you soon! It can be really hard to search for the light at the end of the tunnel when the tunnel seems to have collapsed. Even with that said , try to stay as positive as you can, you'd be surprised how much your mood can change your situation. I really hope things turn up!
