As a male who totally hates the fashion industry and everything about it (especially as my logical mind can not understand any part of it), I really can't see what the fuss is about. She is a woman wearing a dress. Isn't that what you do when you go out in public?

Of course I see nothing wrong with wearing socks in jesus sandals either, I am prone to sunburn especially on my feet, the socks and sandals feel really comfy and protect me from that, yet allow that nice breeze. Do I give a fuck??
