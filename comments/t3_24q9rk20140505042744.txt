A similar thing happened to me! The other night I was out with 3 guy mates dancing at a club and a dude came up to me and started grinding on me and harassing me. I clearly indicated that I was not interested by physically trying to push him off me and he didn't stop until I started clinging onto one of the guys like he was my boyfriend. Dude then apologizes to HIM. I was fucking livid. 

I think the guy must have been fucked on drugs though, normally that sort of stuff doesn't really happen if I'm with guys.
