Men have more body hair than women. It isn't "bizarre" at all that body hair would therefore be considered more masculine.

I don't agree with this idea of shaming body on hair on women, and I personally don't think body hair is non-feminine. However, I also realize that when talking to or about the people that identify body hair with masculinity, describing their attitude as bizarre right from the start is both incorrect and about the worst way to go about getting them to change their views and accept body hair as a feminine trait too.
