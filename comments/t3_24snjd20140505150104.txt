I agree that this seems like pretty manic behavior. The hard thing about bipolar is the medicine dampens the "good" times as well as uplifting the bad. They are willing to deal with the depression and the mess that the manic state makes because of the intensity of the feelings. 

The thing that bothers me the most is his dismissal of your feelings. Don't temper your reaction to this just because he says so or it makes him uncomfortable. You have the same right to react and feel your feelings just as much as he does. 

Are there times where he is more approachable to talking about this? How was your communication before the move? 

The move and job situation seems like it was a high stress thing for both of you. If he isn't willing to go to therapy or marriage counseling, I would suggest finding a professional to talk to about what's going on with you, especially since you don't have as good of a support system yet. Talking with someone else might give some insight on how you want to handle it but can also blow off some of the emotions that you feel like you can't share with your husband. That way when you do talk about it, you have a clearer idea of what you are feeling.
