There's some information on it [here](http://www.hcamag.com/hr-news/landmark-decision-means-employers-must-implement-pay-increase-for-150000-workers-121919.aspx), but employers, state and federal governments were all required to fund payrises for community workers over the course of a number of years.  
  
According to [this](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/federal-politics/women-must-spoil-for-a-fight-to-win-equal-pay-20130109-2cgi6.html) article, it hasn't helped, but honestly, I'm not sure I believe that. The Labor government also improved on the Baby Bonus implemented by Howard, creating our first paid parental leave system: 18 weeks at minimum wage. I took it when my son was born, and it's really no small amount of money. Sure, it's quite a bit less than I earn in my job, but it's not insignificant, either.  
  
I don't know. I think it can only be a good thing to show community and care workers that their work is, in fact, very important. And they're often terribly paid for what they do.
