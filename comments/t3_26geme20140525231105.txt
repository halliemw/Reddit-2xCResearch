I don't think people realise that cake can be vegan. Like, if you have to be vegan you also have to be totally raw.

I had my doctor refuse to believe I was vegan because of my weight. (I was told to go soy-free vegan to help manage a medical condition) 

Just because I don't like meat doesn't mean I don't love carbs and sugar.
