People perceive tall individuals as more powerful/influential in general.  I am currently an MBA student (and a very tall girl), and we are taught in organizational behavior and negotiation classes to try to make ourselves taller so that we can wield more interpersonal influence.  One of my professors is 5'11" and stated that she still wears high heels for that reason.  

Regardless of perceptions, there is something almost disturbingly empowering about looming over people.  However, it can also be uncomfortable because it breeds competition (particularly among other females).  I would suggest that you tell your daughter that her height will actually be very beneficial to her in her future by endowing her with an interpersonal advantage from the very start.  But I do agree that there's no quick fix to how she's feeling--she'll have to navigate it over time and will realize the advantages once the heights of people around her stabilize.  I still have the physical habit of slumping to seem shorter sometimes, but overall am deeply grateful for my height.
