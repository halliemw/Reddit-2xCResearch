Oh geez, I dunno :( I've never even heard of that to be honest but I looked it up. I've taken fluconazole before, the first time I had a yeast infection but I don't remember any peeling like this. I don't think I have any other symptoms but I'll keep an eye out. Thank you so much for replying, I'm definitely going to try an icepack wrapped in a washcloth on the outside of my PJ's, and I've already taken some ibuprofen so hopefully it will kick in soon.
