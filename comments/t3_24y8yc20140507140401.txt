I would never purchase used underwear or swim bottoms, nor would I ever share mine with someone else. Too many bodily fluids have been on them at one point or another, and I don't know how another's bodily fluids will react with mine. I wouldn't want to risk a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, etc.

Even if it's been washed in a washing machine, I wouldn't trust it.

If it were never worn? I wouldn't mind that, but that'd be probably hard to prove that it was never worn.

Edit: I lied, I do share swim bottoms - for some reason it doesn't bother me as much. Maybe it's because swim bottoms aren't worn all day every week/few weeks like underwear is.
