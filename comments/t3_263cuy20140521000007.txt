I'm in college as well and I've had some luck making friends from scratch! One thing I would encourage is joining some school organizations that you're passionate about/interested in. I've found that some of the most rewarding friendships I've formed have come from organizations, and it gives you a rather large group of friends to get to know. The second thing is in classes, I know it can be difficult if you're shy but making small talk with your classmates, asking questions about homework, taking up people's offers of studying together - all of these things add up! I've made two very dear friends just by showing up to a study group for a class we were taking. 

Hope this helps at all, and good luck!
