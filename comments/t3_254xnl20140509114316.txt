Wow, I did not connect with that article at all. I hate Mother's Day because my mother wasn't great at being a mother, but thinks that she was. I have a pretty low amount of contact with her (phone calls once a month, haven't seen her in a year and a half), but as it is, I'm expected to be a good sport about the holiday (and generally send her a card/small gift). 

I know I can't insulate myself from stuff (and yeah, sometimes watching a movie where the mom and daughter are *besties!* gets to me), but the schmaltz associated with Mother's Day can be the worst.
