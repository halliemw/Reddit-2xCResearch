My therapist seems reluctant to address any of my issues with sexual dysfunction, and gave me an "all clear" and an option to come back if i needed to. I'm going to start looking for other options thought. I do feel like I made some really great progress, just not in the way I had originally wanted. I used to be a huge masturbator (heh), but not so much anymore. I really appreciate your advice regardless of your past experience.
