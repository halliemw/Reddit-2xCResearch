I just don't understand though, why hate directed towards women is so rampant and acceptable online.  It concerns me because people online are people nonetheless, and who are these fucking people?  Are they my neighbors, classmates, professors, friends living a double life?  Which life would they choose if they could?  The one in which respect for gender equality is expected, or the reddit no man land one where hatred against women is fun?  When you think about it, it is kinda scary.
