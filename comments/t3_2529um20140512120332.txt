I did a lot of internet dating - how I found my bf of now 4 yrs - and there was a lot of that. (also some folks who told me to eat more, whiten my teeth and so on... no one is cute to everyone!) I just was made sure to include all the nerdy things I liked and pics of my hair all kinds of non-traditional colors, and explained that I didn't want to have kids. Amazing way to filter people. haha. And in the end it was pretty obvious who wasn't reading anything! (My boyfriend asked me about books when he wrote. yes!)
