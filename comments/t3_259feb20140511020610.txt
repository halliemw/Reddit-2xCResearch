This is pretty much what my dad did. I ended up with a Diploma of IT, and my sister is a freelance editor with an honours degree in creative writing.  
  
I own a home with my husband, and we have a 6 month old son. My sister's partner bought them a home and they have two adorable terriers.  
  
We're both strong and independent women who can take care of ourselves. Our gender was never at issue. We got taught how to mow the lawn, and I became a motorcyclist and rode with my dad on a lot of occasions. We used to ride out somewhere on photography trips semi regularly before I had to give it up.
