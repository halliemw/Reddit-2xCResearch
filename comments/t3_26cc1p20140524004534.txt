Getting a completely serious "not all men" comment two days ago was the eye-opener to me. Many guys on here sincerely think that having a female safe-space is "misandrist." There are dudes that are *angry* that there is a default subreddit that doesn't cater to their gender.

I hate how the general Reddit opinion on TwoX is that there needs to be "devil's advocate" shit stirring going on here or its somehow either a reverse Red Pill or hug box. Discussion is not blinding yourself to the experiences of others because they're not your own.
