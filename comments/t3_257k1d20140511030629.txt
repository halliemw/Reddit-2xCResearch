Go for an eye test anyway, it can't hurt and if there is anything wrong, they'll be able to spot it. Make sure to go to an actual optometrist, since..honestly, I don't trust the "doctors" @ places like Lenscrafters anyway. An optometrist will know what to look for and be able to perform certain tests that will be needed(like one where you peek into a machine with one eye, and press a buzzer everytime you see a small white dot appear within your range of vision..that one freaks me out).

On the list for severe side effects, the Blurred Vision and Headaches should be together, along with Nausea+Vomiting+Tinnitus+Double Vision. That'd mean that it's [Psuedotumor Cerebri/Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000351.htm), which has a really low chance of happening from birth control(only estrogen-based ones can provoke it, I believe, as I have it and I'm only allowed on progesterone-based BC..barely).
