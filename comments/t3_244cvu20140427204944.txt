I was 11 when I started getting my period. I remember it well because the night before I was reading *The DaVinci Code* and was in terrible pain from cramps. The next day I got home from school and found blood in my underwear. I called for my mother.

I wasn't excited about it. I hated everything about menstruation, from having to wear a pad until I was positive it was over, to the cramps so severe I had to stay home sick some days, to the mood swings and suicidal thoughts. The second time I got my period I cried and cried and swore that I'd get a hysterectomy when I was old enough.

When I was 18 I talked to my psychiatrist about how bad my PMS was, and she prescribed birth control pills. She told me to take them every day and skip the placebo pills. It's probably the best thing I've ever done.

One of my co-workers told me a horror story about how her sister did the same thing and is now infertile, though. :/
