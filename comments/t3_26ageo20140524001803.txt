>It could be that she's paid less and the media wants to hide the salary imbalance?

Well, you would have to ask if she's being paid less than whom? There's no standard manager salary, everything comes down to negotiations between the club and the manager/agent. We know that women in general do worse than men in negotiations, but there are lots of other factors: Clermont Foot is not a rich club, or a very successful one. They're near the bottom in the French second division, that's gotta have some impact. We could compare her with her predecessor, but I can't find any info on his salary, and even then you can't make the argument that it's gender based. It can be based on experience or the current budget, or million other factors. I guess they didn't report it because they didn't report the salary on anyone in lower leagues.
