I've tried framing it differently. I do 99% of all housework, my SO does 99% of financial earning. In that way it can be argued that we do an equal share of "household work." But that damn voice in the back of my mind doesn't like that. It's my mother's voice constantly saying "you're useless" because, by using hours of work to determine my share of household work, what I am doing is miniscule..
