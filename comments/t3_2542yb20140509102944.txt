Look at this this way.  If you broke your legs and were incapacitated, would you not consider it thoughtful if your SO (or someone who loved you) helped you out - just to make things a bit more comfortable?

Have you ever been so sick you're unable to do anything but stare into oblivion waiting for time to pass - the flu, bronchitis, etc?  Wouldn't it be sad if your SO said "I couldn't give less of a shit about it?"  It's called being a loving, caring and empathetic partner.



Not every woman experiences her periods the same way.   I have a friend, who doesn't even know she's getting it until it arrives.   Mine were so bad, that I had to get rushed to the hospital twice before they designed treatments and meds for me that made it bearable.  

Here please read this, it may give you some insight:

Endometriosis (en-doe-me-tree-O-sis) is an often painful disorder in which tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus (endometrial implant). Endometriosis most commonly involves your ovaries, bowel or the tissue lining your pelvis. Rarely, endometrial tissue may spread beyond your pelvic region.

In endometriosis, displaced endometrial tissue continues to act as it normally would — it thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. Because this displaced tissue has no way to exit your body, it becomes trapped. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. Surrounding tissue can become irritated, eventually developing scar tissue and adhesions — abnormal tissue that binds organs together.

Endometriosis can cause pain — sometimes severe — especially during your period. Fertility problems also may develop. Fortunately, effective treatments are available.

edit - I'm glad you're not my SO, you sound like a self-centered, cold fish.
