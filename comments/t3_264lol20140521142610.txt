Hey thanks for weighing in. 

Questions for you. What do you mean by #3? Outside of my chain of command? Outside of his? I have gone to my boss (this guy's peer) and am planning on going to this guy's boss (who is also my boss' boss).

I don't want to go straight to HR for the reason you mention, and because I want this guy's boss to know what is going on.

I have zero intentions of bringing the law into this. He's violating company policy many times over and that's enough, honestly. He's intimidating a lot of people - a lot of really good people - and I want it to stop.

Edit --and, honestly, now I'm 2nd guessing posting some of this information on here as I'm not sure it could come back to bite me.
