Im going to put this here since my thread and one like it by someone else was removed. 

My posts in my own removed thread received a downvote immediately after removal and response to the mod post in it - as well as all my other recent posts that were anti-default.

So apparently we aren't allowed to speak against this anymore and talk about our rude PMs? Seems a bit much. But this thread is still here, so I'll leave this here.
