Totally okay to go alone!

Some couples like to give the option of bringing a friend or significant other because it makes their guests feel more comfortable in a new environment but you are under NO obligation to bring anyone. Actually they might appreciate it if you don't bring someone because it's becoming more common for brides and grooms to pay for their own weddings instead of their families so it could save them some money by only having you come. Several people came to my wedding alone and that was perfectly fine! I was just glad they were there and their presence was more important to me than anything else!!
