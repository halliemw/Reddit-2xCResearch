Yeah, that's really hard. What do you think she would do if you didn't get her the stuff she's asking for? Also, I wonder if she feels somewhat powerless and the one thing she knows she can control is what she eats. That's not a good excuse for not taking care of herself (or allowing others to), but she may have some anger and resentment about her situation.
