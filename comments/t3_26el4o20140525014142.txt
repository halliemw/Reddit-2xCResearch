And I thought this situation couldn't frigthen/sicken me more. Here I was dismissing the Men's Rights Movement out of hand because I knew at its heart it was bullshit, but this is a whole new level of holy shit. I have a two year old daughter who I can already tell will grow up to at least be pretty. Is this how boys her age will treat her? God, I hope not.
