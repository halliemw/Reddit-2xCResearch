All birth controls are different. I've been on a few different kinds and it took me a few to find kind that works for me, but I'm happy with mine. In my experience most of them make your boobs at least a cup size bigger (no sagging or stretch marks for me, and my boobs were already big to start), some of them would make me feel nauseous or really emotional but remember you aren't "stuck" with whatever birth control you pick, some are more intense than others. As far as I know it didn't make me any more or less attracted to my boyfriend of the time. The only thing I would caution as far as ANY relationships and the pill is when your body's adjusting to going on or being off of it, you can get REALLY hormonal, irritable, or emotional (though thats not true for everyone).
