 I also agree the sex trade should be legalized and regulated to protect sex workers, they are same as anyone else work is work. Its unfortunate that someone would blame the sex worker. 
 

I hope I can have a good relationship one day! but for now I want to "focus on myself" (whatever that means. for now I think I just  want to make sure I don't end up in a abusive relationship again even if that's means I alone for the rest of my life so be it!!
