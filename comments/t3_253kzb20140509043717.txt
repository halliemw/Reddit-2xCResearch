You really are just straight up avoiding the main point of my post, which was that the community never would have voted to become a default and that a logical conclusion is that the moderators decided to go ahead with it to enhance their own positions on the site.


Still hasn't been a real explanation as to why this decision was made in the first place. #2 comment in the thread announcing this decision is a question as to why which has been unanswered. You said in a message to me that the moderators would "keep listening and talking to [the community] about it.", which appears to be untrue.
