It seems like the majority of the original post talks is about how internet abuse so that is particularly what I was responding to.

1. There is no reason to assume that women receive more (non/gendered) internet abuse. If there are no statistics available then we can't come to a conclusion. Also, if these messages are anonymous then why do you assume they're male? I've had female friends that say things most people would assume come from a male.

2. Why are they not investing in women? If women are being judged on the content of their proposed investment but simply aren't as good then it would mean women have an ability to become startups.

On a completely anecdotal level my father was an internet entrepreneur and I observed a lot of what he did. They way he approached investors was the same way men approach women while courting. It's possible that women haven't had this practice that men have been doing for years. My father once said this about investors: "You don't stop calling when they say no. You don't stop when they say no a hundred times. You stop when they file a restraining order...and sometimes you don't stop even then." Apparently it worked out for him.
