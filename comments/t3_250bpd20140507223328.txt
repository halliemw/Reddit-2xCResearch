She'd have been suspended at my old high school for wearing something that short. At the *very* least, she'd have been sent home for the rest of the day and not allowed back even if she *had* changed. =\ (also, I'm not all that old, just from a very *very* conservative southern town)

Skirts, shorts and dresses **had** to extend a minimum of 2 inches past your fingertips, goes for guys AND girls. (Also, no tank tops for anyone, not even the guys, unless it was during phys ed.) As others echoed, she's also bending her arms AND cupping her hands, which will make her arms appear shorter. If she stood up straight, and let her arms hang naturally, there's no possible way that skirt comes to her fingertips. I'm all for wearing what makes you comfortable, but at the same time, there is a line where you are forcing people you *must* interact with to be very uncomfortable about it. Maybe the teacher overheard comments from another student? Maybe the teacher has had issues with her breaking school policy before? Maybe they had a legitimate reason for her to adjust her wardrobe?
