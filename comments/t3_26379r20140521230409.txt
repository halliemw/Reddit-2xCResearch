I know you didn't mean this, but whenever I read people saying things like "It makes me sad when So-and-So feels bad about herself, because *I* think she's beautiful!"...I sort of feel like that's missing the point. Like, it's still sending the message that value (especially for women) is ultimately about appearance, and furthermore it has the unpleasant implication that if So-and-So is actually ugly (or you believe her to be so) that she would then be justified in feeling badly, which I find to be kind of icky.
