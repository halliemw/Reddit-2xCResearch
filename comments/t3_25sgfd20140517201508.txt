I have a distant ancestor named Melisande, which is close enough for me (I've actually met people online with the name and one in real life; there are several in history).  It's close enough to make Maleficent sound as if it should be a name.

(Although Aurora would be a great name for a daughter, wouldn't it?)

People name their children words that weren't names until they used them, all the time.
