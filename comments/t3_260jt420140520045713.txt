>It also feels like she thinks my boyfriend is weakwilled and is liable to be 'taken in' by a controlling woman
  
A note on this as a male with a mother: I think alot of mothers have this concern for their sons, and it doesn't necessarily mean she thinks he is weak willed. Just as fathers fear their daughters being taken advantage of because "we know how men think" so do mothers think critically of the women their sons date due to their perspective.

The analogy extends to other areas. For example a banker may always be giving unsolicited financial advice to family members or a mechanic may nag his friends about car maintenance habits. Someone with expertise, real or perceived, on a matter will tend to be more critical about it.
