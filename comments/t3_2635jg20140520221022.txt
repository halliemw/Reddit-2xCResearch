Yeah I had this for a while. I was checked out by an NP, a GP and finally a gynecologist.

The final consensus was that I had torn at some point, and it had hurt, leaving a "memory" of the fact that it hurt and an involuntary response to tighten. We got through it by always going slow and relaxing and focussing on the fact that nothing was wrong with me. It eventually went away. They offered physical therapy, but my insurance didn't cover it, and I figured my bf and I could just be gentle and slow and thoughtful. If it hadn't worked, I probably would have done the physical therapy.

[To confound things a bit, I was also having a really bad psoriasis flare up, which also went away around the same time. I have no idea if they are linked at all, but I wonder...]

Anyways, not to say that you're having the same problem, but that's my experience.
