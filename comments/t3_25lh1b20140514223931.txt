Take a deep breath because it's going to be ok.

Your best bet for accurate information fast is a pharmacist. Call or go tomorrow and explain what happened. If you need Plan B, you can buy it there I'm sure. Plan B can be taken for up to 72 hours after sex, so early tomorrow morning is the best time to have this conversation. They'll also be able to tell you when to start taking the next pack since this one is off. As far as no period yet, don't worry. Different types of birth control tend to cause periods on different days of the placebo week, and it's even possible to have none at all. Plan B shouldn't affect a pregnancy test because it has progestin in it and the pregnancy test looks for human chorionic gonadotropin, typically only released by a fertilized egg/embryo/fetus, so don't be afraid to take it. 

I don't know enough about this pill to tell you anything about the risks from recent sex, but you should still have been protected in your last placebo week from your old birth control because of the old hormones. That said, in the future, it's generally best to use a secondary form of birth control in at least the first week of a new pill if not the first whole pack, just in case. Chances are you'll be ok, though, because your chances of conceiving from one or two instances of sex are low.
