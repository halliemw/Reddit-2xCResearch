Sorry, this is not true.  All police departments, wherever they are, have the power to issue warrants for information from online sources - including Facebook, ebay etc.  If a person is at risk of harm, these warrants have to be adhered to.  His account could be traced by IP address, and also via the email attached to the account - both pieces of simple information can be requested via established processes.  The police in this case are being deeply unhelpful and are not fulfilling their professional duty.
