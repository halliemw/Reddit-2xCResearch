I think there's some gray area where removing a condom is sexual assault but (since you were legally to drunk to drive or consent to sex) your lie about birth control isn't an assault on him.  Afterall, you're shouldering all the harms of the pregnancy, whereas STDs are bi-directional and lying because you want to get pregnant harms him.
