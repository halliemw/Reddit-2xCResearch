At first as I was reading this I thought, "Hmm, this could actually be a good article". Then I read this, "And yet, the reality is that even with everything I’ve taught you, you are still capable of committing rape. Not because you’re some kind of testosterone-driven monster on the inside, but because you’re at the center of swirling variables and messages." and it made me frustrated and angry again. I might be getting mad because my moms outlook is generally that ever man is probably a rapist until proven otherwise and I would not be surprised to find she thinks I could ever rape someone. But maybe I am getting frustrated because the message is someone saying, 'after all I (or presumably we (father and mother)) have taught you about being a man and looking out for everyone and especially women, you still could rape someone'.  Well no kidding, every person could be a potential rapist. I am so glad my dad instilled in me to always take care of everyone and esp women. This idea of 'even though your a great son your still on the verge of being a rapist' is part of the "center of swirling variables and messages." With some reworking, this could be a good article; as it is, it make me sick to my stomach that this is considered a 'good message' and should be something men teach other men.
