This is a woman-oriented subreddit where we discuss women's issues and things that relate to women. You might have better luck somewhere like /r/oneY, which discusses men's issues. :)

It's not that those things aren't important, but just like you don't go into /r/Nintendo and complain that they aren't talking about the XBone, you shouldn't come stomping in here asking about men in every single thread.
