In 2012, I had two people attempt to break in my home at 4:30 in the morning. I own a 20 gauge shotgun and pulled that from under my bed, loaded 2 shells, and cocked and locked it. When I walked up to the glass sliding door they saw me and ran away very fast. 

That being said, guns are not scary. They're only scary if you want them to be. If you wanna even out the playing field as a woman if you're ever in a scenario where things go south, I suggest you consider getting a firearm. I have a Bersa Thunder .380 CC and a 20 gauge Ithaca shotgun. Perfect for a lady to defend herself. I hope this helps. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.
