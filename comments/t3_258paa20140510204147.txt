Definitely had this problem. Then, I had a great, wonderful boyfriend who very patiently took me to a mirror every time he noticed I was self conscious and showed me something he thought was beautiful about my body. I still remember one of them, standing there staring at myself thinking "Ick," and he placed his hand on my waist and said "This curve right here, I love this curve and how my hand fits in it." He showed me parts of myself that were beautiful that I had never seen because I didn't look for those - I always looked for the nasties.

I realised how sexy I was wasn't 100% how I looked but a combination of how I looked, how I felt, how I moved, and how someone else SAW me. Now, [I feel like this inside](http://media.giphy.com/media/o4aiTVQLenCYo/giphy.gif) and fuck it, even if I'm not sexy as hell, at least I feel sexy as hell. And the boyfriend I am with now has never complained about it :P

It's a bit of fake it 'til you make it, a bit of Accentuate the Positive, a lot of accepting that the compliments people give you are TRUE and HONEST (and not somebody being "polite" or whatever other brush-off you have,) and a bit of support from someone you trust (a therapist, a friend, a boyfriend) but you can get to a place where you feel damn good about yourself.
