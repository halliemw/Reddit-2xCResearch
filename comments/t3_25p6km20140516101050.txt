I actually agree with this - I think it's part of the job, if you are putting yourself up to that level, anyway - the sacrifice for the money and fame, isn't it? 

It's just so sad how common it is for people to say such cruel things on public forums/the media. I honestly believe that this isn't going to improve. The only thing we can do as an individual, is NOT say mean and intentionally hurtful things to (or about) others.
