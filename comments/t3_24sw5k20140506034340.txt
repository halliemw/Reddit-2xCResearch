I can definitely second this. After a string of terrible relationships and being cheated on repeatedly I've taken a year to just be by myself to find happiness and strength from within. It sounds so cliche but I can't even begin to describe the ways in which I've changed, definitely for the better. I've heard it a lot lately that rather than search for someone to be with, you should develop yourself and your own character so you're someone worth being with. I agree wholeheartedly. The quality of men I now date is much, much better. I have more self respect and more belief that I'm worth a decent relationship where I'm more than just a doormat. I think part of it is also opening your eyes and trying to see the world in a realistic view. I think I used to project how much I adored my boyfriends to the point where I tricked myself into thinking they felt exactly the same even when there were clear  signs to the contrary. Self love and self worth aren't bad things, if you have them in the right proportions. Best of luck to OP. Life seems shit right now but trust me lady, you're going to look back on this as a blessing in disguise. Love yourself, care for yourself and rebuild all the energy that was wasted on that loser. The funny part is that he's going to realise not too far away that the grass is always greener.
