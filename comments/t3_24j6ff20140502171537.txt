My husband got out of active duty military to be a stay-at-home dad; the amount of flak he got from coworkers was silly. They weren't outright malicious, but there were a *lot* of comments made questioning his masculinity and also aimed at me for being emasculating. (I'm active duty too.)

I'm so lucky and thankful that he never seemed to take it to heart, that he truly revels in being home with our son and spending time teaching him and watching him grow and flourish.
