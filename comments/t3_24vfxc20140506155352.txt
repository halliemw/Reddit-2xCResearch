I don't think I ever gave it much thought one way or the other, but I've always loved whatever is on my partner.  

My husband has a VERY thick triangle shaped furry patch on his lower back.  It's like an arrow pointing at his butt and I love it.  He doesn't have much fur other places - just a regular amount on his legs and a very thin layer on his chest, and I love his smooth parts too.
