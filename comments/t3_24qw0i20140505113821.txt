I've found that many petite lines at stores are actually sized differently all around. They are tailored for a higher natural waist, neckline and shoulders are shrunken and the sleeve length is shorter. Usually smaller all around. OP might have better luck looking for pants that offer a "short" inseam size rather than petite. Loft sells shorter inseams, as does NY&Company. Both stores frequently have sales too, making it more affordable.
