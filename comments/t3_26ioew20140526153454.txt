I'm not a woman, but I'll say this anyway.

Success and popularity in high school mean little in real life. Basically, everything starts over for adulthood, but without most of the silly rules, cliques, and adolescent nerves of high school. So a lot of the kids who were "most likely to succeed" in high school are still there, sweeping the floors. And conversely, a lot of the 9th grade geeks and nerds are doing pretty dang well.
