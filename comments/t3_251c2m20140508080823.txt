Did you read some of the stuff Dowd based that on? Monica having dinner at a restaurant near the White House, like waiting for her high school boyfriend outside of biology class. Or, you know... having dinner with her family? She also called her "relentless" for showing up for a grand jury that she was asked to come to.

Dowd can mask it however she wants, but the cries of "attention whore!" are not a new criticism to women, nor are they even that clever of a front for slut shaming. Yes, she did a Vanity Fair photo shoot. So? Fame was thrust upon her, and not a good fame either. A fame muddled with accusations and mischaracterizations. Is it that surprising that she wanted to change the narrative? I don't think it's anywhere near fair to characterize that as Monica acting like she was a movie star.
