It won't be that bad. I actually find visits to the gyno less awful than visits to the dentist. It's unpleasant, but it's over so quickly that it's not that bad. Do tell them that you're concerned about potentially being in pain and that you're nervous. Ask them to use the smallest speculum they have and to tell you what they're going to do before they do it. If you have an awful doctor, which does happen sometimes, don't think it will always be awful and do change to someone better. Bad doctors don't deserve to keep patients.
