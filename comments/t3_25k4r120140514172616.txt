It's entirely your decision. You do sound pretty conflicted and you have a little time, though, so I'd recommend calling the clinic and asking if they have or can recommend a counselor. They can help you go over all your options and make sure your decision is right for you and your family, current and future. From what you're telling us I don't think it will change your decision (though it might and that's ok) but it will help you make sure that whatever you decide, you know you're 100% making the best decision you can.
