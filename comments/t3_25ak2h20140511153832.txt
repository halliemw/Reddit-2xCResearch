My personal experience (i'm sure different people would deal with this situation differently): I have seen my dad about 4-5 times in my life, and I have had a step-dad since I was 2.  I feel no pain for not knowing my biological father, and couldn't care less.  I have a great dad in my step-father and have never felt like I needed anything else.  

My 6 year old adopted little sister (my cousin's child) also is in that situation with her mom.  I have told my mom who adopted her that the child does not even ask about her real mom, and the real mom doesn't ask about her, so there's no reason to force a relationship there.  If my little sister isn't told that she's missing out on something by my mom, then she won't feel that until she grows up and decides if it's important for her or not.
