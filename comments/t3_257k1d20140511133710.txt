Well you said "This is wrong...DO NOT DO THIS" which is a bit different than "not recommended in comparison to better options."  Considering both Plan B and ella (which is Rx only) will probably cost >$50, it's still a valid option to use as opposed to doing nothing if you really don't want to get pregnant.
