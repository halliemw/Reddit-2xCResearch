Well I'm a lady who did my degree and PhD in physics at Oxford and never experienced any negative reaction to being a woman. Although you'll be in the minority it's not so rare for a woman to be studying a mathematical subject for it to be a novelty or even particularly noteworthy.

The only issue I found is that the women, myself included tended to be less assertive than the men (this is obviously just in general - not true universally) so you have to make more of an effort to make yourself heard in a male dominated environment.

In general though I think you're getting yourself anxious unnecessarily. The people who really seemed to fall apart as undergrads (both men and women) were the ones who had always got by and even been top of the class without really trying. It was often a massive shock to the system when this was no longer the case.

Good luck!
