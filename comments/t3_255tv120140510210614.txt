I'm sorry you had to go through all of that, it sounds awful but sounds like you're doing much better now.

I've looked into the restraining order, and sadly I really don't think it's viable. He hasn't contacted me at all since he was arrested, and there is no documented proof that he ever actually hurt me. If he'd been found guilty in court I would've got one automatically, which is a shame. I find it very frustrating that the court can hand out a verdict knowing that it may put the victim in real danger, but I guess the law is the law.
