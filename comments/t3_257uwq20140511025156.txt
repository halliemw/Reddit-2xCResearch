I don't know, I think she might be over reacting. I know I might get downvotes for not supporting her, but I think in school you need to understand modesty. If a dress code has restrictions for both genders wearing obscene clothing, than that's acceptable. When I was younger, the majority of schools I went to required men to be shaven unless it was just peach fuzz and girls couldn't wear a sleeveless shirt if the strap was less than an inch thick. And yes, the school did have more or less "ugly" shirts as replacements, since they didn't want to call a parent everytime this happened for more clothes. The so called ugly clothes were usually a t shirt with the school logo on it or a blond polo shirt. 

This girl's school is pretty lax allowing strappy tank tops in the first place. She doesn't realize that there are schools requiring full on uniforms, and she wants to wear strapless shirts.
