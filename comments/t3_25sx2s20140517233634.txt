You can see my thoughts on Academic definitions and their problems below in my reply to /u/futuremaude. I have other issues with academic definitions, especially when translating to regular society as well, but that's a very long post.

Also in your original reply to my comment. You mentioned how language evolved, the need to not invent new words. Neither the word slut, nor shaming are new words. We have simply combined them and it is now a common phrase in discussions such as these. There was nothing that needed to be changed within the definition of either of those words to make it work as a phrase applicable to what it is.

You also did not reply to my stated point to your main objection
