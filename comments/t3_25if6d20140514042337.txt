I understand that telling your mother you're an adult and can do as you please is probably not going to go over very well, especially if you still live with her. Depending on where you live you might be able to get free or low cost birth control from a free health clinic or a Planned Parenthood without the involvement of insurance. Maybe just keeping her out of it completely would be the best for you and your boyfriend.
