She asked for a raise because of gender discrimination, not just for a raise.

The idea is there was no gender discrimination, and thus they couldn't make reparations.  Without reparations, they have an employee who thinks their company treats her poorly as one of the top editors.  Furthermore, they have *shitty* employee who thinks their company treats her poorly.  Okay, shitty may be hyperbole, but it gets to the point.

She was not a great employee, and they had reasons to can her.  Then, she made a fuss about discrimination that didn't exist, so they couldn't repair the alleged "breach of trust," since she still believes it's discrimination.  How can a company feel safe to operate with one of it's big editors not only being a bad supervisor but ALSO having a grudge against the very newspaper she works for?
