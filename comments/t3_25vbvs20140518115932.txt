I think a common issue with searching for a wedding dress is that members of the bridal party impose their tastes too strongly on the bride. *You* saw something in this dress; don't let go of that feeling just because someone voiced a differing opinion. In my personal opinion the color is lovely, the lace is elegant and the dress compliments your figure. Also, don't forget that dresses can be altered. The smallest detail could change the whole look. (On a more random note, I think a bold hairpiece would go beautifully with this.) To be honest, I think your friend will warm up to the dress once she sees how happy you are in it.
