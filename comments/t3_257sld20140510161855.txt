I've always lived on the west coast (Eta: west coast of America) and being called ma'am always came off as someone calling me old. Even while I was working in a tea parlor which old ladies loved going to, I always called them 'ladies' if I needed group attention or 'miss' for one particular woman. Sometimes they would be flattered I called them 'miss' but 'ma'am' sounds a bit rough and old to me. (Try saying it in a sarcastic or derogative tone of voice, that's how I always hear it, even in a normal voice).
