This is a weird suggestion but... get a Twitter account. I've had one since high school, it has given me the ability to share my experience with other people even if no one is there. I've met all kinds of new people who are also sharing their stories, and relationships you create online can materialize into friendships in real life. And twitter has a way better atmosphere than Facebook in that, depending on who you follow, it's so much less inane and vitriolic.
