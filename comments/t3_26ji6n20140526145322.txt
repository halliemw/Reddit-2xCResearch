It sounds like you want to have a fling with this guy but nothing serious? You could just be honest with him and say you like him and would like to have some more fun with him, but dont see it as a long term thing. He'll either agree or peace out, no problem. Of course if you do end up in a relationship it will probably hurt when it ends, but that's not really your responsibility. He's only gonna be super hurt if you lead him to believe you love him when you dont. So yeah, just dont do that.
