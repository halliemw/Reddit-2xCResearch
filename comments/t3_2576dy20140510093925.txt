As I have explained above, fighting one without the other is not a good philosophical approach especially for someone who lives in the West where female circumcision is extremely rare.  What you are saying when you do it is that their Female genital cutting culture is barbaric/not valid but the form of genital mutilation that's routine in the US is OK because it stems from "civilized" people(americans/jews). And that is patronizing .

The ground this should be fought on  is that no genital mutilation/modifications should be inflicted upon anyone against his/her will. It is crucial that it becomes an adult personal decision from a Human Rights point of view.

I disagree with both practices and fight them both on the same grounds.

 "Your culture is barbaric and mine is not" or "Genital mutilation  can be either good or bad depending on the individual's sex" are not good arguments, that's why I think it's normal for people to say this in the comments section. 

It would be a different matter if you were raising awareness /fighting this on the ground locally in AFrica, you could have a gender specific approach - but these are people talking about something that does not affect them at all.
