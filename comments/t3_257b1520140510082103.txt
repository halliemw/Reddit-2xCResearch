>I honestly just don't get it.

It is very simple:  we have always welcomed men and encouraged them to participate here.  However, the focus has always been the women's perspective.  Anything other than that means we are catering to men's needs and we don't want to do that.  Simple enough?  There are enough subs catering to men's needs, we don't want to be one of them, how simple is that?  If there is going to be an influx of male viewers here, they might as well deal with the fact that we will talk about period shits, nipple hair and vaginal secretions. 

Blatant sexism, are you fucking kidding me???  Do you have any idea of the sheer volume of filthy PMs we're receiving asking for boobs and pussy?  I honestly hope you're referring to the blatant sexism this sub was invaded with after becoming default.  Please tell me that's what you mean. There's no self-destruction and the mods should have been introspective *before* betraying this community in this way.  What you're seeing is people fighting to defend what they had.

> Go to any length to get rid of every single male viewer?

Not necessarily.  As long as we're not yet another sub catering to their needs, they are welcome to stay and even participate.  But the focus is women. And if period shits and nipple hair prove to be too much for them to handle, then they probably shouldn't be here in the first place.
