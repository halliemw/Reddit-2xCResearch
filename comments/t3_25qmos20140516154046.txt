As far as I could find when I started taking the pill, you aren't really at risk of anything unless you're taking Depo, which decreases bone mineral density over time. Of course, your risks of gallbladder disease and blood clots are increased by being on the pill, but as far as I know that's not related to the amount of time you spend on the pill. If you have any concerns, your doctor is the best person to rely on for information, because we're just random internet strangers. I think that's some of why you're getting downvoted.
