I'm really lucky that we both had signed up for life insurance before I was diagnosed.  I am also doing a LOT to try and make sure that she has constant support in the days/weeks/months following my death.   I think setting it up so that someone actually stays here with her is a really good idea.  Thank you for passing that on!
