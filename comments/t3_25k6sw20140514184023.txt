This was a really sweet reply, thank you. I agree with you in that it is MY decision who MY friends are!

And that was my worry, that if I tell him I don't want to hear from him again he's going to blow up my phone asking why and making me feel guilty. 

You're right though, it's nobody's business and I shouldn't have to defend myself. I shouldn't feel bad either, but I do. Thank you again for your reply :)
