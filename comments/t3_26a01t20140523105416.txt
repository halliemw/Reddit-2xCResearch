This could have happened even if she stayed in her old school, don't you think so? Bullies won't go away and rarely can be reasoned with (imagine the outrage of these kids' parents if teachers/other parents interfere with their little lovely sprogs being mean shits). Removing them from the bullied girl's life via transfer to another school is the best possible option.
