"Same exact face" is simply inaccurate.  The differences are subtle, but it definitely looks like the degree of variance found in a nuclear family's common genetic makeup.  Different chins, different eyebrows, different complexions.  Saying it "biologically could only happen if she used mitosis" is simply incorrect, and that kind of lily gilding only hurts your case.

Yes, Disney holds and enforces a very particular notion of what beauty is and it frequently conflates that concept with the notions of virtue which it similarly holds and enforces.  The near-universal body and face types of female protagonists are problematic and the similarity between Rapunzel and characters in *Frozen* points damningly to this.  No argument from me.

I'm simply pointing out that all the rhetoric, time, and energy spent criticizing the likeness shared by three members of a nuclear family -- a phenomenon which occurs quite frequently in the real world -- serves only to undermine the validity of those very real points.  You might as well make *The Parent Trap* the cornerstone of your argument.
