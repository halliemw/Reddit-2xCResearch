Having an inferiority complex is awesome when you can embrace it as a tool for all these amazing [reasons](https://www.google.ca/#q=inferiority+complex+and+success). 

I'm not sure about your boyfriend but my balance is a stoic desire to constantly prove to myself that I can endure incredible hardship.

Currently I'm in finance and getting started in a pretty successful career that I think I am spectacularly unqualified for. My back-up is working on offshore drilling rigs outside of west Africa and that is an even more terrifying notion because not only do I think I'm unqualified but being shitty usually means you get seriously hurt/dead.

My point is, having an inferiority complex is great in many situations. Just be able to admit that part of your personality exists and use it as a tool. The same with all other personalities.
