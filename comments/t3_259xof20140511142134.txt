I second the idea of checking for a subreddit devoted to your city. Don't just wait for meetups, either! Make a post gauging interest in starting a group based on one of your hobbies - I did this with a book club when I moved to my current city and made good friends that way. It's a surefire way to meet people with common interests!

Or you could create a meetup of your own! Submit a link asking if anyone wants to come to a local coffee shop, bar, or park and play board games. Good luck, and happy friend-finding!
