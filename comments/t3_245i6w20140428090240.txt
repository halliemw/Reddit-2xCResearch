Dear lord I would LOVE it if she had the guts to say that...

> Playing sports where height is an asset

She loves volleyball, and is really good at it. She also recently discovered long distance running. She went for a run with some girls from the track team and she said the 3 mile run was "easy...I don't know why they were so tired." That kind of thing gives her a lot of confidence, I can see it in her face. I just need to get her to connect the height to that.

>Your daughter should not be forced to buy men's shoes. 

Hell, no. She buys the shoes she wants. (within reason....)

I'll check out /r/tall. Thanks!
