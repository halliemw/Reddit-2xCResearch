My friend got pregnant at 16 and waited until she was too far along for an abortion to tell her mom. 

She decided on an open adoption and she sees her daughter regularly and loves the adoptive parents. She chose them. She got to look at their jobs, how much money they had, and got to interview them. She is happy with her decision.
