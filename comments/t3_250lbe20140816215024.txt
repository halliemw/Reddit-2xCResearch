I have no recommendations.  I am just writing to tell you I feel your pain.  I hate my hair.  It's straight,  thin,  fine,  and has started breaking like crazy (I don't highlight it). I have been growing it long and therefore have been putting it up more.  I guess it's breaking from that. Sucks!  

Curling it is pointless.  Blow drying it doesn't really make a difference.  I use conditioner to help make it look smooth because it looks dingy and lifeless.  Oh,  and it gets greasy super quick! 

People always think they know how to do my hair.  But I've tried everything.  My husband says I don't use enough product.  All it does is weigh it down. 

I'm anxiously awaiting for fashion to go toward head shaving for women.
