Tuesday. A guy friend and I were talking about dating and he said I was "such a catch" and when I rebuffed, he said:

"I'M SERIOUS! You're smart and nice, you're an educated thinker, and you're gorgeous!"

I don't get compliments like that very often. It made me feel really special and tingly. I also turned red.
