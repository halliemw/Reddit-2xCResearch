I see your line of reasoning; however, I really really dislike the white lie approach for a few different reasons. First, those sort of justifications are really common rhetoric for individuals with eating disorders (I feel like I've said literally the EXACT thing you give as an example many times before when I was younger and dealing with anorexia.) This could have the effect of either her family either starting to read into it and taking it as proof that she IS eating disordered, when she actually isn't. It also isn't psychologically a good place to put OP in, a hiding mentality is a bad thing to start associating with your diet.

Additionally, I think in most cases lying just makes a problem worse. Obviously, there are exceptions when the truth could put your in harms way, etc, but just to "make things easier" generally doesn't actually make things easier in the long run. Dealing with the problem head on may be difficult, but is so much nicer for your long term psyche.
