It's definitely possible. It may be overwhelming, but it's possible. You just have to remember that you don't have to be like anyone else. Your body is yours, and you can love it pre-baby, pregnancy, and post-baby.  If you love your child already, then anything's possible. You have 9 months to sort everything out. most schools have a maternity leave sort of thing, and you can work on figuring out budgeting, what you'll need for the baby and talking to your parents about it. 

Talk to him about it too. If he's not supportive, then well, fuck him. Just make it clear to him that you have no intention of getting an abortion. After that, it's up to him to decide what he wants to do. You can go after him for child support, and if you're planning to get government assistance, you will probably HAVE to. 

Last, see if there are some mommy-to-be support groups in your area and visit /r/parenting and some of the related subs in the sidebar, like /r/babybumps. They can give you much more advice than I can for this situation. 

You. Can. Do. This.
