Ok first off, as a former 13 year old girl, you can tell her that being bullied is a good thing.  If she's not 200 pounds, or has acne, or is poor and wears clothes from Goodwill, then the most likely source of bullying is the fact that girls are jealous of her.  Three points:

1.  As girls go through puberty their bodies change.  Their interests change along with their bodies.  Her two "best friends" could be more into boys, or doing 'grown up' things, while your sister hasn't changed.  I remember in 6th grade my two best friends 'broke up' with me, because they wanted to talk to boys, and I was just hanging out reading Little House on the Prarie.  There was a disconnect. 

2. Girls making fun of you is a good thing!  Girls in high school used to make fun of me because I had a really light period.  Yes, my period lasted about 4 hours and then it was over.  They'd call me 'lesbian' and 'dyke' and say that I was faking it.  You know what? Forget those bitches, guess who didn't have PMS, cramps, bloating-- this girl! It still made me sad, but once I got older I realized how ridiculous the bullying was.

3.  My husband's cousin started getting made fun of when she was 14 for having red hair.  They called her Ginger.  This girl had beautiful hair, she looked like Sophie Turner.  Anyway, when they bullied her, she dyed her hair black, transferred schools, ended up with zero self esteem, and was pregnant at 15.  When you succumb to bullying like she did, your life gets messed up.  

Anyway, I'm sorry this is so long.  But tell your sister that it's ok to lose these two girls she thinks of as friends, and also that it's normal for girls to do this especially around her age.  And that she needs to ignore those girls at school.  But the most important thing is that she needs to not let the bullying bother her, because it probably is a good thing she's being bullied.
