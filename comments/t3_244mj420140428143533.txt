Children only have two parents because they are formed from an egg and a sperm, three if you count the rare case of mitochondria donors. Just because a women gestated a child does not make her a mother, nor does raising a child make you a parent.

You may want to hear the opinions of children created from IVF and not just their parents. From http://anonymousus.org/stories/#.U15yIhB5mK1

> I have my reasons for never wanting to know my father. Anyone who willingly degrades women to sexual objectification in pornography, willingly disowns the children he doesn't personally want, willingly impregnates multiple strangers, has these people raise his biological children, and never once in his life checks in to see if his kids are healthy, happy, alive, is not worth my time looking for. This person is the most atrocious and loathing human male on the planet, and the issue is that he thinks he has just done a service to humanity. We have enough men who abandon and disown their children, it's called 'deadbeat fatherhood'. Just because you were paid doesn't mean you're a hero. You're still a monster. 

> If you think I should be praising these reproductive technologies for giving me life, you're not in your right mind. With that understanding, I should be down at the feet of my mother's rapist, if my mother had been rapped by my father, praising him for raping my mother, thus giving me life. It simply doesn't work the way people think.
