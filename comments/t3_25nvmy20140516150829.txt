You are correct about the military, however in New Jersey you can still be intoxicated and consent, you have to be intoxicated and are

>"manifestly unable or known by the actor to be unable to make a 
reasonable judgment as to the nature of harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute an offense"

There is in fact a scale, you do not need to be sober to consent.  However you can not consent if you are falling down drunk.   A jury would probably make the determination.

This is actual similar wording in just about every jurisdiction.   To my knowledge no state statute in the US has a not one drink policy on consent to sex such as the UCMJ has.
