Agree with the others who say PCOS.  You should really get this confirmed with your gynecologist as insulin resistance is common with this, and may be playing a significant role in your obesity, so this affects your overall health too.  You may need to start on a medication like metformin (if you are in the US, this is a common med on the $4 list several major pharmacies offer) which helps with your sugars and also helps your fertility.  PCOS can really prolong the time it takes to get pregnant so this is another reason to get this looked into now.  It would also be a good idea to start on a diabetic diet.  Good luck!
