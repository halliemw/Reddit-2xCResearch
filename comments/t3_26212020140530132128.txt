Comments that start with "as a man" often fall into one of two categories

>1) "As a man, I really like peanut butter sandwiches"

If your gender isn't relevant to your statement, we don't need to know whether you're male, female, genderqueer, agender or a space alien.

This is a forum for women's thoughts and experiences.  Our users don't post here to get perspectives on what men find sexually attractive or socially appropriate - there are many other subreddits for that.  

Of course, there are some circustances where pointing out your gender might be relevant, but before posting a comment/post that starts with "as a man" think carefully about whether it is a)relevant to the rest of the statement and b) relevant to the subreddit.
