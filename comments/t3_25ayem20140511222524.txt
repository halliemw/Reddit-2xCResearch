This is not true.

Yes, there are mechanical problems such as trisomy 21 in which the developmental process of a fetus is disrupted resulting in serious (often lethal) conditions to a newborn baby. The risk for such problems increases with the age of the mother.

But as long as the developmental process is not disrupted, the baby will be normal.
