I'm 5'9" and can easily flat-foot the 500 with legs bent. It definitely is a lunkier bike (made up that word), not as nimble as a 250, but overall not bad. 

That being said, you could probably find a used cbr250 from 2011 for around $3000. It's fuel-injected whereas the Ninja was carbed up until last year I think.
