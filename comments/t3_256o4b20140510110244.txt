I know it's anecdotal evidence, but I will offer this anyway:

I have an IUD, I have never been pregnant and I have had no problems. My Gynecologist had no problem with me getting one, only mentioning that it might hurt a little more to have inserted because I've never given birth. I think you should look for a new doctor and make it clear to the old doctor why you are leaving.
