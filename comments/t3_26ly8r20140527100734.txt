Its absolutely horrible that you have been pushed to the point where you need to be prepared for this type of situation. That being said its absolutely great that you were prepared and able to not only fend off a threat but contact the appropriate authorities and stop this person from doing this to someone else. 

This type of experience is extremely traumatic and it might be a good idea to seek professional help in dealing with an event like this. I'm sorry this happened to you but am very proud of what you did and hope in a similar situation I have the same strength you did. I wish you the best and hope you never have to deal with a situation like this again.
