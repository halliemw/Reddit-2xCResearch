Me and my wife have a great system worked out but it doesn't apply to every relationship. She does what she is good at, I do what I am good at. Some months I do a lot more of the work around the house, other months she does a lot more of the work and I do very little. Neither of us keep track because love isn't about that.

Ex: We each take care of our own breakfast and lunches. I make dinners she cleans the dishes. She gets the food at the store and I make whatever I can with it.

For cleaning she takes care of most of the inside of the house and I take care of the outside. I take out the trash, mow the lawn, wash the deck, etc. She cleans the windows, toilets, floors, etc.

The most important thing is that we don't judge each others work or timelines. I have neglected cleaning the garage for a month now but she doesn't bug me about it. I noticed that she has forgotten to clean one of the toilets for awhile now and I don't bug her about it.

If I feel there is something that needs to be done inside the house before she gets to it I will do it myself because it is MY problem, not hers. I was in charge of the laundry for the last 2 years but a few months ago she randomly started doing it one day before I usually do it. I have no clue why but she is. If next week she doesn't want to do it for some reason I will end up doing it on the day of the week that I have always done it.

The key is that we don't keep track of time. We do these things for each other because we love each other. It doesn't have to be 50/50 and we don't care that it isn't.
