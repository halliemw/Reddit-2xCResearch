Worst hair removal?  Sit down ladies, I have a story to tell.

So, I am a trans woman.  Overall in the genetic hair dept,  I didn't end up too badly.  My face and neck were cleared with 6 or so sessions of laser hair removal, which isn't bad at all.  Like a rubber band snap.  My arms and legs reverted to a very standard female level of hair with hormones.  So what was bad?

Before Gender Realignment Surgery, I needed some hair cleared on my parts, as some of the skin would be reused for my new vagina.  For permanent hair removal, there's really no substitute for electrolysis.  That is, sticking a tiny needle into each hair follicle and frying it with heat and electricity.   Each one.  On my bits.  That, pre-surgery, gave me a ton of anxiety to acknowledge. 

Fortunately my place offered local anesthesia, so most of the time, I didn't feel the electrolysis after the numbing injections.  But they'd be bruised for days afterwards.  That's my worst hair removal story.
