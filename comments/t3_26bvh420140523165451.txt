As a grad student in mechanical engineering, I definitely feel your pain. My program is way ahead of the field by having a whopping 20% female admissions rate. The best way that I have found to combat the casual sexism that pops up is to simply stop the conversation and ask why they would say something like that and if they realize how derogatory their statement was. Sometimes they laugh and start in on how women are too sensitive, but usually they apologize because it's such an ingrained habit that they honestly don't even realize that they're doing it.
