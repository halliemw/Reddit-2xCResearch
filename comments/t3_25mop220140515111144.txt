I, too, think it sounds like depression. I have chronic depression myself, and one thing that most depressed people struggle with is the idea that it's a personal flaw, or a weakness. It's not; it's a disease like any other, and needs to be managed and treated. 

If he's against therapy (I know that I haven't had the best experience with it either, and have been hesitant to try), see about getting him to a GP/family doctor about some antidepressants. They can give you the "leg up" you need to get back on track.

Also, there's a huge amount of research going on lately with mindfulness meditation and depression (and other mental health disorders). I've tried some, as well as some yoga, and boy-howdy, that shit works. I don't understand it, but spending a couple of minutes a day just focusing on your breathing does something to make your brain work better. It's weird. I've found lots of help on wildmind.org, but there are also some guided meditations and yoga programs for free on doyogawithme.com. Oh, and there's an awesome little guided meditation app that I use called "Calm." Even five minutes a day can help a lot.

Good luck, sister. Thanks for taking care of your man. Being the partner of a depressed person can be really difficult too, but remember that it's worse for him, and that you're probably the best thing in his life. <3
