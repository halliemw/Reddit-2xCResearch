I guess I'm confused that you don't want to burden your SO - but would be willing to present him with a legal obligation? It sounds like the law doesn't support this - but a certain amount of human decency in a relationship would lead me to expect some support in this from a partner. Have you talked to him about how difficult this will be to take on all by yourself, with time off and limited income? Ask if he is able to support or help you during this time? I mean, someone who will just sit back while you're bankrupting yourself AND managing physical/emotional recovery is probably not a good long term partner. In which case - family support maybe?
