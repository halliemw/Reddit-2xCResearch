There's a reason why the Manga section of my local bookstore grows every year.  Compared to mainstream US comics, there are a lot more different types of stories to tell besides super-powered spandex-clad models punching each other.  I used to get mad, but now that there are plenty of alternatives I can just vote with my wallet.  If the comics industry keeps on doing what they're doing, we can see how well it works out for them.
