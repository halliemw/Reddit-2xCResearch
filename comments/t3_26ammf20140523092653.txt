I think it depends on his degree of impairment, but from my experiences with special needs folks... he is mostly responsible for his actions. I worked at a group home and overall, people knew when they were being appropriate and when they were out of line, sexually. There was one 18 year old girl who was very flirtatious and possibly promiscuous when off campus, but she never crossed any lines like that.
