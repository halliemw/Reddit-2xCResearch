The problem here isn't PMS, the problem is him. It's not acceptable adult communication to give someone this kind of treatment.

Let's write this out clearly: he's punishing you *for making a mistake and tearing up because you already felt shitty* by refusing to acknowledge you and pretending he doesn't understand why his treatment is hurtful. He withholds affection, empathy and common decency towards you. He literally moves from room to room, floor to floor, to escape you. He won't even reply when you say goodbye to him, won't sit near you, refuses to in any way convey anything. And this is apparently a regular thing with him - checking out of your relationship whenever something happens that he doesn't super duper like. Then when he's punished you for "creating drama" (ie having an emotion he doesn't like) to a degree he finds satisfactory he'll decide that you're an adult couple again I'm guessing? So where exactly do you factor into all this for him, other than as a convenient partner who will be right where he left you?

That's not a healthy person to be with. :( Frankly the way he's treating you with the leaving any room/floor you're on, not caring, not showing emotion when he most mercifully decides you deserve an entire "hey" - *that's how you treat someone* **you don't like**. That's not how you treat your *partner* because she made a *mistake* with your car or, god forbid, cried from feeling shitty. 

There's nothing wrong with alone time, it's important in all relationships, but this *obviously* goes beyond that.

>So here I am typing up this wall of text to you lovely ladies of 2X with tears in my eyes, wondering if my PMS is getting the better of me or if there's some sort of foundation to my waterworks. I'd post this in /r/relationships but they don't understand PMS and I need this viewed through that lens.

Your feelings are valid, PMS or not.
