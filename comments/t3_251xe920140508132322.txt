He should know that counseling will *help* with that if that's an issue you do have. Most people can't just magically will themselves to have better communication skills or anger control.

Go for yourself before trying to get him to go himself or with you. Forcing him to go will most likely just make him resent it, and he won't be willing to open up like he needs to--and you'd probably just end up having a fight over it.
