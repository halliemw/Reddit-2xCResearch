> Wearing hijab these women were allowed to leave the houses they used to be confined to. With hijab they can go to school, university and have a job. They can even work in mixed sexes environments.

The fact that they need to wear a hijab before they're allowed to do these things shows the precise sexism that I'm criticising.


> This is why banning hijab is so potentially destructive. If you are deeply religious muslim you consider the hijab a commandment, being forcefully forbidden to wear one would limit these women to indoor stay.

And what is the reasoning for this commandment? So as not to cause men impure thoughts and harass them, correct? Women should not have a responsibility to cover up so that they are not harassed. The responsibility for changing behaviour lies with the men harassing them.
