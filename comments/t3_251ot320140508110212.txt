I think that movie Katniss becomes flattened though. She is coded extremely male compared to her lovely mosaic of traits that are both masculine and feminine from the novels.

SPOILERS: I also think that the inclusion of Prim, a very strong nurturing character, and the eventual rejection of Gale and his "aggressive" traits is an excellent balance. Peeta as damsel in distress is also a nice touch.
