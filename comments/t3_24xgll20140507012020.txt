You'll be fine. I'm fine. I've had it for two years. There are a lot of women who have had it for longer, and we are all still here, still standing, still loving, still loved.

The standard STD test does not test for herpes. Keep that in mind, a lot of people are misinformed about that and falsely believe they're STD free.

There's a great support community over [here](http://earthwindandherpes.tumblr.com/) if you need it. Another thing I found helpful was [an essay](http://thehairpin.com/2012/04/the-perks-of-herpes) on the perks of herpes. Lastly, if you're in need of facts, the blog I linked and my post history should contain lots of knowledge.

We're here for you!
