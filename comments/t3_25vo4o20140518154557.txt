Honestly, if I feel I need to post something a little more privately, /r/thegirlsurvivalguide is a great place. Some of the same issues are addressed there, plus a little overflow from skincare, makeup, sex, and nail polish subs. Among other things.  It's basically my favorite sub and I'd totally recommend it to anyone who knows a girl.
