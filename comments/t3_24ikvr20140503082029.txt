all of these "hormonal" products (pills, patches, rings, iuds, and injections) are actually made with hormone-analogues. This means that the chemicals are different than the hormones that the body makes for itself. I suggest looking into natural hormones, which are identical to what the body makes for itself. 

Most women's hormone problems are caused by too much estrogen and not enough Progesterone. Fake-progesterone (such as used in the pill) tricks the body into making less genuine progesterone for itself.
