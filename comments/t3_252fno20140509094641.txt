I don't know, I rarely hear the term used, and when it is, it's fairly appropriately. It's not something lightly thrown around, and when it IS used, it's often after the woman has tried to discuss the topic at hand with the man bu he keeps interrupting her, speaking over her, speaking DOWN to her, trying to take on an air of authority, etc. to the point where finally the term "mansplaining" is tossed out after clear attempts at 2 way discussion have been attempted.

Online it can be thrown out a little more quickly, but that's the nature of online discussions where you can type out paragraphs and paragraphs of words, and there's less social pressure to put in excess effort to try and salvage a conversation. 

It's easy to avoid being called out for mansplaining. (1) Don't assume women know less than you about a topic because she's a woman or may not "look the part". (2) Don't speak over her when she is attempting to have a 2 way discussion with you, it's condescending and rude and is a show of power. (3) Acknowledge what she's saying instead of looking for your next opening to jump in. (4) If she's talking about a personal experience, such as being harassed at a bar, she cannot be "wrong" nor does she have to provide "proof" that the guy wasn't actually being really cool for her statements to be considered valid. 

Follow that. like most decently socialized people in this world do, and you'll be good. Like I said, "mansplaining" isn't tossed around often, because it seriously (as in, outside of blatant trolls) doesn't happen all that often in the real world (here in twoX, it can happen a bit more than I'd like it to, but it's often quickly handled). It's just really annoying when it does.
