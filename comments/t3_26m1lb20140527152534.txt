That's a good point. I did like how he said that as a man, we would never know what it's like to live as a woman. Obviously, women know not all men are rapists...but this is the real world we're talking about and you need to be street smart. I tell all my female friends to carry mace and I hope that none of them will ever have to use it. There will always be predators and to think that women shouldn't be wary is naive.
