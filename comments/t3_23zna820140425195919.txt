Actually this is pretty sad.

What it could show is that [women drop out unless they're perfect](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-confidence-gap/359815/). Basically, there was a self-selection at entry into the program. The only girls who enrolled were the ones who were sure that they were going to pass, and girls need higher competence to feel confident whereas boys just try and expect that they can do it.

In fact, in university as well as the professional world, fake it till you make it and "good enough" work a lot of the time.
