I have no idea why you sent me this comment of what hymens look like.  It has nothing to do with my original comment that hymens don't break, and OP clearly doesn't have a completely sealed over vagina or she never would have been able to start menstruation. Any other form of a hymen just needs to be stretched, not broken, which is what my comment said.
