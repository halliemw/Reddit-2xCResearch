Then people should say that instead of pretending that telling the truth is good for her marriage. Her marriage will be over if he finds out. You simply don't stay with your spouse if you think she has murdered your child. There is probably going to be a messy custody battle(he will consider her a bad influence on the kids after all) and she should definitely talk to a lawyer and develop and exit plan before revealing this to him. In return, she will be respecting his free will by giving him the truth and she won't have to carry around the lie for her whole life.

Its up to the OP and what she thinks is important, but we should accurately lay out the consequences for her.
