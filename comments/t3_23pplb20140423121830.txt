I have to disagree with portions of what you said. It's true, there's never been a complete episode devoted to her changing her appearance, but I believe it's brought up that her weight is a defining part of her personality.

Hannah's character is unarguably insecure, and she specifically tells Marnie that shes overweight and it has ruined her whole life/is ruining her life. That's.... a big deal. 
When we are introduced to Hannah, she gets weighed by a doctor, Adam pinches her fat (and CALLS her fat), and there IS an episode where Adam takes her running in an effort to lose weight. What I'm saying is that Hannah's weight is one of the ways her character is defined (her sloppiness, her insecurity, her awkwardness, her lack of social cues). Even the way she dresses seems to highlight her body -- her wardrobe is specifically revolved around making her seem bigger and unflattering. 

That being said, I don't disagree about her being a body positive icon. I think Lena Dunham's use of her body is superb and admirable, but I think it is incorrect to say that Hannah, as a character, is not defined by her weight because she definitely is.
