Haha yes! Like you're heavily judging them. I don't go to bars by myself either, for the same reason. It scares the shit out of me when I'm touched by a stranger without warning. It happens on the bus a lot too. It's really shitty that so many people feel entitled to our bodies :(

So far the judging face has worked. I hope it does for you :)
