You be you. But I would hope you wouldn't actually be mad at someone who came to you with important information for your own physical safety as far as they know for being 'judgmental' when they had your safety at heart. Even if their concern was wrongly based, it's not an insult against open relationships to think the partner should know what's going on.If anything, it's confirming what the situation is.
