Knife under the pillow. It's my go to for staying safe in the neighborhood i'm in. I sleep in an RV behind the house and although the door is locked, the fact is that i'm seperated from the house and everybody in it. Thus, the tiny 2 inch knife I keep on the night stand next to me. I practice grabbing it from multiple sleeping positions and every night I touch it just so I know where it is. I also take it with me when I go camping and put it in my pillow case. 

Get one and keep it handy.
