I'm petite and working in an almost entirely male industry. I work a blue collar dirty job and while most if my coworkers respect me, I run into issues a lot. It is hard for (some) older men to take direction from women. Now that woman is a foot shorter and 30 years younger but with twice the experience. It scares them. 

Other than that, uniforms suck. Yes, they can be hemmed short but the waist doesn't sit right. I have to have boots made in my size, and if they don't have equipment for me, I can't do the task. It gets frustrating. Like they never had a 5' tall man work anywhere? Ever?!
