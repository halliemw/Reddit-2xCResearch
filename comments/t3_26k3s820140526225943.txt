I'd like to add my voice to the "Hate TRP" chorus. They're idiots, what can I say.

> guys who totally have their head on straight and are kind and compassionate, are more likely to ignore TRP than to outright condemn it. 

It's not a defense, but please realize that it is very difficult to understand, in any useful way, another person's experiences, especially when they are a different sex than you (or from another gender, culture, race, class, et cetera). I logically understand what you say when you say you are sexualized all the time, but I don't get it. Likely never will. Much in the same way that, if I tell you about my trip to Cambodia, you will understand but not really *get* what it's like over there. It's a limit of human communication.

I'm not trying to excuse anything, this is more a comment on the debate in general, but when that otherwise great person in your life doesn't react the same way as you do to a terrible encounter you've had, it's because they don't understand.

It get that it's tiring to rehash the same arguments with everyone you meet but, unfortunately, that's the only way useful way to solve the problem.
