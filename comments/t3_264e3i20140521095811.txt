Go see the gynaecologist, he or she is the only one who can help you answer these questions. 

The technician very well could have had a bad day when he couldn't see your left ovary. I would ask the gyno to have a search for it, again. 

Probably you'll also need some blood tests to see what your hormones are doing. 

Good luck, and don't blame yourself too much for it. Telling yourself that it's your fault (and that you're stupid and bad and will never improve yadda yadaa) is not going to help . Big hug.
