>For example, if someone is discussing the fact that men take less responsibility for caregiving of the elderly, saying that some men do holds the same weight as anecdotal evidence and paints the feminist as the bigot.

Okay, but if I say women take more responsibility for childcare I feel like a ton of feminists will be piping up to say "not all women even have or want kids!" Why is that response valid but not the male equivalent? Shouldn't we just try to be conscious of avoiding generalizations of this nature? To me that's kind of what feminism is all about...
