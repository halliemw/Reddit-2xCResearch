I discovered masturbating at 12ish and until I looked in the mirror, I was hella embarssed. Then I discovered the showerhead in my bathroom! So I suggest that for now.

If you like the feeling of fullness, I like glass toys. [edenfantasys](http://www.edenfantasys.com/) is fantastic and personally my favorite site. Visually its appealing, its gender friendly, and the sales are a+ fantastic. If fullness is your thing I like [this](http://www.edenfantasys.com/dildos/glass-steel-ceramic-sex-toys/royal-adventure) because its a good size and I like the texture. Glass toys aren't super expensive and are easy to clean. They also sell cheap lil bullet vibes to play around with it. Actually, if you bought the glass dildo you can add one of [those little vibrators](http://www.edenfantasys.com/presents/free-gifts) for free with your order :) 

Now that I'm 19 I have.. um. A lot. Nearly everything bought from Eden haha. Right now my personal favorite is [the g4 funfactory tiger that the bf spoilded me with](http://www.edenfantasys.com/vibrators/rabbit-vibrators/g4-vibes-tiger), and nowadays my goto. I also have [ a feeldoe which is actually kinda fun on its own](http://www.edenfantasys.com/dildos/double-ended-dildos/share). I had [this lil number](http://www.edenfantasys.com/vibrators/bullet-egg-vibrators/bound-by-diamonds-diamond-teaser) but because it was kinda cheap, it fell apart after a year of vigorous use. 

But yeah I;m a huge advocate for toys.
