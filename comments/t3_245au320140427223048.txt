I recently lost my virginity to my boyfriend and the first 5 times were painful for me even though I was extremely wet and I wanted it. We found out it was because he didn't finger me before penetration and now, I make sure he fingers me before PIV. 

Before the fingering, my boyfriend and I would always talk about why the sex was lackluster after that and he joked that I was a dead fish. I got so offended but he said he was joking; maybe this is the case with your guy as well?
