It was coined by a woman who was at a party and a man was talking over her about a book he liked. She was trying to argue that he was factually wrong about it but he kept dismissing her... not aware that she was actually its author. 

She wrote an article about the experience, I believe it's online somewhere.

Now it's used as a catch-all term for men insisting they know more about women's issues/lives/experiences than the women themselves do.
