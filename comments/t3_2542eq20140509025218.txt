You are not being selfish. You are not a therapist, nor are you educationally equipped to be one. I learned this after years and years -via a therapist. My father used to say if he was ever in a wheelchair or disabled, he'd kill himself and he used his own suicidal mania against both his wives. It set the stage for my own patterns of behavior (trying to save others) as an adult.

My niece had a shicide attempt in my home. I found her (she's ok now;) then a partner had an attempt and I rushed over (he's ok now -still an asshole, but alive;) then a best friend (I drove her to the ER while she called me every name;) then another partner -see a pattern? 

Over two years of therapy later and I now know I was trying to control as an adult what I could not as a kid in an alcoholic environment. I gravitated toward people I had hope of saving and became so embroiled in their experiences, there was no room for my own. It's exhausting and overwhelming.

The best thing my therapist taught me was to not reinforce the behaviors. If someone is suicidal, you call 911 -that is the rule. You are/I am not professionally equipped to handle the situation -be as therapist or first responder. 

Your plate is full. School is a full-time job and life. When people draw you into their pain, there is nothing wrong with saying, "This really upsets me to hear how painful this is to you; can I help you make an appointment with a counselor/crisis center/therapist/group support, so that you can receive appropriate care and treatment?" 

That is your only requirement of compassion. It is not your requirement to be someone else's emotional tampon. The toll is too high.
