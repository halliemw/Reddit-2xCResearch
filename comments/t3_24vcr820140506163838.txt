I'm 5'2", and although i get annoyed with the whole gaining a bit of weight (since there is NO WHERE for it to go!!!) i enjoy being underestimated (though being passed up for work due to this is beyond silly and have never experienced such things ---i'm sorry you have) I think being underestimated sometimes is a strength in disguise. 

I practice excellent posture, i try to pretend im looking down to people rather than up at them (i NEVER wear heels either, i just... eh.. can't be bothered) i focus on speaking with a loud, low and commanding voice

I used to serve for a while, between jobs, and people thought i was in school, i'd just laugh and go 'honey, i've been out of school for the last 7 years' I don't take it personally and get huffy, their intentions are not to hurt you

I know it's annoying for people to say 'don't let it get to you' but what else can you do (other than scolding those who do things like what you've listed) is it really worth it? You know who you are.

As for clothes, i am freepeople obsessed and love oversized tops and tunics with tight pants, or leggings.

in the summer i LOVE wearing short skirts, dresses and shorts (when you're this short, you never look skanky!) with boots and such

my fav places to buy stuff would be freepeople and forever21, and learn how to hem. american eagle have shorter lengths in jeans, so thats where i go for those!
