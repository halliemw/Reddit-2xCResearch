You keep saying that word "sensationalised". I do not think it means what you think it means.

We are not sensationalising more than we are being completely fucking outraged at an objectively disgusting victimisation of a 15-year-old, ill girl in the care of others.

If she were able to handle decision-making, walk around, go to work, fuck her boyfriend, then she wouldn't be in THE ICU OF A HOSPITAL.
