If you did criminal level stuff you **should** have gotten charges for it. Why are you trying to normalize abusive behavior because "hehe i did it too and I am a girl". So no, no cutely winkey smile from me. 

The first time you noticed you behave erratically while drunk you should have made a decision never to get black out drunk again. By far most people I know, know to drunk and either behave themselves or to stop drinking at a point. 

OP does 't owe the guy shit. If he got so drunk he was acting out of character it was still him doing it. Being sober and surprised at what he did doesn't change the situation at all. And again, notice how you were so drunk and all over this guy that the entire party noticed that. Drunk people are not stealthy. The creep in the OP managed to fondle a moving person while moving in a group without letting anyone notice for three blocks AND without even saying anything? Yeah, my money is on deliberate.
