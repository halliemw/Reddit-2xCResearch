LOL @ pretty damn magical. They sold me that shit about a "birth experience", too. I had a 2 page birth plan and everything. In the end, I was in labor for 34 hours until it was a c section or epidural... I got the epidural and my ob stuck her arms in my vagina up to get elbows and manually delivered my fuckin kid. Bad ass
