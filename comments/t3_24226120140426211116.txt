I suffered from depression and still get mild anxiety. But you know, people ultimately have to make the effort on their own to help themselves. You can lead him to the water but you can't make him drink. I'd feel bad for him, but he's not trying. And he's just using you as some kind of emotional foil even though it's dragging you down. 

These are his problems not yours. And while I hate saying it, as long as he refuses to let you in on what's wrong it's not going to change. Sounds like your relationship might be coming to an end.
