I think that if someone is overweight they have a significantly higher likelihood of being called fat growing up. In this case, calling someone fat doesn't help and probably makes it harder for them lose weight, but it doesn't make them overweight in the first place. I think the article is confusing two concepts, initial conditions (being overweight or heavy) and issues compounding the result of initial conditions (making it harder to lose weight/encouraging unhealthy life choices which result in obesity by demoralizing overweight children). They're both bad, but not the same thing.
