I think graduating high school after you've had a child is an accomplishment worth celebrating. Not all teens manage to do it.  

There was a study not that long ago that shows like 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom were actually helping to [reduce teen pregnancy rates](http://www.healthline.com/health-news/children-do-teen-mom-reality-shows-decrease-teen-pregnancy-011614). Maybe this spread will serve as a cautionary tale for some.  

Also, I'd be real interested to know how many of the parents who are 'outraged' over the spread are also adamantly opposed to comprehensive sex education and access to birth control...
