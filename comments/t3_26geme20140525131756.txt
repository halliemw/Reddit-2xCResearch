>I'd say it is perfectly OK to comment anyone on their weight. It seems very weird to me, that you describe something so mundane and natural as "weird and gross". Why should it especially not be OK to comment on a woman's weight? That is, if I'm not misunderstanding you and by "comment" mean hurtful/mean commenting. That of course simply shouldn't be.

A lot of people are sensitive about their weight for a variety of reasons- loads of women in particular think they're too fat, some think they're too thin, actually relatively few women are just thrilled to death with how their weight is right now. By mentioning someone's weight, in either direction, your odds are very good that you will upset them. Upsetting people is rude! So commenting on someone's weight is rude. That's about the logic of it. 

Kinda like how it would be rude to go up to someone with no hair and comment about how bald they are. Like, for all you know, they have cancer, or something! The polite thing is to not bring it up unless they do.
