It seemed to be more than just me being a little hazy to be honest, he compared how I was acting to someone being drunk/on drugs, and even afterwards referred to it as "that time you essentially got high on sleeping pills".  I was behaving quite far from what is normal for me.  He is also well-educated regarding consent, and understands that someone's capacity to consent can be impaired by substance use, although it's not very black and white.

When he talked about touching me, it was quite clear that he was doing so because it was making me say crazier and crazier things, and he got amusement out of that.  I feel that in itself crossed the line.

I don't think there was malicious intent on his part, but I definitely feel like he took advantage of my altered state of mind.  I think it was most likely a misjudgement more than anything.  The last thing I want to do is make him feel punished.  I'd like to be able to put this to rest and have it stop bothering me.  If I do talk to him about it, it wouldn't be for any reason other than to get more context about that night so I can have peace of mind.
