I am mostly our cooker, too, but my male SO still enjoys a fancy home-made meal. I don't know about you, but I don't typically make anything difficult or extravagant on a regular basis! You could try making a few courses, or picking something that's a little complicated, focusing on food he enjoys. Dim the lighting, get some candles, and eat by candle-light. It sounds silly, but my SO (who really isn't the romantic type) really enjoys when I do this. 

We are also both broke students, and as a nice in-between, we have gotten dressed up and gone somewhere fancy just for a drink, and then returned home to eat dinner. It makes the night feel special but doesn't break the bank.

I also make cards for him on special occasions. They're nothing fancy, and usually involve silly little drawings and confessions of my love, but he loves them. He's saved them all in a folder somewhere and we occasionally go through them again and reminisce about where we were in our relationship/lives when I gave him different cards.
