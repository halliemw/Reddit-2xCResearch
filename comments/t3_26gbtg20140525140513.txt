Why do you continue to hang out with this guy? You don't want to engage with him in a physical manner, you express it to him over and over, he wears you down, then you feel awful afterwards. 

So why associate with him at all? It's scummy to have to badger a sexual partner over and over. They are obviously not into it. I get why he does it, he wants to get laid.

What I don't get is why you go back to him. Is he a great guy outside of this, or are you just in a bad rut emotionally where he is familiar?
