I actually feel like there's an opposite reaction. Maybe it's just the sites I go to, but when Blurred Lines came out, people didn't call the girls in the video empowered, they said it was sexist and they were being used as props. With Miley, people seemed to support her right to do what she wants with her body in her own video and break away from the Disney Channel image. Not saying either of those are my opinions but those are the general attitudes I remember.
