Most of this I can agree with but some of your points are off, in my opinion.  

>Saying things like "I couldn't date a woman who doesn't shave." or "Women shouldn't dye their hair, natural looks better." or "She should smile more." These phrases are all about taking away a woman's right to manage her own body, even if the men don't think of it that way.


A woman of course has the right to her own body and do whatever she wants with it.  But at the same time, I as a person have formed my own opinions on what I find attractive. I have the right to decide if the changes a woman makes to her body changes the way I think about her.  Obviously the reverse is true as well.  I doubt my SO would like it if I grew out a joe dirt mullet.   

Another example is with gauges,piercings,tattoos.  I do not find them appealing and so I wouldn't think of dating a woman who had an abundance of these.  We all have personal preferences about what we like in a partner.  

>Discussing women's looks, pretty much ever. Sometimes it can sound like butchers sizing up a cut of meat.

This, honestly, is just bullshit.  I'll give you that the language some people use is crass and definitely shouldn't be said, but if you truly think that me saying to my friend "That woman with the red purse has really nice legs." Is attributing to the downfall of society, then nothing anybody says is going to help anybody on this sub.  I mean, you might as well say that I shouldn't be having thoughts about anybody whatsoever.  Now saying "wow I'd love for that chick with the red purse to wrap her thighs around my face."  Yeah, don't do that. I think as long as the comments are respectful and private amongst themselves it's totally fine.
