Can the "but it's not all bad" argument really be used to mitigate a human rights movement attempting to protect those of the most vulnerable in the world? As an analogy, I'm in physical therapy and the therapist always requests me to describe the pain at it's worst, with the understanding that it's not always that bad and that it comes and goes, but by recognizing and recording it at its worst they can address the core of the problem and heal it from the ground up. Understanding and expressing the problem at its worst is fundamental to making sure that the worst is no longer someone's reality. 

Edit: As a side note, I really appreciate this level of dialogue on the matter and very much appreciate the time you took to get statistics and source it and it reminds me to be more thorough in my own comments in the future.
