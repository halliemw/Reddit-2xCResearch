I'm a pretty socially closed off person myself so I don't have any suggestions for making friends.. but I do have a question.

Have you talked to your BF about the pressure he's putting on you to do this?  Trying to accomplish something that may cause a lot of anxiety definitely doesn't help when you have somebody else you are trying to please.

It would likely be easier if you could just go out and be yourself without worrying about what he's going to think about it.

Perhaps just a gentle reminder that you're aware of the problem and he's not helping when he tells you he thinks you're not trying?

OK, I have one bit of advice on the friends thing, cast a wide net and invest in a lot of different people to start. As you've discovered sometimes the whole friendship thing doesn't work out, so if one or 2 people flake out on you, you'll still have a bunch of other people to try and go further with (and as I read this advise I realize that I in no way could follow it myself cause I would HATE trying to do all of this)
