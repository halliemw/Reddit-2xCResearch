Personally, I couldn't stand the thought of relying on a man (or woman) to make my life better. I like having agency, and I like being able to say that I've worked to make my life every bit as good as it is. I made my life cool, then I found someone to share my cool life with. Figure out what you want to do with your life, what kind of "heroine" you want to be. Give that all you've got, and have a ton of fun doing it.

Plus, think about the princesses. What happens in their Happily Ever After? They just sit around, that's what. Belle got a bigger library, but she's not really going anywhere. Still only one forest away from her town. Tiana's happily ever after was working in a restaurant. It's cool that she got her dream, but it's a pretty mundane thing almost anyone could do. Ariel was the princess of a vibrant underwater kingdom, which I'll bet made more than one lady in here wish she could turn into a mermaid and go visit. She marries Eric, and now she just sits around in a regular old town. Snow White and Aurora ... well they already kind of sat around. Now they sit around wearing nicer dresses, I guess. Happily ever after is lame. In real life, you get to live past the wedding, and go on adventures the rest of your life. 

To say that a relationship is a "hard journey" is just as unrealistic, I feel, as the Happily Ever After is. When you're with someone who you have a lot of compatibility with, it's just not hard. Sure, we have little fights about one of us feeling like it's the other's turn to do the dishes. But we both want the same things out of life, so there's no big dramatic fights over moving to different countries or whether we should have one kid or fifty kids. And that's ignoring the good parts- which are about 90% of the time. I'd take real-life relationship over glossy, superficial Disney one any day.
