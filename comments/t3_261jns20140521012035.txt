Wow, thanks for judging me like this, instead of asking some further info...

The reason I mentioned it, is because when talking about it with other family members, they usually bring this up as a factor that makes it more complicated, so I thought I should mention it because I wanted to start the same conversation with you guys and wanted to give you a broad image.

I also never stood between her and her father and never interfered with their relationship! In fact, I even encouraged more one on one time between them! Don't automatically assume I am the same as your stepmother, you don't know me at all.

And I thought it was clear from my post that I'm asking advice because I want to make this situation optimal FOR THEM. The reason I'm talking about me is because this is mainly my point of view since I'm typing this, and because I just wanted to vent my emotions a bit, I heard you could do that on the internet...
