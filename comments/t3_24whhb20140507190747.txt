I'm not saying his feelings aren't valid, I'm just saying that if she feels she isn't ready for a child and she has made that clear, then the conversation shouldn't really be framed as "IF she gets the abortion" anymore, it should just be an accepted conclusion that she IS getting the abortion and that he is leaving. It's manipulative because he's still playing on her desire to keep him from leaving by putting the discussion in terms of *whether* she's going to have the abortion instead of just acknowledging that the abortion needs to happen regardless of his choice to stay or go.
