Well, the first time around was a lot better than the last two times, it’s odd. He was really gentle/good the first time around and didn’t make me feel bad or anything.  I don’t think he meant to make me feel bad, I think he feels because of the bad sex, we don’t have the chemistry we thought we did, I am being sort of a ‘dead fish’ in bed which makes him feel like I’m not turned on which is obviously then weird for him when he’s trying to have sex with me and I’m just tensed up/not giving anything back. I don’t know what he and I can do to make it feel better. How do I relax? :/
