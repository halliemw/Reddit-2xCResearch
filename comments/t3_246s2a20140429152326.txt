What's the point?  One percentage is greater than the other?  Sure.  I'm arguing that the rape scene did nothing for the characterization because shit before that gave the audience the same impression that the rape scene did.  We can argue arbitrary values of necessity all day, but at the end of the day...it was still unnecessary.
