You know, I never actually met most of his family. I met his uncle and father but never his mother or brother. She doesn't speak English and I don't really speak Spanish, but I was actually learning Spanish so I could surprise him by being able to communicate with his family. It seems like such a waste of time now.

I'm really worried about being able to trust again. I know you said it's easy to trust the right person but that's who I thought he was, especially since we bonded over having exes who cheated on us and how hard it was to trust again. It just adds insult to injury, knowing he said he would never hurt someone he cared about and then wondering what that says about me.

And what you said about being the jealous girlfriend got to me a little. He always made me feel like I was crazy for bringing up anything, to the point where I would feel guilty and apologize. I felt like the psycho jealous girlfriend and was starting to think it was all in my head until it blew up in my face. I'm so afraid of driving someone worthwhile away by being jealous in the future, and that's if I can stomach the idea of being in a relationship again.
