> His face when he gave it to me was the cutest thing. We're long distance, across the atlantic long distance and I had spent 3 months over there and he gave this to me the day before I left. I miss him terribly already and it's only been 4 days :c

I can relate. When my husband and I first met, we were only together (and inseparable) for three months before he went back home, across the Pacific. We spent the first year of our relationship sorting out ways to be together while we were still poor students. We managed to never be apart for more than a few months at a time. We've now been together for 13 years. :)

That's a gorgeous ring!
