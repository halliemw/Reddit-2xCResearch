Speaking as a bisexual person who gets shit on by lesbians and gay people on the regular - some, not all, seem to think they get some sort of 'free pass' for being gay. I don't know where they come up with this shit. Do you know how many times I've heard 'it's just a gay thing' while arguing with someone over their racist or sexist ignorance? I think one of the most well-known of these is when some, not all, gay guys insult or make out that all women are disgusting. 'ewwwwww vagina' and the like. Excuse me? Just because you are not attracted to my gender does not give you the right to insult our biology.Ugh. Sorry for the rant. I have sort-of been in your shoes before only it wasn't my boyfriend that my gay friend decided to kiss, it was my best friend who is in a commited relationship. I hate this stuff
