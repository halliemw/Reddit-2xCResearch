Absolutely. Yet I think it is even more the act of beautification than beauty itself that brings feminine vibes. Personal care, cosmetics and (magic) mirrors are archetypal icons of femininity. I think one can go as far as saying that women are expected to prepare themselves for their own objectification. This is why it's essential that power in terms of subjectivity becomes equally a feminine attribute. Beauty becoming more gender neutral or even masculine will probably not help here as long as "power" is masculine :(.
