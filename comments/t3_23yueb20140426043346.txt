I used to be like that, trying to keep everything inoffensive, but then one of my cousin's unfriended me because he saw I had "liked" a post from a local LGBT organization my friend worked for *because they were trying to raise awareness about a food drive they were doing for homeless people for Christmas* and he also made his wife unfriend me and now they don't talk to me at family gatherings anymore because they don't agree with my personal views and I was like yeah.... I'm just going to post whatever I feel like on Facebook because people are ridiculous.
