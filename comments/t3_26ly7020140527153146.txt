I have an aunt who is schizophrenic and continually stopped taking her meds. Then she'd spend insane amounts of my uncle's money (she doesn't work). By "insane", I'll give you this example: $10K on clothes and perfume. In a day.  
  
Recently, though, her medication was changed to a regular injection (I forget how often, but it's every month or three or somesuch). That way she doesn't have to take a pill daily.
