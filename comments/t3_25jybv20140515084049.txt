Many clinics only do abortions on certain days, i.e. twice a month or only on Wednesdays or whenever they can get the specialist to drop by. So you can have to wait quite a while. What these regulations do is make it ever more likely that a woman will have to wait until she can afford the visit, then wait another 3+ days after the initial visit (potentially having to stay at a hotel if the provider is several hours away), and then get the abortion. During that time, it's quite possible she will pass the point at which abortion is legal, and thus she will have to have the baby. 

It's fairly ridiculous.
