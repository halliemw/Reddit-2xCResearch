I absolutely love Donna Noble.  She's my favorite of all the Doctor Who companions.  She's funny and older and not conventionally tv attractive.  She's brave and has vulnerable moments and that thing she does where her mouth gets all soft when she's sad just makes her beautiful.  Plus, she's not in love with the Doctor.  There's no weird love story or unrequited love, just two people having fun together in time and space.  Until... well, y'know... that thing.
