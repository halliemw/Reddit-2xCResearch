I'd recommend going to your nearest planned parenthood type clinic that offers you up front information without judgement to ask them about abortion options, procedures, etc. 

It may help you decide, either way you choose. And would be good to talk to someone. 

If you weren't open to abortion, you could do some research into adoption as an alternative if you absolutely felt like you should or could not have another child. But carrying it too term might be even harder on you in the long run.

Best of luck!
