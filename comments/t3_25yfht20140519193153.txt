Saints Row 2, 3 & 4. While the game was designed as a male power fantasy, it allows you to play as a female protagonist. This shifts the dynamic somewhat on it's head as you become a woman who leads a gang of misfits and takes over city after city in the most ruthless (and slightly puerile) fashion possible.
