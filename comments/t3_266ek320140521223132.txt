It sounds like it was a mass FB invite and that this guy is really just an acquaintance of yours anyway, not a close friend.  It's a joint party, I'd uninvite him.  Will you be crushed that he isn't there?  He may not even notice that you uninvited him....lots of grad parties this time of year.  I personally would like to attend my own grad party in peace without feeling anxious about the potential appearance of an ex boyfriend that I didn't invite.
