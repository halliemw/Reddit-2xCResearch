Fine, so if I have a shirt that says "I hate really annoying people who are black", is it ok so long as there's a white equivalent shirt? Fangirl is a gendered term, you are correct. But that's the point. If it wasn't a gendered term this wouldn't be sexist. It is saying "I hate this subset of women" or "I hate this subset of fans who are women." Even though there is a male equivalent, it doesn't make this shirt less sexist.
