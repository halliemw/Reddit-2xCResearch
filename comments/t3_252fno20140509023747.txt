We can get your perspectives everywhere else outside of TwoX. We get them all the time when we comment on issues that involve women. 

In here, we'd like a break from that to *actually* get different perspectives without being argued and challenged on every little thing. Not that every man does that, of course. But this is reddit. 

Men  interjecting with their views on women's issues is not dissent. It's the norm.
