So the basic question here, to my mind, is whether actions are evaluated by an absolute standard, or evaluated in context.   

By an absolute standard, this *is* no different from one of your girlfriends doing the same, and you're completely justified in cutting off contact or seeking retribution.  

In context, my experience at parties is that gay guys *do* tend to get a pass on things like this, and are not taught that it is a violation/unacceptable/etc. the same way a straight woman/man would be, and can even expect to be cheered on by the crowd in some groups/situations.  This doesn't mean it's 'ok', but it may mean that you gay friend had different intentions or a different understanding of the situation than a girlfriend would have, and you can decide whether his motives/expectations play any part in how you react to his actions.
