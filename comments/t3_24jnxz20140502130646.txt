Congrats! Personally I think that car is very cute-looking, and I love the color you chose. On a practical level, I think that having a relatively small car that's very square in shape is a really good and useful idea. You're not wasting tons of extra gas like you do with a mid-size or large SUV/truck, but you can transport bicycles, dogs, furniture, etc. in a way that you can't in many other vehicles of similar size but different dimensions.
