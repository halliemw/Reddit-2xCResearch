Rape is also illegal. As is pirating self-defense videos. 

Now... I get bear spray could be illegal, I do... But I personally think it's worth the fine if you get caught with it. 

After all, if you have qualms about bear spray for personal protection, I doubt you'd be doing anything illegal enough to warrant a search for it... 

And iirc, bear spray is pepper spray, but is legal, at least in some areas, because it is to be used to defend yourself from bears while hiking, not on people.
