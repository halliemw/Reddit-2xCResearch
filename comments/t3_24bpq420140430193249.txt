Excellent! I agree with all of your reasoning. I don't doubt that if I do ask, it'll make his *life* and will be the most romantic thing I could ever do in comparison to his constant gestures. 

I'm definitely not thinking of it as a race, though - wrong wording on my part. This is obviously something that needs serious thought and 100% good intentions, not just trying to beat someone to it. I'm really looking forward to it and just want to make the right decision for us (on whether I propose or not).

Anyway, love it! Very good 'story' and great memories! Your grandkids (if you have kids and such) will hopefully share that story during a show and tell or something, like I did with my grandparent's stories when I was little :)

Thanks a bunch for your response!
