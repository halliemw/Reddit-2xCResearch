Feminism tries to achieve gender equality, egalitarianism (no specification) is most often about economic inequality. 

Or you could be using egalitarianism in a general way. But the problem with that is that the most important and over-arching kind of equality seems to be moral equality (the idea that we all have some basic level of equal desert). But that's an idea that's possible to, at least on the surface, reconcile with just about anything, even oppressive institutions. A libertarian capitalist might think that we're all entitled to equal protection of our property rights (even if you have none), and a fundamentalist christian might say that men and women must equally conform to their God-given role, and these people might say they are egalitarians on those bases.

The problem with the term used generally is that it could be applied to almost anyone in some respect, which makes it basically useless as a label.
