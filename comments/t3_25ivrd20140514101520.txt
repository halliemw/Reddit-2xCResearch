After a year, you can't just cut off the sex. I mean, these guys are used to having it multiple times a week or even daily. You're a cruel and callous woman if you just cut off sex at the time of a breakup. I firmly believe that this is why men can get abusive. They trusted you, and you just cut them off completely from sex when you broke up. You should be sensitive to their needs.
