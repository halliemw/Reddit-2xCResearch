Oh, I'm definitely thinking that he has a weird rape fetish. The fact that it was a strong feminist icon (Wonder Woman) being violated in his artwork made it even creepier; it was like he was just saying, "I hate strong women and want to hurt them." I know he's a smart guy, but I can't figure out why he didn't think that this would bother or offend anyone. 
I tried calling D out, but M stepped in and basically said, "OK, let's just move onto the next artist." M really hates confrontation. It's infuriating.
