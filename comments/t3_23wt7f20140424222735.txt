Be honest with the staff and tell them when you get there that you aren't comfortable swallowing pills. I'm sure they'll be able to figure something out with you. 

All things considered, you did a great job of planning. The waiting is the worst part, honestly. Once you're there, things will probably go very quickly and you won't remember much. The meds will definitely make you sick, so make sure you have Gatorade or something to replenish electrolytes. 

When I was at PP the staff was incredible. They'll be able to answer all of your questions and give you more personalized input on what to expect. Oh, and trust them! They know what they're talking about. :)

Best of luck to you.
