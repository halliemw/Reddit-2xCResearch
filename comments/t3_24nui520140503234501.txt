I am totally comfortable being naked around other people UNLESS I think they'll be uncomfortable with my nakedness or it's inappropriate to be naked in front of them. I think this situation falls under the latter category (at least from your boyfriend's perspective). Unless it's previously stated that your man friend is cool with you undressing in front of other dudes, I feel like it can be assumed he won't be. It's not that other people are less comfortable with their bodies than you are, it's that other people have more well-defined boundaries regarding nudity. This isn't a judgment, but it's definitely something you and your boyfriend should discuss.
