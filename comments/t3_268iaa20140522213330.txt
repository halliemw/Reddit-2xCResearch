She-Hulk. There's been [a lot of talk](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/05/21/she-hulk-is-a-feminist-hero-not-a-male-fantasy/) recently about her because of a certain director's comments. But she represents a woman that can act without the fear of judgement or violence against her. Also she's a lawyer and she's able to keep her whits about her when she's in hulk mode. Also, that article I linked does a much better job of explaining all this than I am.
