One thing I did while being a stay-at-home spouse is manage our social life and hobbies/activities so that we always had something fun to do or friends to hang out with on weekends/evenings.  Research shows/museums/etc. in your area, places to hike or kayak, fun bars/clubs, whatever you guys like.  

You can also manage health by cooking things that are very healthy but taste good, and by planning/setting up fun activities for exercise instead of just 'exercising' on a treadmill/etc at home. 

 If you own your home, you may potentially be able to add tens of thousands of dollars to the resale value with fixer-upper activities - refinish bathrooms and kitchen, repaint, fix roofs/gutters, etc.
