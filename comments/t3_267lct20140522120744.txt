New England here.  I get called Miss about 25% of the time and Ma'am 75% of the time although most people rarely use it up here, and it's closer to 50/50 when I'm dressed more casually (I work in finance in the city so I'm usually dressed a little nicer than the average college student).

For reference, I'm 28 but get carded pretty often and look about 24 on most days.
