My day can be ruined simply through one asshole pulling the whole "you're too pretty to look so sad, smile baby" bullshit on the street. I spend all day enraged about what I should have said to him instead of hiding and running away. As far as I'm concerned, you're well within your rights to be bent about this. You have a right to walk down the street and be left alone.
