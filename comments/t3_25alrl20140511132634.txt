10 hour drive away, but I only recently graduated and am on the job hunt so I thought about offering to come visit sometime post-delivery, since I can keep applying for jobs from anywhere I can have internet... and can always drive back if an interview comes up. My mother is visiting her in a week or so, but I didn't want to visit if I'd be more of an inconvenience than a help... do you have any advice on that point, i.e. whether a visiting brother would be a help or a hindrance to her? She has a loving husband around as well, that could make a difference I imagine.
