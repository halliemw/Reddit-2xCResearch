The fake nerd girl drives me nuts. As a nerdy, awkward kid and as fairly nerdy adult, the idea that I need to prove myself to the same guys who wanted nothing to do with me in my youth because it's now hip is just dumb. 

I know plenty of guys that would love to stay home with kids. I'm sure we all wish it wasn't seen as a less valid option, regardless of gender.
