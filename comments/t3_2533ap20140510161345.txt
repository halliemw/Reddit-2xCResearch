Wow, I have never heard of something like that! That must be a pain dealing with all the different lengths of hair as they grow back, though. 

I feel the same way -  I offered to shave all my hair for charity once because being bald really wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately,  my mom didn't feel the same way, so that didn't happen :(. To me, it's just like fingernails.
