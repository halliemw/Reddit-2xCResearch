You have to ask yourself, "What do I like to do?" Then you have to make an effort to do those things. Maybe you are interested in riding a bike. So research bike trails, fix up or get a new bicycle, look for bicycle groups (maybe meetup.com) and start going! If it is something like bicycling, you don't even need other people, you just go when you get bored! 

It can be anything and many things. Do you like cooking? Dancing? Animals? So, you like books... would you be interested in a book club? That is something you already do with a social element. Once to start to do these things, you'll get bored of some, you'll do some occasionally, and some will become routine. 

Then when you DO meet someone, you'll be more interesting too, because you've had all of these experiences.
