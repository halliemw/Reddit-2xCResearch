The article you reference doesn't really sound like it's about sexism explicitly, it sounds like it's about a problem that affects some women. I don't think saying "men also can have low confidence" is equivalent to saying "men and women suffer equally from low confidence and it's stupid to have an article just about how women suffer from it". Like, if the article were about how women should be aware of breast cancer, would it be wrong for a male commenter to say "men can have breast cancer too, so men also need to know the signs"?

I'm not trying to attack you here, I just see this come up all the time in feminist discussions and I'm really not sure how to feel about it. I completely agree that it's alright (good in fact!) to have articles/books/websites that focus on how particular issues affect women. I just don't know why it's so problematic if men who read those articles say "oh hey, this happens to me/my buddy all the time too!". Isn't that good, because it means they're really engaging with the material?

Granted sometimes it's not such an innocent response, and is really intended as a way of saying "I have this problem too so suck it up", but I think it's important to give people the benefit of the doubt. I don't think saying that men and women share issues implies those issues don't exist.
