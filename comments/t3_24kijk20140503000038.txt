The greatest piece of advice I ever got (from [r/running](http://www.reddit.com/r/running)) was that miles are more important than speed. My problem in the past was that I wanted to be faster, then I would lose energy before I'd even run 2 miles. The key is to run stupid slow. Slower than you think you should (but still with good form) for longer distances. So even if you can run 10:00 miles, you might need to start by running 11:30 minute miles so that you can run for 3, 4, 5 miles at a time.

I hope that makes sense. :)
