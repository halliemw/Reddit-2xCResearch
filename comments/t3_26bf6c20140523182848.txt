I honestly can say that I have never experienced anything like any of those examples you have given in my own personal life. If I have I probably just ignored it or let it go. But honestly I can't recall any specific sexists interactions I have had.    

>If a woman says she has never experienced it, I think she is not paying close enough attention.    

I was more aiming for sexism instances that would affect every woman since you stated that all women have experienced it without realizing it. Not personal ones. I know it happens I just am aware that it does not happen to everyone.
