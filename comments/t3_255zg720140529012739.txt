Hey E, 

Thank you for the birthday wishes!  I'm sorry it took me (again) a long time to respond.  The birthday ended up being a pretty huge event - about 40 people showed up at the hospital I go to & joined me in passing out cupcakes.  A local news channel showed up as well and interviewed me. :)  In addition to this, people all around the world (facebook friends) joined me in passing out cupcakes & treats.  I got pictures posted on facebook from Israel, Canada & Thailand as well as all over the US of A. It was really cool, but it drained me completely.  I ended up getting pretty sick and was down for the count for quite a few days.

Thank you so much for sharing both the gmail instructions, and even more so, the small acts of kindness.  I have a big smile right now, it is very cool to hear about this joy that you have added to the world.

You rock, and you prove that awesome people are all around us. 

Thank you again, for sharing your time, your ideas, and some of the ways you have made the world better. 

:)

Dov
