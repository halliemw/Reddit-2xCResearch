Just a thought, but as the youngest of four, she's looking at three ladies (four if you're counting your mom) who have already gone through the awkward early teen years, and in theory gotten their shit together a little more than she has. She's seeing the end result. Even when you guys were 14, she was a little kid, and still saw you as very mature and beautiful. I wonder if, given the right time and setting, looking at old pictures of you and your sisters at her age might help her out? To see that she's pretty on-track developmentally, and that she shouldn't stress herself out by comparing her appearance to that of someone almost twice her age (in the case of your oldest sister).

Oddly enough I have almost this same problem with my mom. She complains about being "fat" all the time (she's size 16 and looks great for her size and age), but a lot of her problem is that she just wears really baggy clothes. It gives her a shapeless/moo moo appearance, and makes it look like she doesn't care about her clothes. What I try to do is mention *other* people's style choices infront of her. Stuff like "that actress would look better if she wore the right sized clothes," or "I think that model's a pear-shape. Wearing this instead would be really flattering for her body type." I try to phrase things is so the emphasis is on the clothes, not the body of the person being good or bad. I also try to make it seem like wearing flattering and fitting clothing is the fun and normal thing to do. I've never directly said to her that she looks bad or that she should wear something different, but now she's started coming to me for fashion advice from time to time.
