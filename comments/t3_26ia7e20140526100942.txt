My breasts are large enough that I simply *can't* not wear one in public. Most of my clothes literally wouldn't go onto my body or would look absolutely ridiculous, or if I leaned over a boob would swing out. Yes, swing out, not pop out. I suppose I could get away with an extremely baggy high-necked tshirt but it would look awful, and anytime I tried to go up or down stairs or move above a slow stroll or hop on my bike, there would be some pain involved.

If you like going without a bra and your boobs are perky enough that you can, go for it. I'm going to keep wearing mine, but it has nothing to do with 'bra worship' or being modest or anything else along those lines.
