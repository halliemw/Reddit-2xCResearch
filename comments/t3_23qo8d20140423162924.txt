Aww, I know that feeling! Most everyone has that little nagging paranoia of, "Were they staring or zoned out? Were they staring because I'm hot, or because I'm just awful? Oh frick now I can't quit thinking about it." It can be hard to silence that little voice; think of now as a great time to either practice silencing that voice, or deciding you don't care what the voice (or the people setting it off) have to say. 

And frankly, if they're going to look at you and not like what they see, clearly they are terribly misinformed and you aren't going to have a *thing* in common with them, so why let their sadly misguided opinions bring you down? (That's always been my attitude towards that sort of thing, anyway; it certainly helps prevent dwelling on it, if you can just dismiss it and go on!)
