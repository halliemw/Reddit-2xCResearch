Well, they had a discussion about this before.  They agreed on abortion.  Sure, you can change your mind about things over time, but it shouldn't be brought up when you find out your pregnant, it should be brought up when someone realizes their feelings on abortion are changing, before me someone gets pregnant.  I know it's hard to know if you're feelings have changed until it happens, but Jesus, who exactly does he think this pregnancy is going to affect more?
