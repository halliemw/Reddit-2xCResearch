The kicker? The true, most ridiculous part of this story? The woman that is having the party is the HR Director. Granted, she is a ridiculous HR rep and this is not nearly the worst thing she's ever said/done (it's a small company and I mean, who is anyone going to report her to?) but still. The added fact that she is in HR makes it just absurd. I haven't committed to anything but she seems to think that I am definitely going, so hopefully I can grab her later today and kind of lay the situation out for her. Just ridiculous.
