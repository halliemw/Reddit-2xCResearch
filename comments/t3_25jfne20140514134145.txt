Idk if I'd even join /r/lawyers if I pass the bar and get licensed, my husband still hasn't joined since he's become an attorney just because idk, doxxing/security shit really not being worth it to go talk on a private subreddit. Making it a double hoop to jump through where you have to prove you're a woman too just sounds exhausting.

Would a subreddit where people talk about the law profession and female issues be pretty cool? Probably. But I'd think a safe space for paralegals, law students, etc. would be kind of nice. /r/lawschool's a pretty great community but if I have a problem like getting hit on at networking events and how to handle it, they'd probably go "wish I was a girl." And if I posted here about awkward sexism in the legal industry I'd probably get more of a "you can do whatever you want, don't put up with that stuff, go talk to HR!" and I'd have to say "uhh there is no HR, and I'm kind of desperate for any job I could get." Just as a student I've thought it would be cool to have some sort of hang out spot online for such a thing, but maybe shit gets worse when you become an actual attorney?

 Or planning out if/when you'd ever have kids (if someone took off time to work between law school like everyone suggests, spent three years in law school, and spent 10 years paying off loans, you'd be in your mid-late thirties before you're settled enough to have kids). Idk, there's a lot of issues that could be cool to discuss in a female/legal subreddit. But I like my anonymity way more.
