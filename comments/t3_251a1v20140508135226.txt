That's probably why they don't pay a living wage to their employees. 

Why pay your employees more when the government are willing to give them more assistance?

If you ask me the government should look at smaller companies and offer them and their employees financial assistance. 
I read like 16% of working American's are uninsured which is because either their employer can't afford it, they can't afford it or they see the cost as too high for what they would get. If the government stepped in and offered these small businesses financial aid in covering insurance then maybe every American (at least the ones who are working) would be insured as well as their families. Having these people insured means that if they get into an accident, they will at least have some cover and won't fall into debt, which on such low incomes would probably just result in a downward spiral from which the family would never recover, and will allow them to have more time off to heal instead of risking a more severe injury just because they need to cover their medical bills.
