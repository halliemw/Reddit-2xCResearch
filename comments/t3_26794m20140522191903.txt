> It seems like you spend a lot of time finding out about and thinking about where they spend their work time that is not on their work. I feel this is you being judgmental.

Nope, don't spend any time. If I could I avoid it, I would. I try to actively find time away. I see it. It is brought to me.  I am made involved. Instead of making my time harder at work, I play along with "a bit of acting and diplomacy". 

Honestly, I don't think she will last much longer. If she does, it makes my work look only better and makes me more eligible for a promotion. 


I have already talked to my supervisor. They are aware, but their hands are tied as she is a pregnant unwed mother, and the law is on her side. That's the way it works, and I have to just work it out to my advantage. 

Ill do my work and handle their horrible company until I get my promotion and nice  heck  to go home to my loving husband and cat, while they can love I  their telenovela of drama and stress.
