I don't have girls, but I do have boys, so this is simply general observation of raising children.

Every single one of these is something my boys went through around this age. I felt like 7-8 was this weird breakthrough into more solid individuality. Growing like weeds, changing sleep desires and schedules, sudden interest in not wanting to be seen naked, weird attitudes, etc. I ranted to my husband plenty of times that it wasn't fair that I was having to deal with a teenage kid when I didn't have one yet! None of this has actually turned out to be early onset puberty...it was just a developmental stage.

Now, not to say it couldn't be, obviously. But there can be lots of reasons for the same symptoms. Correlation not equaling causation and all that.

I think the best thing you can do is be relaxed about it, whatever is going on. It can be hard not to worry, but the greatest gift you can give her is the safe harbor of an adult who is calm and peaceful about new sometimes scary things. Whether that be puberty, or simply a new stage of development in life.  :)
