Guys are definitely welcome on 2XC! The best thing you can do is come into here with an open mind, be supportive of community members, and at least at this point in time, maybe listen before you comment. A lot of people come to TwoX for support and may not be looking to have a discussion, so just be aware of that. Just be genuine and understanding and it's likely your comments will be received well.
