It's just interesting to me that the views they hold can be so self contradictory and self serving. If men get to hold some place of power due to evolution, women should be able to "rape" (i'm assuming this was metaphorical) by matriarchal dominance. If they are allowed to be dominant in some area because of evolution, then why should we not? 

Obviously none of that shit is true, but I find it funny how they will only believe the bullshit if it makes them better than the opposite sex and therefore better in general. I think they just have really low self esteem, which is why they so vehemently put other people down.
