I feel super accomplished with myself because at the age of 23 I already own a house, a car, and have a well paying job that is related to my University degree. I am happy with the fact that I am completely providing a good life for myself, which is something I was basically encouraged to do in my teens. I also have an amazing SO, I seriously couldn't ask for a better partner, and our anniversary is in a couple weeks :)
