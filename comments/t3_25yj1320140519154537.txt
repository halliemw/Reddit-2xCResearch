I did. Checking the depth of my vagina, removal, and insertion probably took all of five minutes. The first one I got at Planned Parenthood. This time I went back to the Gyno I originally had as a teenager (I left town for college so didn't go to him for the first one). I think he is a really top notch doctor and that probably affected my experience.

Edit: The second time I didn't take any ibuprofen or anything and didn't have anything to dilate/loosen my cervix.... or whatever it was that pill was supposed to do that I shoved up there the first time.
