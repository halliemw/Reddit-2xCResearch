Nobody with OCD 'likes the way they feel'. OCD is all consuming, it's 'not let me vacuum because I do it better'. When you have OCD you scrub until your fingers are raw and peeling, and if you move the vacuum or rag in the wrong direction then the whole time spent cleaning is wrong and must be started again. THAT is OCD. 

Not wanting to see you because he hasn't showered has nothing to do with OCD. There are many people that don't feel comfortable going out without showering. OCD means that your showers can last for hours because the timing of how many circular scrubbing motions you made on one side of your head didn't match the other and you need to start the whole shower again. THAT is OCD. 

Your boyfriend is a controlling douche who is blaming his behaviors on OCD so he can use it to guilt you if you call him on anything he says.
