Of course having a baby is an option. But you have to careful not to downplay the magnitude of what going through pregnancy means -- carrying a child to term is a Big Deal, and giving it up for adoption is a whole 'nother Big Deal. Pregnancy comes with various medical risks and costs, as well as social risks and costs (under certain circumstances). Keeping the baby is the right choice for some people; giving it up for adoption is the right choice for others. But if a woman has already decided that she doesn't want to remain pregnant, then I don't think it's appropriate to push for adoption/keeping the baby. Just like if a woman has decided she wants to keep the baby, it's not appropriate to push for abortion.

(Note: I have a son, planned pregnancy. No risk factors, but I developed preeclampsia 8 weeks before his due date that caused me to gain 20 lbs of water weight in two weeks and then required an emergency c-section. This is not common, of course, but it is an example of the toll that pregnancy can take. Before this, there were food/drink restrictions, changing body shape, my feet grew a size, I experienced fatigue, nausea, and mood swings, and I developed hip pain while sleeping. This would have been a much more difficult thing to go through if I had not wanted the child. Never diminish the magnitude of pregnancy as an experience when advocating that people keep the baby/adopt it out.)
