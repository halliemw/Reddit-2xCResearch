It sounds like he was just saying something in a way that didn't quite come out right, especially if you're usually quite blunt with each other. Don't take it to heart too much, you have to remember that we're all only human, and sometimes we say hurtful things, whether it be on purpose or by accident. Don't worry OP, I'm sure you're beautiful and strong, just believe in yourself! <3
