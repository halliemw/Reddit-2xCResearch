>Every time he 's done with his shift I spend nine cleaning his mess. Honestly, if he wasn't my brother I would have him fired.


If you care about your bro (despit him being a tremendous douche), you should stop helping him. When you'll be finally on your own, he won't be able to do his job properly.


>Exactly you won't say that because you don't want to think about it. We can discuss this for hours if you want but you can't since you don't want to think deeper.


"No offense, bro, but if you're such a smart deep-thinker, why are you still living with your parents and fail at your job which your parents provide to you? You can't claim that you're smart if you can't prove it with something. Maybe you created a book/software/etc, solved previously unsolved complex math problem - oh, you didn't? Seems like you overrating yourself". Be evil. Be relentless. Hit him where it hurts the most, after all, he doesn't mind putting you down - you have no obligations not to do the same. It seems that he needs a nice kick in his nuts to get his shit together - do him a favour and kick him.
