My mom for years made derogatory comments about my body. A letter like this would not have worked, because it will come off as an attack and she would not connect the dots. 

It took me a few years to figure out how to deal with her. I would make a plan for how I would handle a specific remark. Practice it in my head, out loud in the car, even run it by friends. Then when she said something I would have a rebuttal. Sometimes it is one word. 

Make it short and sweet. I find the word "ouch' packs a lot of punch. It makes it clear that she hurt you without attacking her or fanning flames. It tends to deflate the whole situation. It also leaves it up to her to figure out what she said that hurt you. 

Good luck. Mom issues are tough. Just remember she is doing the best she can and is doing what she thinks is best for you. Doesn't mean you have to take it but whatever you do should be done in a spirit of loving kindness.
