Depends. Depends on what your issues are, what kind of therapy you go to, how much you want to get out of it and how much you believe you can get out of it. most important is finding the best therapist for your needs. I went through a blend of specialized therapies that are "teaching therapies" (half therapy half class): dialectical behavior therapy, rational emotive behavior therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. I learned actual skills, like how to manage harmful emotions ( big one for me is rage) in a healthy way and how to communicate properly and effectively. I unlearned a lot of things too, which was very difficult, like how to dwindle my negative self-talk. 

If you are lucky, you are taught these things growing up and learn them from competent parents or other guardians. A lot of people are not, and struggle throughout their whole lives without knowing that they don't have to, or develop negative coping mechanisms for life in general such as drug abuse, eating disorders (includes overeating and binge eating which is very prevalent), cutting, building a wall and becoming emotionless, etc.
