That understandable. I could see why you would be afraid in that situation, its not unreasonable to be afraid of things, regardless of the probability of it occurring. I'm glad you have someplace to go to talk about that kind of thing. I've never understood the sentiment of "I don't want to listen to ANYTHING 'X' group says even if its correct and insightful". Why wouldn't you want to hear something correct and insightful? Would it change if someone of another gender said the exact same words? I had a lot of great male and female role models growing up, and I always learned to evaluate and respect the person and their words regardless of gender. Why would you want to not listen to an entire subset of opinions, especially if they are 'correct and insightful?' I do however understand the idea of wanting a place where you can share thoughts and ideas with other people who may be feeling the same things as you.
