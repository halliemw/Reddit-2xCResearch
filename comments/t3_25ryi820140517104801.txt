I agree. Casting a superhero is as insistent as the "we exist" message is meant to be. Harder to ignore and write off. 

I also remember when they were making one of the first Spider-Man sequels, with Tobey, a rumor circulated that his role as Spider-Man had been jeopardized by his past film Wonderboys, where it's insinuated that he is seduced by a gay man. Tobey said that he regretted doing the scene for that reason, and I lost all respect for him. Wonderboys was one of his best performances. 

(The man that seduced him would later play Iron Man.)
