I had sex all the time while pregnant except after I went into early labor. I also ate a lot of salmon patties and laid around so much because I had no energy. I didn't eat a recommended diet and my baby was really healthy for premie. He was a premie for uncontrollable reason. Do what you feel is best. Next baby I'm going to be on a strict keto diet because I feel it's best. Obviously don't do anything crazy but relax babies are surprisingly durable.
