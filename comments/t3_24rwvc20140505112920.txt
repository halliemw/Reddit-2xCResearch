It depends on how well they take hints. You could slowly distance yourself, stop replying to texts, don't hang out, etc. If a person you don't want to be around anymore doesn't let it go, gets emotional or confrontational, just be upfront. Tell them you don't want to pursue this friendship, and end it. You don't need to tell why, or give a second chance. However- once you end it, it has to stay ended. No texts, remove from Facebook. You don't have to be mean, just be consistent in keeping the relationship closed.
