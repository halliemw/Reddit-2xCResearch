I started the pill at age 13 because I was taking accutane and I needed a form of BC. That was about 10.5 years ago. I was on and off the pill for the next 7 years.  I was on it only for acne related reasons from the age of 13-17, and then on it from 19-20 to try to regulate my cycle.

When I wound up in a relationship and I was not on it at the age of 22 i decided to investigate other options. I knew I had been pretty bad about taking it at the exact same time everyday in the past so I decided I didn't want that again. I ultimately decided on the merina IUD. It was a long term option that I wouldn't really have to think about.  

I had had no problems with the pill and any side effects, and the IUD has been fantastic since I got it a little over a year ago, save getting it placed in which I passed out.  Ultimately I am really pleased with my choice!
