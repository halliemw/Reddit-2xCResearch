>I most certainly did.

No, you didn't.  You ignored their post, and repeated your question.

>I couldn't possibly demonstrate the hypocrisy in this sub better than you are right now.

What, it's hypocrisy to say that **not everything revolves around you**?

>I can't say I'm surprised.

I am merely holding you to the same standard you are trying to hold others to.  

Your observation reflects poorly on you, not me.  You expect others to answer your questions, without you having to respond to theirs.

And that is not how it works.
