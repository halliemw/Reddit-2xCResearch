We've got one atheist, one practising Christian, and one non-practising Christian.

For a bit of background we were taken to church every Sunday with my Mom while she was finishing school. Then once we hit around 12 we could start to make our own decisions. We still had to show up once/month to make my Mom's life easier in the parish but could decide whether or not we wanted to get confirmed. We were all baptised to keep grandparents happy (maternal are also ordained, so much church in one family...) but since confirmation is making the promises for yourself it was left up to us. Only one of us was confirmed.
