Well, I don't really think I should need to say this explicitly in order to avoid further assumptions on my meaning, but my primary points of interest in social issues deal more with the way that different races have been treated within American society, not simply feminism. My favorite feminist authors are those who deal with the issue of intersections between race and gender, often dealing with racial inequalities within the feminist movement as well as inequalities they experience as women within their own racial group. And there are other interesting dynamics to consider as well, including those of non-heterosexual people, those of trans* people, those of people in poverty, and so on and so forth.

What I notice in your response, no matter how you justify it, is that you have this gut response to hearing something expressed as "This is an experience that I have as a female-born person," and you respond by attaching a lot of meaning to it. Feminists do not make you do that. You do that. And you do not do it because you have no choice. You had the option of asking for clarification, or even just checking to see whether what you thought you heard was correct. But you did not do that. You instead responded as if what you assumed was undoubtedly true.

You say that it's important to talk about human rights, but how can we possibly know whether something is truly equal between men and women if we cannot talk about women? You say that we mustn't highlight differences between men and women, yet you felt perfectly comfortable making a claim about how men and women are treated differently. And there's a sort of inherent resistance towards equality there that can only be resolved by acknowledging differences.

You see the term "woman's rights" as taking sides because you do not acknowledge the fact that there are those regimes where the law can impact women with a very different effect on men. A law relating to abortion **does not** change whether a male-born individual needs to tolerate another organism growing inside of them. I am absolutely astounded that you are taking issue with something as basic and simple as the idea that men and women may be affected differently by changes in policy, or that this could be something worth discussing. I do not even know how to cut through all of the assumptions and ideological overlays you are attaching to a simple statement, to just establish something as basic and simple as, "We know there are ways where men and women are different." And if I cannot even do that, then I don't know how I can possibly persuade you to believe that it could be worthwhile to think and debate about the questions, "How are men and women different? How are men and women the same? How are men and women treated differently in spite of their being the same? Is there a such thing as men and women being treated the same in spite of being different?" And so on and so forth.

Is this the total sum of all issues around equality? **For the bazillionth time, no.** But as women are **part of humanity**, woman's rights are **part of human rights**. And we cannot tackle the whole problem if we insist on excluding those parts which are specific to certain people.
