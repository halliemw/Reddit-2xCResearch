I have two things to say to you. The first is, I totally get how awful it is to be asked something like that. I've had that question asked of me too... and even worse, by a boyfriend. It's one of those things that's like: I knew I was out of shape, but I never expected anyone to call me out on it. It turns out, though, that it was a good thing.

The second thing I can say is this: Are you seriously dieting and exercising? If so, you should be seeing a change. I know how hard it is. I've been through it, and it wasn't until I committed completely that things changed. If you want some help, you can PM me. Or check out the xxfitness subreddit.
