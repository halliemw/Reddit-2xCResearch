I believe the problem is that healthcare is somewhat devolved, so England/Wales/Scotland/NI all get given a budget from Westminster to spend on healthcare, and it's up to each parliament/assembly on how they spend that.  NI chooses not to cover abortions for their citizens, and one can somehow see that it's "unfair" that England should pay for NI citizens out of the England budget.  It's the same reason that Scottish people can get free prescriptions, but if you live in England you can't just pop over the border and use the Scottish system to get your prescription for free because you don't live in that region.

Having said that, I would like to see a situation where Westminster put some money into the England/Scottish/Welsh NHS to allow for NI women to have abortions here, but I can imagine that would cause all sorts of trouble with the folk in NI who refuse to legalise abortion.
