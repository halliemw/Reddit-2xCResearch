Oh boy, I think we can all relate to this. First of all, that was kind of a shitty way for him to break up with you. Secondly, I've had breakups where I totally felt like it was never going to be okay again and I'd never get over it, blah blah. And guess what, I'm totally happy and great now. So take comfort in knowing that even if it doesn't feel like it now, you WILL be great again soon and hardly even think about him. 

My first rule of going through a break-up is to allow yourself time to lay around in your pajamas, eat comfort foods, watch your favorite movies, and burst out into tears a few times a day. Then after you've gotten it out of your system a little bit you can take relaxing baths, eat some healthy foods, make yourself look nice and feel nice, and start to move forward with your life. Because really that's all you can do. There's not going to be one magical moment where you're like "I'm over it now!" It's just going to happen slowly. Also, do NOT keep in contact with him for like at least 2 months. NO texting him. That makes it sooo much harder, I've made that mistake.
