This isn't a sub for discussing women, it's for women to discuss things they encounter in their lives. /r/Denver isn't a sub for discussing Denver as outsiders, it's for Denver-people to share Denver-things to other Denver-people. I'm not from Denver but I follow it because I plan to move there in a year and I find it interesting, but I wouldn't start posting there about how in Louisiana we do this or that. And I often see locals getting annoyed at the same 'where do I get weed? where should I stay? plan my whole trip for me!!' kind of posts from people not from there, especially since they've built up a whole wiki with information. 

I think /r/askwomen would be a better female-sub to have default. Since that is an open-forum discussion, anyone can join in. 

I just think it's awkward to have a default sub that not everyone can jump in feet first in. You need some contextual awareness for these.
