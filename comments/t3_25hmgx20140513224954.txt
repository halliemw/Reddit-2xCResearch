Yes, sexual harassment is one of the thing that can cause a professor to lose tenure. When I joined my department, I was strongly advised to never be alone in my office with a female student and the door shut to avoid the potential for a compromising situation. In any case, every university has rules about what can result in a dismissal after getting tenure. The common ones are sexual harassment, ethics violations, and a failure to satisfy the contract.
