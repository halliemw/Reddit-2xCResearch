Encouraging someone to get a gun and telling them that their fears are "irrational" when their own intuition is telling them that they don't feel comfortable with it is about as responsible as encouraging them to jump off the high dive without any regard to their diving skills, that they'll be just fine.

Before weapons of any kind will be a benefit to someone, as opposed to merely providing a dangerous false sense of security, that person needs to have some control over their fight or flight responses. This is really easy for some people, which tends to give them the erroneous notion that it's easy for everyone, but requires a lot of effort and training for others.

Motion detectors and lights, bells hung on doors and windows, security cameras, and other passive deterrents all have merit.  I'm a pro-weapons guy, but I'd do all of those things first.  Not doing any of those things and jumping straight to a firearm in the hands of someone who doesn't want one is not the right approach.
