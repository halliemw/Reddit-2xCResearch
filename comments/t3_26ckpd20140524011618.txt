I interview interns (unpaid) yearly for the nonprofit I work at. This year, I took two because they were both incredible. They have totally different work histories, a 15 year age gap, and different styles of working. My best guess is that the agency was so impressed with both of you. Yea, you're getting less money. Yea, you feel inadequate. And guess what? I have two licensures and I *still* feel inadequate from time to time. This is an opportunity for you to create a plan to lift yourself up when you start to feel this way. Ask yourself: What unique qualities do I bring to this position? What feedback do I receive from my peers/colleagues? Why am I an asset to this organization? As for getting along with your internship partner, keep an open mind. You two may complement each other's work habits and get shit done! Remain thoughtful and pleasant. Make the organization wish they had only selected you!
