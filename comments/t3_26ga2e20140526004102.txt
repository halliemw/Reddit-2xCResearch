I consider it to be misanthropy (which I guess includes misandry) that stems from misogyny. His manifesto contains a lot of shit about males that are somehow tainted or whatnot by women, so misogyny is sort of the thing that started this general hatred. Though his manifesto also apparently contains a lot of racism, and I'm not sure where that would fit into this model.
