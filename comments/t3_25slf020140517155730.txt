Here's a few examples, although for the most part I don't think I've received much - if any - different treatment at work due to my gender:

The worst was when I **started my own business**. I had a male business partner, who actually approached *me* about joining me in the project I'd started. It was my idea, my baby, but we decided to do it as equals. Anyway, we had a number of local business owners that we went to as advisers (100% male) and potential investors that we spoke to about our plan (also 100% male). They virtually always, without fail, referred to him in conversation. They often made eye contact with him rather than me in conversation (like OP), even when I was the one speaking. They often implied that I should be the one taking notes during the convo. It was a rage-inducing experience. 

I worked at a **truck stop** for a few months. The customers were often sexist and obvious in ogling the female cashiers. A group of guys came in once while I was cleaning a window pane: they made a lewd comment about me being a "dirty girl" and made a swipe at my ass. Luckily my manager was great and immediately kicked them out. 

In high school I applied for a job doing **loading and unloading in the back of a grocery store**, since it had an opening and paid a bit more than the front register. They hired me for the register anyway since they said they mostly wanted "strong guys" in the back. Some of those guys were flimsy as shit. And what do you know, despite the tremendous diversity of people working there, only the young women were up front as cashiers. 

At numerous office jobs, **female supervisors have made rude comments about my outfits**. In one position my supervisor walked over to me, pulled the top of my shirt up and tugged on my bra and said "I can see your cleavage. Don't be so inappropriate." First of all, I was 18 and it was my first office job, so you'd think she could have made her point without being such an ass. Second, my tits were basically an A cup at the time. I did not have cleavage. At my next office job at age 19, which entailed basically making photocopies for a nonprofit, my supervisor threatened to fire me on the first warning for "dressing like I was on my way to the beach." I wore tanktops and capris, just like my male co-worker, who wore tshirts and jeans. He got no flack for his choice in outfits.
