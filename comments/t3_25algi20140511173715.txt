They sewed the right ovary back together and put my on Depo for the next couple of years -- don't ovulate, can't get more cysts. Mine were actually dermoid cysts that had pre-teeth and hair in them. I know, gross and freaky. 

My pelvics have come back with nothing found and I do them every other year now. 

The crazy part of the whole thing is I never had any pain that I identified as being from the tearing ovary. I only went in the the ob/gyn because I 1/was starting to see someone and wanted to be on the pill and 2/finally had decent insurance where most everything was covered. I had no idea i had these things growing on my ovaries.
