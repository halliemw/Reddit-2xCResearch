Even if the possible sex can be sort of "excused" because he blacked out, why was he flirting, touching, hand-holding with this girl?  I doubt he was blacked out then if he was still functioning for a long period of time through the night in front of his friends like that.  I would honestly be way more concerned about why he was doing all that with the girl than where it lead to.

My general advice about infidelity-related things is, if you can't get to the root of the problem as to why he cheated and fix it, then it likely *will* happen again because your current situation is already set up for it.  When his inhibitions got lowered a bit, he started getting touchy and affectionate with this girl.  Why?  What felt good about it that trumped respecting your relationship?  Can you fix this problem in your relationship?  How?  Why will this not happen again next time he drinks?  These are the questions you need to explore together to honestly assess your relationship.  Good luck!
