We've both been absolutely swamped for time together. He works full time and goes to school for nursing, plus I work two part time jobs (one being from 4am-8am). He and I really have been seeing each other only on Saturday and Sunday, with him sleeping over Saturday night. We text constantly, call each other a few times a week, but I think he's lonely a bit. Previously we were spending at least two nights together during the week, and the weekend together. Also, although he was the one to bring up a future together in the first place, he mentioned that thought was a little scary to him too. I think attention elsewhere was perhaps distracting. Like eating potato chips. It's fatty, keeps you busy with something, and tastes good, even though it isn't nutritious. 

I guess I meant the naivete to encompass moreso he didn't understand why he was doing it, so it didn't feel 'wrong' to him.
