I am someone who has had a step-dad since I was 2. He and my mum split up when I was 14 but he is and always will be my dad (and is still in my life, as my dad). Since then I've had a step-dad figure (Mum's live-in boyfriend, not married though).

My advice would be this: Don't kill with kindness. I know that you have already been with them for 3 years but continue with a mentality of 'start as you mean to go on'. Punish them when they are doing wrong. Do NOT indicate to them in any way/shape/form that you have no control or authority to ground them. This isn't about authority but rather about projecting the idea that you are there for the good AND the bad. You are firmly a part of their life. And like a parent, you have the authority and they should respect you.
