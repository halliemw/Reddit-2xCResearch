Thank you for sharing your experience.  I'm going to talk with my counselor, and I will consider talking to him about it too.  I guess I'm concerned about hurting him so much because I'm worried he might chalk it down to having Asperger's, and he tends to beat himself up a bit for having trouble understanding social norms etc, even though it was something he was born with and can't help.  I'm also concerned that if I tell him I feel it was non consensual that he might equate that to my previous experience of rape, which gave me nightmares and flashbacks that he was there during, which isn't the case at all.  I don't want him to think that I view him in the same way as the person who raped me.
