I've learned to just say as high as possible if you want to see someone quickly in the emergency room. Broke my collarbone and was altogether too reasonable when asked what level my pain was. My response: "Well, I'm not dying and I can talk, so a 6 or 7?" In the end, it took me 4 hours to see a doctor.
