I consider myself to be non-confrontational, but I do always stick up for myself if someone touches me unwantedly. Maybe it's because I'm not very touchy-feely overall, so my natural response to someone randomly touching me (especially if we're not very close) is to back away. 

I try not to judge, I just wanted to understand why someone reacts the way that they do because it's so different from what I think I would have done.
