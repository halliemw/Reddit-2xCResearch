"Bob, thanks for your invitation.  Is Jim going to be there?  He's mean in ways that make me really uncomfortable, and it isn't going to be fun for me if he makes sexist jokes."

"Jim, this isn't okay.  We've talked about this before.  Bob, it's your house and your party, so it's your choice - which of us do you want to leave now?"  And then you leave, if Bob doesn't ask Jim to.

Yes, it's uncomfortable.  But it's uncomfortable for the people causing the problem, and that's who should be uncomfortable.
