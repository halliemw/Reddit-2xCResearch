I feel your pain. I've been through multiple IVFs, had multiple miscarriages, and still nobody knows why I can't have a baby. I get it. When you are an infertile woman, it seems like everybody around you is pregnant but you. 

HUGS. You'll get through this. You're already doing great - congratulating her and then mourning privately. That's good and that's healthy. If there is an event where you need to hang out with her, don't be afraid to decline to attend. You don't need to put yourself through stuff like that right now.

What's not great is the drinking - that has potential to turn ugly. Try to find less destructive ways of comforting yourself. Treat yourself to some nice things. Exercise. Start a new project. Show yourself some love - it might help. 

/r/miscarriage as well. You're not alone.
