First off- good for you for not allowing yourself to get "stuck" in abusive relationship, and moving along in life!

I understand the trust issue. I've dealt with multiple LTRs that had lying, cheating etc involved. I too met a **wonderful** man that I feel much like you do about your great new man! (It feels so good, doesn't it?!) 
My best advice to you is actually something my current SO said to *me* while I was (openly and honestly) dealing with your similar issues while new to the relationship. That is- "You now know what to (or not to) do in the wrong relationship, but how do you know what to do in the right one?" This floored me. I just had to do what felt right, and trust him...and myself. A big thing was I didn't do *anything* I wasn't ready for and wanting to do. That made it a little resistant and slow moving- but he understood, never pressured me, and therefor I was comfortable and growing throughout the experience.
