The solution my school had was we had different uniforms for junior cycle (1st year to 3rd year) and senior cycle (4th and 5th year and transition year if you did it). The junior cycle one was the good old shirt, loose jumper and tartan skirt with knee socks combo. The senior cycle one was pinafores which were actually cut properly with socks, shirt and jumper. The junior one was green, senior one was blue. The senior one was far more mature looking and actually looked good on more mature bodies. 

Not everyone is going to be happy in a uniform but they can help prevent bullying, help enforce correct dress codes and make parents lives much easier.
