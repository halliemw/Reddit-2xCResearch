The purpose of twox is simply to discuss twox. Discuss women. Issues or problems or ideas or ANYTHING having to do with twox. And who better to discuss women's issues than women themselves? However, this sub is definitely open to anyone who wishes to post here. If you have a problem, question, or thought that has to do with anything twox, then post it here (that is, if it's not offensive). I promise you won't get a lot of "hostile" responses from twoxers, regardless of your gender. I have been lurking in this sub for almost a year now, and I can tell you honestly that I can't recall ever seeing any hostility from anyone. We're not just a bunch of bitches with a "NO BOYS ALLOWED" sign on the door. All opinions - male, female, or other - are welcome here. 

I just don't think we need flair to show which gender we identify as, because there's no point.
