This may sound silly, but [The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUl6xlYIbAw) makes me curl up in a ball and cry my eyes out, and then carefully uncurls me and makes me smile again. But I won't lie--especially if you're a fan of the Muppets, it's a gut punch of EPIC proportion.
