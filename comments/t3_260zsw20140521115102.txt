I grew up CoC! It was a small, uber conservative church that got all out of sorts when one of the younger deacons used an overhead projector to display a new hymn. We did have a kitchen, though! We had lots of potlucks (not unusual for West Texas CoC's) but God forbid you call it anything but a fellowship center. It was not a "party room" or a "banquet hall." God hates those words, haha.

Anyhow, knowing that I came from that is probably some insight into why I asked my question. =)
