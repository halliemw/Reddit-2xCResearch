Thank you, I definitely won't be getting another. Right now I'm done with what I consider phase 1 of the shot, in that it's 3 months post my last shot so it should now be worn off. Now I'm entering phase 2 when the side effects of coming off it start, and my body has to learn to regulate hormones on its own again. I've read it can take a few months before things work themselves out again and weight loss can occur. 

I've got an appointment with my gyno next week to see if there's anything that can help in the meantime. Fingers crossed.
