> this sub's gonna get hit by a tsunami of trolls and misguided whackos in 3... 2...

While those groups may be annoying, they should be pretty small and I think the mods can handle it. I think the much worse impact will be huge masses of reasonably-intelligent, well-meaning people who are simply uneducated and inexperienced with the topics, ideas, and terminology used around here (particularly around feminism and political/social women's issues), whose ideas on those issues are mostly informed by popular culture, with all the misinformation and misconceptions that entails.  

We may be buried under a deluge of earnest and well-meant 'men also' and 'not all men' comments, 'reverse sexism' posts, a complete loss of whatever intersectionality we had, people getting pissy about the term 'privilege' because they were bullied in highschool and are having a hard time finding a job after college so obviously they're not privileged, etc.  

There's a whole lot of educating ahead of us if we want this sub to survive, which kinda sucks because there should be a place to have these discussions without having to stop and educate every 2nd post.  But, if we're lucky, maybe it will improve things on Reddit overall, eventually.
