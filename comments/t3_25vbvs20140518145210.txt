Does the dress poof out a bit and flounced if you twirl and jump?
It looks a bit like it might. (I always like skirts with these qualities). 

It fits you wonderfully, I like how it swoops and reveals the waterfall of lace.. I would bet that your friend doesn't like lace, which means it wouldn't be a good dress for her anyway. 

This might be a terrible idea, (I am known for terrible ideas) but I would be tempted to see if there is some small motif from the theme of your wedding that could be hidden amongst the lace. Coloured sparkles, tiny flowers. It would be a lot of work, but I feel it goes with the reveal idea.

Best of luck with your wedding.
