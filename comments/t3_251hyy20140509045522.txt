> NI's politicians represent the people

This isn't even true anymore. The politicians are in disagreement with the general public on nearly every large issue like this (abortion, gay marriage, fucking flags nonsense, etc). They pander the their most extreme followers because it's easy, they're all highly religious old white men and that no longer reflects the rest of the country here. Sadly some people still put tribal politics over real issues, but I am hoping for at least some visible change come the 22nd.

On your second point, it is wise to not ever mention NI and 'revolution' in the same sentence. If there is one thing that nobody wants here it's more violence and anarchy. We're in such a shit situation that all we can do is vote and peacefully protest and be privately frustrated every day that they continue not to listen.

SO no, I cannot imagine them thinking this was a 'good decision' for anything except money. Which is a horrific reason to make our women have to pay almost Â£1000 for a medical procedure just because our politicians are bigoted old men.
