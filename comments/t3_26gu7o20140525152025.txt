~~I have no experience with this, or pregnancy, but I think pregnancy generally only affects urinary continence when it's so far along that the bladder is being compressed by the uterus/fetus, so that one can probably be ruled out as the cause.~~ JK apparently frequent urination is one of the earliest symptoms of pregnancy, disregard me I spoke before I googled. But I would think you would feel it in this case, so I still doubt this is the cause.

I tend to have to pee very frequently when I have a UTI, but I always feel it, and that's the extent of my knowledge on bladder problems. Sorry. Hope it gets resolved quickly and that it's nothing serious.
