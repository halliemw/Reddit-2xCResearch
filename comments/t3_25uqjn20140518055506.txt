This happens a lot at my work. My work is a lot more casual though. lucky me I have a counter between me and the customers most of the time to keep that physical distance and I have a boss who doesn't give a shit if I tell a customer to fuck off if they start getting inappropriate. 

"Do you get called beautiful very often?" You could reply "Not usually in such a professional environment." in a joking manner that could give them the hint that they're making things awkward.

If they start bugging you, keep your replies short and just get back to your work. DONT laugh at their jokes. Ask "Is there anything else I can help you with sir?" making the point that your interactions are purely work related also helps. 

You're under no obligation to reciprocate flirting with someone if they're making you uncomfortable. At that point they're not there for your service, they're impeding your work and you could very well just ask them to leave if they get to that point. 

Try not to say that you have a boyfriend, just say you're not interested. Just because you have to be nice to them while you're on the clock, again, doesnt mean you have to reciprocate that interest to keep em happy.
