I think a good chunk of the problem might be the way you view yourself. It seems like you buying clothes for who you were/want to be and keep putting off that relationship for that same person. It's not a bad thing to want to improve and change, but it also sounds to me like you're not being kind to who you are right now.

Your weight doesn't determine your worth as a person or you diminish your right to be loved and have a happy relationship. Ultimately, it's very hard to make healthy and positive changes if you feel like crap. Take care of yourself, as you are, and the improvements will follow--because the fact that you're a person with thoughts and feelings and value has never changed and you need to be treated accordingly.

As for that guy, you might want to try being straight with him. I can't speak to your relationship but it sounds like you do like each other.  Something like, "I'm sorry, I keep delaying our meet up because I'm feeling unconfident with my appearance". You've been getting to know each other for a while and I think it's very likely he values you far beyond your appearance.
