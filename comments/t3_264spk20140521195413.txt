Major, major kudos for stepping up proactively and sensitively to help your baby girl. My mother assumed my depression, ADHD, and anxiety were willful sullenness, laziness, and anti-social snottiness. I suffered alone for so long before I finally got myself in therapy as an adult. I have made it my mission in life to be different for my young daughters and your example is inspiring. <3
