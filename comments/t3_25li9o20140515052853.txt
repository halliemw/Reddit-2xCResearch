Do your research before you donate. I've donated my hair twice (maybe 3x now) and I regret my first donation so much. 

I first donated to locks of love, as that is the famous organization. When I went to do it the second time I did some research and realize...they kind of suck. The wigs they give out aren't always free or even heavily discounted, they throw out tons of hair, they also sell a lot of hair to other wig suppliers.

For my second donation I used Pantene Beautiful Lengths as I had a lot of good things about them. For Pantene they only need 8inches.
