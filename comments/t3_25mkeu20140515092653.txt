OMG, it is terrifying! That's such a good idea, but knowing my luck, I will never find those  empty rolls in the trash.  Not to mention that I'd be grossed out to touch it?  Fuck knows where it has been. I had to use those cardboard rolls in emergency situations before! Might as well start collecting my own as of now.
