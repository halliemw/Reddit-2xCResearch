In truth, excercise does very little in helping you lose weight in comparison to a diet change. Skipping lunch and then having a big dinner by itself is probably not where your weight gain is coming from, unless you are excessively eating at dinner time. In reality it does not matter when you eat your calories, as long as the amount of calories you are ingesting are also what you are using. I suspect you are probably snacking a lot along with your large dinners or doing something you don't quite realise you are.
