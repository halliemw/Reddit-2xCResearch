But men and women both have body hair, at least on their legs and arms and armpits. I think a bush is fairly feminine because it highlights what isn't there, and thick, coarse facial hair and chest hair are masculine because while women do have some hair on their faces and that's completely natural, it's generally fairly fine hair. It may be that they have a lot of it, but typically each hair is thin and silky, while on men the shaft is generally thicker and coarser.
