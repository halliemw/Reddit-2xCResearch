Well, look around the world. Look at your own experiences, even the experiences here in 2x. We humans have done some messed up things to other people. We have all been harmed, and we have all caused harm as well... Varying degrees, yes, but we have all hurt and been hurt. 

We believe that we are loved by God. He treasures us, and by harming each other we have disobeyed him. We believe we will be held accountable for the ways we have hurt others. God loves us and has offered us forgiveness through the sacrifice of Jesus. He pays our penalty and has defeated death, which is our punishment. Through Jesus we don't have to die, we can live-- and not only that, but we are called to go out and bring restoration to the world. 

That's a quick and dirty explanation as I am walking out the door... Basically, we've all caused pain to others, and there will be justice brought for those actions. Without Jesus we stand guilty... Through Jesus, we are set free.
