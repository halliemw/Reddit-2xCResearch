Sure, I don't mean to discount that. But there is a risk of injury doing anything physical, I don't think dancing within the context of what cheerleaders do carries much more risk than something like playing pick-up games at the park. Injuries you're likely to see are a pulled muscle, or rolled ankle, not life altering injuries.
