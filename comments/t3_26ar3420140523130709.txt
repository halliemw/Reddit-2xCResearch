Honestly, yes.  If it's a factor of your attractiveness that is completely within your control, then it's a bit selfish not to consider his opinion at all.  Not that you have to conform to any of his ideals, but to not give "two shits" is awful.  Attraction is a big part of a relationship.  If my husband wanted to make huge changes in his appearance and didn't give two shits how I felt about it - that would really hurt my feelings.  But then again, I had to talk my husband out of eyelid tattoos...
