You know, I probably had a similar attitude a few years ago, I'm ashamed to admit that I thought it was just a weakness, and wanting to fill your body with chemicals is stupid. I couldn't understand my friends who were on antidepressants, because when I saw them, they seemed fine, so I thought they're just overreacting. But then my mother developed depression, and I saw first hand how mentally devastating it is, that yes, you can pretend to be ok for short periods of time in public, but I fully realized how difficult it is just to go through the motions. I see it with my friends now, many of them had the same attitude and when somebody close to them started to suffer similarly, it was an eye-opener. What I'm trying to say - it is difficult to fully comprehend it when you don't have an experience with depression. I am sure they don't mean it in a bad way, they're just happily ignorant, as I was. Do what you think is best for you. It IS valid. Everybody has experience with physical pain, so it is easy to empathize with a broken leg, but unless one has a closer experience with depression, it is difficult to imagine what it truly entails. Maybe your depression will eventually help them understand and be there for the next depressed person in their future. Good luck and I wish you all the best.
