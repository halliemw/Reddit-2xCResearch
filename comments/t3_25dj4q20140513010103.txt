I have a group of friends who I know through gay pride who are poly, sex-positive people, and although they prefer open relationships, I trust that no one in that group would *ever* cross boundaries in other people's relationships. The people who I've known who are a part of that culture, from my experience, tend to put a big emphasis on consent, boundaries, and respect. What this guy did constitutes sexual assault in my book. You're friends might think they're being open-minded by defending him, but equating homosexuality with sexual predation and promiscuity is homophobic, if anything.
