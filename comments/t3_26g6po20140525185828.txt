"It's not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you girls have never been attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It's an injustice, a crime, because I don't know what you don't see in me. I'm the perfect guy, and yet you throw yourselves at all these obnoxious men, instead of me, the supreme gentleman."

He sees there lack of attraction to him as an injustice, and a crime - because he is entitled to their attention but they are giving it to other people instead of him 'the supreme gentleman'.


Definitely entitlement.   He's talking about sex and attraction as if it is owed to him and is an injustice that it is not given to him - sounds like male entitlement - he is owed sex and deserves sex in his life simply because he is a guy and is also a 'supreme' kinda guy.  He bleats about being 22 and a virgin as if it's so shocking and terrible.. how could this happen to him etc etc?  That is definitely entitlement, and the 'male sense of entitlement to sex'.
And it's pretty toxic sounding too.. you know with the 'I'll slaughter you all' message at the end.

So...
