I'm bi.  In my life, I've had 3 girlfriends and 3 boyfriends, so I'm as close to 50/50 as it gets.  Though I find women to be more attractive to the eye and to the nose, and men more attractive by the touch and feel of them.  But I don't have a strong preference either way overall, I just wanna be loved.  ;)
