Thanks and congrats to you too!  I am just now in my third trimester and I gotta say...for me it hasn't really gotten more enjoyable!  I am just uncomfortable and feeling huge and awkward.  I am of course very excited for the end result though.  Hopefully the rest of your pregnancy is more enjoyable than mine!
