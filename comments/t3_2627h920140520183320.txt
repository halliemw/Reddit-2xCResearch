Considering not all boys do this, I'd say a great deal of it can be changed--culturally, by reminding boys that girls are people too.  You seem to be continually playing up that "men/boys are animals" angle and that's a huge disservice to all of the men and boys who feel these same impulses but teach themselves to dial them back.

Yes teenagers have less impulse control, but it doesn't mean they have none, and regardless this should never be the burden for a young girl in any case.

You may think /u/starfuzion is being too extreme in their example, but that's just more of the "boys will be boys" logic at work at a much more ramped up level.  If we don't hold boys up to expectations of behaviour (rather than just brushing it off as how teen boys behave) then we're doing both them and the people they leer at a disservice.
