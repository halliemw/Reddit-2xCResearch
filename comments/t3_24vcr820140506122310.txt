I completely and totally understand. I'm 25 and 4'11" (149 cm). I absolutely HATE shopping for clothes because I always have to get the "short" lengths of pants. When I got married last June they had to cut like 5-6 inches off the bottom of my dress. For prom I work a dress that was supposed to be teacup length (is that what it's called where it's like mid-calf?) but on me it went to the floor. I'm also pretty chubby (working on it...) so finding clothes that fit my height AND my ass are challenging.




I really get annoyed with my coworkers though, sometimes. I work in health insurance and I've worked hard to prove myself and move up in the company, and some of them (who technically I am their superior) love to make fun of my height. "Oh, I know I've asked you this over 9000 times but how tall are you?" "Jeez, my 11 year old is taller than you!" "Aww you're so adorable!"
