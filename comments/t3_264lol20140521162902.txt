you apparently overlooked my statements that he makes sexist comments, racist jokes, and overtly excludes women at his social events. And actually, the social events are the least of my worries (though that is where work relationships are really formed). 

>It doesn't sound like anyone did anything to you

That's my point. Having to hear a racist nickname multiple times is indirect harassment. It's against our company code of conduct. It doesn't have to happen TO me for it to make me feel uncomfortable.

Someone should speak up when a senior manager thinks it's ok to give someone a racist nickname or refer to young 20-somethings to as eye-candy *in the office*

This is why women don't confront a lot of mistreatment - we get called "betty buzzkill" because we call out bias when we see it.
