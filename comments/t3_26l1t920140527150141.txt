I always have a crazy amount of symptoms. Sore boobs, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, cravings, and the ability to smell EVERYTHING. I've always known well before any test could tell me.  

I had a a Dr literally laugh at me and tell me I had a virus because I was throwing up so much and I was asking for Zofran. He didn't believe me when I told him I was pregnant and the test came back negative. I was back less than two weeks later for an OBGYN referral.
