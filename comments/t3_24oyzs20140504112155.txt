Idk if anyone has mentioned this, but what I find really strange about the "submissive Asian woman" stereotype is that I have literally NEVER met an Asian woman who fits it. I think, generally, men fetishizes shyness for submissiveness. Every Asian woman I've ever met has (given time) shown herself to be both assertive and outspoken (especially with their boyfriends). 

I don't want to make it sound like I think all Asian women behave this way, but this has been my experience. I'm convinced that people who claim all Asian women are these meek, submissive, little flowers just haven't spent any time getting to know the people they fantasize about.
