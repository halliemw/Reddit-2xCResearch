Dude, in my country no one looks down on anyone for having a cut or uncut dick. A dick is a dick.i don't even know how common it is to be circumcised here unless you're religious.



We do look down on five year old girls being held down whilst their clitoris, inner labia, etc is removed, without anaesthetic, before fhey're sewn up so that there is only a terny, tiny whole left (for menstrating and urinating) so that one day, when they have sex, they're ripped to shreds and will never, ever enjoy sex.



Neither practice is good, but don't act all shitty in here because your country likes circumsized men. Start an awareness campaign and do some good to change it, don't start yelling about it *just* because you've seen something about girls being circumsized..
