I agree with Rina, and just want to chime in to say that I'm nursing while I type this and I love it. I eat like a trucker and the weight is still falling off. My baby is a pretty healthy dude, and snuggling with him while he eats is pretty nice. Plus, after the part where it hurts like hell, it starts to feel kind of pleasant. 

None of that is science, but you did ask for opinions. I purely endorse breastfeeding. Do it for yourself. Do it for your baby. Do it in public. Do it as long as you can.
