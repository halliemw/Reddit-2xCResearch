Don't get me wrong, they need to stop disturbing people now that she knows. But yeah, I save my anger for people who get loud by, say, smacking their kids around.  Loud sex - slightly annoying when it happened, worth saying something about, and amusing. To me, approach ing someone angrily is saved for people who are being nasty or abusive, or if it's a repeat issue. First time approach angry is a far more rude thing than oblivious loud sex. Out of those two neighbors, I'd rather have the loud sex couple that quiets down when asked over the angry-on-frst-go neighbor any day of the week.

I think anyone with an ounce of self awareness or empathy would know that most people who are approached over their loud sex are going to be a bit embarrassed by that conversation. Approaching that person with anger isn't problem solving; it's pettiness.
