I looked at your post history because I seriously thought you were a troll based on your comments here. Sadly, this is just how you are. 

Oh and I did copy the exact sentences I felt were assigning blame. Really. Go back and look. Geez. 

Seriously? Jealous of your condo? That's what you came up with? I'm not a child and intimidated by who has the shinier or bigger fire truck toy. That's just silly and sad of you.
