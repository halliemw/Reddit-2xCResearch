Usually if your BC hormone levels (or whatever) change each week (usually indicated by colour), then you have to get your period on the placebo week. But if not then check wit your doctor before hand and you can potentially do it! 

Edit: Just saw your other question and yes depending on the kind you use. I use a brand called Select and have to take a break and get my period once every three months. It's honestly awesome, my periods are super super light now and a quarter as painful as they once were.
