I understand entirely, and am a bit ridiculously pissed off. Not an hour after I read this and began posting to this thread, and other communities that are related, I received a PM that said "Do your inner pussy lips stick out?"

What the actual fuck, TwoX? Default status just opens up everyone to these sort of ridiculous criticisms - trolling or not, it's degrading to women in a forum that was INTENDED to be safe for women, =(
