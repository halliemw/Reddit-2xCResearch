I definitely think I need to take a page out of your book and learn (and become well-versed) in saying no. You make a really great point that there's no way this will be an enjoyable day for me and while I might not have more exciting plans, I'm sure anything else I choose to do that day will be less stressful. 

Another problem entirely is me investing in the problems of others, but hopefully I can learn to get past that as well. :)
