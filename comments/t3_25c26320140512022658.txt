I don't think there's a problem with displaying your emotions, as has been pointed out he was probably going to offer you a raise anyway. 

If the job is stressing you out that much though, you may want to reevaluate whether this is worth the money or not. Some jobs never are, either because of what you're doing, the people there or the workload/extra hours. And that's ok, but I've seen people take years and years to recognise that.
