Have a cellphone fully charged and handy at all times and a *very* loud whistle wrapped around your wrist or your neck.  Usually, people looking for trouble don't want noise and attention directed at them especially while following their target, so blow the whistle and make as much noise as possible, if you even suspect that you're being followed. Try to get to a safe, public area and call the police.  Don't think too much about whether or not you're mistaken. If it turns out to be nothing, you can always apologize.  Also, if at all possible, consider investing in a good self-defense class.
