I have had no problems whatsoever. I play with my boyfriend's friends sometimes, and although I suck because I'm not really into FPS and Starcraft, it's always lots of fun. By myself I play Guild Wars 2 (on a European server). I've never had problems and was recently invited into a guild. Nobody was even surprised that I'm a girl, and although the guild leader is a guy, there are lots of women on the guild. Friendly environment, good game. 

I guess it kind of depends on what you're playing and which servers you use.
