It sounds like you're frustrated because all of these strange men are objectifying you.  My advice: Stop caring whether they respect your not.  Who the hell are *they*?  You don't need them to value you in order to live your life fulfillingly.

That guy you texted was extremely inappropriate for sexting you after being rejected.  He probably thought that you had texted him because of some underlying desire to cheat on your boyfriend (revolting, I know) instead of just to be nice.  So my two cents is to not give these guys a second thought, and don't be nice to them.  You're under no obligation to offer any attention to any guy, ever (outside of doing the job you're paid for).

I also want to just add that it's not unfair for guys to ask women out based on their looks, but I do think it's tacky to ask a girl out while she's at work.
