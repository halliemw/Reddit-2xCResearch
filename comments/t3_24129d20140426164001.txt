A few things I know about HPV, based on my long abiding interest in sexuality and sexual health that has led me to do extensive research, and my own experience w/ being diagnosed w/ genital warts seven years ago:

Most sexually active adults will contract at least one strain of HPV.

The vaccine protects against a handful of them; those it protects against are the ones that scientific research has shown to be the most dangerous in terms of causing cancer, and 2 or 3 that cause warts.

The Nurse Practitioner who diagnosed me told me that all the current science shows that the strains that cause warts do not cause cancer. Subsequent OB/Gyn's have affirmed this for me, as has my research.  We may learn otherwise, but this is what the data show at present.

Most cases of HPV are cleared by the body w/ no complications.

So no matter what, even if the doc who speculated based on a picture is correct, you should be fine, and you're not alone.
