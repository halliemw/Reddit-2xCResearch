You need to take the two years and change it from something bad to something good. Because trust me two years aren't that long. I've been in college for two years now and while it does seem forever ago it simultaneously feels like just yesterday!! You are lucky in that you have a pretty solidly set date for when the distance will end so that makes it a lot easier for you to push through any problems the distance is specifically causing. And it will cause problems you just have to brace yourself for that. And make sure that you and your partner are totally capable of really good communication. Naturally this is key in any relationship but particularly long distance.
