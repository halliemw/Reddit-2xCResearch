That's a good question. Umm maybe? We don't know. They think it has some genetic component.

Kiddo's best friend is identical symptomatically. They have looked at every thing they can, but we don't have a reason.  

Kiddo also had an adverse reaction to a vaccine in the first round of shots. It causes swelling of the brain. There is many reasons Kiddo is special needs. It's likely a combo of several of these things... at this point I'm not looking at why, just trying to help my kiddo learn and grow as much as possible.
