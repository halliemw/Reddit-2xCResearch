I'm totally a yay on this one.

My last dating spree was with a younger guy, I'm 25 and he's 20, and besides obvious things such as school / work differences, it was good times.

I think 20 is probably my cut off line and, as shallow as it may be, I probably wouldn't have gone out with him had he not been so very hot but I would do it again for sure.

You do notice some differences but if your head is in the right place, it's a lot of fun. As dating should be :)
