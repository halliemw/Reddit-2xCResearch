Target sells Hanes underwear that are basically boxer briefs without the dick pocket! Also fruit of the loom bikini undies I've found my big butt don't eat as much as slippery ones or anything. If you get the right size they don't look all baggy either.  Honestly I've tried a bunch of different boy short style underwear and I find they are instant wedgie-makers, they just legitimately go half-way down the cheeks and then ten minutes later they're in the crack. 

Lasenza (do they have those in the states? I guess they're owned by Victoria Secret, but they're a little cheaper) has cotton undies that are a cross between a bikini and a boy short that don't get up my ass quite as much.  Aside from that,  Winners/Marshalls tends to carry Calvin Klein, which are the best underwear I've ever put on my butt. Highly recomend. Very soft, very cute. They also carry men's boxer briefs that are SUPER SUPER soft and not crazy expensive, you could get some smaller ones from there.
