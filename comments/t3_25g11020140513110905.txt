Whenever privilege comes up in conversation a lot of people get super defensive and say that "I can't help that I was born white/male/upper class/whatever!" Nobody is asking you to "help it" and go back in time to be born under different circumstances, and the intent isn't to make you feel guilty. It's just important to be aware of it and how it affects other people. Because once you're aware of your privilege, you can use it for good and stop perpetuating systems that oppress others. That's the goal.
