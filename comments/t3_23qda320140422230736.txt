Keep in mind, too, that nationals can look very, very good on college applications, and even job applications later on. 


You should not feel guilty for feeling hurt. You have a right to feel hurt. At the same time, ohkatey is right, your boyfriend should go to the nationals.


You guys can get through this. It was shitty timing, you didn't get to do something you looked forward to together, but it's not the end of the world or a dealbreaker.


Tell him its ok for him to go to nationals, but only if he takes you out for a super romantic dinner when he comes back! :D Go to a fancy restaurant and wear the dress!
