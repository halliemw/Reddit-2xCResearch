I'm 22 and I work in a college library, but if I'm in a suit, I still get "ma'am"ed.

I don't think I've been called me "miss" since high school, unless someone 20 years older is trying to get my attention at a train stop. I think I'm going to bring back the "miss" now when I don't know someone's name. I like it.
