Don't feel awful, you didn't do anything wrong.  You do not exist for the sole pleasure of another person.  As long as your partner really, truly cares about, your comfort is all that should matter.  My husband doesn't enjoy sex if I am uncomfortable in any way.  We will stop or adjust.  It's not a big deal in any way if things go awry no or years from now.  All that matters is that you and your partner are supportive of one another.

Sex for the first time is different for everyone.  A good rule of thumb, whether it is your first time or 100th time is to make sure you have some sort of foreplay to get you in the mood.  Or perhaps a little lube can speed things along if you feel you need the help.  Sex is a fun, funny, awkward thing we do that brings a great deal of intimacy and pleasure...or shenanigans.  Hopefully someday you can laugh about it.  I know it all new and you are probably very insecure about a lot of small things but as you get older and have more sex you will learn to be more at ease when things don't see to go perfect.

Not everyone bleeds a ton.  Some people do.  Our vajays are all different.  Don't be afraid to take some time to heal before having sex again.  It may still be uncomfortable or painful the next time, but try to relax and not tense up.  That can make it more painful for you.  For me, personally, it took a few months of sex to stop hurting.  Maybe it was my own nervousness or my guy's huge dong?  Who knows?
