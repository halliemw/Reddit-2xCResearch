You talked about how young men are "conditioned" into thinking they're losers if they're in the friend-zone, which I agree with, and that's what I mean by having "issues." Talking about the friend-zone as if it's a real thing is not helping anyone, men or women. If we're ever going to "uncondition" men into thinking/feeling that way when they're rejected, we have to stop using that term. And I didn't downvote you.
