I got my ears pierced as a pre-teen, but I kind of regret it now. Pretty much any and every earring I've ever worn has cause my ears to become puffy, itchy, and start oozing. Some metals, like good silver (not Sterling!) and gold don't affect them quite as much, but even those "for sensitive ears" ones don't help. Yet, I've gone years at a time without wearing earrings and the holes *still* won't close up.
