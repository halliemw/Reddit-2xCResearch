Yep - go and see the doctor rather than asking the internet. And seriously, take this as a wakeup call. If he refused to use protection with you, he probably refused to use protection with the last woman he slept with. And if she was okay with that, she was probably okay with the last guy refusing, too. And on and on...you don't know HOW many people you effectively bumped uglies with that night.

If your doctor tells you it's a yeast infection, make a habit of wearing cotton panties and boil-washing them between wearings. Wear stockings instead of pantyhose. Use unscented soaps, and for goodness sake don't douche. If s/he says it's cystitis, make a habit of keeping well-hydrated and also drinking cranberry juice. These steps should help to reduce the risk of future problems.

But DO NOT try those things INSTEAD of going to see your doctor. Unidentified problems related to your reproductive organs are nothing to fuck about with, pun totally intended.
