I don't think that's OK.

It makes sense for public-facing employees, such as reception and sales, to be trained on personal presentation but this should apply to men as well. These people are the public face of the company and should present themselves as such.

Giving the same training to non-public facing employees (e.g. office management) and back-office employees (e.g. switchboard) just because they're women, however, looks very sexist. In these positions, as long as the dress code is met, work product ought to matter much more then appearance.  Appearance training gives the wrong impression that these people are there as eyecandy and that's not appropriate.
