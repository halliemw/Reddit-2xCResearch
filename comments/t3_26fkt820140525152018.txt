I've been hit on a couple times at work.  The instant I start to feel uncomfortable, I smile and excuse myself, saying that I have some paperwork I need to do in the back room.  Or some shelves that need to be stocked.  Or a question for my boss.  Then I make myself scarce.  It doesn't address their bad behavior, but it gets you out of the situation quickly, and looks very professional.
