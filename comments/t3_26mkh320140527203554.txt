I think you're just trolling badly, but if you take away the assholery, there's something valid there. It can be very challenging to date a survivor, depending on the situation. My SO was molested as a kid, mentally and physically abused by her parents, and date raped as a teenager. A few years later on, her sister was a victim of statutory rape. It took years for her to fully trust me, and for me to figure out most of her triggers. It was a long and painful learning process for both of us, and it still continues. We have a deep, loving, and fulfilling relationship, but it takes a lot of work.
