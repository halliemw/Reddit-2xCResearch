The whole point is to build awareness that women are ultimately just people. 

If a friend opened your eyes to something you didn't know before, isn't it polite and friendly to say "wow, thanks, I didn't know that, you really opened my eyes".

It's not pandering, it's being a person. Why do we expect women to be seen as human but when a guy posts something totally human-seeming, he's bashed?

I appreciate his appreciation. He could have unsubscribed, or trolled, or whatever but instead he said 'thanks'.
