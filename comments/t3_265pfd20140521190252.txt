Don't give up on online things, tinder, meet ups, etc. I really clicked with my high school sweetheart but we broke up freshman year of college, then didn't really click with *anyone* through college. I dated a bit, but it was very casual and never lasted longer than six months.

It took six years to meet someone I finally really clicked with. I'm starting to realize that all the casual dates taught me something and made me grow as a person and I might not have been ready for my current relationship otherwise.
