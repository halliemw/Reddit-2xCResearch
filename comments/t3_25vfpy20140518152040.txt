Based solely on the fact that she did not immediately withdraw the offer (she claims regretting it on the drive home and deciding that she would not go through with it no matter what in that moment yet did not inform  the person presenting the offer of this) I lean toward 'saving face'. I really do hope that they sued her for every penny they gave her throughout the surrogacy plus damages for breach of contract.
