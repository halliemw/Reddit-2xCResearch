While I didn't have this experience with Nuvaring, I read about many women who did suffer from lower sex drive/libido while using it. If you're able, you might want to talk to your doctor about a different form of birth control (although you might want to wait another month, as BC usually takes about 3 months for the body to "settle" after the hormone changes).
