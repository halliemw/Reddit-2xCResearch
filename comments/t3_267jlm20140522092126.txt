This is really hard. As a Christian, I wonder if this church is a manipulative church... And perhaps they use their members for their own gain. 

I follow Jesus. I have given him my life and I submit all to him. However-- my church elders have led me well. I love my family. I use my God given talents. I don't give so much as to put us in debt... Doing that is irresponsible. There is a line between living selfishly and not giving enough, and being abused and manipulated into giving too much.

I wonder if a more healthy church would help. His church should lead him in being loving towards his family, and if it's driving him to something other than love, there is a problem. It sucks that there are some really shitty and abusive churches around.
