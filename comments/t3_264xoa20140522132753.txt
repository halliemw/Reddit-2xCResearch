Update to my earlier comment: [Here's](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/05/22/buyer-beware-can-trust-cheap-plan-b-one-step-amazon-com/?utm_source=nar.al&utm_medium=urlshortener&utm_campaign=FB) an article that was just posted by NARAL. Basically, the argument comes down to this:

> It is normal for prices to vary from store to store, but such a steep drop in price raises red flags, especially since the wholesale acquisition cost (the cost for wholesalers to purchase the product from the manufacturer, Teva Women’s Health) is estimated to be $32.50 for Plan B One-Step. Wholesalers then sell the product for an estimated $39.00. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that any Amazon.com vendor would be able to acquire Plan B One-Step wholesale and sell it for $16 without taking a substantial financial hit.

Of the different Amazon sellers investigated by the articles' authors, Pharmacy Consultants seemed the most cooperative/forthcoming with information:

>Another vendor, who operates under the name Pharmacy Consultants and sells Plan B One-Step for $16.90, replied to RHTP’s requests stating that he was a licensed pharmacist and was able to sell the product at a deep discount because of a wholesale supplier, although this information is not available on the seller page. When asked about his credentials, the vendor replied that he was a licensed pharmacist in Ohio. He was clear to note that his product “is not from [a] family planning clinic or shop lifted medication.” One review noted that the product’s box arrived opened, the foil encasing the pill was ripped, and the pill was cut in half. After the reviewer notified the seller, he sent her a new package immediately. Another reviewer noted that the product they received was close to being expired.

Still not sure what to think, since the package I received had been opened, but it seems that this was done to add an anti-theft sticker, and the pill itself didn't appear to be tampered with.

One thing that I read in the article that I wasn't aware of before: **apparently thanks to the ACA, if you have health insurance, emergency contraception should be covered, just like any other oral contraception.** I just logged in to my insurance plan's website, and ran it through the "drug cost estimator" - it checks out! Apparently I wasted $60 at CVS *and* $20 on Amazon, because my copay would have been $0 if I had used my insurance card!
