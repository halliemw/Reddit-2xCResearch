Hi! I'm going to guess you're new here (and welcome!), so I want to thank you for contributing and encourage you to stay and keep contributing. 

In this case, though, it's totally impractical for OP to have to ask a guy to come get her so she can go anywhere, or to buy a motorcycle.

There's not really much that can be done to help (maybe the counseling bit to help deal with it); she can't suddenly hit the big red button and freeze all the assholes of the world until she's gone about her day. (Nor can the rest of us.) BUT!!! What OP asked for was **to be believed**. She just needs someone else out there to confirm that she's not crazy or alone in this. And she's not - so we just offer her the mental support she requested.

Take care of your friends! They're lucky to have a friend like you who cares, and we're glad you're here, too.
