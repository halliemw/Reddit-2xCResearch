Well, one can at least say he lived. There is a certain charm to living fast and dying young, although that charm may be more rhetorical rather than actual.

I have experienced similar joy with the pets I used to own. The stuff I'd do to make sure those animals were loved and cared... made it even harder when they died. It's like a little chunk of yourself is ripped out. Hell, I couldn't go to work the following day because of the pain.

However, I am glad that I got to enjoy my time with them. As non-human they were, they were my true friends in a sense. They never judge you like humans tend to do. 

I don't really expect myself to just boil. After the aforementioned experiences last year I've been on guard. A kind of a PTSD in regards to physical ailments. Almost as if I am just waiting for that excuse to jump out.

The sacrosanct aspect of living is mostly cultural conditioning. In my mind most likely created by men and women that intended to control people through moral fear. It's amazing how much guilt there is in society, considering how useless it is. One rarely benefits from guilt, unless it's the guilt others have perhaps.

Here is the funny part though. In my day to day life I am not this morose or depressive outwardly. I am the person that in the company of others might appear as if on cocaine all the time. I make jokes, fool around, and just do zany things. "Life is too serious to be taken seriously," kind of person. Just here that this side gets out.
