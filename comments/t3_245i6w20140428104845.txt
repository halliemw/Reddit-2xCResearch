Horse riding favors the long-legged.  As a taller than average female who has been riding most of my life, I know that my long legs give me an advantage.  They also help me balance out my heavier than normal torso.

I spent years feeling inferior to other females because of my size,  Like others have said, i wasn't dainty and therefore felt that I wasn't feminine.  I think what would have helped me, and what you can do for your daughter, is show her how much you appreciate your wife.  Praise your wife's height, speak well of how it makes her strong, feminine and beautiful.  My father spent many years cutting down my mom for being heavy - what I got out of it was that being heavy (as well as tall) as well made me less of a woman.  I look like my mother, chances are your daughter looks like her mother.  If my father had shown me that my mother was still a desirable, appealing woman, it would have done a lot for me when I was in that younger, insecure stage.
