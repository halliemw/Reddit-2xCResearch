I recommend cryotherapy if you go that route. I had two moles on my face that, besides being rather noticeable, also had the bad habit of growing long hairs. Sometime in my 20s, I had them frozen off -- it was easy, cheap, didn't leave a scar, and stopped the hair growth forever. The skin there is still a little darker but nothing foundation can't handle.
