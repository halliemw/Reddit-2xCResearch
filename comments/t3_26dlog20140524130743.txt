Even though not speaking to them might seem unreasonable, I would probably feel the same way. Not only did she betray your trust (after having told her NOT to tell about it to her husband) but also possibly ruin the planned surprise for your boyfriend. Her not being able to respect your wishes didn't do any good. 


I suggest you let her know how you feel (or maybe you already have considering their thoughts on you not speaking to them). And as it was mentioned before, that person is not someone you can trust. 


However, as some people have already mentioned, you should definitely consider your own actions as well, no matter how uncool the whole text thing is.
