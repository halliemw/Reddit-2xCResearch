Sorry about typing Marlene there, I meant Tess.

But about your argument, I do agree that much of it was a father daughter story, but I think the trust issues really only run one way:

When does Ellie show reticence to trust or form relationships?

She regret's Tess's death a lot after knowing her for less than 24 hours.

She regrets Sam's death months later after knowing him for less than 48.

It seems like she quite quickly forms relationships and has no attachment issues.

And the story is about moving Ellie cross country so that she can be the savior of humanity with her uniqueness. The father-daughter development is the primary characterization of the two most significant characters in that story. The story about Ellie.
