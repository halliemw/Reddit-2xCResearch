Please feel free to! I have a most irrational love of planning things, including events.

One other bit of advice I forgot  - I attended a wedding in Seattle that had many lovely elements, but the brides (plural) couldn't afford to really throw the wedding they did. So, to save money they had all their relatives and closest friends act as wait staff and bartenders and such. They worked SO hard. I thought it was super sad - the most important people to them, the people in your life who will act as a waiter for strangers for you, weren't enjoying the party, and instead it was like distant relatives and college friends partying.

So don't do that. Not that you suggested you would, but I think they would have had a much more personal and lovely and heartfelt wedding at some venue with THOSE dear friends and family and screw inviting everyone else. You know? If you can't afford it.

Also, beware of the phenomenon that is the pack - if you invite your great-aunt Tancy, you also have to invite her husband, and his daughter from his first marriage, and that means her husband, and they never travel without their teenage kids, and if you invite Tancy, you can't exclude Aunt Wheezy, because even though you're not as close to her, it will insult Tancy TOO and then you have to give Wheezy her plus one, which is Uncle George . . . etc. 

Small, tight, contained guest lists = less money. Other option is the "Wheeee monopoly money!" version of a big crazy wedding, which is fun, but only if you actually have a budget where you can pretend it is monopoly money. In my opinion this is best enjoyed by multi-millionaires and people marrying rich. Otherwise writing those checks for one day HURTS.
