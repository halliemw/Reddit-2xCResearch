> There is no action that can be carried out by a person without the risk of impacting cognition.  

"Impacting cognition" and "mental  health issues" are two very different things. Any sort of stressful or involved decision can impact impact cognition; that doesn't mean that disruption automatically classifies as mental illness.    

But you know what's actually more dangerous to a woman's mental health than an abortion? [Being denied autonomy over her own body](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881979/).  

> Beside we're not discussing post abortion, we're talking about right to terminate at a moment's notice.   

More misleading rhetoric. The religious right loves to paint this picture of fickle, irresponsible whores who go down to the salon, get their nails done, and then pop over to the local PP to kill a baby or two. That's so condescending, patronizing and so far removed from reality that it's disgusting.
