I hate that this article refers to TwoX as a feminist forum. It is a women's issues forum and nothing else. Not all women identify as feminists, we are not a monolithic block. We also have many center left, moderate, and conservative women in this forum. This subreddit is apolitical, quit trying to box all women into a political mold. Not all of us are mindless idiots spewing regurgitated antiquated anachronistic ideology, many of us prefer to think for ourselves.
