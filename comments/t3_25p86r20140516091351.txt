> stand by what I did. It makes me worried that we as fellow women are so willing to treat other women so crassly to, what, get a funny Instagram selfie? 

From what you've said, this didn't sound sexual or gendered - they were just laughing at how drunk and passed out your friend was.  

This is pretty damn innocent.  I've had this done to me dozens of times, and in worse states than sleeping.  Now those photos stand as great memories (and warnings...)

What's the big deal?  What is being gained or lost by her having a drunken selfie taken?  She was drunk, and likely not accidentally, and she wasn't assaulted.  

> It just seems like such a violation.

I mean, going into her bedroom, sure I can see that as a violation.  But again, in my time of doing these things, my bedroom was not off limits for others to enter, and often neither were my friends'.  And if it was off limits, it got locked - drunk people wander and look for beds to have sex in.  Maybe she's just not as concerned as you are.



I guess I'm just wondering what exactly what was so wrong here?  IMO, I would've addressed the issue with her when she woke up, not knowing her stance on it.
