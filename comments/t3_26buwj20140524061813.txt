My auntie has been bugging me to lose weight for years. I told her how much I had lost and she just looked at me and asked how much more was I going to lose.

Both those guys that I saw rarely get female attention. But the first one took me for granted and the second thinks he can find someone better and skinnier than me.

My parents just act as if I'm a disappointment to them. Even though I have 3 siblings and I'm the only one to go to university. I think part of it was that from about age 7-13 I got quite a few achievement awards from school. But then after that I was 'only' slightly above average and am now at a mid-ranking university.
