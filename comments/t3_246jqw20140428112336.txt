Mine's a toddler now and I actually miss the rush of being in demand 24-7. I have my energy back but I'm a better person now than I was beforehand. 

I also found that when I was so tired and stressed post-baby I couldn't bear the sight of my clutter, so I found my get-up-and-go and threw it all out.  The housework gets done more now because I got used to constantly doing laundry and clearing up spills. I am now always either folding something or wiping something, and if the washing machine is empty I feel uncomfortable until it's running again!
