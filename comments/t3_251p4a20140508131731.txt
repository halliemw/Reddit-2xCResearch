Absolutely; I couldn't think of a way to work in an active agent into the whole stove-house thing. Perhaps it's more a case of going up to a friend after their house was actively burned down by a pyromaniac and saying, "well what the fuck were you thinking owning a stove?"

I wanted to write something much longer, in response to /u/DinoDash's comment, but I couldn't un-angry myself enough to point out that there's a big honking difference between "dissenting opinions" and engaging in rape apologia and victim blaming.
