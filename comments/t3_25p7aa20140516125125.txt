> How about you stop whining about meaningless down votes you've received for voicing unpopular opinions

The OP NEVER said that (s)he agrees with any of those unpopular opinions (in fact, they stated that they were pro-choice on one). 

 > It's also a very popular opinion outside GOP enclaves that one should be pro-science and there's nothing wrong with that. If fact, being ANTI-Science is indefensible and utterly ignorant. 

It was pretty obvious that by "pro-science," they meant unquestioning and uncritical of any scientific claims (pop-science and sensationalist claims are HUGE problems on reddit and the Internet community in general. People are becoming obsessed with the ideology of scientism and discovering new, ground-breaking things rather than supporting the scientific method itself, regardless of how boring or disappointing the results turn out). Maybe pro-science may have not been the best term, and you could have called them out on this, but if you read the context, it was pretty clear what they meant.

 >  Maybe you should be spending your time at conservareddit.com. I'm SURE your opinions would be very popular there. 

You're attacking a strawman here. It's fine if you want to question the notion of "all opinions are equal," but the OP never stated that they agreed with these opinions, nor that they are a conservative.

 > No one ANYWHERE that I've ever read here thinks that abortion in any phase is 100% acceptable. Stupid claim on the face of it.

I do agree with you on this, but there really is no need to be hostile.


And maybe you're right that they are unpopular opinions that shouldn't necessary receive praise, but the point of downvoting is to separate spam, trolls, and rude posts from genuine posts, not to downvote those that contribute to respectful discussion, regardless of whether you may agree with them or not (which is why I downvoted you - you are not contributing to respectful discussion by being rude)
