Of course! It's obvious, and demonstrably so, as can be seen by the lower rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion in places with good sex ed and good access to multiple options for birth control. 

But while I agree that responsible behaviours can be taught, there is an element of innate personality in it too - some people are just less responsible, regardless of their situation. And I honestly believe that in those cases, forcing someone who is like that to take on *even more responsibility*, in the form of responsibility for another human being's development, is so wrong-headed I have trouble understanding how anyone could think it's a good idea.
