Pregnancy really is very difficult for so many women. I feel like all that gets focused on is "the glow" and how wonderful and amazing every pregnant woman ever must feel. And who cares if you're miserable, you're bringing forth life so get over it! I'm sorry to hear that you're suffering too and hope your husband comes around to being more supportive. Thank you for sharing your story with me <3
