i understand why people get pissy about it because guys are usually whiny babys about it lady stuff. i have 2 brothers and once my dad had to pick up my bc after my brothers baseball game. he came home and was like dont ever make me do that again. i said dad would you rather i have a baby? i could have made you buy me tampons! so then i followed him around the house screaming vagina, uteris, period, cramps, crotch blood, tampon, pads. i was really angry, for gods sake man you have a daughter and a wife you watched the birth of a baby get over it. i was pmsing and being a bitch but it made me feel beter and he stopped complaing. i also like to think my brothers are considerate of their gfs stuff because of me.
