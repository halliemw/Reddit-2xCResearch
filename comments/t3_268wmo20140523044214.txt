I had my first experience with oral when I was about 18. I didn't really care for it and thought it felt "weird" more than anything. It wasn't until I was 21 with another bf (and a less experienced one at that!) that I really started to enjoy it and even want it. A huge part for me getting into it and loving it, had to do with how enthusiastic my partner was for it. My first couple bf's didn't seem interested enough in it for me to feel like they were doing something that I should be enjoying. Between being more comfortable about my vagina and having guy go crazy on it because he wanted to and clearly loved it changed my perspective entirely. I like to also keep in mind that lots of guys are just as unsure as we are about whether or not they're satisfying their partner. I think  giving them some feedback (without faking it of course) through audible moans, or straight up telling them how you like it gets rid of a lot of that "am I doing it right?" tentativeness plenty of guys have, and will improves the experience for you both. Hope this helps :)
