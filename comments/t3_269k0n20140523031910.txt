I don't think "calling someone bad names" is the worse sort of bullying that can occur, and, barring coordinated efforts, I don't think it's easy or helpful to moderate all bullying.  Also I believe companies will err on the side of censoring all critical speech of any person, rather than judging what is too harmful.  I would see that as a serious danger.

"*to call a witch hunt against someone*" would be the important issue here, not being rude to someone online.

As an example, let's say I call some racist or fascist a "monster," who is supporting the murder and exploitation of many innocent people.  That could very well hurt that person, and they'd certainly think it was uncalled for since they see their own beliefs as reasonable.  Depending upon what they are advocating, does that make my insulting language necessarily abusive or incorrect, or deserving of censorship?

EDIT:  Oh, and, sorry, you're right.  I assumed you would support legislation to prevent online bullying, but that was unsupported by your statement.  (perhaps I went that direction because of the discussion of freedom of speech?)  I guessed you'd want a formalized system to prevent bullying, which is tantamount to legislation.  If you'd expect a formalized system without legislation, though voluntary agreement between organizations, I really don't see how that would be much better than legislation.  In many ways it could be worse.  Regardless, I don't believe that even private censorship of things that could be considered "mean" is a good idea, and I don't think it would be easy to censor only that which is likely to be harmful.  I want people to be able to insult me as honestly as they feel is appropriate ;)
