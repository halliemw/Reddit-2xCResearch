we might disagree over what is considered "classical" music. jim morison the vocalist from the doors, was a heroine addict. 

smoking cigarettes would also be comparable with being fat. basically it is something that is bad for you. it causes you to die younger. it causes many health problems. it should be discouraged for people to do it. it should be looked at as a medical problem. it should taxed. it should be made to be an option that is not valid for children to allowed to do. if parents allow their children to do it, it should be considered child abuse. and there shouldn't be a social stigma against saying that it is an unattractive and undesirable trait. also it makes you smell bad.
