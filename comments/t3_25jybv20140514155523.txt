It's basically about what the woman wants. She gets precedence over the parasite in her body; it's a medical condition. The example you mentioned about someone killing the fetus inside of a pregnant woman and getting charged with murder definitely seems like a legal grey area...the language would have to be worded carefully in a law like that so that it doesn't allow abortion providers to be charged with murder. 

You say "pretty much" pro-life. Do you think no woman should be allowed to have an abortion?
