I thought so too.  I had sex ed at age 16.  My school taught "mainly abstinence, but we'll teach you how to use a condom" sex ed.  I had sex at an early age and laughed at most of it (I wasn't pregnant and I didn't have an std!)  but the other kids in my sex ed class were knowledgeable and made the sex ed lady look like a fool.  I'm sorry that didn't happen with you.  

Also public school, almost inner-city.
