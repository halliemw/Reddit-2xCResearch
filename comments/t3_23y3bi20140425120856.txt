I can't speak to that because I don't know what you're referring to. But to say most/all women hate their bodies is an awful thing to say.

Sure maybe at some point everyone has said, "UGH this sucks about me." But, that doesn't mean they feel that every day all the time. I have certainly been unhappy with my hair/tummy/butt at some specific time or the other. But generally? I like me. A lot!
