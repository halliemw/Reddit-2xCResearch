I'm glad we agree that many men don't understand the definition of rape. I'm glad we agree that we should tell men to stop touching women without their consent. I'm glad we agree that if men stopped raping, there wouldn't be 1 in 3 or 1 in 6 women being raped, most often by someone she knows. I'm very glad we agree that men need to be told not to rape.
