I have seen this on here for a while now.  I rarely even come into this subreddit, the front page is usually 60-70% rape posts and then 10-15% abortion posts and the rest are a mix of relationship issues and occasionally a post from the news.

I have nothing against discussing rape, but TwoX seems at times obsessed with the topic.  This is a wildly unpopular opinion and I expect downvotes.  I don't care about downvotes though, so its fine.

I don't know why, but if you go into a subreddit that has been around for a while, there already exists an ideology that is accepted and anything else outside that framework is downvoted to oblivion.  Some examples (whether I agree with these or not doesn't matter, just tossing out examples):

* TwoX - abortion at any phase pregnancy is 100% okay and any opinion outside that is deeply unwelcome. On TwoX, an unwanted pregnancy is a lump of whatever.  A wanted pregnancy lost to miscarriage is met with great amounts of kindness and sympathy.  (I offer no personal opinion here, but its what I've seen.  I'm pro-choice.)

* Loseit - just eat at a calorie deficit, no other restrictions on your diet should exist ever.

* Tea - Do not buy tea from Teavana ever.  Adagio Teas or bust.  

* Television - You have to love the following shows: Breaking Bad, Sopranos, The Wire, and GoT.  If you don't believe these shows aren't the greatest things to have ever been on television, you should keep that to yourself.

* Skincare Addiction - Never, ever, ever leave your house without layers of SPF 100 slathered on your skin. Any bit of UV hitting your skin is about the worst thing that can happen.

* Personal Finance - Whatever you do, don't buy a house unless you have at least 20% down payment, 6 months of savings on top of that and never, ever buy a new car.  

* General Reddit - Typically any conversation around God or religion is soundly discounted, atheism is huge around here.  Pro-legalization of marijuana, pro-gay marriage, must hate ISP's and especially Comcast for hte Americans, should be pro-science at all costs and never question the research (even though there are so many examples of science finding out what htey previously learned was wrong).  Pay your bills.  Fuck student loans. 

These are just a tiny sampling of accepted beliefs.  If you go against these ideas by saying, "Hey, I lost 40 lbs by restricting carbs and working out" on /r/Loseit, you will be congratulated but then told that it was the caloric deficit only and anything else is insane.  But venture over to r/paleo and they'll tell you the opposite.  Everyone is losing weight, everyone is happy, but there is little crossover happening.

And to all of that, all I can say is, "Its Reddit."
