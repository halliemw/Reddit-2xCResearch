Evaporater has given some great advice here.  I just want to chime in and say that I have been in very VERY similar situations with one of my ex's.  I didn't take these kinds of red-flags that seriously, because I loved him.  He would occasionally get aggressive or violent, and nonsensical, much in the way you've described the events with your boyfriend.  He became the father of my child, which made my emotional attachment to him even stronger, and made the idea of leaving him even more daunting, but nonetheless, I learned the hard way that red-flags should not be ignored.  That kind of behavior is never a completely isolated event.  Like evaporater said, those violent thoughts and statement DID come from somewhere inside of him.  Alcohol doesn't CAUSE those thoughts, it only brings them to the surface.  My ex became progressively more violent with me as time went on, and eventually alcohol was not needed to bring it out.  He beat me, insulted me, distrusted me, ridiculed me, and cut me off from the outside world.  His family defended him through and through, always assuming I'd done something to deserve it, and looking back I know more clearly than ever that NOTHING I could have ever every done would have warranted such terror.  You are very very lucky to have family of your own that want to help you, I was not so lucky.  I wish I could say that I left him on my own because I finally decided enough was enough, but that wasn't really the case.  Eventually he just stopped coming home, and I found he'd been seeing someone else.  Men like this (any PEOPLE like this) are not suitable as life-long mates.  

I know it is hard for you because you feel a connection with him, you love him, but I promise you, I GUARANTEE you, that there is someone better out there who will not have these deep-seeded violent tendencies.  I promise.
