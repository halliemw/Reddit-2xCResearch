I think laser hair removal sounds like a good option for you.  It works the best on light skin with dark hair.  And while it doesn't always make hair go away completely, if you are looking to thin down your hair, a couple sessions would work great for that.

If you have Groupon or Living Social, keep your eye out for deals.  Otherwise it can be pretty expensive.  I've been getting laser treatments on my bikini zone, so feel free to message me with any questions on the experience.  Good luck!
