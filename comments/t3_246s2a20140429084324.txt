I dunno. I think it's a bit of an exaggeration to say that there's absolutely no reason for it to be there. Background noises have one kind of impact, something actually happening on-screen has an entirely different one. You could argue that the entire series could be in old time radio series format and would technically be correct, but that doesn't mean that on-screen actors are "100% unnecessary."
