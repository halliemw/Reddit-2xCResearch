I've said it before and I'll say it again. This guy's videos were absolutely deranged. But I can go into TRP right now and find comments/posts that say basically the same shit that Elliot was saying. Are those guys going to murder people? Maybe, maybe not. It's not *just* his misogyny that was the issue. But this hatred of women has been normalized. Even guys who totally have their head on straight and are kind and compassionate, are more likely to ignore TRP than to outright condemn it. I don't know why people find it acceptable. People just brush it off as "oh, they're just socially awkward males who don't know any better - just ignore them!" People who spout hatred like this should not be ignored. It's pretty much "boys will be boys." Hell even the police were like "this guy sounds legit" even after viewing some of his videos. How??? *NO* guy who talks like that is legit, regardless of whether or not they are mentally ill, or have any violent tendencies. It's ridiculous that we still brush this off.
