What bearing does your comment have on the point that men do this? It's a non sequitur.

Is it a rational retort in a comparable situation? "Rich bankers have defrauded millions." "Poor people commit fraud too." Obviously not.

The author never claimed that *only* men dismiss arguments by belittling their opponents.

This is a perfect example of the derail tactic people are speaking about in another thread right now. That women us similar tactics is completely irrelevant to the discussion.
