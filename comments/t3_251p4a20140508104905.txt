I agree with you. I hate seeing the misogyny. But it's been there well before Two X was a default. 

And that reaction is a lot of people's reaction to reddit already--it's not a great place for women.

As I said, it could or could not work. I'm interested to see the what happens. I'm hopeful, at least.
