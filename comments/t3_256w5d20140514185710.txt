I was in no way saying that "people with a spare tire need to just poop more to get a flat stomach" so i'm surprised you would think that. I was referring to myself; my stomach does stick out when I haven't pooped, and as mentioned by Zanily when you are thin it is very noticeable when your stomach is full of food or poop or any variation of. there are lots of other reasons why someone's stomach may stick out whether it be constipation, excess stomach chub and so on, so what i said isn't the only reason why someone may have a tummy that sticks out. it just so happens that in MY case this is one of the main reasons that my stomach would stick out and I'm not the only person who experiences this is what I was getting at. I used the word "your" in my second comment as a more ambiguous version of the word; replacing it with "My" would be fine too.

I would never tell anyone anything they "need" to do in order to change their bodies and I would never judge why they have a pooch. but anyhow, I apologize if you felt that what I said was an attack towards people who do have pooches for other reasons. I still stand by what I said happens with my body, which I should be allowed to share without doubts, because once again it is something that does actually happen. It does not mean constipation (Pooing 3x a day is definitely not constipated), I just have very little fat around my midsection which makes it more easily visible whenever i'm full, gassy, need to poop. even after drinking a ton of water I can see a visual difference until I pee.
