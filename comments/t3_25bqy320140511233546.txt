All things I used to do when I lived in a more dangerous area.

A lot of men feel the same way.   

I'm not saying it isn't harder on women, I mean, you all have to deal with all the same shit we do *plus* all the sexual harassment, all while being generally smaller and not as strong physically (speaking statistically, I know there are exceptions). I don't think I could ever fully understand that feeling, being a relatively big, tough looking guy. I guess what I'm trying to say, while not in any way minimizing your problems, is that you are not entirely alone when it comes to being afraid.
