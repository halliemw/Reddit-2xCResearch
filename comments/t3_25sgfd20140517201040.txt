What do you mean by society?  There is no big monolithic group of people called "society."  No one represents society, society doesn't have a mind.  There are various strands of ideologies, different subcultures, but there is no global (or any other subunit) of "society" that confers either villainy or sympathy.  

How did "victims of circumstance" or "mental illness" even get into this discussion of Malificent?

Dr. Evil is much more like Malificent.
