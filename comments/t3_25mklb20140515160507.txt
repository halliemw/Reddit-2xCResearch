"Very publicly tried to embarrass her boss"? I found no public comment from her on the issue. The New Yorker writer's source said she complained to management about her salary and they decided she was "pushy," but no one has had anything concrete to say about her demeanor throughout this affair. The fact that Sulzberger and Thompson don't like her is no evidence that she acted in a spirit of antagonism.

Also, I feel compelled to point out that she'd actually been at the Times since 1997. She became executive editor after eight years as managing editor, during which time she also made less money than a man who reported to her. Before that, she was Washington, D.C., bureau chief, under executive editor and famous nutjob Howell Raines.
