I rejected a guy THREE YEARS AGO who still can't get over it, it was clearly such a big blow to his ego. He approached me very rudely and inappropriately (think negging, PUA tactics, etc. at a work event). I told people about the encounter. He got back in touch a year ago, threatening me with lawyers to *sue me*. He claims I have spread lies about what happened, which I have not (and there were quite a few witnesses to his shitty tactics).

To hear his version, I am a huge bitch who is also burned out on life because I expressed shock and wouldn't put up with being negged in front of 12 or 13 industry colleagues and *then* went on to refuse to sleep with him. He still brings it up fairly regularly, I am told.
