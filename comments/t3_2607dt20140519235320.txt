I was cramping for awhile too. I think it was about 4 days. Each day that passed was a little less painful. I also bled for about a month. But I was under a huge amount of stress too. I had moved, met my biological mom and got my mirena put in all in one month. So that might have had something to do with it. I think you would KNOW if it was migrating. A lot of blood and pain. Not just feeling crampy.
