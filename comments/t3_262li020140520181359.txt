Oh, I'm sorry if it came across like we were alienating men. The dress code does involve boys as well, but the girls feel A LOT more strongly about the whole situation so that's who were mainly involved.

I can understand that perspective, but where I live, the high schools (mostly) do not have dress codes. So all this strict junior high one does is make it more likely that we will dress even more scandalously with the lack of code for 3 years, which makes it even harder to accustom to strict professional dresscodes once high school is over.
