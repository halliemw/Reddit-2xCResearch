I don't know what to say that won't sound rude.

Sometimes I wish I believed so I could feel more loved and reassured.

Does he think he's being tempted by Satan because the two of you are living together before marriage?

If he really only thinks that Satan is tempting him to be with a non-believer (and there are no 'sinful' behaviors)...I couldn't be with a person like this.  To believe so intensely in a personal, manipulative Satan is to me too irrational.

I think you should consider whether or not its worth saving a relationship with someone who probably things you're going to hell. That's one relationship that I wouldn't fight to keep.  Since the two of you have incompatible worldviews, if I were you, I'd try to turn on the more calculating rational part of my brain and say that I can find someone just as good and more compatible for me. Sometimes calculation has its place in relationships.
