I get that all the time! Guess what I am? ME, a woman who is straight and delightfully not narrow minded. 

I got this in high school: "Are you a lesbian?" My response? "You're not my type." 

In college: "Are you a member of the LGBTQ community?" "I'm a member of the LGBTQS community." "What's the S?" "Sensational." 

For some reason the people that asked me, if they were women, were trying to stir up drama and the guys were just hoping to get their kicks. :: shrugs :: people are weird. If you don't fit a stereotype and you're confident despite nonconformity, you must be whatever they're not. Saddest of conclusions.
