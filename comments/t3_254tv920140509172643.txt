All of that is so damn exciting with tiny humans. My boyfriend has a now toddler nephew that I've really loved watched grow. He's so chatty these days. It was the most exciting day when he could say my name, and now he's stringing sentences together. He'll be a big brother in a couple months, so I'm excited to watch the new one grab thumbs, roll over, and giggle maniacally.

Little things are the best with babies. I may have baby rabies again. Dammit.
