Yeah, I think your situation is a bit different than you worded it. *You* have a problem, and that problem is that you're dating an asshole who thus far has refused to stop acting like an asshole.

If you've had a serious talk about his constant misogynistic jokes and about his regular talk of sleeping around and he hasn't stopped, he's probably not going to.

If you haven't try talking about it, do so, and leave if he still doesn't stop.
