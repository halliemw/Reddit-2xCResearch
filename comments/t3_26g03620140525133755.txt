I think your issue in this case would not be with the law, but the original judge/DA of the case. Someone said the average length of time in jail for a rape (wasn't specific for violent v. nonviolent) is ~11y, with actual time served being around >5y. So either the DA made a deal to serve the time consecutively or there was some plea deal to get him to admit to other rapes they had no evidence of.
