Favouring: Crimes of physical violence, including sexual violence (*whether or not* physical bruising occurs).

Nothing should be completely ignored, but lower resources should be spent on e.g. public littering, shoplifting, maybe minor drugs offences.

Prosecutors should take some sexual violence cases to court *even when* there may be some difficulties obtaining a conviction.  However in an electoral system there is no incentive to do this.  Compare the outcomes:

DA Prosecutes: conviction obtained - public perception, DA just doing his job.
DA Prosecutes: acquittal - public perception, DA persecuted an innocent man, his life has been ruined.
DA Does not prosecute: woman stays quiet - public perception, DA just doing his job.
DA Does not prosecute: woman goes to press - public perception mixed, many will doubt the woman's story.
