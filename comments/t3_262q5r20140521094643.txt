You've definitely given me something to think about, but I wouldn't throw the word "rape" around in this case. We both consented to intercourse. And I have had experiences where I ask a guy to use a condom, he says he doesn't have one, and we have sex anyways. But even though I'm fine with unprotected sex doesn't mean that the guy would feel the same way.
