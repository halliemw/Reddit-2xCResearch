I don't think that the advice was that helpful. All it amounted to is telling the woman that she "lucked" into bad relationships and not to blame herself for anything going wrong. 

I'm not saying that people should be down on themselves all the time if their love life isn't working out. But I'm saying that it is good to ask "what can I do better to achieve better results."

This woman's post didn't really explain much about what she's like as a person, aside from saying that she is obviously very independent and has her life together. 

One thing that I did pick up on though is that she gets into relationships with guys who pursue HER hard and then gets sad when that pursuit fades away. 

Maybe it is time for her to initiate some of the dating and find a guy that she can pursue. 

Also, she doesn't really say where she is meeting these guys. If she is meeting them all at the club, then of course it's going to be hook up central. If she's looking for a solid long term relationship she needs to look elsewhere. 

It sounds like many of the guys she ends up with are looking for a fuck buddy, or a "way stop" on the way to where they want to be. She needs to find a way to weed out the guys looking for fuck buddies from guys looking for LTR. Maybe in the beginning of the relationship she can try communicating her needs. She can flat out say, "I'm not looking for a fuck buddy" or whatever. 

Long story short, the advice was: You've lucked into bad relationships, don't do anything, it's not your fault. 

I think she deserves better advice than that.
