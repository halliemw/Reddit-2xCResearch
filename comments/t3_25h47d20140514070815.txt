I getcha. And a good point about compromised ability to defend oneself. One of the things a harp on about if I'm ever using drugs with other people is responsibility. It is very important to know how much you've taken of any substance, and how it will affect you. It is quite easy to plan ahead when sober. "Getting wasted/tripping balls" may be a lot of fun, but if the setting isn't safe enough for a child, it probably isn't safe enough for anyone who isn't sober. I've seen too many people get very angry very quickly to enjoy going to clubs and similar environments. In places like that, not only are people more susceptible to violence/rape/theft, they are more likely to commit those same things.

As far as online interaction goes, I think the level of separation removes any obligation to act decently from the aggressor's point of view. As long as the victim is fastidious in removing identifiable information about themselves from their profile, they should be fine (other than online harassment, which is more of an annoyance than a threat).
