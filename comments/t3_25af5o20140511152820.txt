So sorry for your loss.

It was hard.  When I was younger, I was a little lost about it.  For a while, I made every strong female in my life a mother - looking for her in everyone I suppose.  I didn't like to talk about it a lot when I was a kid.  As I grew up, I started needing to talk about it, but it was hard to bring it up.  I didn't want to bring people down.  I think the most important thing is to be ready to talk about your mother when your sister is ready.  

And now that I know what a powerful thing having written memories is, I would recommend that you write down stories about your mother.  Stories of when your sister was little.  Stories you remember your mom telling about her childhood.  Maybe ask some friends or relatives of your mom to contribute a couple stories.  Then, when your sister is ready, you can give it to her.  I think it will also be really good for you.  

My condolences on your loss, and I wish healing and hope for you and your sister.
