Mine was a convoluted process. I went in to the ob/gyn because for the first time in a decade (age 28) I had decent insurance and hadn't had a pap in that long. Doc felt the cysts on my pelvic exam, told me to come back in three months and put me on the pill. I have a family history if fluid cysts and I told him about that (my sister had surgery at 14, she had a grapefruit-sized cyst). Anyway, three months later, he says we might want to talk about surgery but not much else. 

It was almost Christmas, so I went back home and had the doc who did my sister's surgeries take a look. He suggested that I find a new doctor back here in IL, was mad the guy didn't do surgery ASAP or at least schedule an ultrasound, based on what I told him about my family history.

Went back, found new doctor, and had surgery in early February. Even after the ultrasound, she assumed it would by a fluid cyst, didn't know what they had until they got in there. Had two on the left side that none of the three doctors recognized, and she didn't see it on the ultrasound either.

I never had an symptoms! No pain, no weird periods that I was aware of.

But back to your original question ... if you are on the pill, there is no reason to get a period. The "period" that you get on the pill is just there for marketing -- because it feels "natural" but it's really unnecessary. HOWEVER if that is what you want, go for it :)

It's a complete PITA to figure what which pill or other device works for you. I had a friend who loved her patch, but then that is being blamed for blood clots, as is Yaz. Other's love their Nuva Ring, or their IUD. Someone suggested I look at a diaphragm. Personally not a fan of something I have to put in pre-sexy times.

One sort weird thing with the cyst/dermoid history is early perimenopause. Which sorta sucks. Both my sister and I started peri by age 40.
