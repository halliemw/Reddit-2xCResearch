LOL!

I used to use a juice bottle, a screw driver, and the cut off top of a coke bottle as a can can. None of the commercially made gas cans would ever get gas in my car, I had a 90 Corolla. It would go like this: coke bottle in gas tank. Long,  big handled screw driver in coke bottle to hold open the tank. Then pour gas from juice bottle into the coke bottle.
