Aww. Gross. I hate it when someone attractive just kills that by being an idiot. 

> It's things like this that make me want to crawl back into bed and not bother with dating anymore. I feel like I'm never going to find anyone who measures up to my ex.

Not every dude is a misogynistic dick, don't give up hope forever! I know a bunch of great guys who'd find that absolutely repulsive, I wish I could send you one, haha.
