I feel like a fool for wanting a relationship and person so much when it was not mutual but I would rather have given him the benefit of the doubt and loved him like I did than been skeptical and jealous. I know I acted with honor throughout the entire relationship. He was not who I thought he was, you are right. I'm hoping the universe also sees fit to help me actually be grateful that he is gone. I think right now I am still reeling from the complete loss of the imaginary person I thought he was and how to cope with the person who he actually is. After 7 years I don't think that I can see him every weekend or run into him at the grocery store. I'm not sure what I am going to do about our mutual friend group or really how I move forward from here. Ugh.
