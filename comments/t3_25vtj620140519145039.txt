The problem is that female sport has not received enough funding for a large enough selection of top level athletes to break through. There just isn't as much competition as there is in male sports. This problem is further compounded by the fact that (as there is more competition) the male sports get a huge amount of T.V funding whereas female sport has not garnered enough interest for them to be profitable to show on the T.V. There is some development in the UK in women's cycling and also football with most Premier League clubs having a women's team however neither of these get 'primetime' showing and would are not nearly as popular as the male competitions.
