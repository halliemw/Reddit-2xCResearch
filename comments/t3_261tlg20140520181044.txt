Personally, I would go to drop off a gift, send my well-wishes and leave saying that you have a family matter to attend to. But I'd probably also do it in a nice dress that reflects who you are, not who these woman want you to be. I would be uncomfortable going after remarks were being made about my appearance, but I would still want to stop by.
