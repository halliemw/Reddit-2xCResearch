We are working with 1 assumption of the budget being lowered, but the reality is, there could be hundreds of reasons. Some of those reasons might not be easy to explain to the OP. What if the OP went to the bridal shower, and annoyed everyone there and the other guests asked the bride not to invite her to the wedding? Now the Bride either has to lie, invite her when nobody wants her there, or have an incredibly awkward conversation during a very stressful time of her life.

She has her friends contact information. Among her group of friends, someone will be able to find out for her, or get contact information from someone else in the family to ask. There is just no reason to put this on the bride right now. They are busy with other things. If you want to go to the wedding, don't become a liability, make the extra effort to find out if you were invited discreetly.
