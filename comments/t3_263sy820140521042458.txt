Well, this is just my personal opinion, but what I'd do is talk to them about it when you start to get that feeling that they're getting too clingy, and then make your decision. But make sure to talk to them about it first. Morals are almost always a gray area, but in my mind, the rule about No Strings Attached is your rule, not theirs. You can't expect them to enforce it, even if they agreed to it. So let them speak their mind.

But yeah, at the end of the day, you're the only one who's going to know when the line has been crossed. Is that kissing on the lips? Is it buying a present for Valentine's day? Is it being upset that you didn't call them back after you said you would? It's totally fair for anything AT ALL to be a dealbreaker for you in a relationship, but when the guideline is just "don't get too close," it's unfair to ask them to guess what that means.
