Look, I don't want to even use the term but a girl who is actually slutty isn't crying herself to sleep either, and that said kind of a horrible stereotype to assume that men don't have feelings too. I'm against calling people sluts and it's become a term that gets thrown around to hurt feelings and judge people into conforming to societies icky feelings of sexuality. That said there is another group that crosses genders... what then, can we use as a shameful term for the example I mentioned before?
