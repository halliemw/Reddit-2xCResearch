The concept of raising up women at the expense of men is interesting to me. On the one hand, feminism benefits everyone by tearing down oppressive binaries that affect those of all genders. On the other hand, there is a redistribution of power; yes, men do need to give up their power *over* women; their power to oppress, use & define for their benefit. That's just how oppression works.  One group is advantaged at the *expense* of another. I don't  think talking about *equality* in an unjust system is the right framework to understand social justice.
