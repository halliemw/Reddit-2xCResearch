Yes, that's a good point. I'm not saying it's an overly *good* thing, but I can see some hope and I'm running with it. Another person expressed that TwoX is likely to turn into a new AskWomen, and rather than commiserating, we'll be explaining simple concepts and defending ourselves over and over and over again. I fully understand that that *sucks* and I'm not looking forward to that aspect at all. Also, all the old defaults seemed to suck, so yeah I'm nervous of this changing everything. So many have already jumped ship.

BUT.... I don't know. I think if we're able to open some minds, if more people come here looking for new perspectives and ideas, then we can maaaaaayybe build a better reddit for women?

Optimistic, I know. Possibly naively so. I agree with you, but I think there may be some good here. Most important thing: those of us who understand the purpose and importance of this sub need to stick together, and remain respectful and supportive.
