/r/AskHistorians goes for a more academic setting, and answers to questions often have multiple sources. it's a different type of subreddit. I'm sure 2X could do it, but it seems like it would be a bit harder to police.

Basically, being a scholarly subreddit is a good part of why AskHistorians hasuch good quality for reddit. It's easier to judge whether something is worthy of their standards, since it's less objective. I haven't been there in awhile, but I am a frequent lurker in /r/badhistory, where posts MUST have evidence and sources, or they are removed.
