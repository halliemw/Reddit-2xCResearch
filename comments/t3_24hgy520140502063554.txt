I love knowing the ounces of my period, I will actually record it in my period tracker for science! But I'm sorry you had such a terrible experience, I can't even imagine the underwear you must have mourned. 

Also by "bear down" do we mean you actually pushed the cup out of your vagina? Because I never do that, unless it's by accident, also I need to relax myself to get it out so I guess I'm confused.
