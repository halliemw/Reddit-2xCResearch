I'm glad to hear from a nurse, thank you. We're Canadian, so cost isn't really an issue at all. She has great insurance too for any extras as she's a teacher. 

She's definitely following the doctor's orders about weight bearing and she is eating better. The problem is that I still don't think that she's eating well enough. She's lost weight and she thinks she's eating healthy, while in my eyes she's still eating like shit. She's eating unhealthy high sugar/high carb things (for example her breakfast today was toast with nutella and yogurt) she's just eating a bit of a smaller portion size. 

Is it common to see diabetics do this? I guess it's a problem with food addiction?
