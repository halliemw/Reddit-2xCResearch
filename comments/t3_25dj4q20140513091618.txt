I'm a simple man who sees no need to complicate things. What I stated is what it boils down to in a nutshell. If others want to treat them different then that's not my concern.

If a gay guy tried to plant one on me or grab my junk, my girlfriend would beat the hell out of him, just as she would if a straight girl tried any of that. And its the exact same with me if a lesbian or a straight dude tried to make a move on her.
