This actually makes a lot of sense. I don't think he truly understood what he had in me. He definitely didn't value me. 

And finding relationships seems to come easy to him. I don't think he has been single for more than 3 months since high school. He seems to just fall into relationships and it doesn't faze him when they end. I didn't realize his pattern until recently because when we got together 7 years ago it was right on the tail end of another 2 year relationship.  I doubt ours would have lasted near as long if I didn't fight so hard to maintain it. If I didn't forgive so easily and make excuses for poor behavior. I was so caught up in loving him that I didn't realize he loved what I brought him, not me. (Sorry epiphany here.)
