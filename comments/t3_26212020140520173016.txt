I think that falls under a violation of rules 1 and 3.  It invites gender generalization and it tells someone their feelings are wrong, when no reasonable argument can be made that feelings are ever subject to the categories of right and wrong.  

The post should be removed and the person should feel free to find a way of stating his views that is more respectful and avoids the generalization that "as a man" represents a class of thinkers that are relevant to the issue at hand.
