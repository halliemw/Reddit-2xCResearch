I think nutrition could be a great topic. It could cover body image to some extent, the dangers of fad diets, the female athlete triad which is getting increasing amounts of attention and really should be addressed at a young age, and maybe addressing some myths about how to tell if you're overweight or underweight. For example, many adult women will never have a thigh gap, and that doesn't make them fat. Many women have violin hips that create a muffintop look, but that doesn't mean they're fat. BMI is a good population tool but not the best individual tool. It would allow you to emphasize that aiming for a specific weight is often a useless or even harmful idea, and that instead, a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and reasonable amounts of exercise should be the goal.
