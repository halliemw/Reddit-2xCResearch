My opinion?  Not the best choice for a default sub.  If for no reason than the members enjoyed the close private community.   Just based on some of the post titles I've seen so far (figured I'd sample now that I know it exists) there's NO WAY that the "I love to argue for the sake of it" crowd will turn down some of the new opportunities.  Just saying.
