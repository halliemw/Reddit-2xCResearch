Hm. Well Im against the idea of the whole woman-wears-an-engagement-ring thing. But given that you are into it... You know you're committed to each other. Do you know when you'd want to get married? Venues book up fast! Why don't you have that talk?
"Honey, I know you wanted to do the traditional surprise proposal. And I want that too. But Im finding Im getting a bit antsy about us having had the talk that we're getting married "someday" and yet, we're not actually engaged. So I find myself doing engaged lady things like looking at dresses, etc, but it feels weird that Im just waiting around for you to officially propose." Just tell him how you feel and see what he says.
