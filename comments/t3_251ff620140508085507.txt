Nope. Absolutely not, because most of the issues linked with TwoX as a default are entirely out of the mods' hands. As others have mentioned, the downvote brigade is in full effect. Look at the new queue- nearly every submission has been downvoted into oblivion. I've been here for three years and it has NEVER been like that until today.

Women will not feel nearly as comfortable posting about their personal issues knowing that it *will* be broadcast to the rest of reddit. Sure, twoX was never hidden but it wasn't nearly as out in the open as the default subs. A number of women have already reported that the wave of creepy and threatening PMs has already picked up. Mods cannot prevent that. 

RedPillers aren't the only threat. Most reddit users are male and this is a subreddit

> for thoughtful content - serious or silly - related to gender, and intended for women's perspectives

(per the sidebar)

Do you think the random reddit user is going to respect that? Think again.
