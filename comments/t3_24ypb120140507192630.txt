Photography costs a lot for a reason. The cost of the equipment is huge plus for say a $2000 set of wedding photos, the photographer has probably spent 40 hours post processing. Then you have to add their time such as meeting with you before hand as well as hanging around at your wedding all day. 

I'm not having a photographer because I can't justify the cost but I do know that there is a reason why their costs are so high as one of my close friends does wedding photography and I help her with her tax returns!
