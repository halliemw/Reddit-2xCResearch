You're probably better off just leaving it alone unless he wants to talk about it. As you said you have no idea what happened and just from reading it, as a guy, I would guess his dad showed him porn when he was young or something and his mom didn't like it (does the mom seem like the type to disapprove of something like that?). 

If he doesn't seem phased by it or otherwise upset then there doesn't seem to be a reason to bring it up.
