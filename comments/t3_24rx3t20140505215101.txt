Feminism is a branch of the egalitarian movement just as much as the Republican party is still the stalwart promoter of civil liberties as it was when it ended slavery, had the first black senator, got the 19th amendment passed and didn't filibuster the civil rights act. Feminism today is severely tarnished as an anti-male movement due to several loud people who hate and have been given a platform to speak from.

It is certainly possible for a movement to be a subset of a larger ideal without violating the larger ideal. The LGBT movement is a great example of this. Collectively as a movement they have made great strides to end discrimination against them. They have made laws treat them equally and they are successfully pursuing social change that will have them be more accepted, though they certainly do have a long road ahead of them. For the record, my voting record has been in support of them. Though I haven't had many opportunities, when the time came I did vote in favor or legalizing homosexual marriage. I think, though, there can be danger in identifying primarily as one of these subsets. It becomes your team, or your tribe, and begin to associate more with it than the larger goal. I believe feminism is just such a subset that has exceeded the envelope of egalitarianism. Here are just a few examples of what feminists with a large audience have to say:

>I feel that 'man-hating' is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.

Robin Morgan, Ms. Magazine Editor.
