I totally understand where you're coming from-- being "done". But when my bf said this to me I got really upset and it took a long time to figure out why. He would just give up on conversations or chores and It made me sad  and angry and confused. When we finally got around to talking about it, he pointed out that he couldn't do anything "right" according to me. But he never told me, he would just shut down. It took him pointing it out for me to see it and we worked on it from there. It's a big thing to learn to let other people do things their own way. It's even harder to learn how to offer help and advice while still not nitpicking. 

Whatever scenario you're referring to here, make sure to point it out. Do so kindly, if possible. Let them know that they criticize you or make you feel bad every time you try to do something and that if they don't stop or don't show you how they want it, you're not going to do it. Maybe they have no clue what they're doing to you.

And if you've already had this conversation and they are still rude and nitpicky then at least you gave them a fair shot. This issue is a two-way street, and you met them in the middle.
