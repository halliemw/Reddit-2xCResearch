Perhaps try a low dose pill like Yaz or Loette. OR switch from a combined pill to a progesterone only pill. Yaz might be better, but you have to take it at the same time each day or your period can just spontaneously start. I find, for me, it is not high enough in dosage to keep my PMS symptoms low - it still works for that, but not as much. I have read that lots of women love Yaz for skin, but it can be pricey.

The pill is definitely the problem. Have seen research on it. I just looked up Junel, it seems pretty high in its estrogen content which (I think?) can lower sex drive.
