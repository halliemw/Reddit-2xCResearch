I've been equally critical of men's appearance. One of my favorite celebrity singers keeps mixing grey and blue in a way that doesn't actually suit him - but he's a guy so that's "normal" looking.

The dress doesn't fit her well, she paid zero attention to posture, and the round circle of the pearls brings attention to her neck and chin, not the best areas to be focusing on.

The hate is somewhat understandable in that she didn't actually TRY to respect the venue and the fashion industry. So she positioned herself as an outsider. People are reacting, as people do, in a very silly way.

However the point is well made that men *aren't* subjected to the same scrutiny.

The point gets muddied by the very real problem that an outfit that looks "cute" on one body type will NOT look "cute" on a different body type.

However that brings up another point in that there isn't much to wear at ALL for that particular body type.

*The fashion industry in itself needs to start focusing on making clothes that help people of various sizes and types look good, instead of insisting that people adjust themselves - via starvation and even surgery - to fit the clothes.*
