Bulimia and anorexia can lead to death. Period. And it's not that hard to get there, to be honest. Even if you think she looks beautiful and sexy and healthy, she's not. She's hurting herself. You need to tell someone, someone professional. She may hate you for it, but you have to, or she's gonna drive herself into an early grave. 

I'd talk to her about it first, ask her if she would like to seek professional help cause you're concerned about her, but if she refuses...I just really think you should still tell someone.
