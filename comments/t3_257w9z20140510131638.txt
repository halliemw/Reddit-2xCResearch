There's nothing silly about feminist dialogue about Frozen. Frozen may not have anything to do with feminism, but feminism has to do with everything in our culture at large. I really hate the diminishing of children's media, that you can put any crap in front of a child as long as its G-rated and it has no lasting impact. The stories I loved as a child where extremely formative, and informed my social consciousness and morals in ways that platitudes from my parents never could. I run in literary circles where the symbols and interpretation myth and folklore are met with almost religious reverence.

I don't think OPs exchange with a friend, who basically plugs his ears, is the best way to distill what was positive or negative about Frozen from a feminist perspective. The article, however, is brilliant. As a creative person, I recognize that truly talented artists like those working for Disney make very conscious decisions concerning the themes, values, and subtext of the stories they tell. Yes, Frozen is the Sense and Sensibility-esque  tale of the love of two sisters. Yes, that's new and shiny and positive. But the original tale, The Snow Queen, is not very old by fairy tale standards. Hans Christian Anderson's  tale was about a girl who rescues the boy, a friend whose vision has been poisoned by an evil enchantment and sees nothing but evil and ugliness. To me, growing up, this was both terrifying and heartening. As an adult, I definitely interpret it as a metaphor about helping a loved one struggling with mental illness. Why did Disney appropriate this tale, only to change it so radically?
