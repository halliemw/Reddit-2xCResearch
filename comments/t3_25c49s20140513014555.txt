I have the same problem with my feet. I use the sanding attachment on my dremel tool. I know it sounds crazy and extreme, but if you don't press very hard and are careful not to sand in one place for too long (and burn yourself), it's extremely effective. Be sure to sand down the callous on both ends of the cracks as well as along the sides. Otherwise you'll end up with even more painful cracks. 

And use lotion after every time your feet get wet. I find that the cracking gets worse with repeated wet/dry cycles.
