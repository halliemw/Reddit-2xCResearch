Honestly I wouldn't even risk annoying them over something so small. They are trying to be nice in their own way, not mean. It's just one of those things whenever I think about it it bugs me. 

Also I'm glad someone else in Ireland has heard it! I was starting to think we were seriously culchie up here. More than we already are.
