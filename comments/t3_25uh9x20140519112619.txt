Someone already mentioned this, but it's worth mentioning again....on days when your flow is heavy use a panty liner even if you're using tampons.

Also remember this is totally normal, every girl goes through this so don't feel like you should be embarrassed. I know when I first started getting my period I was super embarrassed and thought everyone would somehow know just by looking at me.
