I think that there's wisdom here. Your long luscious labias might be the victim of your shaky self esteem but not the cause.  You'll always find something about yourself to dislike (trust me on this one >_<).

This is A BIG DEAL. You should love yourself and be able to have uninhibited sex. I think learning to love your body is a hard journey worth taking.   Who knows; maby surgery is the right answer in your case, but you said yourself that surgery is a long way down the line.

Nothing worth while is easy to get.  Study strategies for having a positive mental attitude and learning to accept and maybe even love your low-hanging lower lips.... or at least see them as an inconvenience rather than a blight upon your body.


I see A LOT of posts about people who hate the way their vaginas look.... it's a horrible epidemic and I'm sad that we live in a world where women feel judged by the way their lovely private bits are constructed.
