I think IFF is more about showing what women do in their everyday lives. If that is concrete construction why does it matter whether or not its 'non stereotypical' ? One of the IFF is quilt made for her baby. Should we not post that picture because it's 'too stereotypical' ? She never says anything about being an exception to the rule. She should be able to post her work no matter what it is without positive or negative sexism.
