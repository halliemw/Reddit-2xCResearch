I wonder if there's anything about swimming in know shark water and being on your period. I've heard about bears before, and foxes - lovely having wildlife rifle through your used sanitary products - but not sharks. Off to google! 

edit:
Amazing! "Sharks are not known to associate this fluid [menstruation] with feeding opportunities. Although they can certainly detect menstrual discharge, there is little reason to suspect it is attractive to them in the way fresh blood is. It is more likely attractive only in the way any novel sensory stimulus—such as urine, splashing or noises – might be." - See more at: http://www.alertdiver.com/Myths_and_Truths_About_Sharks#sthash.nviBXx8P.dpuf
