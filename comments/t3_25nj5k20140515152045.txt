I'm going to assume you meant to type "you'll never get along with everyone".

Yeah the best I could do as far the first option goes is pretend that she looks familiar but I don't remember her name...I was kinda thinking of going that direction. And then maybe try to get some one on one with her. I'm sure there's a reason my friends invite her to things and Iv just not gotten to see it yet. :-/
