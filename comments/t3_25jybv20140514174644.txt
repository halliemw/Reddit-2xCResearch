>I am pretty much pro-life but I am open to new ideas if someone is able to convince me that an unborn fetus does not matter.

You're probably not going to find many to argue that a fetus does not matter at all here. I'm sure there are a few, but most at least acknowledge that it's a member of our species.

Whether it's a person is up for debate, but it isn't really even a signficant factor since no person is allowed to use the organs or body of another against his or her will.
