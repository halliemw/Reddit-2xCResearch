I was the one who made the original post, and I really like this one. But as you know (considering you're using an alt) this is not a discussion space anymore in any sense of the word.

I really do hope that 2X is salvageable, but I am also being realistic in the fact that it probably won't be. It will probably become a male-dominated, female-oriented sub... Which kind of sucks a lot.
