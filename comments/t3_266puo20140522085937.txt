I am the bride in a weirdly similar situation. This is what I did. 

My bridesmaids and I have been best friends since high school. College, relationships, and life in general has scattered us to the far corners of the state, and my very best friend is far out of state. It sucks. I don't have very many other friends, but we've fought to keep in touch and see each other as often as we can. Those girls are gold.

We've been promising each other a girls weekend for some years now, but life always gets in the way. When I got engaged, I told the Maid of Honor, "I love you. I don't care that you can't help with the planning. I don't care what you wear. All I want is for you to confer with the girls and make that weekend happen for all of us, and stand with me on my wedding day."

I knew asking my girls to go to New Orleans for three days was a lot. We are seasoned travelers and know how to have a great time on a tiny budget. I would NEVER expect them to pay for my portion of the hotel, meals, burlesque class, drinks (beyond our normal system of taking turns) or anything else. 

They all have a decent selection of dresses ready to wear in their closet, and are fully capable of doing their own hair, makeup, and accessorizing. I trust them completely, and I know they are going to be beautiful.

$250 is not..unheard of for a bridesmaid dress. But *my wedding dress* was less than $100.

I would talk to the bride. Be honest and tell her you can't afford the dress, and give her ideas of similar dresses that are more friendly to your budget. 

I'm sure if you brought this over to the brides of /r/weddingplanning, they'd be more than happy to give you more insight from that perspective. 

I hope you get that teaching job!
