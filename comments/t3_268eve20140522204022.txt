Even the fact that anything happened (like all the crazy stuff I was saying) without me remembering is scary for me.  I have never drank alcohol or taken recreational drugs, so it's literally my first experience of being out of my mind because of a substance.  

Thank you for your response.  I'm going to consider talking to him about it, after I've discussed it with my counselor.  I think it will be difficult for me to talk about it, so it won't be a decision I make lightly.  I want to be sure it's what I want to do before deciding to do it.
