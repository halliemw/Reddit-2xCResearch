I do not care if you call them leggings, jeggings, tights or whatever, but when you are wearing them and your crotch and butt are not covered- you are doing it wrong!

I wear leggings almost every day. There is nothing easier than throwing on a pair and coupling that with a mid thigh lengt shirt/tunic/minidress. But wearing them as pants has never even crossed my mind. 

Also on the topic of yoga pants- those are for exercising. I don't understand the concept if going out to public in sweats or other training clothes (not talking about going running or walking in a park). "But they are so comfortable" is not an argument, except corsets and garters all of my clothing is comfortable.
