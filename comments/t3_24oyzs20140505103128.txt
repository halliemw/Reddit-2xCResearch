Yeah absolutely. I was trying to say that at first I had an extremely bad impression of TRP b/c so many men come off as extremely whiny, bitter and hateful towards women, but RPW seemed more reasonable. Got called "an entitled shrew." for saying something negative about TRP. I take back my general stance on RPW. I think there are some fairly reasonably girls on there, but a lot seem a little crazy to me.
