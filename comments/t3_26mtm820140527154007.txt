Yeah that's very true. I think I might just bite the bullet and go in sometime this summer since it'll be about 3 years which seems to be the most common answer that I have been told/read. It's also hard for me because I got a new job in October working in schools but summer is coming so I'll have more time...I have been holding it off this year so far because the last thing I want to do when I get off work is go sit in a doctor's office for 2 hours waiting to get my cervix jabbed at and THEN go home!
