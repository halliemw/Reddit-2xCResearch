My kids insisted on paying for their own wedding, and did most of it themselves.

They made the invitations, centerpieces, favors, much of the food, the wedding cupcakes, the cake toppers (for the cheesecake that was in addition to the cupcakes), and most of the decorations.  The meal was barbecue buffet, and much tastier than most catered wedding meals.

It was beautiful.  The bride wore turquoise and the theme was mostly octopi.  They are a strange and wonderful pair.

Bottom line:  do what makes you happy.
