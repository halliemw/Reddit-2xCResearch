She doesn't have to know anything if you are on her insurance. Make an appointment with your doctor, ask for the prescription and pay the co-pay yourself. Unless there is an additional bill your mom will never know. If she does find out and confronts you just say "This is what responsible adults do to protect themselves" and end the conversation.
