Having more hair than the normal could be a symptom of something you should talk to your doctor about.  You might have PCOS or an endocrine disorder.  As others have suggested, perhaps hormonal birth control could help.

As for hair removal-I'm pants at it! Its so so hard. I can't even manage to shave my legs well.
