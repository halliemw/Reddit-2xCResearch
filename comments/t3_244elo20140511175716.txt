This is probably late for you, I was poking around the sub to see if people had posted about dermoid cysts in the past. I had one much like yours -- it was splitting my right ovary in two. But my doctor was able to sew it back together and save it.

I went on Depo for four years after my surgery and loved it. There are stories about people women -- because Depo stops menstruation -- for who it took a while (months, a year) for them to get periods again. Mine came back the next month.

I was just asking a similar question tho. researching what i available out there for the pill sucks, and is generally a PITA.
