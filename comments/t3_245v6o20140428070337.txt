Oh lawd. Same thing happened to me once. I played a game online with a really good male friend of mine. We both joined a guild and after they found out I actually was a girl (damn you, ventrillo) I was called a slut, whore, etc. Insert "I'm actually happily married" then it was I'm a cheating whore and slut.
