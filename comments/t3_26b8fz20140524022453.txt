Admins are inferring that they will actually deal with it. Nothing about subreddits. From the admin's post above:

> I'm certainly not trying to say that there hasn't been any harassment, because some definitely has actually occurred (and please report it to us by sending a modmail to /r/reddit.com if it happens to you). 

There is little point in reporting it to reddit.com if they don't actually do anything. The screenshot shows an admin saying outright that they don't ban for such things.
