Bad idea. Look, waiting for marriage to have sex and to live together is hard. It's really hard. I chose not to do it and have been dating my SO for over 4 years because even though we both know that marriage is what we want eventually, we aren't certain about how well we can make our careers work together and we're both way too early in them to be ready to put an obstacle in the way. But that's us, and we're obviously completely different.

I also had a roommate in college who started dating her now husband before I started dating my boyfriend. When they started dating they knew they wanted to get married, and they did. But they waited until they'd graduated from college because they wanted to make sure that they'd each had time living on their own, being responsible for their own money, food, etc. They never had sex or got close to having sex and they never lived together before marrying. They haven't been married for quite a year now, but their marriage is much stronger than the marriage of some mutual friends who also didn't want to have sex or live together before marriage and who got married within a year of starting dating at 21. They have now been married two and a half years, and from what's posted on Facebook, things look pretty rocky for them. They didn't give themselves enough time to actually get to know each other and to get established as independent adults first.

I think the most important thing to take away from that is that even without sex and even without living together, there's no rush to get married. In the best marriages, two *independent adults* create a family unit in a way that suits them both and makes them both feel happy and satisfied. Until you're two independent adults and you've discussed lifestyle and everything, I think marriage shouldn't be in your near future.
