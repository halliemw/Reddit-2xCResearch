Here's what's going on now:

The mods made the sub a default. The anticipated change/reality/totally misperceived non-phenomenon is that the sub would change character from the largest place on reddit were women were in the majority and had discussions with mostly women, to a sub about women but where most of the posters were actually men giving their opinions on women's issues. And if you want to know what men think about something, that exists on a gazillion other subs. It's not something that's super rare and we can't find if we want to seek that out.  I think men's experiences and opinions are totally valid and often interesting, but if someone was seeking opinions of both genders, why would they seek out a sub only aimed at one gender?

That's why there's so much complaining right now. It might change as the sub adjusts, it might not.
