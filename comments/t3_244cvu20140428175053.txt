Sorry if I was unclear, you're uterus almost always has some lining but it builds its self up when you're ovulating so that you can be extra fertile. When you're not on the pill that's what you're shedding during your period. When you're on the pill you don't ovulate, that big build never happens and you just shed your thin everyday lining.
