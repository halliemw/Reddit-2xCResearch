Thank you- this was really helpful. It feels totally true, since I was hyperalert for noises, even though I knew that the most likely noise would be him coming home and not an intruder or something. But just knowing that if I didn't remind myself of that I might be scared in the middle of the night made things difficult!

We decided to do an ETA thing. We're clear that it's not a curfew, just that if we set 2am and it looks like it will be 3, he should text. I found out he wanted to text me with his changed plans but didn't want to wake me, so I promised that if I felt like I might sleep, I'd silence my phone. I silence my phone at night anyway.
