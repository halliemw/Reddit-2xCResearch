Are you me?

The Bell Jar helped me so much though. I was so scared while I was reading it because I could identify with it so well. But then I finished it and thought about it for a while.

You're recognizing now that's it's not necessarily common to have these thoughts. That recognition is a good thing. The one thing lacking in the book is a recognition of how strange everything in the book is for the most part, until she starts to get better.

I even started wondering how Esther would react if she read this book herself if it was written in someone else's point of view. I didn't come up with a good answer here, I was just wondering.

You should definitely talk to someone about it. A therapist maybe; I've had not the best experiences with therapists, it's hard to find a good one fast.

Maybe talk to someone you're close to. I realise someone that close may not exist though.

I used to not want to say any of the stuff going on with me aloud, so I would write it down. That helped me straighten a lot of it out.

I know not everyone has someone to talk to, or resources to find a therapist, but everyone can write this stuff down. You can type it out and then delete it even, or write it down and shred the pages. It still helps.

You could even write to us. We're nice.

There's also a sub here, I can't remember the name (if anyone else knows, help me out here), that will help with suicidal tendencies in particular. I've been told it's worth checking out.

We're always here for you though, if you start slipping down the crisis path.
