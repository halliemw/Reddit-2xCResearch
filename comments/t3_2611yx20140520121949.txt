You mention the length of your lunch break several times here... that can actually be a legal issue and a risk to the company. I always liked to cut mine short, but it's managed by the law, at least in my state. They always catch on. :-D

Since I'm here.... I kinda feel like they're jealous of you. #prettypeopleproblems. I managed a temp for awhile and people were so mean to her. She dressed really cute, went to the gym all the time, so she had a great body, and just was really pretty. I was shocked to see how many people were mean to her. They made her cry a few times. Made me happy that I'm unattractive for once in my life.
