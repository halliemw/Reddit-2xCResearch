Haha, that is so shitty of him I'm sorry! 

The thing is this guy used to be heavy, so you'd think he would have some sense of emotional courtesy. Like I said, I really don't think it was said to be intentionally mean, I guess I'm just really aware of trying not to say things like that to others, so it can be a crappy wake up when someone else doesn't extend the same courtesy.
