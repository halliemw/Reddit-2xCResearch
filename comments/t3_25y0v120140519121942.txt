The same thing happened to me recently. I was told it was probably stress and took two pregnancy tests just to be sure i could calm down about that one. I'm also cramping really badly between cycles. Webmd says cancer, but then again what else is new? -_- if i have more of the same for my next period I'm gonna try to go the doctor route.
