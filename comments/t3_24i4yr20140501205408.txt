Thank you!

Luckily, Comcast was able to get me in tomorrow so I will have internet right away. 
I feel like I don't have that many boxes but I'm sure once they're all in the new place, it'll seem very different. 
I've actually been on top of labelling my boxes so I think I have that covered, and can leave my 6+ boxes of books for a later time and get at my necessities ASAP.
