>But between the various outside groups trying quite hard to push 2XC out, the false flags, and the lying, please take all claims about it with a large grain of salt.

Since you clearly have a much better view of this information than others,  saying "significant amount of lying" and "great deal of attempted manipulation", can you clarify the percentages between lies and truth? Stating that "some" harassment has occurred but a "significant" amount of lying is happening provides a lot of cover for the harassers and makes it even harder for people to feel like they can speak out about it.
