I'm personally a big fan, though I had to stop sooner than I would have liked with my kids. My first I ended up having to supplement and I felt like a massive failure (even though I had people telling me I was a good mom for making sure Bean got what was needed, even after some weird interactions about breastfeeding in 'public'), and I highly don't recommend a cold turkey weaning( D: don't do it! Pain!) like what happened with my second. First time I had no choice(to stop) and second I made a conscious decision.

I kind of feel like the people that get into others peoples faces about whether or not to breastfeed are the same people that get offended a lot by everything, y'know? Or "they know what's right and that's all there is to it, so just listen to them." Blah. Lay off. Share happy stories, if you have to share, don't go out of your way to scare or disturb others, and just remember that it's a bodily function that may or may not work for some people, whatever the reason. Walk a mile in the others shoes.
