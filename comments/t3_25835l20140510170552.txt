Whatever you do, if you end up bringing tampons with you, please don't bury them. I saw you mentioned bringing a ziplock bag with you to throw out when you get back, which is definitely what you should do. I spend a lot of time in the Summer backpacking, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen where someone has buried their business only to have it dug up by some animal or whatever. Tampons and wet wipes do not readily decompose or biodegrade efficiently at all.
