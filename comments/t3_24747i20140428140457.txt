Being a woman doesn't mean you're not sexist, though. There are plenty of sexist women who see women as inferior or subservient to men, and men and women who see men as inferior or worse than women.

You're right that saying things like this once or twice out of anger aren't necessarily indicative of sexism. If it's something you do regularly, though, there's a strong indication you have some sexist ideas, even if you don't recognize them openly.
