The point Nora_Oie is making is the fact that people should introduce their own experiences to broaden our scope of how people behave and experience things. If someone can say "not all men", then they are simply implying that there is something else to consider rather than what you want to hear. This is relevant of course because when the argument is made, the individual almost always speaks about an experience involving women.
