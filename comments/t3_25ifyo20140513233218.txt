You just tell him 'I don't think this is working out for me'. He asks why tell him 'I'm just not feeling a connection.' And then wish him luck. You don't have to say anything else. You gave it a good shot, it didn't work out, & that's how it goes. 

I can tell you what you shouldn't do. Don't drag this out for much longer, it might potentially make it more painful for him.  Also don't say anything that will indicate that he might have a chance with you in the future if you know he doesn't. Don't say "well maybe someday in the future" or any shit like that... and don't say you just want to be friends if you know you don't want to be friends. Being honest is the best thing you can do. It might seem cruel at first, but it's better to rip off the Band-Aid have a quick pain then the drag it out for months and months on end in agony. You know it's over, just tell him. Good luck
