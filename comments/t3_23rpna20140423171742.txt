I read this, and realised that I used to be very silencing of myself, but I'm not anymore. For example, I was brought up to believe that you had to do everything for other people, and stay with people forever, etc etc. It led to me staying in a very emotionally abusive relationship for years, because I thought that you had to just stay with people, once you'd made the original choice to be with them. Well I got out of that relationship, was messed up for a few years, did some counselling, thought about things- and realised that I don't really believe it. I don't believe that bullshit I was taught. I can see why my parents cling to it, but it's not true in all cases- and I don't have to be with someone, if they're not right for me. And I realised that I would rather be on my own, than be with the wrong person. That was SO FREEING for me to realise. I just could not be arsed anymore, worrying myself over the other person, twisting myself to be what I thought they wanted. It just seemed so much more relaxing to be on my own, and be my own self.

So I feel like you wanted help, you asked about the steps people took. So, I went to counselling. I got the right meds for my depression and anxiety. I did a lot of CBT and thought about WHY I put my own needs last. And CBT teaches you to challenge those thoughts. So now when I read that list, I would read 'I need to put my own desires last to not be selfish' and I think 'no, I need to look after myself otherwise I will be miserable, looking after myself is a basic prerequisite for allowing me to have good relationships with other people.' So now I automatically have helpful, healthy thoughts about things- because I have sat down and asked myself questions like 'why do I think it's okay for people to mistreat me? What am I scared of if I say no? What am I scared of if I am myself?' So I would recommend CBT to everyone, it really helped me.
