You really, really should not use the word "make" if you mean "ask". Also,

>And tell him that if he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to continue to go.

this sentence implies that, in contrast, he *did* "have to" go the first time. I would bottle that sentence and slap a "100% guaranteed to start an unproductive argument in this situation" sticker on the side.
