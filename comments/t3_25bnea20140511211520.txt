"These are just songs. They are just jokes. They are just movies. It’s just a hug. They’re just breasts. Smile, you’re beautiful. Can’t a man pay you a compliment? In truth, this is all a symptom of a much more virulent cultural sickness — one where women exist to satisfy the whims of men, one where a woman’s worth is consistently diminished or entirely ignored."

Indeed - people say to lighten up because boys will be boys.  IT's just a joke, just a song, just a constant bombardment of beauty advertisements so don't let it get to you,  just a random unsolicited hug, just that one time when your supervisor touches your ass, who cares, it just your ass - it's just a body part and it should only bother you if you let it.  It's just your job - just smile.  It's just a guy enjoying the beauty of a womans body - you'll miss it when you're old, as if growing old is a scourge, instead of a privilege.  He just want's to talk to you, that's why he followed you half way home.  He's just awkward, don't worry about him.     


Well these little things make up my day and days make up my life.
