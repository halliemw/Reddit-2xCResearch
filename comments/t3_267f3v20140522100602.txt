Of course you should go to a doctor if you think you're pregnant, but it makes more sense to take an at-home test again in a few days to check rather than:

* Scheduling the appointment
* Getting off work to go to said appointment
* Paying copay for said appointment

...All to find out you're not actually pregnant, when you could have just peed on a stick. Once you get a positive you should go.
