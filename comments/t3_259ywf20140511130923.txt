>Hi Sally, I haven't received my invitation to your wedding yet. I want to make sure I get my response card back to you on time. Since it seems like this one got lost in the mail, could you pop another in the mail?

That assumes she was actually sent an invitation in the first place though.  You have to work with an assumption that she may not have been invited. If she wants to assume she was sent an invitation that got list in the mail, then she doesn't actually need a formal invitation and the phone call is unnecessary. 

If you actually feel like you need to take this up with the bride, rather than having a friend or family member find out for you, you need to be a little more tactful.

I can give you a very clear scenario where someone is sent a save the date, invited to the bridal shower, and not invited to the wedding. She might have annoyed people at the bridal shower. I have seen it many times where people either get drunk or say something they shouldn't have, or pretty much "take over" the bridal shower, and the other guests are unhappy with it, and that person gets uninvited to the wedding.

You have to accept that as a possibility.
