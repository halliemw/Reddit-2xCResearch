To me, banning skintight yoga pants is very reasonable. I don't feel comfortable when I go to the mall and there is some woman's asscrack outlined in detail. She is not doing yoga at the damn mall. But there are non-sexual clothes that are sexualized. Like how my coworker would always compliment my appearance only on the days I wore a skirt. a professional skirt of below-the-knee length. Banning that skirt for distracting a man would be frustrating, but in my opinion yoga pants do belong in the gym.
