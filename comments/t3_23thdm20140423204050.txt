Would I be upset..? YES & NO.

I WOULD be kind of ticked that he used "ME being upset" and "HIM being strong for me" as an excuse. Fuck that - YOU WERE STRONG during a difficult time and actually toughed it out and went to work! 

Here is a scenario that I WOULDN'T be pissed: if he told a little "fiblet" to his boss and said "Hey we just had another death in the family, I would like to request today off." (it would be IMPLIED that HE is upset & needs time off - even though he just wanted to pick up a kayak). 

And in an ideal world he would have cooked me dinner so when I got home there was at a hot meal (or even a pizza) on the table...
