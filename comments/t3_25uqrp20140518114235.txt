Funnily enough, this stuff happens quite often (though not in the exact same ways yours did). There were plenty of mistakes on both sides, but that's why we are humans. 

I am amazed at how people are on your ass for being involved, when it concerns family and you are somewhat connected to it.... you get involved, simple as that. 

Unforturnately I don't have horror stories to share, all I can say is, with all my heart I hope everything will work out for mom and you.
