Yeah, I shaved once at the beginning of spring because I wanted to show my legs off in shorts (if I want to flaunt my legs I'll generally shave them, if I'm only wearing shorts because it's hot then I don't care), and it has been *so friggin cold* most of the time since then that I've been wearing pants anyway. Really annoyed that I even put the effort in! So now I'm pretty much just not shaving again until like. June. When I know it will stay consistently hot. Cause fuck this shaving business, I mean really.
