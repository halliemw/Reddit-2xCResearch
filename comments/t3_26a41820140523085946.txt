> I am now letting go of all the shame

This is why it is so important for those of us who have had abortions to speak up.

There is NO reason to feel ashamed.  

NONE!

Having one was the right thing for me to do at that point of my life.

I was 18, my family had all moved from California to Australia and I was putting myself through college and when not in the college Dorm I was basically homeless.  I lived out of my car a few times and bummed sleeping room at friends homes at other times.

There was no way I was going to go through a pregnancy or even keep a child back then.  This was in 1976.

Now I have 3 grown children and I have never regretted having the abortion.
