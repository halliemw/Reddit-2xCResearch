So, you know, instead of using her experiences to teach children and teens how to practice safe sex so they don't get pregnant or get STDs, she uses it to teach them that sex is wrong and you will die. Those kids will end up having sex anyway (well, the ones who aren't traumatised by this speech will), and probably won't use contraception because they've never been taught how.

Teaching kids about consent is great, but she's not doing that either.
