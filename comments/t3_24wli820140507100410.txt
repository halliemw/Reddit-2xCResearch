wow, what a huge over-reaction... much ado about nothing, in my opinion. the joke they were making wasn't about Amy being ugly or anything like that, it was just pointing out the difference between the 'all dolled up' kind of sexy the model has and the regular-girl casual thing she has going on.

I'm a nerdy girl and I'm pretty frumpy most of the time, but sometimes I try to be sexier and yeah, I could relate to the post. I can't always figure out flattering clothing and pretty makeup. it was just a dumb little joke, these people need to relax.
