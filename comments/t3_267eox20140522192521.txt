If feminism is about equal opportunity and treatment for men and women then I think this mindset is very counter-productive to the goals of feminism and actually serves to handcuff feminism to false factoids when it deserves so much more respect than that.

Why did I bring up genetic differences in the first place? Only to point out the fact that deviations from a 50/50 gender split are not *inherently* sexist or discriminatory (and they're usually not in the West) given that there are statistical differences between the genders to begin with, and further that one does not need to deny these differences to support feminism. Feminism is a good principle regardless of these facts.

When people handcuff feminism to a false dogma that men and women are identical then they hurt feminism by making it seem flawed in comparison to an informed understanding of human psychology. On the other hand, if feminism is supported in its own right because it's only fair to treat people without regard to their gender, then no gender differences real or imagined can undermine that.

We can have a culture that ensures equal opportunity for women and science when:

* Both men and women, but especially women, know how to spot unequal opportunity in science and expose it. When people *assume* that genetic differences between men and women (and even between individuals) do not matter for interest or ability in science and within science, they will inevitably not be able to recognize true unequal opportunities because they will conflate unequal outcome with unequal opportunity. (This can lead them to dismiss equal outcomes that actually derive from unequal opportunity.)

* Both men and women, but especially women, recognize that there are genetic differences between the genders that contribute to differences in psychological traits but also that every individual is shaped *in part* by their own genes giving them a unique set of traits. Hence, no man or woman should feel ashamed about "giving in" to purely cultural pressures that determine their traits if in fact those traits are in part shaped by their biology (i.e. no woman should feel guilty for not liking science as if they "gave in" to a stereotype as opposed to "defying" or "overcoming" the stereotype). Alternatively, no man or woman should feel ashamed uncomfortable about being atypical for someone of their gender given that their unique set of genes probably played a part in their uniqueness as opposed to some environmental error (i.e. no woman should feel like she doesn't belong in any role just because she's a woman).
