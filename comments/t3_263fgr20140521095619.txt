That sounds like an amazing solution! I really want to bring my partner to a couples therapy session. Everyone comes with their own brand of nonsense and it's hard for him to believe me when i say he's not the cause. I think it will help hearing that from a person in a place of authority. The one thing they never tell you about sleeping with your best friend, is that when things aren't going as well as they could be, it can be difficult to talk to one another without getting emotionally wrapped up in it. Nobody wants to hear that their best friend is hurting!
