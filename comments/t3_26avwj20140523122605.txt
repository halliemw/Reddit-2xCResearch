Endo is actually very difficult to diagnose without surgery, but can be diagnosed by symptoms. It might be worth mentioning to your gyno to see what they know about it as it relates to your pain.

It isn't too scary for me now that I understand it better, maybe once you know more about it you won't feel so intimated. My symptoms started with pain during sex and pain during my period, which is why I suggested it might be worth looking into for your pain. It may or may not be endo, but I wish that I had known about it sooner because I could have looked into before it got so bad. Check out endometriosis.org and they have a short video at http://vimeo.com/20910143 that might help explain it. Also, endometriosisassn.org has a lot of good info. I'm sorry about the wall of text, I'm on mobile right now. Let me know if you have other questions.
