Sorry that happened to you. 

I've had the reddit hug of death in real life. 

First time it happened to me was when I was trying to ask out a deaf woman. I wanted to ask her out in sign language. I asked for help. Reddit was awesome for advice... at first. 

I got great resources. I asked her out. She pretty much said that she wasn't into me in that way. Meh, dust yourself off, get back on that horse. 

Then, people went through my post history. They pieced things together and found out where I went to school. Redditors found out who I was based on my previous posts. 

When they came up to me to ask about me asking her out, I tended to say "It's fine, please walk away".

She was in a public service position. Things were different for her. She got tons of shit. 

People from reddit harassed a chick because she wasn't into a guy whose story they wanted a "Happily ever after" ending.  

She quit her job over it.

So reddit can do bad things with good intentions. 

I kill off an account a year because of this. If anyone recognizes me, I kill that account full stop.  

When Reddit has good intentions, it's bad. When it's bad intentions, it's REAL bad. 

FYI, I'll PM you the link that caused me so much trouble the first time, if you don't believe the trouble.
