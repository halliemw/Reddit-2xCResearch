Oh gosh. I was talking at a party last night about MrPantzen and I trying to convince the Moose that she could pee in the shower. I was like, "And you know, we tell her, 'The humans do it. You can do it too,' but she's a dog, so not so good with the English."

One guy choked so hard on his beer that I thought he was going to pass out, but all the women looked positively horrified. I was like, wtf? Who wants to get out of the shower and go sit on a toilet with a wet butt? Not me.
