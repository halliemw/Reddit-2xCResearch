Haha! The creator's comments below the comic basically sum up our interactions over this. Thanks so much for the intersectionality link. We talked more and I think the problem is that he views it as if I'm not at the very bottom I shouldn't feel like sexism is an issue, when really I'm just upset in the same way the comic artist is-- I don't like my experiences made out to seem imagined. Thanks again, will try sharing this later.
