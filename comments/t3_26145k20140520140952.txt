It depends on how I feel that day. If I'm tired, headachy, otherwise not feeling well (I am chronically ill), I just ignore it. If I'm feeling pretty well and perky I can get pretty snotty back at them. Most men will not actually attack a woman because they are trained to be too embarrassed to do so - they feel it "lowers" them.  Use this against them. Humiliate them.
One time a dude grabbed my boobs as I was walking down the street. He kept walking and I stopped for a minute, I was so shocked. Then I turned and started shrieking at him, all kinds of curses and incoherent rage.  He actually ran out in traffic, he was so scared.  I was very proud of myself!
