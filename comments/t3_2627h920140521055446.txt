Maybe not a mind-reader so much as having an awareness of social cues.

If you look at a person you find attractive, that's fine. But staring at them for, as you say, "longer than a few minutes"... I mean, really, minutes? That's a long time, it would definitely make me feel uncomfortable, let alone a thirteen year old girl.

I would suggest that the most "selfish oxytocin trip" is the stranger making a young girl feel unhappy in public because they are staring at her for their own pleasure.

Of course it is not acceptable to tar everyone with the same brush, but it's important that this young lady is aware that behaviour that makes her uncomfortable is not acceptable and that she is not in the wrong for feeling the way she does.
