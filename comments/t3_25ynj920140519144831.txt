Yes, get your degree.  It's hard but you're almost there, it just doesn't make sense to stop.  You may think you never want kids and never want money, but our 20 year old selves can never know what we'll want at 30.  And at least as far as money is concerned, you WILL want it at some point, when you realize just how expensive it is to live even modestly.  

Now, I write that and then see you're studying flute performance.  Have you considered changing your major to something else?  If you don't even enjoy it anymore as you say, getting a degree in something so specific and niche as that might be a mistake.  I know if you've been on a music school track for so long transfer credits might be tough to work out, but I imagine you still had to take most of the regular gen eds required for other degrees anyway, so maybe there isn't much to make up.
