Miley has done some pretty gross things. She made a pretty awful rape joke the other day at one of her Bangerz shows, and the way she plays dress up in black culture is really not cool. Also she uses little people as props in one of her shows. 

I completely agree with you though about how it's not okay how child actresses are treated, though. She got the same unfair treatment as Britney.
