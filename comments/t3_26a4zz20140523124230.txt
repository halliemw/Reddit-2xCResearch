Sure, it really depends on what the conversation actually was, but if it's just "I feel like crap because of my period,"  or "I need a tampon" or whatever then I see no issue. Not all "period talk" is graphic.

 You don't have to imagine the blood her tampon is soaking up! (and for some guys, it IS a sensitivity issue)
