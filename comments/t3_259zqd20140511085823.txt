I'm polyamorous so being good at working through jealousy kind of comes with the territory. I still get jealous but the trick is to work through it rather then to avoid it. 

Typically I look at jealousy as the dashboard "check engine" light of the relationship. It's nothing more then a signal that demonstrates that you are not getting some need met in the relationship. Do some reflection and see what that is. Do you have fears of abandonment? Do you not feel special within the relationship? Do you feel insecure about yourself? Do you need more affection? Words of affirmation? 

If you know your triggers it can be easier to identify. I know personally my biggest triggers are not getting enough sex and physical affection, and not feeling special in the relationship. I find that if I notice I have an unmet need I communicate this with my primary and then he knows how to help me and we can solve the problem. If all my needs are met in my primary relationship I don't experience jealousy at all, even as my primary has other relationships. 

While this method works well for me in my non-monogamous relationship the principle is the same for monogamous relationships. No one is immune to jealousy but it doesn't mean you can't work through it. Don't fear jealousy, that just makes the problem bigger in your mind. Confront it, identify your triggers and work through it with your partner. Knowing your triggers can prevent future jealousy attacks as well.
