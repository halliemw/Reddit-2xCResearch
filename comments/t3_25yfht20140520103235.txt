I totally second Mass Effect and Knights of the Old Republic. I played through all three ME games last year and I fell in love with them. They create the character of female Shepard really well, so Mass Effect is definitely my top rec. KOTOR is great for that too, especially the second one, it has a strong female lead. I also like that in both of them you can choose who you romance and whether or not you want to romance someone at all.
