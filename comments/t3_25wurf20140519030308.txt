I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder in my late teens. I sounded a lot like you, in that in situations where there was sort of a set topic to be discussed (such as helping customers at work) I was fine, but when it came to small talk and just socializing I was useless (bullied as a kid/emotional abuse at home just totally sapped my confidence). I spent about a year in really intensive cognitive behavioural therapy, with a really awesome psychologist, and by the time we were done I no longer met the diagnostic criteria of the disorder. Changed my life.

I was told that social anxiety disorder is very treatable. I do think you have to find the right person to work with though. It was pretty systematic and constructive - not just them listening to you talk about your feelings (although that's part of it). I'm saying this as not all therapists are psychologists, and not all psychologists practice CBT, and (in my experience) not all CBT psychologists are good at what they do. But if social anxiety is the issue, you may be able to find someone who can really help you :).
