There are some women who come to accept their facial hair. I went shopping with my sister about 15 years ago and met saleswoman who was dressed to impress, had great makeup, and a thick mustache with a streak of white hair. It matched the white streak that she had in her hair. I remember how it seemed feminine and elegant . (She had her mustache groomed as well.)
