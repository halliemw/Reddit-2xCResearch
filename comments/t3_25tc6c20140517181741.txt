Depending on the severity/how the case turns, he could probably, quite realistically, press charges, especially on something like defamation (if he were to get away with the assaults). Legal counsel would be the best option, especially if there are any doubts of him being convicted. Also, I think its incredibly stupid that a school can adjudicate a case as serious as sexual assault. I'd try talking to your local (non campus) police and explaining your situation. A lot of schools have been facing trouble from their treatment of rape/sexual assault n campus. I don't know if it's being treated correctly or not, but its something to look into. I'm sorry it happened, and good luck at your hearings.
