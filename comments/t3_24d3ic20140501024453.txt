I already perform self exams frequently. So far I've not had anything abnormal, but I'd definitely notice it quickly. Even if I'm negative, that wouldn't change. Its just so ingrained at this point.  

My mom had her mastectomy at 33, after her first remission ended.  Her cancer was aggressive and relentless. I don't want that. Even a 45% higher chance is more than I'm comfortable with.
