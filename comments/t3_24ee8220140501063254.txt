That must be hard... But you can do it! Even if it takes an extra year and semester like me :-) Are you getting any help? A good deal of what was going on with me was that I was on the wrong medication for a whole year and didn't realize it! Now I've changed meds and am doing way better :-)

Please pm me if you ever want to talk/vent/rant/whatever!! :-)
