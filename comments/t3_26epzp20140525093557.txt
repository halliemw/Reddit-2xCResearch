It's not about choosing different toys.  I'm ok with my daughter choosing different toys than my son.  It's that girl toys presume that girls won't be as interested in the stars or science in general.  I once saw car kit for my son where he built his own roads and pathways.   The "girl" version from the same company didn't disassemble and the pink cars just drove to the mall.   You are one massive insecure douche
