How much do you two know about life?  What were 'adult' measuring events in your mutual lives.  Have you had serious discussion on the roles you each of you are being cast to play?  Who is the stronger, leading partner?  Have all your dreams, hopes, fears been discussed?  How will all the bills be paid, and by whom?   Do you each have a true 'lust' to be with each other?  Not just sexual lust, but companion - togetherness lust.

Get those answers for yourselves, and then tell them to your Mother.  If you have a flirty, dirty Aunt, talk to her and have her tell you the way it is.  Have you future husband talk to his bravest, successful Uncle, and get his head straight.  After this, at the end of the next 6 months, get married.
