Ahh, thank you for this. I'm so glad things worked out/you're in a better place now! The past times I've had meaningless sex I didn't feel this way but for some reason this time, sleeping with a guy I probably wouldn't have hooked up with if it was in a different setting made me realize this is completely not what I want. 

I'm a pretty self-aware person, but I didn't realize I was lonely until this encounter, and the line of thought of "lonely people don't get laid" is definitely something that I had been thinking before this.

Again, thank you so much for your response. I really just needed to hear that it'll turn out okay
