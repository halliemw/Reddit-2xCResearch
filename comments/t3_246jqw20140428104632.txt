Get to the gym after work.  The biggest barrier is what I call "shoe inertia"--if you can get past the hurdle of putting your shoes on and getting in your car, you'll work out at least a little.  It won't happen immediately, but over time you'll notice you have more energy and you can get more things done...  I've also found that eating well (lots of veggies) and sleeping adequately help.
