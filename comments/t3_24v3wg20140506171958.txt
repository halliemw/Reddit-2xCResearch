Oh god. Seriously, this. Torture is nice and all, but little moments of affection are the most important to me. I want my sub knowing he's doing well. I want him to feel loved and appreciated, even when I'm making his life very difficult. 


For example, I'd like to see a top stroking the sub's hair a little bit after teasing them mercilessly. Telling them how good they are, how lovely they look, how perfect they are, how much they're appreciated, all while they struggle for you, jerking and whimpering. Kissing their nose or their cheek or their mouth, telling them how good they're doing. That you believe in them, that you know they can do it. Checking in with them, making sure everything is still okay. If they're tied up for a while, making sure their circulation is still good. Porn is full of "perfect scenarios", where nobody ever checks in and there are never any problems. I don't really like that. 

And aftercare. Nothing sweeter than good aftercare. Especially if we see the top doing something special (like baking/buying the sub's favorite treat). Even in amateur porn this is almost impossible to find. Kink to me is not just about pain and punishment. It's about knowing your sub, knowing what they need, and giving it to them in a kind, responsible, empathetic way. Sure, a lot of what they need might be pain or different forms of torment. But ultimately the point is that they enjoy it. And most actual human beings aren't *only* looking to be used or degraded or tortured. In addition, they need affection and support, little moments of love and kindness during scenes - and tons of love and kindness outside of scenes.
