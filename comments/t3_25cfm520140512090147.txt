I had a pretty good grounding in the basics of anatomy and sex from a young age, thanks to a comprehensively illustrated book about where babies come from, but I still made certain inferences about it that didn't turn out to be correct.

Because it hurts guys so much to be hit in the groin, I figured that their whole genital area must be really delicate and that you'd have to be very gentle when touching a penis. Sex turned out to be a lot more vigorous than I'd originally imagined.
