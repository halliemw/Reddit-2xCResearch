Find a salon where they have a wide range of customers and do more than straight traditional. The salon I go to serves everyone from kids to ol' grannies to punk rockers. The stylists have a wide range of styles and colors on themselves. Also see if your neighborhood or town newspaper has a people's choice thing every year; also a good way to find a salon where they listen to their clients.
