I guess maybe just talk about what happened, how it made you feel, and your concerns. That you feel unsafe, that you are scared as to where those thoughts and words and actions on his part came from, that you feel the blame is being placed on you. I would be upfront with him, and say you don't feel comfortable in this relationship anymore, because regardless of the fact that he was drunk, those feelings and words and actions came from somewhere inside him, and you don't want to be hurt worse next time if it happens again. 

Also, if he doesn't want someone in the room with you when you talk, at least have someone in the house, maybe outside the door, and make sure you have your phone with you in your hand. If at all possible, have someone physically next to you. If he can't understand why you would need that assurance, then you have your answer as to whether or not you should stay with him. If he cares more about his feelings than the fact that he hurt you, and could have very seriously injured you, there's a big problem.
