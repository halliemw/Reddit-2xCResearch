That would totally make me cry, just the shock of having someone doing something so horrible when I wasn't doing anything. I'd get mad later, but I'd definitely cry first :(

Edit: Really? Sorry my hypothetical emotions offended someone. I might not have the toughest skin, but pretty sure this event would ruin anyone's day and I express my feelings instead of internalizing them.
