>Wearing hijab these women were allowed to leave the houses they used to be confined to. With hijab they can go to school, university and have a job. They can even work in mixed sexes environments.

That sounds horrible. They would be perfectly capable of doing all those things (and helping to do good things in the world) if not for people and ideologies that declared they were bad women for doing them without the hijab or doing them at all.

I'm glad it's helped them progress, but to see not wearing a hijab as more of a problem than being forced to wear one seems like you're compromising with a symptom rather than the root of the oppression.

>If you are deeply religious muslim you consider the hijab a commandment, being forcefully forbidden to wear one would limit these women to indoor stay.

Aren't there some religious Muslim women who do not think the hijab is a commandment? It's not in the Koran, as I recall.
