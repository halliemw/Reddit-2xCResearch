Mine's a combination of both! Half of the time she's within a few feet of me, wanting love (she'll sit on one of the kitchen table chairs when I cook!) and the other half she's inventing ways to pester me (her new one is standing the bathroom, chirping at me until I turn the faucet on for her).

She greets me at the door too! I had never heard of a cat doing that before.
