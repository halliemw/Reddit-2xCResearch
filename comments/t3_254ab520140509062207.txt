Everyone reacts to birth control differently. Personally, when I was on it my physical symptoms (cramping, nausea, migraines) were significantly lessened and I had a much lighter flow BUT my emotional symptoms were much more extreme. I switched to Nuvaring and everything is much more balanced now. Sometimes it takes a month or two for your body to regain a balance. But there are non-hormonal alternatives that you could look into. On both of them I only ever had PMS while I was actually PMSing.

But, no one can force you. It's ultimately your decision, and you should remember that you do have a choice in this.
