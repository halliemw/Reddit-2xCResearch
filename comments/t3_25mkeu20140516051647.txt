I agree, age doesn't solve the issue but it certainly makes me way more comfortable. 

I'm 8ish years in to getting my period now, and my views of it have changed greatly. I was MORTIFIED going to the store to get tampons or pads in the beginning, I didn't even like having them in the cart. If I'd gone to a friends house while on my period and they didn't have a bin for a pad, little 13 year old me would've wanted to die. 

Now, it's just not a big deal anymore. If somebody doesn't have a waste bin wrap it well and take it to the kitchen. People aren't going to say anything. They know what you're doing, they won't necessarily comment. Same way I doubt you'd comment when your friend had to pee and took 20 minutes in the bathroom. You know they were pooping but you don't say anything.
