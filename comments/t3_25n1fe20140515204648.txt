I think it should also be okay to choose not to change yourself and not be put down for doing so. You can love yourself and want to improve your physique. You can also love yourself and be okay with your physique. I shouldn't have to feel ashamed for my body all the time because someone else deems that it is unattractive or unhealthy. I should be allowed to love myself anyway. Isn't it possible that both answers are okay?
