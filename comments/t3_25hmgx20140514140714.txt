I'm not giving no consideration to the woman in his class who felt insulted.  I'm suggesting she take a mature approach and talk to him directly as a first step.

Why is everyone so ready to make a huge issue out of everything instead of just trying plain and simple communication first.

By the way, I've had professors say things which insulted/irritated me too.  I'm just not sure that feeling insulted/irritated is enough to make the decision to ruin someones career.
