> I'm pretty sure we're not getting the full story here as 2 emails in 9 months would not warrant looking to further action on Emma's part. 

He glosses over the rest with, "there were mistakes and miscommunications."  

I'm pretty sure this is what happened: she says to him that the emails he's been sending at 3AM quoting Lovecraft on despair are creepy and threatening (he doesn't think that's a fair reading; it was a reference to that one time they went camping and stayed up late at night in the woods and he read *The Mountains of Madness* to her.  He was truly happy then and she said she was too). He reflects, though, and can see how she might have misinterpreted. And how better to show that he gets it than to break into her apartment and leave a boiling rabbit on the stove? Who could think so low of him to miss the self-deprecatory irony?
