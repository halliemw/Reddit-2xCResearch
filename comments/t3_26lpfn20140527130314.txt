Have you considered doing some freelance work on the side? Hop on http://www.peopleperhour.com/ or https://www.elance.com/ and see if you can make a little extra doing some writing (you're already a student so you must be good at that!), editing or really anything you like! I know when I first started out as a freelancer (before my SO went freelance & he was still working 50 hours a week at a job he loved) I went through a lot of the same emotions as you did. I was home, doing a bit of housework, but generally feeling not-very-useful. I know you said you don't really want to work, but I can't describe to you the satisfaction and fulfillment I felt when I was doing something entirely on my own, even if it was just 3 hours a week! Just thought it might, possibly, help you lift that depression fog :)
