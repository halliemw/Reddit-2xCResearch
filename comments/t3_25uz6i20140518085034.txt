I'll offer this advice: If you and your fianc√© haven't done anything sexual before, don't feel like you necessarily have to go all the way with PIV sex on your first night. After all, most people who are sexually active before marriage work up to that, so why should people who wait feel the need to jump right in? That's not to say you shouldn't do it if it feels right, but spend some time getting used to just being naked together, feeling each other, talking about what you want. I'd advise starting with fingers or toys so you can get used to the feeling of having something inside you. A lot of the pain that women experience on their first time comes from being nervous, so taking some time to get used to each other before jumping in might help relax you and your muscles.
