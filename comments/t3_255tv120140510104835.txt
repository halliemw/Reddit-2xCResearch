First of all, thank you so much for sharing your story and being strong enough to leave him but even face him in court. That's wonderful and you did a great thing! I have been through my fair share of abusive relationships, plus I was raised by a very violent, abusive father so I've always been very interested in what makes men (as that is my experience with abuse) behave that way. I've recently found [this book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q9J0RO/ref=cm_sw_r_fa_ask_Jy2MH.1BKTHQT) has helped me process a lot of what happened in my childhood and what's happened in past relationships. You might check it out if you're into that.  

Other than that, hang in there! Every day is an opportunity for a better day.
