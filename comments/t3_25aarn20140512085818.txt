I have no horse in this race. I've spent years on tour with the Dead and Phish, I am the last guy who gives a damn if you shave your legs or not. Just trying to shed some light on how these things can look with another decade or two under your belt. I'm not saying she's spot on for her take, because I have no view into the particulars. I'm not saying you're wrong for making personal decisions. As I said, I don't take her approach myself. But I understand it, and I expect that she's trying to be helpful in the long-term if not the immediate present.

[One note, trivial though it clearly is: just like lots of women like men clean shaven, lots of men like women shaven as well. If I grew my beard out, which looks hillbilly and god-awful, no one would actually say to me, "I'm not interested in you because of that ugly beard of yours". But that wouldn't mean that my beard hadn't had an impact on their level of interest in me. I'm sure you've considered such things and don't care, but I thought it was worth noting.]
