Thank you!  I'm one of the guys that fits your description. Now that I'm in my 30's I've had to try and accept that companionship, love and sex are simply not something I get to experience. Sometimes I'm fine with it but other times it hurts a lot. The world can be a very lonely place at times. Does this mean that I hate women? No.  Do I blame others for my flaws? No.

What I don't like though is the way that men like myself are increasingly becoming stereotyped as misogynists. Perhaps I just notice it more because I frequent sites like Jezebel and have many feminist friends, or perhaps I'm just more sensitive to it, but it has got to the stage where I feel even less able to express how lonely I am as it feels like guys like me are no longer allowed to say that they feel lonely without coming across as entitled.

Unfortunately, in many ways I fit the "Nice Guy" stereotype too. Physically I fit the bill. To the point where if I was photographed next to one of my female friends and the image ended up on Reddit there would be several "LOL FRIENDZONED" comments within seconds. I'm not physically attractive and yeah I have a neckbeard. My kind is mocked, and I'm used to that.  I'm ugly, and I'm used to that. But now I feel that because of the way I look and because of my lack of relationship experience people are starting to presume that I must therefore be an entitled bitter misogynist.

The unfortunate truth is that there are misogynists in every part of society. There are misogynists in the office, on the sports field and yes, at sic-fi conventions. Some misogynists are attractive and date many women, some misogynists will likely die virgins.
