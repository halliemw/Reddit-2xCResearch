I don't know how one goes about relinquishing parental duties, but this idiot needs to pay child support. What state do you live in? Some states like Texas are extremely vigilant about garnishing wages for child support and will even go about getting it all on their own. His behavior is unacceptable and immature. I feel so sad for your poor daughter, she doesn't deserve to have such a deadbeat.
