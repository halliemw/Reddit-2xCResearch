Yup! 

OP, you don't have to say it during sex if you think it'll feel forced afterwards. 

Maybe next time he talks about your butt maybe you bring up your breasts. Go with a flirty "I love how much you love my butt, but all that love is making my poor breasts/boobs/tits feel neglected. Can't you give them some love too? I love hearing you say how much you like them."  If he doesn't go for a boob compliment after that, say it openly at another time. Just don't start with a defensive "do you hate my boobs or something!?"
