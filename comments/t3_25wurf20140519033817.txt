Everything you just said basically describes me. Especially blurting out stuff that makes no sense in conversations and later wondering why I even said that. And the nail biting stuff too, I know it looks gross but i just can't stop doing it when I`m stressed. I`m 26, female, software developer, not diagnosed with any mental disorders. And I have really, really hard time making new friends.
 I had really good friends in highschool and university, but after I graduated we kinda drifted apart. And I have literally no idea how you are supposed to make new friends at 26. In school it kinda happened naturally, you would sit together and start to talk about stuff and hang out. Most people at my job are male and a lot older than me. But not just that, its like we simply don't interact in ways that would start friendships. Or at the gym, or my yoga class, I would make some small talk with some women there, but it just never develops beyond that.  I'm just really starting to feel like i`m hopeless.
