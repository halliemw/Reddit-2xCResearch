Hi. I had a gun put to my head in front of my apartment a few years ago. I know what it feels like to be helpless and put in a terrifying situation. I don't think you know though - you'd rather pass the buck and call anyone you disagree with "attacking" the OP

I hope that you never have to go through anything like what her or I have gone through, and I hope you learn to put your emotions aside and see when somebody is trying to help

That is all.
