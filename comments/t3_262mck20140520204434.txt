If you're going solo maybe your cousin can introduce you to some people before you go so it's not the awkward introduction small talk at the event itself? Since she's your cousin there's probably going to be family there, maybe reach out to them and let them know that you're going but don't know a lot of the other invited guests? 

Keep some things in the back of your mind that you can make small talk about. If worse comes to worse find the table with all the drunk people and join in j/k.
