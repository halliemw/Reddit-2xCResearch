I didn't even know what rape scenes the article was talking about because I watched the movie through a red film of anger. I read and thoroughly enjoyed the first two books. The first two books never have a rape. In fact, she says she wasn't raped ("they touched me...now like that...but they touched me" is about what she says. I'm not discounting her violation, just that the books didn't really have that content.)

The movie was corny and weak compared to the books, and in my opinion is really that the book is a story of what happens when a strong female character falls victim to An authors perspective of love.
