I had a strickingly similar situation when I decided to move in with my best friend!  

Remember to stand up for yourself.  This is your home too.  Tell her how you feel, she needs to know.  It may help as long as she doesnt sweep this under the rug too.

If you calmly explain how you feel and she does not take it well at least you tried.  From there, you will have to distance yourself and find another roomate.  From what it sounds you are a great roomate, even going so far as giving your undivided attention when they had a bad day.

Every one has faults but if she is constantly pointing out yours or making you feel like less of a person that is unnaceptable. There is a difference between constructive critisim and bullying. I hope so badly that you can resolve this situation through communication so that you will not have to live in a toxic situation.  I know how it feels to be anxious to go home everyday.
