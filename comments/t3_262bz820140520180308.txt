Now I'm going to have to go back and watch that scene again, but IIRC in the initial scene where the Pied Piper guys meet her at the booth, she portrays herself as being the (or a?) programmer for the app she is promoting. It's only in the scene in the hotel room that she admits that she gets guys to write all her code for her, and she just writes the company's tweets.
