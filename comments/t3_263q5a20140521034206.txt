I have a bifid tip too! I didn't know there was a term for it so thanks :) English isn't my first language so it's easier for me to do more research on that now (there isn't much in my own language). 

I'm not really worried about the pain, honestly. I've read that it isn't so horrible especially if you only get the tip done and I've gone through a bigger surgery before haha. My main concern is that the change will be too big although the surgeon that would be doing my nose is known for not cutting too much! He has even refused doing surgery when he thought they didn't need it. I haven't met him yet but I feel quite confident about him! 

Thanks for the support :)
