> What message does it send when you say that "virginity" is preferred?

It says that women should wait until marriage to have sex - they will be happier that way.  There is a less of a chance they will get their heartbroken or become attached to somebody who doesn't like you. 

> Would you not be sending the message that a lack of virginity is okay but NOT AS GOOD as being a virgin?

No, not at all.  You can say "it's better to not do cocaine" without saying "people who do cocaine have less value than people who do cocaine."
