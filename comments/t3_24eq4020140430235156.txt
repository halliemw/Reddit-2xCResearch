You *can* get a massage in the first trimester. It is a myth that you can't. Some spas or individual massage therapists won't do it because they are covering their asses in case something goes wrong and you want to blame them, but you will not put the baby at risk by getting a massage.  Keep calling around and find someone who will work on you.  After your work trauma you definitely deserve it. 

I personally had two massages in my first trimester.  One was in a spa setting around 6 weeks and very relaxing but not much pressure, and the other was with a therapist who does structural work and nearly made me cry around 9 weeks.  I'm 24 weeks now.  

I also occasionally drink some wine, have caffeinated coffee, and don't worry about things like lunch meat.  We had an actual listeria outbreak from cantaloupe here in CO (and nobody suggests pregnant women avoid fruit.), and I've never heard of anyone actually getting it from lunch meat.

When I went on vacation in Puerto Rico at 10 weeks I was sad because I felt like I had to avoid the hot tub.  My doctor told me that I was not going to cook my baby and as long as I wasn't feeling over heated the baby would be fine too.  He said to relax in general, and the only diet advice he has given me is, "keep doing what you're doing, the baby is clearly growing"

Fuck anyone who is not your doctor who thinks they have a right to comment on your choices.
