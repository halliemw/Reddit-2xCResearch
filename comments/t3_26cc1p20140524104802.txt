Victim blaming is not permitted, but due to mods inability to moderate the new traffic to the sub, these kinds of posts often stay up for a long period of time. Even if they are downvoted, it brings a negative energy to the sub which makes me and many other users extremely uncomfortable.

I've also noticed people saying that "victim blaming" is some SJ radfem made up word, which I never encountered before this sub when default.
