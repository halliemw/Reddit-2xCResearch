I started my period at 9 and had B-cup boobs at 10, and was the tallest person in my class then too. So I probably started puberty around 8. 


I don't know, it was normal to me and my mum treated it as normal. I knew where babies came from since I was 4 and my little brother showed up, so that was not a surprise. My mum just showed me how period stuff worked and I was allowed to use the teacher's bathroom when I was on my period since it had a trashcan. That was it. Not a big deal.
