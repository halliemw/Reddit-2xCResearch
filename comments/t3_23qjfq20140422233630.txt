I'd arrange a doctor's visit, tomorrow preferably, and have his family make a surprise visit. That is, make a certified medical health professional tell your SO that his coping strategy is misinformed and reckless, coupled with an intervention style sit down. You and your in-laws need to address the fact that he is putting his need to exercise before your various relationships and his loved ones' emotional well being, which is just plain selfish. Cruel even. Only an entitled ass of epic proportions would expect his/her SO, family and friends to stick around to watch him/her kill himself.
