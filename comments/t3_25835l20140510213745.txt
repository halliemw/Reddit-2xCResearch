Don't bury tampons or toilet paper, Pack it in pack it out! 
I have spent a month backpacking in the wilderness and you just put them in a plastic bag and dispose if them after the trip. 
Imagine coming across someone else's used tampons or toilet paper. It's unpleasant and animals sometimes don't leave things buried. Just bring a bag and pack out what you bring in. It's only polite :)
