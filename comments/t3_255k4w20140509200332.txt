Do you work with only this one vendor, and are you considering looking for other vendors? I ask because all of the t-shirts in the picture you posted look like they are fairly tight/unforgiving in the bust, but a little baggy at the waist. I think it is __incredibly cool__ that you are posting examples of all sizes, and I love the designs, but based on that picture I would not order your product because it doesn't look like it would fit a girl with a more hourglass shape.
