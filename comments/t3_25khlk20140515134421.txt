Yep.  A bunch of us have been seen as loud or bitchy.  There's one *really* loud woman at my workplace (we're very good friends).  I've sometimes asked her to pipe down temporarily (she can intimidate almost anyone) and because she gets tired of people complaining about her (she can't understand why her loudness is such a problem - she's very loud), she has been happy to experiment with me.

The fun part is bringing her to a meeting where people think some other woman is loud or bitchy.  She's more than willing to do her part (she likes herself as she is).

BTW, I think there's a real trend for men who want to be upwardly mobile to master soft-speaking to the point of...extremely softspoken guys.  It makes the louder women stand out even more.  And it's definitely something they encourage (soft spokeness) in each other these days.  

Is spokeness a word?  Spokenness?  Well, if it isn't, I'm still using it.
