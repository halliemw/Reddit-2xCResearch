I'll go ahead and vouch for the copper IUD as well. It's gonna make her periods a bit heavier and maybe a little more crampy but thats pretty much it and it's totally manageable. 

It lasts for ten years so compare the one time cost of the IUD to the monthly charge of a pill pack or whatever for the same amount of time and the IUD will have paid for itself within two years.
