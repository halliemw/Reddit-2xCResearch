Don't worry it really doesn't actually hurt. 

First of all don't be afraid to tell the doctor that you are nervous about being uncomfortable during you're Pap smear. That should ensure they take their time and slowly explain the procedure and personally, I think knowing everything that's going on will put you at ease from the beginning. 

That should help with your nerves right out the gate.

The speculum is really made out to be a scary metal torture device. It's not THAT big. It's helping your doctor get a clear view of all your lady parts. Sure they are chilly and are not made of a tempur pedic mattress foam but if you flinch or clench that's more apt to cause you discomfort then the device itself. 

Also, they aren't scraping plaque off your teeth during a Pap smear. It's more like swabbing the inside of your cheek with a cotton swab. But instead of a cotton swab they use something better shaped for the inside of your vagina. It's quick and as long as you relax and remember it's once a year and for your health and well- being I'm sure you won't ever hate it as much as the dentist. Also you seem like you might prefer a women doctor. 

But regardless of preference always be open about your concerns and a good doctor will not only address them they will do everything they can to put you at ease.

Maybe consider getting a OBGYN recommendation directly from a friend. Ask what they like about their doctor, are they friendly? Easy to talk to? And super gentle with your friend's lady business? If they answer yes to all those questions it's time to check and see if they accept your insurance, because you are on your way to a five star check up!
