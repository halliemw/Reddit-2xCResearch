I can only say that I (and several people I hang out with) would be *really* angry in this scenario and would not be playing go-between with the business contacts.  

I would find it hard to confine my anger to just venting, I'd have to act in some way (and simply hanging up on those business related phone calls would be a more neutral way, I'd have a hard time endorsing that the people on the phone - who met *me* would now want contact with *that company.*  The ethics of a company is more important to me than the products they may offer.

A combination of realizing you're an outstanding worker, a very kind and good person, that you've been screwed over by people without ethics  and that you can just let the anger help might help get rid of the soul-crushing sensation.
