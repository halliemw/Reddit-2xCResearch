Just playing devil's advocate here, but does calling this response sexist bullshit imply that dress codes in general are bullshit? Because I wouldn't necessarily agree with that. Dress codes are something that keeps people within sane lines (ie. don't come to school naked, don't wear your gang colours, explicitly offensive clothing (eg. racial slurs), etc.). The problem is when these rules are overtly unfair for any particular gender/race in my opinion.

This case is slightly different than what I'm saying here, because she was following the rules, and still reprimanded, which is legit bullshit. However, it seems to me like a lot of other people are taking this further and extending it to "this is sexist bullshit because she should be able to wear whatever the hell she wants", which isn't necessarily true. Dress codes should exist to some extent.

...Of course I may just be taking responses in a manner not intended by them, but I don't think I am so far.
