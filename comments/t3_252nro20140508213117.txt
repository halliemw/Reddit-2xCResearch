Perhaps a bit off subject but, I have gone without any eye makeup for two months now for the first time in decades.  No mascara (which I rarely wore anyway) and no eyeliner (which I wore daily).  The result is no more headaches caused by eye strain.  Apparently, the eye liner irritated the surface of my eyes causing horrible headaches.  :/
