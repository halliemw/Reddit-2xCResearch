Thank you! 

We have a joint account and separate personal accounts.  We both have debit cards and checks for the joint account.  I definitely have enough money in my personal account for a worst case scenario.

We haven't talked about me paying him back when I get a job, but I'll definitely bring that up do him.  All he's asked is that I help unpack the apartment while he's away at work (fine by me, I love decorating and arranging things).  

I would imagine that once I get a job, we'll look at things in a percentage sort of way.  He makes a good chunk of money right now, so if I make less than him once I get a job, I'll just pay in a smaller percentage into the joint account.  Thanks so much for your response.  Your questions at the end really helped me put things into perspective.
