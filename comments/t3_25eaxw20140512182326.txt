Seek some counseling. Its never easy and you did what was best you thought and thats fine.  You not a bad person and at that time that was right for you. Look after your mental health now. Tell your boyfriend how you feel. Get counseling. You will be a mother when your ready. regretting a child would be worse. And I can't impress this on you enough you are not a bad person your emotions now are perfectly fine to have and your entitled to be sad about it but please get help before it gets out of hand.
