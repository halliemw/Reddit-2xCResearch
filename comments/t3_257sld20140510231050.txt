I feel like in the South, anything before 60-70 is young, and anything before 30 is teenaged. Time just seems to go slower, and I don't know about your neck of the woods, but people tend to live forever out here. It bothers me when people who are 25 think they're old- you've only lived a third of your life! You're still a spring chicken! 

These types of compliments have nothing to do as a comment on your maturity, only that maybe you got lucky in the genes department. I don't mind them.
