I experienced something similar recently and it really broke my heart.  My SO was afraid to clean something because he was afraid he would do it 'wrong' and I would be mad. At first I thought it was an excuse to not clean-up when I'm not around, but when he named specific instances, I realized I can be way too anal about how I want things done.  Since then I've loosened up since I never want him to be afraid of me/my reaction.
