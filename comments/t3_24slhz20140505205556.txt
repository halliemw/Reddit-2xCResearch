I had a LEEP done two years ago, it was just about two months before I was back to normal and excuse me if its TMI but my "normal" means that I was done bleeding, passing the black stuff, gooing and otherwise leaking any fluids that were not my norm, and smelling fresh again because the LEEP makes you smell terrible for a little while. also that's when I felt comfortable enough to have gentle sex again.
