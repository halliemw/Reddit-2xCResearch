Haha theres nothing to apologize for. Of course those type of posts are not insightful, and theres really not a place for them here. I don't really hang out here at all so I am not familiar with what goes on, I just thought the idea of not wanting to hear opinions specifically referred to as 'correct and insightful' just because of gender is an attitude I'm unfamiliar with.
