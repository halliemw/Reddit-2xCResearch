If you're in the US and don't mind paying shipping, www.therealreal.com is what's up. It's a verified luxury consignment site, and it's perfect for poor kids with expensive taste like myself. I got a pair of barely worn Louboutins for a third of their retail price, and they have killer sales all the time.
