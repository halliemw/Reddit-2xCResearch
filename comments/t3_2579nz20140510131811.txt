It seemed pretty far-fetched to me, too. I am glad that you called them out. I'm disappointed that this sub becoming default has caused some residual territory protection where people are up in arms in this manner. You weren't questioning OP so I personally don't have a problem with your asking for a source where you did because the statement that commenter made was a bit...out there.

HOWEVER, this specific comment of yours that I'm replying to doesn't really jive well with this sub. I know what you meant by your differentiation between life experiences/anecdotes and verified studies. None of us have a problem with that because there are some fiercly (I don't care that it's not a word it is now) intelligent women on here, many of whom are scientists and engineers. BUT, when we come here, we take off our scientist/engineer/etc. hat and share life stories and experiences. This is simply not the place to differentiate those two. I'm sorry some commenters are telling you you're not open minded...I'm sure that if that commenter had replaced boys with girls they would have been downvoted instead of you. We shouldn't be perpetuating stereotypes of either gender even though this is a women-focused sub because we are all smart enough to know that putting one gender down still hurts the other (even if it didn't it would still be a problem of course!).

tldr; I think how and when you asked for a source was appropriate (it wasn't OP you were challenging and IMO it was a pretty sexist statement to say that all young boys were like), but please pardon our dust as we settle in to this change, a lot of us are still on edge. And also be wary of telling people on this sub, where a main purpose to share our life experiences, that our life experiences aren't "fact" (again I know what you mean by fact but this is where we put our scientist/engineer hats down)
