It could be nothing, it could be how you were discussed before you came (something like, "We hired an intern and she's a she, so you need to make sure you're behaving around her like you would around any lady") that made them afraid to talk to you or made them resent you for invading their space and requiring "special treatment," it could be that you ain't from around there (I know this is big in Appalachian coal mines), it could be because you're the intern or even because you're college educated and inexperienced and you're coming to tell them how to do their jobs (which you aren't, but blue-collar industries can have that kind of attitude sometimes), it could be outright sexism. 

Chances are it's some combination of those things, and honestly, there's not much you can do about it but do the work and show you're competent. Mining is male-dominated everywhere, so this isn't likely to be the last time you encounter this sort of attitude at work. You're going to have to learn to deal with it, and you might find yourself much more accepted by the men around you once they find out that you're competent, friendly, a little unladylike, and you aren't so different from the people who actually are from around there. It'll get better, and if it doesn't, you'll know one place you don't want to work after you graduate.
