If I posted half of the bad stuff that my family and I have been through in terrible domestic situations, people would say I was making it up, too. You've got nothing to prove and you don't have to justify anything to any of us. Shame on the non-supportive. I think you are awesome for taking an active role in the situation and I encourage you to be there for/protect your Mom while she's down so hard.
