I don't see a lot of guys wearing shortie shorts that go up to their ass cheeks the last time I checked. And did you know that things like tank tops that show the guy's skin is not allowed under most dress codes? you are a complete idiot if you think guys wear clothes that reveal themselves to the same amount as girls.
