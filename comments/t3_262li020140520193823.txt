That's not what I meant by double standards.  I am talking about how clothing and skin is interpreted and what expectations there are around that as to what's "professional" for each gender.  Women experience much more victim-blaming and slut-shaming for their clothing, and the madonna/whore complex of being just revealing enough to be likeable without being a "slut" or a "prude" and women's appearance is much more judged as a measure of her intelligence, likeability and worth than for men.  It not being socially acceptable for men to wear dresses doesn't mean everything about clothing is more oppressive for men.
