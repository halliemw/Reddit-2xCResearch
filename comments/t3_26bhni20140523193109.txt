Poly relationships definitely do have some different challenges than monogamous ones. If Google ever discontinues their lovely calendar, I think the polyamorous members of society will take to rioting in the streets :P 

I consider polyamory part of my sexual orientation, like my bisexuality. I could choose to be with just one person (like I could choose to sleep with only men), but I couldn't make myself stop wanting to pursue more relationships (like I couldnâ€™t turn off wanting women).
