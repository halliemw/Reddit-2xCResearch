I'm not that familiar with their work; it doesn't show up in any of the feminist feeds I follow. But I gather they're "the main feminist organization" in the same way that the Southern Baptist Convention is "the main Christian organization". They get media coverage and are noisy. What does the media cover? Stuff that will get them eyeballs.
