My grandma had a necklace she wore pretty much every single day. All throughout my childhood, whenever she came to visit, I always held it and got her to tell me the story of the necklace. When she and my grandfather were young, he gave her the necklace. It is in the shape of a heart and has tiny chips of 7 gems set in the edges of the heart: Diamond, Emerald, Amethyst, Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, Tourmaline. If you take the first letter of each gem it spells out "Dearest". I don't recall seeing her without it. 

When I turned 18 she gave it to me. It's at home right now because I live in crappy student apartments and wouldn't want something so precious stolen, but I hope one day I can pass it onto one of my own children or grandchildren.

PS. I know nothing about saris but that is beautiful!
