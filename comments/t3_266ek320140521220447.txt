I don't think she's overreacting at all. He really hurt her, and even though time has gone by, it probably still hurts A LOT. In my opinion, I think you're being insensitive to your friend's feelings about her ex. It's not for you to decide whether or not she's having the right feelings or whether she's taking a long time to move past it.

I think he should be uninvited (after all, it's her party too) and you should really apologize to your friend and talk to her about her remaining ill feelings for this guy. He obviously doesn't have any respect for her and it probably really hurt her, more than you realize. I'm sure you didn't mean to make her upset, though. You probably assumed that she was over it by now, but sometimes it can take a lot longer, especially after she was so young and treated badly.
You guys have been friends for a long time and I really hope yall can work it out.
