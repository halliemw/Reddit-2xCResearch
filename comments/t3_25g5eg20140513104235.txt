I got mine put in mostly for the convenience of not having to take a pill every day. But my period *never* regulated. Ever. Not even sort of. I then realized almost two years out that with the Affordable Care Act my NuvaRing was covered 100% by my insurance. I got the implant taken out like two days later and haven't looked back. I'm about two months out and I can totally manage to remember to take out and put in a NuvaRing once a month :)
