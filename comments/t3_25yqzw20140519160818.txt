It's *gotta* be cognitive dissonance, right? I think that when people deal with a great deal of fear or anxiety, it can be easier to lie to yourself and others in order to feel safe. Now, I'm not saying that behavior is acceptable or profitable (deception is almost never okay), but I guess I can decipher where it's coming from.
