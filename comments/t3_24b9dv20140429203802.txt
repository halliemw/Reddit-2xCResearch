I think it depends on what stage of life the mom is in. Are the kids grown or little? I'm a mom to two little kids. To me, the best "gift" on Mother's Day is being able to get all of the good parenting stuff without having to do any of the work for the day. I like to be woken up to the kids climbing all over & to breakfast in bed. I like to sit outside with the family while they play but not have to wash their muddy hands and wash off their muddy boots when we go in. Also--this might sound really odd--I really, really enjoy the idea of everyone else doing the chores for the day. I'm a stay-at-home mom, so I don't think my husband's ever had to do the dishes or laundry or sweep. I ask him to do the chores on Mother's Day because it usually results in getting some compliments for just the daily jobs I do. It makes me feel appreciated. 

Growing up, I remember asking my dad what he'd want on Father's Day. He'd always say, "For you kids to pick up your rooms." We always groaned at him. Now, as a parent, I realize he really meant it! Maybe we should have cleaned our rooms...

I know that answer seems like a cop-out because none of those things are presents, but I think that's the best gift for a mom with kids at home. Give her a day where she doesn't have to do work around the house, but all of the work gets done. Let her just enjoy the good parts of parenting! 

In terms of an actual, literal gift, I'd go with flowers. It's the perfect time of year to plant some annuals. Go get some packs of flowers that she can plant (if she likes that kind of thing), and maybe the kids can help her plant the flowers. :)
