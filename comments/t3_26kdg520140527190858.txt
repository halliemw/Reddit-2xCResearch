Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply.
I looked up the Bra Band Project, but I don't know if it was helpful :(
I saw several girls on their who were 28f and 28g, but maybe I'm crazy, I feel like I'm MUCH more awkwardly built, bigger, etc. than they were.  Why is that???  I was really careful with measuring the second time, and if the calculator is correct, then I'm the same size as they.  Weird, 'cause I can't see it :(
