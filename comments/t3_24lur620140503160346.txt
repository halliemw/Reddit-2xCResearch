>The faculty sample was selected in two different ways to facilitate a statistical examination of the impact of shared race between the student and professor. The first selection method involved identifying an entirely random (and thus representative) sample of 4,375 professors (87% Caucasian, 2% Hispanic, 1% Black, 3% Indian, 4% Chinese, 3% Other; **69% Male**). The second selection method involved over-sampling faculty who were not Caucasian, allowing us the necessary statistical power to test whether minorities are less (or more) biased toward students sharing their race. To examine whether the race and gender of faculty influence the degree to which discrimination is exhibited against minority and female prospective students, 2,173 additional minority faculty were picked for inclusion in the study (29% Hispanic, 21% Black, 21% Indian, 29% Chinese, **68% Male**),3 thus ensuring a sufficiently large sample for an
analysis of same-race faculty-student pairs.

The paper doesn't have a table breaking down the response percentage rates for each e-mail sender demographic as a function of the professor demographics, despite going through pains to have the necessary sample size to get meaningful statistics for all categories.
