Why don't you ask your physician what's going on? I'm sure those growths have been biopsied and microscopically examined and the possibility of it being a non-benign growth has been discussed with you. It can't be such a strange phenomenon that there is no literature available. You need to speak to your physician, ask him the questions you are asking us because we can't give you valid medical advice over the internet :)

Edit: I have never heard of breast tissue being able to grow to such a large size in a small length of time. Not even breast tissue neoplasms grow so fast. I am inclined to believe that this is a medical condition, and you have been given a diagnosis - perhaps it's also a good idea to research this yourself in the medical literature or ask to be referred to a specialist in endocrinology.
