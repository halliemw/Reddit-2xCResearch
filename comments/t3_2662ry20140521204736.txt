I am allergic to the 'sensicreme' of condoms (not the latex itself) and I didn't know about that the first time I had sex. Make sure you're not extra sensitive down there to latex or any sort of condom coating like 'Fire and Ice' or what have you.
Honestly, it felt like I got hot sauce in my eye. Except it was my vagina.
