Ok, again, they could just not watch? If there is a part in a movie that I find disgusting, I don't watch it. I refuse to watch certain movies. I can't really think of anything that people do in public that actively grosses me out, but I imagine if there was something it would be pretty easy just to not look at them.  

I understand that certain people are averse to certain things, but it is on them to avoid it, especially when it's a natural thing that has to happen. I don't think most breastfeeding moms want to whip their boobs out in public, there are cover ups available. But if you're comfortable breastfeeding in public and there is no health or safety reason why you shouldn't, then you shouldn't be hassled for it.

Maybe you're suggesting more education around the issue, like a PSA or something? I don't think it needs to lie on the shoulders of breastfeeding moms to try to make other people more comfortable about it, though. 

You're right, I'm not trying to compare people who are grossed out by breastfeeding to homophobes, but I am saying that what we are "uncomfortable" with has a lot to do with cultural standards. If you were raised around snakes, you're comfortable with the, if you were raised to have care and compassion for people from other backgrounds, you probably do. It's an education issue. 

I just get pissed off when people complain, because, like, that's what babies EAT. Because we are mammals. It has nothing to do with nakedness or sexuality. I really just want them to get over it.
