The fatter you where the richer you where, not healthier.  Fat was a statues symbol and so was being pale.  Everyone should try and be a healthy size, not an extreme of one or the other.  When a third of adults are obese in America there is a major problem with health.  http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html

Everyone should love themselves and be confident no matter what, but that does not mean everyone should be comfortable with their size.  If you are obese or anorexic you should not be comfortable with your size until you are back in a healthy weight range.  Just like an addict shouldn't be comfortable with their addiction, for if they are they will never overcome it.
