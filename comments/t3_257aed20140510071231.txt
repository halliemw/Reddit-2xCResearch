The only time I ever experienced nausea when on BC was during the adjustment period, for like the first 3 months after I started taking it. Have you changed the time/way(with or without food) you take it? Personally, I'd find it odd to develop the nausea symptoms out of nowhere and talk to my doctor about it, it could be related or completely unrelated to the BC. I'd probably take a pregnancy test because I'm paranoid, too. Definitely ask your doctor about it, though!
