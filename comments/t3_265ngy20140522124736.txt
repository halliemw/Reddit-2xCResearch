I have nothing but sympathy for people whose personal experiences have exceeded their ability to adjust. Every single one of us can end up in that situation given the wrong circumstance.

But the larger discussion here isn't about how to provide mental health services to people that need them (that's a whole other discussion that we SHOULD be having), this is about how to effectively run an institution of higher learning so that it best serves the overwhelming majority of students, faculty, and the demands of our society.

First off, it's interesting that someone thought this article was more appropriate to post to /r/TwoXChromosomes instead of say /r/psychology, /r/academia or any other subreddit related to the material.

Anyways... What people [identify](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2000-07436-018) with is truly remarkable, even when they have [overwhelmingly](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21359617) convincing [evidence](http://psi.sagepub.com/content/13/3/106.full) that their beliefs and behaviors are actually what's causing them more harm.

Certainly, it doesn't seem like "such a big deal" for a professor to list some things in the beginning of their syllabus that "any rational person" may recognize as "complex" subject matter that for some humans may be "emotionally difficult."

And... everything about that is exactly the problem. So, by making this kind of concession, you're actually opening up your professors, students, and your institution as a whole to possible legal liability.

Next, we have the "any rational person" argument. Someone with "triggers" is already not a "rational person." A [rational](https://www.google.com/search?q=rational&rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS569US569&oq=rational&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l3j69i60l2.774j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8_) person is one that isn't experiencing any "behavior-inducing emotions." Giving any official recognition to "Triggerites" (I'm not trying to be funny or insensitive, I literally have no idea if there's already a name that they prefer to use or not) then immediately exposes anyone else involved to a hazardous legal situation because everything then become defined by someone or someone's that are self-admittedly experiencing a completely subjective and irrational state.

Thirdly, since using the PTSD framework is the only way that any medical field has attempted to understand anything near this topic, that means that Triggerites (not to be confused with the relatively small percentage of PTSD sufferers that the above article identifies) are largely "self-diagnosed."

Ironically, you could legitimately have a situation where someone's "trigger" is other people having "triggers."

Education is difficult. Learning is difficult. Educators cannot teach and the majority of students cannot effectively learn in an environment that requires self-censorship extremes.

How long before the first Triggerite claims that because a university's "Violence in Africa" history class deals with trigger-inducing subjects for them, that the university is itself unlawfully discriminating against them simply by offering the class? You may think this is a [fallacious extreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum), but there is good precedence in U.S. law which shows that once "legal momentum" is generated, it continues until stopped by another "legal force."

How do you think someone would feel if they had to get up in the middle of class and walk out because it was "rape discussion time" or "[talking about dads](http://i.imgur.com/2fTeo07.jpg)" time? There is literally no way to make a positive education environment for people that make these demands (or require this level of emotional attention, whichever way you prefer to conceptualize it).

And, contrary to what many people in this comment section are advocating, education is not therapy. Education is a way to prepare people for living in the "real world" which is the same place that so criminally underprepared Triggerites to deal with the trauma that it (the real world again) dealt them.

The natural extent to which this system of trigger warnings escalates towards is:

**Education: Warning, actual information about objective reality may be discussed and/or encountered. If you have any emotional triggers, do not attend.**

There is no way that the above statement would not be interpreted by a Triggerite as being anything other than inherently discriminatory.

If someone's personal goal is to give infinite attention to each individual they meet in life, that's fine. I'd say possibly even admirable. But it isn't a mandate we can force everyone to follow.

However, when you're a profit-driven institution that's attempting to meet the demands of thousands of students using an assembly line-esque factory model, that level of attention is not possible.

Someone further down in the comments already stated, "especially if your peers are invited to share their opinions on the subject. no rape victim wants to hear a bunch of uninformed college students talk about how false rape accusations are just as bad as actual rape, blah blah blah. it's uncomfortable and upsetting and really destructive to a learning environment."

Nothing could be further from the truth. That person with that opinion actually exists. Learning how to constructively communicate with people of differing opinions is absolutely one of the most important aspects of a college education.

And, would that student be legally liable for "triggering" another student? Could that student suffer academic consequences for sharing their "honest opinion?" If this was the case, I sure know I'd prefer to pay for a class that advertised, "No Triggerites Allowed," because it meant that I wouldn't be legally liable for mentioning something about cats when I was unaware that someone else in the class had a bad experience with a [cat](http://i.imgur.com/aZpSKZ0.jpg) once.

Sure, being in kindergarten that's paid for with public tax dollars in a country where the [average citizen is essentially below the average human ability level](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-adults-score-below-average-on-worldwide-competency-test-2013-10) and has all kinds of irrational beliefs that they force their government to try to "educate around" may be necessary, and is also probably one of the major reasons that Americans constantly underperform academically, but this isn't an optimal way to educate.

Lastly, there's also the issue of whether or not we as a society want to allow the acceptance of this behavior to grow. And [grow it does](/r/TumblrInAction). Certainly, allowing people to connect their identity to their trauma is bad for the individual as one of the studies referenced in the original piece found. Even more troubling is how humans seem to be inherently programmed to use memes. This is especially disadvantageous as people adopt "negative memes" and then define their [society](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/lewisconfession.html) and [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture) based on those memes (and yes, one of those links is about how teenage girls "having some sport" because they were "bored" led to women being burned at the stake. That is a real thing. That happened, and no, it shouldn't come with a "trigger warning." Reality is more important than how anyone feels about it).

Education is all about empowering people. Sadly, despite what many others believe, empowerment doesn't come from demanding that others work around your sensibilities and limitations. Empowerment comes by developing the skills necessary to thrive in any environment.
