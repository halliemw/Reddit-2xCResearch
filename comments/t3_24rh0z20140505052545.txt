It's not okay at all. I guarantee you that this girl made comments about your figure only because she's insecure about her own. It seems that you decided to let it go, but remember that it's not something you have to put up with if she makes that kind of remark again. 

The reason many people do it, when they wouldn't comment if you were larger, is that being small isn't stigmatized in the same way being large is -- thinness is considered a marker of high status.  So being an asshole to people because they're thinner doesn't have the element of "punching down" that being cruel to someone because they're fat does. But it's still fundamentally the same kind of behavior -- being shitty to someone because of their body size.
