So if you have had this conversation and he assured you it will happen in X timeline (let's say til 2015) then convince yourself he will propose on New Years eve (aka the last time-point) and forget about it. 

Also, think about the fact that you only have one life and it makes no sense to rush through the checkpoints but to enjoy the ride. Soon you will stop being a girlfriend, and may never get that title ever again. Sure there will be the fianc√©e and wife milestones but once you are there you cannot go back. Enjoy each step, it's a scenic ride not a race to the finish. 

I recommend reading the Hans Christian Andersen story about the little fir tree: http://hca.gilead.org.il/fir_tree.html

Enjoy each step as it comes!
