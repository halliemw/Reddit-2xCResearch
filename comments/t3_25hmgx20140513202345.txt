That's a good point and you're right, he probably wouldn't have seen the evaluation until after my final exam. I was paranoid because we have to login to our online student accounts to fill out the evaluations, so I ultimately chickened out from writing mine.

Definitely planning on looking into the ombudsperson resources on my campus, and if there isn't a good one, my department chair is pretty wonderful (from the very little I've interacted with her) so I may send her a note.
