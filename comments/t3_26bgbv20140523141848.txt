If you have an hour to spare, I highly recommend Esquire's 2009 profile of Dr. Warren Hern (*'The Last Abortion Doctor'*).

The compassion and professionalism of his staff, and the reality that they're surrounded by armed guards and bulletproof glass, is surreal. It's a fascinating window into the erosion of rights for women at their most vulnerable.
