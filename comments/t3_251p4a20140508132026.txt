Well this sub of course has its problems about things but let me ask you this. Would you go up to someone you just met and start telling them everything that's wrong about themselves? That's what a lot of outsiders are doing here. Just lurk for a bit, I am all for making positive changes to the sub but know that there is a time and place for those things. And as I just commented to someone else, the sub/person/whatever has to want to change. And it's bad to make many sweeping changes all at once.

Please just try to be a little more aware that coming up to a "stranger" and telling then everything that's wrong about themselves probably won't go so well. Especially when that stranger would have preferred to remain cut off/ never wanted to hear from you in the first place. We all need some time to adjust to this huge change and criticizing "someone" right off the bat isn't very...diplomatic.

Edit: fixed some words and added some more
