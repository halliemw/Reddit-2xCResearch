Canadian, so not the same.  But I never, not once, felt like one of my profs ignored me.  Most of my profs were white males, but they were very fair.  A few were highly motivational and supportive.  One kept pushing me to do grad school (wasn't in a position to do that) and took time to talk to all of his students if they needed assistance.
