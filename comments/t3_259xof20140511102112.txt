You are saying you don't have enough money for hobbies, which is perfectly understandable. Perhaps you haven't looked into very inexpensive to free alternatives? Many parks have free group tai chi or yoga sessions, book clubs tend to be free as well, same goes for a lot of women's knitting/crocheting gatherings and such. Have a look around! Try and be as proactive as you can, it will pay off :)

I hope things look up for you soon <3
