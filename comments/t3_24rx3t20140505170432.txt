> My one issue with this article, which was pretty well-written, is that FAIRNESS, REPRESENTATION, AND RESPECT IS THE FUCKING "FEMINIST AGENDA" ARRGHRGHRHGHG  

I used to think of myself as a feminist. Matter of fact, I seem to be the exact younger demographic you're making this appeal to.  

Then I met the disgusting assholes from /r/againstmensrights that brigade /r/girlgamers on a daily basis.  

If that's feminism, you can keep it.  

EDIT: Downvote if you want, people, but it's why the tides are spinning the way they are. I'll sooner have a listen to /r/AMRsucks than /r/againstmensrights and they don't necessarily have my best long-term interests in mind. These women factionalize us and then leave us out in the cold with their own hate being only enough to keep them warm at night. I'm disinterested in paying any attention to any group that nitpicks words, shoots first and asks questions later or constantly plays the victim.  

Give me strong female role models. I'm not going to find one in someone who dissects my sentence structure or use of pronouns in order to make me out to be a poor excuse for a feminist.  

EDIT2: Someone from there responded to me here, responded again, and deleted their post, instead taking to their comrades for support.  

Welp, this post was never in the positives, anyway! Just know what sunk it.  

Here they come!
