I can't figure out what she's angry about. She's saying nobody shamed her for nursing in public, nobody told her that her breasts were gross or offensive. She was encouraged by people who told her that her baby's latch was great.

It is not possible to encourage breastfeeding (which is a public health issue, regardless of what this blogger says) and simultaneously make women who choose not to breastfeed despite having a good milk supply feel good about their decisions. The doctors and nurses aren't insensitive jerks; they're going where the science points them. Sometimes as adults we have to say, I'm making a different decision and I'm strong enough to stand by it without getting defensive and ranty.
