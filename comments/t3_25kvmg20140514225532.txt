A few names so far, sure. What reason do you have to believe that people will stop at four names? As we can see based on what happened at Brown, it's far more likely to get out of control than anything. At that point you have more people being victimized by this nonsense than are being helped.

That being said, this is the only mention the article makes about the men listed having been found "responsible" by the school:

>The fliers list the same four men, asserting that three of them remain on campus even though the university found them “responsible” of sexual assault. The fourth is identified as a “serial rapist.”

Read that carefully. The ***fliers*** assert that the university found them "responsible" of sexual assault. Where's the proof that the university actually found them guilty? And how did the people writing the names find out that the accused weree both found responsible and not punished? It's not like the university is going to go announcing the fact that they found someone guilty of sexual assault and didn't punish them for it. So how did they find out? Until I get some concrete evidence that these people were found guilty of anything, you'll have to forgive me if I don't trust the anonymous person(s) pointing fingers at alleged "sex offenders".
