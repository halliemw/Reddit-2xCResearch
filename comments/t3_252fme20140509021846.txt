I'm sorry that your introduction to 2X has been met with this misunderstanding and controversy. Just understand that people here are on edge after becoming a default, and you're just being caught in the crossfire. 

I wish you all the best with your girlfriend, and hopefully your time at 2X is more pleasant.
