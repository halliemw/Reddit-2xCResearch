What cities will you be visiting on your trip? 

Depending on what museums you plan on visiting you can buy tickets online so you can skip the huge lines. Even for some places in Florence you guy buy tickets from the natural history museum without having to buy a ticket for the museum itself. 

Flats will be your friend. Cobblestones all over the place. And band-aids will come in hand. 

Be wary of pick pockets. Also I'm not sure if this is still the case, but it used to be that if you got caught buying designer fakes you can get in trouble with the law.
