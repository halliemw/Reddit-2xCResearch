Believe me when I say that you can get some serious bruises on your pubic bone from the bar on a "girl" bike. The location of the bar makes no difference. That said, the point of the lower bar on those bikes is for wearing skirts. You don't have to flash the world your junk to get over the bar in the middle if you're wearing a knee length or so skirt. I miss my "girl" bike because I use a bike as my main mode of transportation in my city and I now ride a men's mountain bike. When going to certain grad school events while wearing a pencil skirt, getting on and off the men's bike is much harder and less graceful and I'm certain one of these days I'm going to just fall over bike and all while trying to dismount. And it's heavier and I have to carry it up to my second story apartment unless I want to lose my seat for the fourth time in the last year. That said, it's a personal preference thing. I do think if OP is headed to college soon and might want to use her bike for actual transportation everywhere, she might consider how well she could cope with skirts and a men's bike, but which is better depends on preference and what she's using it for.
