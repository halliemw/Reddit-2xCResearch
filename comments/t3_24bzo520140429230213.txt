I'm kind of confused by this comparison. What makes a person knowledgeable over another person? Are we talking about crystallized intelligence, in terms of like knowing a lot of things and stuff or we talking about critical thinking skills?  

True, I don't think that grades are very good indicators of these types of things either, but I'm not sure where you are going with "girls probably do homework" and "boys do this other stuff". There is no objective way to test this.  

I agree with OP that the study is disapproving the cultural context around girls and STEM--there isn't any genetic predisposition that prevents girls from participating in these activities, and the studies show that girls can brawl with the best of them.
