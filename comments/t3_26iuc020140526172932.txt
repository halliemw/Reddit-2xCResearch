I think that mothers who are also working are taking it as a slight to their quality as a parents, while it's one sentence in the context of an actress who has a potentially very demanding job clashing with daily family life, and who has the money and context to afford taking time fully away from work.

Was that inconsiderate of mothers who have to work two jobs to make ends meet? Yes. But I don't think the comment was meant for any other context than women who choose to invest themselves so wholly in their career (as personal goals and preferences VS necessity to keep a roof over their family's heads) they have little time and energy left for their children. She also used "great mum" and not "good mum", as in exceeding expectations VS doing a perfectly good job meeting all of their children's needs.
