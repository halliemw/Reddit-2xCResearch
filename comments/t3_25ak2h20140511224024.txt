Maybe this will contribute more to your thoughts that it's a punishment but HELLO if he didn't want the kid he should have thought of that back when they got pregnant. He doesn't just get to create an entire human being with thoughts and feelings and wants and needs and then 100% ditch her. It's not about punishment it's about responsibility. That kind of mindset is exactly what leaves so many single mothers struggling and the kids are the ones who suffer. Plus just because she lives with a guy who's currently financially stable doesn't mean tragedy won't strike (I'm being purposefully vague here a lot of things could happen), the impact of which could be lessened by having greater financial flexibility both now and later down the line when that actually happens.
