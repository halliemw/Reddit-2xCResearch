I don't understand the campus police's actions (inaction really) in your story. It makes me furious and yet it's all too common. Colleges are notorious for blocking victims who come forward to report rape and sexual assault and making it difficult or even impossible for them to seek justice. In your situation they protected the rapist and blamed the victim and that's fucked up. 

As for receiving vitriol report that shit to the mods and admins. It has no place here. If you've received nasty PMs and would like a safe place to talk about them head on over to /r/creepyPMs. It's not a default so it doesn't get the same amount of clueless assholes that wander in here and the community is the best I've ever seen on Reddit. The mods are great at making it a really safe place. 

Love and support and thank you for sharing your story! It really resonated with me.
