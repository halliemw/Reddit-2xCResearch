I effing hated Big Head with that weird nipple app he was working on in the first episode, and then loved him in the second when he berated himself for it being misogynistic crap.

I think someone's pointed this out already: the woman does not identify herself as a programmer. In her final scene she admits her company role is purely in social media. The entire point of her character was to make fun of the guys happily working for her for free. She didn't seduce them into doing it, she wasn't wearing a low-cut top, she was just a female who asked them to write code for her. I guess Dinesh no longer finding her attractive when he accepts that she's not a programmer is kind of a good message? If we're going to get analytical about it.

The majority of the women in the show so far have been props for the 'computer guys are so awkward/clueless around women' stereotype. Like awkwardly avoiding the stripper, or how every party they go to they say something along the lines of "dude, there's like 12 women here", and then all look terrified/delighted. Monica has been boss, and I hope they never develop a romantic entanglement between her and Richard, because I can kind of see that coming and it would be so blah.

I can't see 'Silicon Valley' ever being a show with a strong feminist message. But it's also not entirely sexist crap. Sure there's only one regular female character so far, but she has so far been shown as the most competent and together character out of all of them, and her looks have not been a factor. So I don't feel bad about the show just yet.

Plus in my view 'Workaholics' lead to 'Broad City' being picked up, so who knows, maybe there'll be a successor series with an all-female start-up. Though yeh, of course, a few more decent female characters in 'SV' would be awesome.
