I did find it ironic that the petite bourgie were complaining about their idols during Occupy. Baby steps though. I think more and more people are realizing the real cost of their comfy lifestyle is the suffering of other people.  

I don't think people are honestly okay with that. It just seems like we prefer to overlook it and out of sight out of mind.
