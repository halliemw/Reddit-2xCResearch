I haven't downvoted you, but I can make a guess as to why. By saying
>Any woman who is a good developer and knows her shit will have 0 problems finding a good job at a place that values them for their brains and not their bodies.

You're being dismissive of the experience of women who've experienced sexism in hiring. You're explicitly saying that women aren't experiencing discrimination or ending up in sexist environments, and that simply isn't true. I'm going to need someone to back me up with data/articles in software development, but unconscious bias has been shown to have a strong effect in academic hiring.

/r/TwoXChromosomes is meant to be supportive of women, and by denying our experiences you disrespect us, hence the downvotes.
