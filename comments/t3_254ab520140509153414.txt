I was in a similar situation to you when I decided to get on the pill.  I was really worried about putting hormones in my body, having to take a pill every day forever, possible side effects, etc. 

To be honest, deciding to go for it is one of the best decisions I've ever made. Going on the pill cleared up my skin, mostly eliminated any premenstrual symptoms I had before (reduced bloating, no cramps, no sore breasts...), reduced the volume and length of my periods, and made sex much more desirable/enjoyable for me by reducing my ridiculously overblown anxiety about getting pregnant. I think the fact that my now-husband and I were finally able to have a happy, normal sex life was the most important of the benefits.

I didn't notice much/any weight gain or other negative side effects.  When I went off the pill early this year (my husband and I decided to try for a kiddo), my cycle was a few days late for 1 cycle and has since returned to a normal--and possibly more regular than pre-BC--cycle length. I don't anticipate any problem getting pregnant, especially any problem related to being on BC.  

When hubs and I are done having babies, I fully intend to go back on BC. I have no concerns or regrets.
