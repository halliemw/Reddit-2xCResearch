Age has nothing to do with liking privacy. I was just trying to express a different view point. I am completely comfortable with bodily functions, I just don't like it being obvious unless it has to be. I'm not ashamed, just private. 

This feels like we have different opinions, and since mine isn't the same as yours, you think I am young and wrong.
