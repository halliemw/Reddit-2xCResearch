I would maybe try calling again and talking to someone else. I'm not her, so I can't be sure, but it sounds like she is saying she has to report it as an assault.

If you call back and that person also says they have to report it, get more detail about what exactly they are reporting, to whom, and why. Remain calm and polite, but firm. Alternatively, call back and just lie if they ask you the same question - if both you and your boyfriend feel your sex was consensual, it's not really anyone else's business.
