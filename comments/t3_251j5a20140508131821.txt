You're a good friend, and are looking out for your friend.

I agree with those who say that it seems low-risk at this point. However... do you have any way of verifying where he lives? How old he is? He might actually *not* be 15 and on another continent, just pretending to be. (I know she's talked to him on Skype, but not everyone looks their age.)

Something seems off to you. You're there, we're not. Keep an eye out. If he suddenly shows up "from Norway," keep your skeptical brain on. Keep in contact with your friend. Let *her* know that you don't judge, you won't judge, and if she ever needs anything, you'll help rather than criticizing. Be there for her is probably the best option.
