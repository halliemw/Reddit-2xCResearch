I am also a girl who struggles to form close friendships with other girls. I really am not sure why this is, but I'm hoping to get better. I know that you understand it's unreasonable to fear an entire gender because of one bad person, and I also know that this fear is there despite that understanding. Not all women are like this. You'll meet people like this of both genders. This girl didn't act this way because of her gender; that tantrum was the result of being spoiled and enabled her entire life.
