When I was younger, I remember thinking lots of body hair was so gross -in fact, I once said I would never date a guy with back hair (shallow much?).  Well i'm now married to a guy with back hair (and hair everywhere else too!).  I don't exactly think back hair is the bee's knees or anything but I love me some chest hair/leg hair and even arm hair.  It is manly.  Not a fan of the whole shaved/waxed chest thing guys are doing these days.
