yeah definitely, i agree. he served his sentence and he deserves to walk free.

i'm just saying that as far as repeat offenses go, statistically he's very likely to do it again. i personally would have liked a stronger sentence (he probably would have gotten one if he hadn't been offered a plea deal --w which is one way in which this justice system is massively flawed), but your alternatives work too.
