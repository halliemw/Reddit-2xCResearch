I have a huge ass/hips and have the same problem. Even the kinds that say they don't ride up are amateur hour for my butt. I actually just decided to wear men's boxer briefs and bought a pack the other day. I think they look quite cute on me, personally. Obviously not always an option with tight clothes, but for everyday wear, they seem great.
