> a sample size of 177 is pathetic for a study

Because...? Trying to state that sample size is a single objective measure regardless of population and regardless of methodology otherwise.. well, that isn't really valid. If you want to make methodological criticisms, make them properly, don't latch desperately onto something you think invalidates the findings.

> I was saying that given a single pornstar has met hundreds alone

Which is _purely_ anecdotal and does not really say anything at all.

>I'd be interested to see what level of success the women who were interviewed were at.

So you did not actually go to the study linked, you are just ranting on reflex...? How... quaint.

>The results could have been skewed also because if the women interviewed were on the higher scale of pay they'll automatically be happier and can dictate terms more. They aren't the women being choked, spat on and forced to make themselves vomit into a dog bowl that gets tipped over their head while they get repeatedly asked if their father would be proud of them.

You claim that the latter are the majority? Could I see a [citation] on that?

To me, it seems like you are heavily emotionally invested in this issue, therefore I think I'll refrain from further "debate". Have a nice day!
