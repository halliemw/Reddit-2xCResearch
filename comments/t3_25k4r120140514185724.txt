You're right, it doesn't sound serious. However, it's something someone said to a friend of mine who was pregnant. She didn't feel that she could keep it, and she felt as if she had to have an abortion. She called me an hour before I was going to take her to her appointment, crying, telling me that she couldn't go through with the abortion. 

I asked her what changed her mind, and she said that in a stupid online forum she posted her predicament. Most of the replies were messages of support or advice, but one person posted "I'll take it". She thought they were an asshole, but for a couple days it just kept eating at her. Some random stranger, someone who didn't know her at all, would take her baby and raise it.

That stupid comment somehow pushed her to consider adoption; something she never thought she could go through. She says adoption was the hardest thing she has ever gone through, but that for her - not everyone - that pain was far less than the guilt she would have felt if she had had the abortion. 

As a result, every once in a while I'll be the random asshole who says "I'll take it" just in case that person was in the same boat as my friend.
