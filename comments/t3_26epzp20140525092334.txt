I'm not saying the opposite. But what you're doing is perpetuating sexism in a different way by incessantly pointing fingers. Did you the video? All the women siding with the abusive woman without knowing the story is a direct result of an "us versus them" mentality that you're promoting as we speak. 



You attributed the view on violence only to the fact that women are seen as the weaker sex and associated it to the patriarchy (rightly so IMO). However, that doesn't explain the warped view that many passer bys had that the men was automatically guilty of something and surely deserved the beating he was getting (direct quote). Is that a result of the patriarchy? Or is that a result of vilifying men? Obviously the latter. 



Honestly p, just watch the video and stop being so close minded. I'm hanging out on this forum and trying to learn, and I'm not saying sexism isn't real (and worse) for women. The least you could do is take 6 minutes and realize that not everything is men's fault. Gender equality is a team effort, not a war.
