I like burlesque shows but I am a sex positive humanist. I think of the human body as a work of art and that sexuality should be celebrated. It's not for everyone, I will give you that. If you want to go to a more fun burlesque try some of the themed ones. I've been to a Super Mario burlesque show. That was quite funny and entertaining. It all comes down to personal taste.
