At the start of the year (February I think?) two police officers repeatedly raped a female in their patrol car, while on duty where I live. They had handcuffed her to the seat. They had two weeks pay before being suspended and since then once has quit. Their case was adjourned this month until August. I know this isn't completely relevant, but after reading the responses here it me think how on earth would I approach the police to report their co workers.
