Thanks for your thoughtful reply! I think 5 years might be too long a gap to go, I feel like if my next pap comes out normal I'd be more comfortable going 5 years, if that's what my doctor(s) think is okay. 

I have an appointment on Saturday for a consult to get my rx renewed and when I made the appointment, they didn't say anything about needing a pap/exam in order to get the rx. HOPEFULLY that'll be the case and I can get the rx filled, and they will probably remind me that I need the exam, otherwise, my appointment on Saturday will be a waste of time, BUT if it's going to get in the way of me getting the rx, then they should have told me. I don't mind making an appointment for an exam/pap in the next few weeks when I have more time to go in, and I'd honestly call and ask if I could add the exam/pap to this upcoming appointment, BUT I'm on my period right now so...but I NEED to go in ASAP because I'm all out of refills and have no new pack to start when I'm done with this cycle, hopefully they will understand this. I don't have a risk of cancer in my family, I have had only one partner since I have been sexually active and am otherwise healthy and the last pap I had did come out normal so hopefully given those facts in mind, they will allow me to get my rx without the pap as long as I go in for one soon. 

About the HPV vaccine, I had asked about it a few years ago and they basically made it sound like it wasn't necessary but I still kind of want to get it. When I go in for my appointment, I'll ask about it-they say it's for women 26 and under so I should still be eligible to get it. If I end up staying with my current partner then I don't see a need for it, (we've been together 7 years and he has been the only person I have been sexually active with) but I'm afraid if I ever do wind up not with him and with someone else, then I have to worry about all the people he's slept with, etc. so I think I would feel better getting the HPV vaccine.
