Thanks for taking the time to read it. My point is that men should want to go to these workshops because the responsibility for sexual assault falls on men, not women. I feel like lad culture for making assault more acceptable, or more of a grey area. (I probably should have made it less vague but I only had 800 words) 

The feminazi things was to try and link the people who criticise feminists with the bystanders in nazi germany who just went along without challenging the social order. I hope that made sense. I do worry that I use too many big words sometimes when I don't need them to make my point.
