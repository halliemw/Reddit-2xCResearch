Good luck. The Anti-choice movement runs right over those sort of generalizations straight to abortion. We're currently losing the right to abortion, especially in the South, because peoplewho believe in abortion are not vocal enough about it specifically. Voting/Supporting Doctors/Protesting. 
Anti-choicers are. And get bills at the state level specifically intended to wipe abortion out. And they are winning.
