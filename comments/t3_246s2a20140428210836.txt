100%? It definitely served to solidify the characterization of the mutineers as monsters. It's one thing to know that they killed Mormont (and subsequently drank from his skull), another thing to know that the leader *and* the henchmen are treating the women in a way comparable to Craster himself. I'm not arguing that it was a necessary addition, but it wasn't "100% unnecessary."
