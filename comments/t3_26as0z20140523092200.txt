I recently had a similar type conversation with my SO and his response surprised me. He genuinely didn't want to fuck up. He could very easily write down what's depleted from the pantry/fridge/etc and fill it, but he's concerned with doing it 'wrong'. I guess I'm to blame for that train of thought because there's certain things that I much prefer one brand over another and other things where the brand just doesn't matter.

Have you ever asked him why he doesn't take the initiative?
