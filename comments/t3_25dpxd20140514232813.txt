Kudos to you ladies who went through it without a numbing agent!! I have my Skyla and I love it!! My gyno inserted it during my period, gave me a couple aspirin before, and then injected a numbing agent into my cervix before she put it in. Even with the numbing agent it was slightly uncomfortable! After a month of cramps on and off I'm in love with the Skyle IUD and will continue to trade those couple of minutes of discomfort for it!
