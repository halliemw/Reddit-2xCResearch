My mom did this to her best friend (a lot) because of her total dedication to honesty (and, behind the scenes, expressed the view that perhaps her taste was better than her friend's).  Over the years, the friend's daughters and I noticed that while both women said they were being honest, only my mom was making the cutting remarks (she did the same thing to me - honesty, you know, is the highest virtue!)

My dad and I talked to my mom a little about tact (which made her mad).  As the years went by, I realized my mom's tastes were, themselves, subject to several criticisms - but no one made them.  They were tactful.

So I think my mom died thinking that her honesty was still the best policy (she would sometimes reluctantly say that she was keeping her opinions to herself, which of course meant she had something else negative to say) AND that her taste was a bit better than other people's.  It is true that my mom, as a young woman, put more energy into hair and makeup than her friend, and that her friend was breaking some rules written down in women's magazines.

My mom was truly not jealous of her friend, and she wasn't trying to be helpful, either.  She really thought it was very, very important (in friendship) to express one's true opinion.  In my mom's case, it was usually a snap judgment, never changed, and it was years before I realized that many beautifully dressed people fell outside my mom's tolerances.

She was the same way with cooking, food, recipes, etc.  Naturally, as a kid, I thought my mom was a great cook, but years later, I question a lot of her practices.

I'd be interested to know of OP's best friend usually has fairly narrow tastes and/or what the friend thinks a great dress looks like.
