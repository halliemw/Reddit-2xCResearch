I was really hoping they'd be able to take the IUD out...I mean, I'd rather miscarry now than, say, 4 weeks from now.

I'm thinking of possibly going to another doctor for a second opinion, since the one I went to wasn't super helpful. I'm not sure if there's much "help" to be given at this point, but I want to be sure. I've tried Google and there just doesn't seem to be a whole lot of info out there :(
