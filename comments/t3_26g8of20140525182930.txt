> By this reasoning the media exploits every tragedy. And doctors exploit cancer.

...and every lawyer is an ambulance chaser. No, there is a difference between doing a professional job in noble professions that by design respond to tragedy, and doing that same job in a way that exploits the tragedy.

*Journalists* don't exploit every tragedy. They are providing an important service, and it is literally their job to deliver information about every tragedy.

*Pundits/columnists* are a different matter. These a generally well spoken and intelligent people who make a living presenting their particular viewpoint on the world around them.

They're both very respectable professions, and both have a role to play during a tragedy. Journalists provide the factual information about an event, and columnists present unique and (hopefully) thoughtful contexts for framing those facts. The problem is when the two jobs get mixed together and you end up with columnists presenting conclusions before the facts are in and asserting facts that simply don't exist in order to draw attention. So, when you see a headline like that, it's hard not to see it as exploitative.
