Oh yes! My mother did something like this. She had a ring that an old boyfriend had given her before she met my dad. It had beautiful opals  on it (my birthstone) but the setting was a truly hideous filigree butterfly. A few years ago, she brought the ring to  jeweller and had the stones set in something much more my style as a birthday gift.
