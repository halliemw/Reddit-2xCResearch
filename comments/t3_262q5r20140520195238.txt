As a guy (words I normally avoid here) I agree with this. I am very pro-life, and I guess there is something to be said for "having the right to know," but if OP's mind is really made up there's no reason to potentially hurt the guy when he really has no say whatsoever.

However, if you want to keep seeing this guy, you have to tell him 100%.
