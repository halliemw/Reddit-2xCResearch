I recently subscribed to /r/againstmensrights, then just as quickly unsubscribed because I disliked it as much as you do.

That doesn't stop me from calling myself a feminist, though!  I subscribe to the theory that it's better to try to represent the feminist movement in the way I feel is best (equality, fuck yes!!!) rather than distance myself from the movement because I don't agree with a minority of it.  

...and you do have to admit that /r/againstmensrights represents really a very small minority of feminists on reddit.
