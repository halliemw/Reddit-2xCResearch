I would really recommend that you measure yourself using the guide/calculator at /r/abrathatfits first, as there might be a better size for you that could help you with any pain you get (and you might be surprised at the difference a bra can make in how clothing fits!). Without a band size it doesn't mean much in terms of the actual volume of the breasts, but for reference [these are all properly-fitted DD cups](http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search/cup/DD/) on various band sizes (bust measurement 5" larger than underbust). If you look proportionally much bigger than those women then it's very likely there's a better size for you. It's also very common to have different size breasts, and generally the advice is to fit the larger one properly and then use an insert in the cup with the smaller one to balance them out if you prefer.

Of course, if you've measured and are definitely wearing the best size for you, then ignore that part!

Head on over to /r/reduction, plenty of experiences there for you :)
