The difference is, women are 50% of the entire population (and should be 50% of the reddit population, if the site's gender-balance wasn't so massively out of whack).

Remember, /r/atheism used to be a default, and even now substantially less than 50% are going to be interested in DIY, Art, History or Old School Cool.

I don't think the new default choices are intended to *reflect* the makeup of the community - I think they're intended to *influence* it, away from the lame image-macros, bigoted Advice Animals and childish crap that we've been sliding headlong towards for the last few years and back towards attracting intelligent adults and a more even gender-balance on the site.
