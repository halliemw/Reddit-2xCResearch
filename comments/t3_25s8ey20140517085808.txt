As someone who had two ER visits in one weekend last weekend, that scale would've been helpful. The first time they sent me home with Tylenol with codeine and 600 mg ibuprofen - big whoop, I was already self administering 600 mg of advil and it was not working which was half the reason I was in the ER in the first place. It wasn't until I came back a day later and the doctor saw that I was REALLY IN PAIN and they gave me a shot of dilaudid that I experienced even a slight reduction in pain. I told you fools it hurt the first time, sheesh! !
