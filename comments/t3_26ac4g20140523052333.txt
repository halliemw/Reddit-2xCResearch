About the first, I don't know. All the statics I hear only look at annual income but doesn't state anything about hours worked etc.

Secondly, paternity leave is here for males only one week after birth. Every other day you take off is just a day that goes of the list you can use to take days of for other things. Also it's still a situation that the woman is responsible for the child. Some employers are lient(?) and will give you a day off or let you go early, others are just assholes.
