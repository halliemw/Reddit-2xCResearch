I've been feeling similar because I'm about 5'6" and 10.5 stones according to google, and while I'm pretty healthy as far as lifestyle, I'm just not built in a way that will allow me to be truly slender and when you add my love of the occasional dessert or burger and wine and beer and bourbon, oh man, I'm just going to be this size. There will be no thigh gap and there will always be a little extra weight around my arms and thighs and butt and a little tummy.

And you know, I'm completely healthy and I do eat quinoa and the occasional fruit smoothie, but I look like this and always will. Usually I'm ok with being a little more voluptuous and a little stocky, but every once in a while I think, "I'm researching obesity, I should be slimmer and generally healthier. I'm 23, I should be at my physical prime." I have started running so maybe that will help, and I need to get back to lifting again. In the past, I've found that exercising increases my enjoyment of food and drinks and it helps me get my day started and improves my mood, so usually I'm a little more toned than I am now, which I think is part of what's bothering me about my appearance right now.
