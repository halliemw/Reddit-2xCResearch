I'm not sure this is a fair analogy, since 'fanboy' and 'fangirl' are commonly used ways to refer to members of the same group - obsessive fans - but there's no similar racial modifier in common usage to describe obsessive fans of different races.  


You might argue that it's problematic that 'fanboy' and 'fangirl' are both used, rather than a single, gender-neutral terminology; but since we exist in a world where that's already the standard, I'm not sure it's the t-shirt company's job to try to change it.
