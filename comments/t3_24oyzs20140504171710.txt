It exists, it just tends to wane pretty quickly once the women become Americanized from what I can tell. One thing I will never forget is something my mother told me. She was never much of a gossiper or busybody so she rarely spoke of or concerned herself with other people's home lives. But what she said, was that she remembered visiting the home of one of my father's old pharmacy school roommates, an asian couple of Asian ethnicity of some type I don't remember (my parents are now in their mid 60s). She said she remembered the man as having a disgust for her as an "obnoxious American woman who doesn't know how to act" (she knew how to be polite, but she was in the same pharmacy school and made it no concern to submit herself to anyone) and he only ever asked my father questions directly. In his home he would give his wife commands and require her to *stand* next to the table while him and his dinner guests ate. She was also not allowed to speak for herself and he answered all questions directed at her.

My mom was appalled at this horrific behavior by the guy and told me she would never forget how backwards some people can be. So it exists.
