If you used a condom and your boyfriend didn't ejaculate, there's almost no way you could be pregnant. Of course, we can't tell you if you're pregnant or not, so you should take a test if it will make you feel better.

Coincidentally, my period, which just started again today, was 8 days late. It happens. Periods are not regular 100% of the time. I don't even bother worrying anymore.
