As a therapist who worked with eating disorders for several years,  I would not suggest teaching calorie counting to an 11-year-old. Anorexia and related eating disorders often do start with calorie counting--kids that age can get so focused on numbers and "doing better" without realizing that they're not getting proper nutrition. Rather, I think it's best to model portion control and communal eating--eating a healthy portion at a moderate pace as a way to encourage natural hunger and fullness cues. So cooking and eating a meal together--that can be a great lesson in nutrition and health. 

EDIT: in reading more of your comments, I think there is a cultural aspect here that could partially explain our differing perspectives. I should note I am writing from the perspective of someone from the U.S. Girls that age have a very conflicted view of their bodies and of food--after all, we have a ton of food, tons of message about food equalling happiness and then a crazy-thin beauty ideal. It can be very confusing for children, but based on research in the United States, parents attitudes towards their own bodies and parents' modeling of healthy eating are two of the strongest predictors of health and body satisfaction in kids when they get older.
