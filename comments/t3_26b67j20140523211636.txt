Nowadays, I don't think we're as much hung up on the whole wearing a wedding band 24/7. It took me a long time to not feel uncomfortable with rings on my fingers, even now I don't wear them often.

As an unmarried female, yes, multiple times I have used the excuse of being with someone to deflect unwarranted interest. I suppose it's most likely due to the fact that I'd rather not make the situation more complex (and warrant more conversation) by admitting that I'm a very straight looking girl exclusively interested in women.

It fucking sucks sometimes when men can be overtly aggressive seeking your attention out.
