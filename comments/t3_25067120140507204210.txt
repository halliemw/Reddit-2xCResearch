Someone who lost her virginity at 13 here.  I have to say, you hit the nail on the head with

>I don't think she has much foresight and I don't know how well she understands the consequences of her actions.

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. Having that as my first sexual experiences (it lasted for almost two years) was absolutely horrible for my sexual and mental well-being. At age 20, I am still struggling to get over the bad habits this relationship instilled in me (such as feeling guilty for not "putting out" often enough).

I also managed to get pregnant and have a miscarriage at 14, despite being on birth control. That experience led to me feeling unable and unwilling to get an abortion now, at 20, and I am currently 8 months pregnant as a result.

>I'm totally at a loss for what else to say to her from a sex-positive point of view (or am I not being sex-positive by thinking she's too young to have sex?)

Even though I was in exactly her position, I have no idea what to say to her, either. It's not sex-negative to think 13 is too young for a girl who grew up in Western society to be having sex, though.
