I think it would be the first one for me. It’s a bit complicated to explain. But then I can tell myself how I think I look and in time it would give me some confidence. The second one means more or less that I want that other people don’t care about it. And that’s of course a very good thing, I think it would be awesome because it really doesn’t matter  how you look. But for me, it just feels so much harder because it feels for me like I’m trying to change the entire world and not just me.   
But now that I’ve written this, I realized that I actually believe both. The first one seems easier to start with for me, but they're both very nice thoughts.
