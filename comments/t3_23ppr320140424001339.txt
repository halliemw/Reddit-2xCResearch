Well, it's super stiff which makes it much harder to budge. It's designed for people with strong pelvic floor muscles. I play a full contact sport (roller derby) and I had heard from other athletic cup users that a big hit could knock it loose or cause leakage. So every time I hear people saying "I want a softer cup" I am somewhat mystified. How stiff do you go? Give me the most solid one you've got!
