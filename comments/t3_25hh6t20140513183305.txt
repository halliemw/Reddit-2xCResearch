I get downvoted if I mention the fact that i have chosen to wait until marriage until having sex, and if that means I want to get married "younger" (looking at 23), so be it. I have to back up and defend my personal choices against accusations of not taking it seriously etc. Everyone else is free to have sex whenever they want, and marry whenever they want; this is my choice and it's not made hastily -_-
