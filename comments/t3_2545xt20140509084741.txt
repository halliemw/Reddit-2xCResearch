My girlfriend commonly has 12-14 day periods, and anything shorter than about 10 is very unusual for her.  What we ended up learning about her situation was that in her case the bleeding is caused by Uterine fibroids, which are apparently extremely common in most women.  They're not a problem usually, but they do grow over time and depending on where they're situated they can impinge on the interior of the uterus causing problems.  In my girlfriend's case the first 7-8 days the bleeding is regular period blood, and then the latter 5-6 days the blood is thinner and just the fibroids bleeding.  She's scheduled for surgery in a few months to hopefully take care of the fibroids.

If this sounds at all like you it might be worthwhile asking for an ultrasound or at least mention the possibility to the doctor.  Like I said, they're very common, it's just that for most women they're never an issue.
