I think it really depends on her relationship with the girls. I would NOT be okay with strangers or acquaintances doing that if I were passed out, but I would think it was hilarious or not a big deal if it were my closer friends. Either way, if someone stepped in and said something I wouldn't be mad. Your intentions were good. I would definitely let you know if what they did was okay with me or not, but I wouldn't be upset. I don't think you should feel bad for saying something.
