I don't think that is to be taken quite as literally as you're taking it. More as a general feeling or spirit on how many "nerds" may feel the world treats them. As far as there being more rage and entitlement in the younger generation now, since when have teens/young adults not been full of angst and a sense of entitlement. As far as i'm concerned it's nothing new, just more available to spectacle with the internet.
