I was one of the ones who jumped on the bandwagon and downvoted you. 

When this was posted, a couple of days ago, the sub had just been made a default and a lot of the folks here, myself included, got uber defensive. I downvoted & reported the trolls, but your comment stuck with me because you shouldn't have been downvoted. Your take on the situation was different but not unreasonable and not sexist. I apologize.
