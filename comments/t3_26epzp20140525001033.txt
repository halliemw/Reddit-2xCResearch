My mom is the breadwinner in my family and my dad has always did housework better. I was kind of confused by other families growing up. I don't even hear the word feminist until I moved to California, but when I did it didn't carry the same kind of baggage it did elsewhere. To most of my Californian peers feminist mean and activist promoting equality. It was assumed that any decent person shared the same views by default, even if they weren't picketers or lobbyists.

I was really confused when I got into college and learned there were very loaded preconceptions on the idea of feminism. I lived in a pretty liberal area by that point thought. For the longest time I wouldn't even associate with someone who was anti-feminist because my peers and I thought, growing up, that meant there was something seriously wrong with that person. Like Nazi-quality or something. I mean, we'd talk to baby boomers and minority parents, but it was understood that they were mistaken, and just didn't know any better and we'd have to correct the system when we got older.

You'd occasionally get a guy who would be a bit sexist but they were shut down pretty quickly. Usually by other guys.
