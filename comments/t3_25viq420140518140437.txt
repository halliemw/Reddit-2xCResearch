I suppose I was arguing the point of the animation student that even in her amateur classes she is penalized for using the "same face syndrome" and these Disney characters all look extraordinarily similar and only variant in their "surface textures", which is described in the article. I personally don't see any difference between the three characters in frozen other than hair color, freckles, and height. Looking very similar to your family members isn't uncommon or bad. It's just strange when Disney comes out with movies that depict almost identical characters when basic animation guidelines encourage variance.
