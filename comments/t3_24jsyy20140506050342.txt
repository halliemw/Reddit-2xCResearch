This comment rocks. It's as the judge said, this is not your traditional rape case. Things aren't always black and white. People are reading the word 'rape' and instantly losing all ability to listen to reason. BE REASONABLE people, don't just let your bias rule over you and cause you to become primitive beasts. We have the cognitive ability to take every case differently and to understand that every case is different from the next. Use that ability.
