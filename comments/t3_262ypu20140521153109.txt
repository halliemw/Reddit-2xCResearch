I have one friend who just gets super drunk (to get past the whole stranger-sex thing) and has a one night stand. She never feels bad about it, I'd say it happens once or twice a year. I have another friend that makes these really intense connections with dudes....that only last a week or two and then she's over it. With me, it's just not my programming. I don't really like new people, and I don't like being touched by strangers, which kinda rules out one night stands, and FWB's always end up feeling awkward. It's not about feeling like a bad person, I just don't get much pleasure from casual sex, I've never had an orgasm that way. If you can get off from casual encounters then go on with your bad self and there is no shame in it.
