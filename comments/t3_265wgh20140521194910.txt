If this is a university and you will not see this one-time tutor again, then I would advise doing nothing. 

If there is no legal issue (I'm uncertain), once again, I would advise doing nothing.

You could mention it to the guys how you felt. Of course, you'll face any consequences of that. Bad *or* good.

You could mention to a higher authority, such as a dean. Personally, I don't believe it would be worth it.
