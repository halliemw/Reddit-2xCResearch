I'm on the non-horomonal IUD and have been for almost 2 years. I barely think about it and periods come every month within 2 days of the 28-day schedule. (I still track my periods). As a rule, I still make my partner use a condom because as much as I love my little munchkin, I have no desire to be raising a second child with a second father. (Single mom).

Unless you want a child and am prepared to raise it yourself, make your man wear a condom and if it ever breaks, seek planB.
