For many women it's not a matter of weight, it's a matter of body type.

It doesn't matter how thin I get, my thighs will still touch.  It may work for some people, like yourself, but it's not a solution for many of us.  I get that you're not trying to be insulting, but please realize there are lots of different body types, and weight doesn't always play into this.  =)
