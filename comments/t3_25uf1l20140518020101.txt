Your hormones and symptoms may change a bit as you get older. Stress, diet, sleep routine, exercise routine, and basically everything can also affect how you feel and what PMS symptoms you have. If your PMS symptoms become unbearable, talk to your doctor about your treatment options. Birth control is typically option number one, but there are other possibilities as well.
