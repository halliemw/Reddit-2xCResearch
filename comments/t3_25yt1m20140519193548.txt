It's normal to not have to the intimacy of friendship with your mom. I love my mom to pieces, but I will never try to talk to her like one of my girlfriends.

Is it disappointing? Very. Unfortunately, my mom has had a very hard time seeing or respecting me as an adult and almost sees it as an affront when I make choices she doesn't agree with. I also don't trust her a whole lot. 

Honestly, I've been okay. For every topic I can't discuss with my mom, I have at least 2-3 friends I can discuss with. I can still have fun with her if we keep the conversation light.
