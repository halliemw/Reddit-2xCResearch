Be mean.  It sounds like you think straight up rejection is mean, but it's not.  Trying to be subtle is worse because it makes them think they have a chance, and trust me guys are not always smart enough to get that you're just trying to be nice.  I say, "sorry I'm not interested" in a confident tone (your tone is important), and make it clear by using body language that I am not interested (turn your back to them, use an arm to cut them off if you're at the bar, like a barrier).  Be blunt, be straightforward and be confident, because at the end of the day if they walk off thinking you're a total b who cares? You're not interested in them anyway.  It took me ages to realize (esp in bars) that you don't have to be nice to people just because they're nice to you. Be polite, but that's as far as you need to go.

That said, the scenario you're describing is straight up sexual harassment and if anything like that happens again tell the person (confidently) that they are being inappropriate and to stop immediately. Don't say please, don't humor them, just make it clear you will not tolerate their behavior. If they persist report it to your boss right away.  Just because you work retail doesn't mean you don't have rights, it's in your right to have a safe working environment, free from sexual harassment.
