Really good point about not being taken seriously. Lots of posts in r/short are men upset that they are overlooked and not taken seriously. Over here in 2X, lots of women saying the same. I'm 5'7" and feel that way. Just made me feel very sad that you are having to deal with that from multiple angles.
