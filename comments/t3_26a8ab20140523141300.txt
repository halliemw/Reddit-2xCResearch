I'm not so much concerned about what people claim on reddit.  If TwoX wants to give them support and they need support, that's fine.

But I'm also not looking at the other extreme where "rape allegations don't really matter to the accused" because false claims of drunken rape "would never hold up in court".

I'm more concerned about the "real world" where a girl gets herself drunk, has enthusiastic, consensual sex with a guy, and then chooses to say it was rape amongst her (and his) friends, because she doesn't want to accept responsibility for the choice she made.  And I'm further concerned about the "sorority girl" effect of one girl understanding that she had enthusiastic, consensual (but drunken) sex, and she's got 5 friends sitting around her dorm room convincing her that she was raped.
