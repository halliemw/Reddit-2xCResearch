Your experience totally counts, and I hope I didn't imply otherwise! The risk of infection is definitely a big part of the reason why I didn't want to get mine pierced, and that story of one ripping through sounds like a nightmare! But it sounds like your earlobes have character, and I think that's cool, too. (:
