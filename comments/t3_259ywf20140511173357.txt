Well I would go with the suggestions of others and check to make sure that your invitation has not been lost in the mail.  If this isn't the case and you are just no longer invited to the wedding, then I would have to agree with you that the actions of this woman are very rude.  A similar situation happened to a friend of mine.  I attended the wedding of a coupe friends from college along with two close friends of mine.  We were all expecting to see an old friend of ours there, as she had received a save the date and the group of us had spoken at a party that the couple had thrown, about how excited we all were for the wedding.  When we got to the wedding, this friend was not in attendance.  Upon seeing her some time later she informed us that she had never received an invitation and had attempted to contact the couple but had been ignored.  It was such a rude act that it really affected my friendship with the couple and we're no longer as close.  I would say something.  Especially seeing as you purchased a gift for this couple's bridal shower.  You deserve an explanation, but let's hope it's a simple matter of "lost in the mail."
