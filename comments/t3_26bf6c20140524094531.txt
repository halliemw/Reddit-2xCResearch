I haven't faced street harrasment like you have. 

I've faced some minor sexism, esp related to math.

I've experience some benevolent sexism, which since I've learned about its negative effects, I should dislike more than I do.

I have been sexually assaulted when I was too drunk to consent by a guy who walked me home from a party.  I thought the two girls would be chaperone enough.  But it wasn't rape, so that's good.
