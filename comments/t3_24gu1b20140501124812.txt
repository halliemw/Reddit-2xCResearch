Haha well the menstrual struggle will last as long as another 3-4 decades, sorry to break the news.

I found over the first year or two of having my period it did get much more regular. On the other hand, I think it got heavier and more PMS-y as I got older (now 24, got it when I was 12). Its hard to say for sure, because for 6 of those years I was on the pill, and now I have an IUD.

You could try grinding up a tablet and mixing with applesauce or yoghurt. Some women find exercise helps alleviate cramps. (regardless, exercise is good for you!). Other women try to avoid caffeine or high salt food or other dietary things. 

Or come hang out at /r/TrollXChromosomes where we've founded a sisterhood around complaining about (or maniacally taking pleasure in) our periods.
