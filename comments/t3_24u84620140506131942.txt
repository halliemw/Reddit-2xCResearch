Some characters really deserve their own film. Usually either because they're very interesting, compelling, or funny characters with a lot of personality, or because they've got a bunch of great storylines that translate well to film, or both. 

I know that non-comic fans think that Wonder Woman is one of the three most popular superheroes in DC comics like the comic says, but she really isn't. Wonder Woman is a popular BRAND. She's on underwear and pajamas. She had a goofy TV show in the 70's. She's in cartoons sometimes. But in comics Wonder Woman really isn't all that popular, and it's not entirely because she's a woman. It's because she doesn't have any classic storylines, she doesn't have any great villains, she doesn't have a very interesting mythology, and she has kind of a cardboard personality. She gets a (probably more prominent) cameo alongside Cyborg and Aquaman because she's about as popular and relevant to comics storylines as those characters. 

There are plenty of second or even third stringer *female* characters that are FAR more deserving of a film than Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman just gets shoved to the front of the line by non-comic fans because she's was on their bedsheets when they were kids.
