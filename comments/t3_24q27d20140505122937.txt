That's a wonderful idea! We talked last night and one of the compromises we made was that he meets my guy friends before I hang out with them one on one so that he can form his own opinion of them and feel comfortable around them. Hopefully it works for us as good as it does for you. Thanks for the advice, I already feel like a HUGE weight has been lifted, I'm very hopeful for mine and G's future now!
