You shouldn't feel like an asshole first of all. Sounds like you've given this a lot of rational thought. Sometimes people just aren't well matched. If you're feeling this strongly about it, you're going to be doing right by him and yourself by cutting it off cleanly. Knowing what you want and taking steps towards making it happen makes you smart, not a jerk! 

Good luck :)
