I'm really starting to feel like I missclicked and commented on a wrong thread. That would certainly explain the downvotes. 

I thought we were talking about a father hitting his daughter in heated argument. While certainly not a dad of the year, OP - to no surprise - clearly cares about their relationship.
>I'm telling them they wont see me again unless my dad a.) apologizes to me, and b.) goes to some sort of anger management class.

With this in mind, please read again my original post and feel free to point out any ill-advised actions.
