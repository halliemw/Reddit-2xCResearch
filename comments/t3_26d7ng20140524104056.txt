This may not be the advice you're looking for, but it's the first thing that jumped out at me. Device use (doesn't matter if it's a phone, a tablet, or a handheld game) before sleep can be a killer, especially if you end up invested in what you're reading/doing. I know I've blown my share of nights browsing reddit and checking emails. Once there's a debate or a topic I get interested in, it's all over for a good night's sleep. 

Rather than trying to blame your body or your boyfriend for it, try doing things that help you get to sleep instead.
