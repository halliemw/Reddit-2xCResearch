What I've found in my own personal experience is that PMS just kind of exaggerates issues that are important to you. So it might be that you need to look at what is making you sad, and then you need to communicate that appropriately. Being emotional during PMS is actually a good tool to check out where you're at in life as it's a great magnifier about things that are important to you, even if you don't realize it. And then you can fix that stuff.
