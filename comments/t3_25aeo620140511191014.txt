What I hate about this (besides, of course, the fact that these creeps did this) is the fact that you seem to feel like you're wrong somehow because you're afraid. What they did was wrong and creepy, so you don't have to justify feeling anxious about it. Anyone who tells you otherwise... Well I probably shouldn't get into exactly how I feel about anyone who tells you that you're wrong for being upset about harassment. Let's just leave it at: I'm sorry this happened.
