I did try to jot down a few questions that I could still remember once I got home, and I've been able to do this with each interview hoping that it will help me with the next. Problem is, they all seem to ask different questions! LOL **sigh** I'll be thoroughly prepared one of these days! Thanks for your suggestion! :)
