The problem with /r/seduction is not the posts, nor is it the community itself (from what I've gathered it's actually helpful). It's the name.  
  
I mean, [look at the most prominent definitions of 'seduce'](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/seduce). It has a negative connotation and that in itself detracts many people from taking it seriously. I personally don't give a shit if it ever gets changed, but just keep it in mind.
