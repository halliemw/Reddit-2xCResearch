The next time you guys are kissing if things start to get a little heated and intense, pull away for a second and just say "hey I'm a virgin, would you mind if we worked our way up to sex slowly?". This way it gives you a chance to explore being sexual without having to go all the way. You'll learn about your body and his so that when you decide you are ready for sex you'll be more relaxed about. 
Chances are he'll be cool with this, and if he's not then ditch him.
