I kind of get a kick out of the fact that a whole bunch of people that have harassed me or my husband (or both) in WoW are people that are fatter than us, uglier than us, sleep around more than us, barely adults, or have some shit job in the middle of nowhere that quite literally pays so terribly that either one of us makes more money in one year than they would in a whole decade...while they're trying to go to school for what we do for a living or something nearly as ironic. And you know the insults...fat, ugly, whore, slut, loser, idiot...

I know this because I joined forums or a facebook group for guilds, they were usually guildies, and I eventually decided to put a face to the words (I'd call it stalking, but looking through the list of forum/fb group members isn't really stalking).

I really just want to be all like "come on, WTF" to them. You want to be a developer, I'll be happy to help you learn and make you connections for jobs in the future. Or your organic chemistry course, or your advanced math, or how to play your priest and make sense of theorycrafting. Calling me a nerd and burning bridges is unbelievable, and only makes me wonder if you did it out of pure jealousy.
