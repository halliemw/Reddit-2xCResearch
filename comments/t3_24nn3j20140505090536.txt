Found it in a footnote:
>6 **Nearly all faculty responses to students in our study conveyed a willingness to offer assistance or guidance, but due to scheduling constraints, many encouraging faculty responses did not include an immediate offer to meet with the student on the requested date.** In previously reported analyses of these data (Milkman, Akinola and Chugh, 2012), it was determined that all bias against women and minorities in this experiment occurs at the email response stage. Specifically, faculty respond to (and therefore also agree to meet with) women and minorities at a significantly lower rate than Caucasian males. However, once a faculty member responds to a student, no additional discrimination is observed on the decision of whether to respond affirmatively or negatively. In other words, all discrimination observed on the decision of whether to meet with a student results from e-mail non-responses, which is thus the outcome variable on which we focus our attention here.

Looking at the paper cited in the footnote, you find that there is no difference in response rates or acceptance rates to students asking for a meeting that day, [but suddenly a huge (and incredibly significant) disparity when the students are asking for a meeting a week in advance.](http://imgur.com/k0fw4Bd)

The 2012 paper in the footnote is rather fascinating. I'm glad I took the time to criticize the larger model-based paper referenced in the policymic article.
