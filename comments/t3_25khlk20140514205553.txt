I'm actually going to pay attention if we as guys do it too now. Also, I have to say, I've seen it the other way around as well. If I'm in a group of two or more women talking with each other, it doesn't matter what the subject is, but the same thing happens. I can talk perfectly fine to other guys, or one on one with women or men, but groups of women? I get pushed to the sidelines.
