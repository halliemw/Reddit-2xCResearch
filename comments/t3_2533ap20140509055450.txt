I go through this cycle of growing my hair out and chopping it off (donating it)--I'd say I've done it 5 or 6 times in the last 10 years.  Every time the hair dressers keep checking that I'm ok, that I don't want to change my mind. One time they brought over tissues, "just in case." I just laugh politely, mentally roll my eyes.  Change can be hard, I guess.
