I also have anxiety in many social situations.  Though it seems natural when other people do it, it is terrifying to rebuff someone or give them an answer they dont want or expect. Confidence doesn't cause this to be easier, but is instead caused by knowing you can do this.

 My anxiety at least stems from feeling out of control in social situations, and I have almost become like a toddler that has started to say "no!" to almost everything, ignoring my fear of consequences that actually dont materialize. I assume that I'll mellow out once I get used to having this new power, but it has been awesome. No advice on making getting over the fear easier that first time or two - you just have to jump.
