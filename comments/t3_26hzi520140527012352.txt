Don't allow ANYONE to talk you out of the right to protect yourself. I was born and raised in South Africa, which is known for its crime. Even male friends of mine own tasers which are made to look liked cell phones. Do research on size, how long a battery lasts and how much of a kick it gives when you use it. If I were nervous, I would add a small canister of pepper spray which can be added to you key chain. Be alert, notice your surroundings and change up your routine frequently. Thieves, rapists, etc thrive on watching for patterns. I'm not sure where you're headed, but keep safe and good luck.
