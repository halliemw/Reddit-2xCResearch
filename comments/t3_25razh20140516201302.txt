I believe it exists, mostly because I watched it happen for the better part of 2 or 3 years. Persons 1 and 2 were in a relationship, and person 3 was very interested in person 2. Person 3 never stopped pursuing person 2--didn't even bother trying, despite being told that it was utterly disrespectful to the relationship that already existed between persons 1 and 2, because person 2 just couldn't tell person 3 to back off. Person 2 also admitted to having more than strictly platonic feelings for person 3, and it was really, really obvious to our entire friend circle, and especially to me when I lived with all three of them (and my own SO) for a year that all was not well. Persons 1 and 2 have since broken up, and there seems to be something between 2 and 3... which is fine now, but given that 3 pursued 2 and 2 at least allowed it while in a relationship with 1 make me look less kindly on it, for sure.

It was clear that 2 very much valued 1 as a significant other... but it also seemed that 2 valued 3... at least somewhat equally. And it's not as though 3 was/is a bad person; 3 just wouldn't let go of 2.

I think you need to clear the air with your fianc√©. What happens if you go out to have fun (not necessarily a romantic dinner or anything) with just the two of you? Assuming he says she should come, what happens if you say that you want it to be just the two of you? Why does she need to be there?

I think that if you just leave this be, the what-ifs will always nag at you. Better to have the conversation as soon as you notice it.
