Okay, so my BF also asks me to do this. Specifically just with my tongue. He really loves it, but I'm so much more vanilla than him. I don't like it very much, but I feel bad because I should want to do it considering how much he likes it. It also makes me feel more masculine, which isn't what I want during sexual activity. Let me know if you have advice on how to get over it.
