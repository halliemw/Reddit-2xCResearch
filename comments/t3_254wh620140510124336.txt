I share the optimistic first paragraph, but I think if the past few days are any sign, I love how TwoX is stepping up to keep the quality high, and the influx of new people who are seeing what's happening, and also want TwoX to be high quality.

If anything we need more users to post PSA style things of what TwoX does really well, and how to do it. -- Supporting people, listening, actively making this a safe place.

Last, I think there's a spectrum of beliefs in the men who make up 59% of reddit's userbase. Before there wasn't anywhere on the default front page to rally feminist voices, but there definitely were circlejerks for sexist comments. I am SO GLAD for this change. I don't think a majority of reddit is anti-twox -- and I'm glad there is now a place for that support to be visible.
