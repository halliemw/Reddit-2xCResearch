It is so nice to see that breastfeeding in public is becoming widely accepted.  There is a meme posted someplace that shows a woman feeding her baby in a bathroom stall.  That was my life while breastfeeding my kids in the late 80's/early 90's.

There was one store at the mall where the management told the staff that women who were breastfeeding could use the handicapped dressing room for that reason and we became regulars there (Go Macy's!)
