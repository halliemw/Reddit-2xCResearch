This is a slippery slope. On one hand you have your best friend who've you known for 12+ years, and then you have his current GF, who more than likely sees you as competition(I'm saying this because you mentioned she has depression and anxiety issues.). Are you in the wrong for still wanting to be his friend? Of course not, you have every right to be beside that man. As for his GF, i'd imagine it'd be a good idea to start including her in all your events even when you want it to be the two of you just like old times, that way both of you can start feeling comfortable in each others presence. Can women and men ever be friends? Yea, doesn't matter if you're single,engaged or married, if you need somebody to hang out with and talk to, it doesn't matter the gender, and even though your mother doesn't think its right, that doesn't make it wrong. Hope this helped answer your question! :)
