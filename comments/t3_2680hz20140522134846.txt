You're right. I really need to work on not using gender as a discriminating factor in people's intentions. It's hard because that's what my mind jumps to, but I want to grow more conscious of it. 

Also, do you have any advice on how not to come off as "flirty." I consciously try to treat people of both genders with friendliness but it's often confused with romantic interest with a lot of men.

I really appreciate your insight on sexual vs. non-sexual motivation, and it definitely brought some new perspective to me. Thank you. I can see how I need to grow less sensitive with that issue.
