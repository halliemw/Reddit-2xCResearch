When I worked with the Lung Association, I found it fascinating that they will only advertise to a point.  That's because if you push past that point, with more advertisements and information about how bad smoking is for you... Smoking goes up.

"Huh?", you might say (I know I did) "How can telling more people about the dangers of smoking make more people smoke?" and the psychology was explained to me that, for a certain segment of the population, the more you explained, the more attractive you made smoking for them.  I guess they think "Hey, smoking is scary and dangerous?  I want to be scary and dangerous, so I should smoke"

And that's a little bit of what I feel like Internet misogyny is like.  There are people you can reach, people you can say "Hey, this is bad and here are the logical reasons why".  But after a point, you realize that there are just some mouth-breathers who feel a sense of power by being ignorant online.  And the more you push, the more they push back.

So, like the Lung Association, you have to play the long game.  Put the information out there, and don't push.  Let it be absorbed over time.  And eventually you'll see people realize, like smoking, that it's not cool, it's not 'powerful' and it only really hurts you in the long run.  And then they'll stop.

As bad as it is, things are getting better.  And I can totally understand why you want it to happen faster.
