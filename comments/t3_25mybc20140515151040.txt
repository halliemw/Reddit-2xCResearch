The main "con's" are potential side effects such as headaches or nausea (usually only lasts a few days) or possibly mental effects such as depression. Some people also experience weight gain. I did not experience a single one of those side effects. I did however have my period come every month (it wasn't before because of PCOS) and my acne cleared up. My biggest issue honestly is remembering to take the darn thing. If I didn't have to take the birth control for the hormones (due to PCOS) I would personally go for an IUD.
