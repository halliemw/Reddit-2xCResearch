I have a friend who does this on occasion. I'm glad you posted this because I also wondered if it happened to other people. I've wanted to confront her about it several times but I usually just let it go. I tell myself that I haven't done anything wrong and if she has a problem with me that's her issue, not mine. A few days later she'll be fine. It's annoying but she's a good friend so I deal with it; although I do find it very rude/mean/obnoxious.
