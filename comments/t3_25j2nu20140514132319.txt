In my college Global Heath class, we had an assignment to set up in the cafeteria and give out information about child slavery in products like chocolate and computer components.

Several people just outright refused to accept that their iPhones and laptops had minerals mined by slaves. "Nu-uh, no, that's not true" and just walked away.

So I'm guessing it's "ignorance is bliss." If you don't know the products you use are causing harm to human beings, no need to worry!
