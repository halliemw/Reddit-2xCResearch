Went out to eat with a guy friend recently. We've had conversations about how annoying it is that servers assume we're dating, give us one check, and put it in front of him (it's happened before). Well, the server asked if we were "ready for the check" at the end of the meal - we both said yes, and he scurried off before we could ask him to split it. We kind of face-palmed and waited for the inevitable. Server put the check down in front of my friend, and said, "here you are, sir!" then walked away. I took it and just paid for us both (my meal was more expensive, and I'm sure I owe him for something). *I* handed the waiter the checkbook with my card in it (which has my typically female name and a 101 Dalmatians motif on it). When he returned to have the receipt signed, he set the book down in the middle of the table, made eye contact with my friend, thanked us, and left. It was so weird!!! We laughed over it, because it was clearly *such a struggle* for this waiter to accept that I had paid for our dinner.
