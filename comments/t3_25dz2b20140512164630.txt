I was at court paying a traffic violation and just my luck, it also happens to be sex offender registration day (YAY) so catch this: I just saw this guy in line registering as a sex offender two minutes ago and he fixes his gaze upon me while licking his lips. He had the stereotypical creepy sex offender look too: Long greasy pony tail and a mustache. I felt relatively safe since I was at a court with an attached police station but I still made sure he didn't follow me home. If anything can top that, Idk.
