It's sort of like removing "Huckleberry Finn" from the library because of the n-word; one must ask, do we also remove "To Kill a Mockingbird"? 
But I think that maybe we do need to establish boundaries over what is and is not appropriate to bring to meetings. Or we need to find a way to ensure that no one is "forcing" others to look at something that could make them uncomfortable.
Up until now, I always thought that we were capable of using common sense with these things...but D has proved me wrong. I guess this is why we can't have nice things.
