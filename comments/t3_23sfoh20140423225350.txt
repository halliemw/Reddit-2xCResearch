Sounds about right! My cup sits low when I first insert it and by the time I take it out, it's migrated higher and I have to bear down a little to get to the stem. 

The punchdown method works the best for me. If it doesn't pop open right away, you can give it a gentle tug downward or spin it to get the fold to open.

You'll definitely always be able to get it out, you just might have to bear down a few times before you'll be able to reach it. When I leave mine in overnight it's always more difficult, but not impossible! 

Practice makes progress! Good luck =]
