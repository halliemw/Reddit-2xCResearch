1. Professing feelings is definitely an advance.
2. Giving an (appropriate) gift isn't also an advance. If it were a _lot_ more people have hit on me than I ever realized, and there are a lot more homosexual or at least bi-curious people in the world than I've ever been lead to believe.
3. Insisting upon giving her a ride (regardless of what had transpired) is being domineering... However all he did was ask to give her a ride and waited even when she said he needn't. That's not insisting. If he was a teenager I think most people would describe his behaviour as being that of a love sick puppy wanting to spend just a few more minutes with the OP.

Sure the whole thing sounds creepy and inappropriate, and of course the OP is entitled to feel however she does about it all, but every now and then someone is going to get the wires crossed and mistakenly think an advance might be reciprocated despite all evidence to the contrary. The problem is when it isn't reciprocated and they still don't get it.
