I don't disagree that she was quick to be offended. Then again, they were incredibly quick to be dismissive. I can totally understand her feelings at that moment. 

And yes, OP, this is the real, adult, other-cliche-here world. People are still shitheads sometimes. They are still awesome sometimes. They are less likely to be interested in honest debate and exploration; more likely to be interested in winning a point or just ignoring for the sake of self-confirmation.

You learn to choose your battles and balance your values and its hard and its weird and it hurts and its totally worth it sometimes too.
