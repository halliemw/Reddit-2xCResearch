I wouldn't say that... or maybe the tide is turning.  The stigma is there, but I shut that shit down pretty fast. People know I'm a cool person. So when I tell guys there's an initial,  "so...you hate my penis?" but then I reassure them that their penis is fine and then it's all good.

When I tell a girl though the reaction is usually "me too!", followed by some high-fives. 

But maybe I am the radical one, WHO KNOWS?
