1. Redpill are not right 

2. I can't say I understand what you want or how  you feel, to me the very idea of "husband hunting" at that age (my age) is rediculous, I don't want to settle down and get married 

Yes I worry I might be forever alone, I'm comfortable with being single and  not even sure I want a "relationship" but them I've got a few things to figure out now 

You shouldn't give up hope, if you lived how you felt was best for you at the time you didn't go wrong
