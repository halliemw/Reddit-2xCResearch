Yeah, he was pretty good-looking, and rich, and connected... the only conclusion I can draw is that most of the women he came into contact with could sense his crazy and ran the other way.

There used to be a guy in my neighborhood who seemed nice enough, but my collie, who was smart and outgoing and loved *everyone*, would shy away from him. I never did find out what was wrong with him, but I always think of him when I read about cases like this. Sometimes I get some kind of feeling about someone, that I can't articulate or explain, but it's just a sense that they must be avoided. I  wouldn't be shocked to read that this Rodger guy gave off a similar vibe.
