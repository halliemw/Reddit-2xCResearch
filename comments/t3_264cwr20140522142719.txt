I would disagree, I wouldn't say it is either of their problem. It is possible for two people to be good people, but not be good in a relationship together. That doesn't make one an asshole because the other doesn't like a specific character trait. I know plenty of women that love to laugh and joke about how women belong in the kitchen, and how they find X girl attractive, and all sorts of other things with their bfs and husbands that are great together. I also know plenty of men that get all kinds of butthurt when you make a "back to the kitchen" joke that are just as happy in their respective relationships. 

I will agree that if they have had a serious talk about it and it hasn't changed, that there is an issue - but again, I completely disagree that it is a specific person's fault. It is a compatibility issue (if he is genuinely not serious about sleeping with another woman). 

Now, if he is cheating or trying to cheat, the gloves are off, and everyone is free to call him a wide variety of obscenities as well as OP needing to kick him to the curb, no second chances.
