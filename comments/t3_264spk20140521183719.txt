I'm so happy for your daughter. I had a hard time in school until about grade 8, when I met a couple really amazing friends. I will be the maid of honour for one of them in a few months :) I also had two really good teachers in the same year who helped me realize I was awesome and full of potential to be whatever and whoever I wanted.

I hope that she continues to be more happy and more fulfilled as time goes on.
