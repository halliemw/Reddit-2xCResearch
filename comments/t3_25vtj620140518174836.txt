WNBA games are not that very exciting. The athleticism in the WMNA league just doesn't even come close to that of the NBA. I wouldn't watch it if it were on TV, I don't want to watch people make layups all day I want to see some dunking. I'm sure the general public would also agree with that sentiment. There is women's tennis which is fairly exciting to watch and I have watched it on occasion, that gets regularly televised. You are going to have to come to terms with reality sooner or later that we are not as strong as men on average in athletics, and thus we will likely have fewer sports that are exciting to televise. The one place that I can think of that women do excel at over men is gymnastics but that is due to our smaller average size which gives us a lower center of gravity and better power to weight ratio. In gymnastics, I've noticed that women get more coverage than men because it is more exciting. It is just reality that stems from our biological differences. Learn to celebrate your differences and instead of pushing for things that we cannot compete with men due to our biology, push instead for sports that we can excel at like gymnastics to be televised.
