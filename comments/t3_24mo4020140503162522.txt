Your story is so similar to mine. My dad hit me once. My mom told me to forgive him. 20 years later she was still making me uncomfortable about my dad. I noticed she never came to my house to visit me and just me. Maybe once in 20 years, by herself. Your mom is getting a payoff by putting the family ahead of the needs of the individual members. You need to be safe from emotional abuse. My mom managed to stay with my dad because she learned to manipulate her kids into giving her the love she didn't get from him. My mom gave herself to her kids to make sure she would have our loyalty. I say watch out for her because she is just as sick as he is. You should feel loved no matter what you do.
