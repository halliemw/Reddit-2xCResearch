This is what annoys me. Women and men are the same, we are the same species, we are so identical that our bodies together can create a third, also identical creature! So why do so many guys believe that some intangible aspect of humanity makes women vitriolic hysterics and leaves them untouched? The obvious answer is that women's 50% of the population has been *nurtured* differently, even though our two *natures* remain pretty much the same. If a man were to be nurtured (treated) like a woman from birth to death, exposed to casual sexism on a mind-numbing, daily basis, why then he would also begin to think and feel like a woman. He would also hate when men stared at his ass, he would not stand in front of the mirror and play with his boobs all day, and he would not take catcalling out of car windows as a compliment.


TL;DR If a guy says "I'd like it if girls were always slapping my ass!" then my response is that that experiment has been done, women are the control group, and you would NOT like it.
