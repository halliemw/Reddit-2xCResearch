I really hate that this double standard about promiscuity/sex exists. One of my ex's who I dated for a long time, when we first started dating a mutual friend (well, someone who I thought was a good friend of mine anyway) straight up asked him "are you sure you want to date her, you know she's had sex with a lot of guys". seriously wtf
