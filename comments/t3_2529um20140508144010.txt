You're fine. You're going to be fine, and you're going to be happy and confident again. 

Now, I've been in a similar situation to his, albeit on a smaller scale. I've slept with people I wasn't necessarily attracted to because I thought my feelings might change because I liked their personality and my initial idea of what they looked like. 

To be honest though, I would have slowed you down if I were him. Obviously, he should have taken more time to think about what he wanted before he went on a marathon sex spree with you. That was wrong, no two ways about it. I've also just told people it wasn't going to work out.

People make mistakes, and misinterpret things. You were love-blind, as you said. But that was what he had led you up to, in a way. It's just a shitty situation that you went through. But that's not you. You are a person that is looking to better themselves, and be happy with themselves. You have hobbies, interests, and friends. This is one bad situation out of so many good ones that you have had, and will have. Your life isn't over, and your dating life isn't over.

So do things that make you happy. Work out, eat healthy tasty foods (this always makes me feel like I'm treating myself right), masturbate, and when you feel comfortable enough (or maybe not quite there, even), get out there. Even if you need to just go out with some friends and lightly flirt to start out.
