Honestly, its not just your problem - you say he is in your social group and he bluntly says this kind of stuff in front of all of the other people in your group. If the other people in your social group laugh along with him at your expense then they too are encouraging his behavior. You said you have already tried holding him accountable and he just brushes it off as a joke (clearly it isnt  a joke otherwise you wouldnt feel like shit after he says such things). I would talk with your fiance and the other people in your group - because this man has no respect for you (or other women) and the only way he will stop is if your entire group points out his sexist, brash, and unacceptable behavior and force him to stop his behavior. ===== in my experience the men in social groups stand by without saying a word because they dont want to seem weak by pointing out that such things are unacceptable and other women in the group wont say anything because then they will be at the end of every joke. You are not overreacting by any means this man does what he does because he is in an enviroment where jokes can be made at your expense and everyone else just stands by and does nothing
