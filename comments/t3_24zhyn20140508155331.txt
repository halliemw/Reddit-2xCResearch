yeah this is what has me scared somewhat the most. I had a friend who was molested a lot and she never opened up about it during high school. Later on in asking her why she acted the way she did it made perfect sense but at the time we thought she was just 'mental'. In middle school she was so vibrant and loud, and then became meek and acted as if she was embarrassed to even exist. It was one of her coaches...

I'm just super afraid about someone doing that awful to someone I love. Even moreso aware from all the the discouraging facts about how likely it is a woman can be molested/raped (what is it 3 in 10 or something awful?) and it just feels like obstacle course to raise her. 

And then there's the fact of just talking to her. I can be completely oblivious so I hope I don't muck this up.
