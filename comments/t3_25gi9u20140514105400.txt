I was only in labor for 6 hours, most at home, and got to the hospital 9 cm dilated, so there wasn't much time for talking. But my doctor (who was on vacation) knew I was breastfeeding, the one who delivered me said it would be okay if I used formula so my friends didn't make fun of me. Ya know, peer pressure and all.

As miserable as I was at that hospital, the stupidity of the staff sure brightened my day.
