I have witnessed it directly several times. He uses these nicknames in front of me and in stories he tells me. And others have experienced it as well but what I am going to talk to his boss about is what I have experienced. 

I am going to tell the VP what I have heard, seen, and experienced. How it affects me, how it makes me feel, and how I'm afraid of retaliation if I confront him directly. Does that make sense? I'm not taking this lightly. 

His behavior is offensive and I'm tired of it.
