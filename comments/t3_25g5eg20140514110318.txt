Before I went on birth control they were very irregular. I think the longest I went without one was 6 months, and 3-4 months was the norm. I had some tests done to check if there was a hormone imbalance or something causing it but everything was normal. My sisters and mother were all really irregular too. Around the age of 19 I went through a patch where they were reeeeaaaaallllly heavy and difficult to manage. I went on the pill (I can't recall which one I'm afraid) at maybe 20, which made me regular and less heavy (I'd guess average). But honestly, having never had it that regularly I found that really annoying! My periods stopped as soon as I went on depo.
