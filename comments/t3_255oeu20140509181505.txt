((Hugs)) for you if you want them. I really don't have any advice or words of wisdom and I'm sorry about that. I hope your phonecall goes OK and you can say what you need to say.  

I can commiserate with you on having an absent dad, though. I was a complete and utter daddy's girl but then he went and abandoned me when I was 13. He didn't talk to me until I was 18 and he has flitted in and out of my life since then. Just after my son was born I (unintentionally, I was unaware he lived in that house) moved in to the house next door to my father, we actually shared a wall. In the 2 years I lived in that house my father visited us 5 times. I've since moved away and haven't seen him at all in 18 months and we've spoken on the phone twice.

This is the same for me. I've often thought about why my father stopped loving me but he was able to be a good dad to children of the women he has dated. I still contantly want his approval and his love, it's toxic to my mental health.
