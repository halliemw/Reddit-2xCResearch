Building off that, I would say school is a professional social setting. Many private schools have uniforms and it doesn't damage the kids. I am not even suggesting something as drastic as that, just business casual. Slacks instead of jeans, no tee shirts. It really is not that different than what many schools already have in place.  But it would put the boys and girls on equal footing, since saggy pants would be a definite no.
