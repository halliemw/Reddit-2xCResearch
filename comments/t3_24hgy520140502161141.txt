I tried a Lunette for two cycles.  I have heavy periods (much worse since going off the pill) and having to pry the thing out of me every four hours, especially at 3 AM when half asleep, was not the Womanly Experience I was going for.  

I gave it another whirl with my last cycle and it filled up and leaked within three hours.  Meh.
