There are some forms of mental illness with a strong propensity towards violence... and some with none. One of the issues with mental illness is that people don't separate it into the actual conditions. This is, for want of a better word, crazy. It's like not recognizing that Ebola and Sickle Cell Disease are different. Paranoid Schizophrenia and Depression are different in every way except that they are mental and not physical ailments. Then there are conditions like sociopathy, which are untreatable, and may not even be illnesses so much as just types of people.
