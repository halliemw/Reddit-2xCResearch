This was... over a decade ago, but I tried three types of pills and they all caused terrible side effects.  I was curled up in a ball with pain.  I could barely function.  I finally gave up on hormonal bc and only used spermicidal condoms.  My SO and I would happily accept a surprise baby at that point, but we would have preferred to wait a bit.  After a short time it became apparent that we were both sensitive or perhaps allergic to the spermicide, so we switched to plain condoms.  We did not have any surprise babies.  Later, we got pregnant immediately every time we halted birth control and then he got clipped so we wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.
