Regardless of what you do to make her feel comfortable, jealousy of someone is an issue that person has to deal with. We all get jealous it's natural but making someone else feel bad is not cool, though I'm sure its probably not intentional at all. 

Of course communication is key as it may be another issue but don't change your natural behaviour because they are jealous. That is their issue and self esteem issues they have to work on. By all means support them but I just don't think it should come at the cost of changing your personality.
