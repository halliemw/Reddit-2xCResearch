Both yeast and bv are a result of ph imbalance in the vagina. I deal with both by using a probiotic capsule (i like Fem-dophillus) inserted directly into my vag once a day til symptoms abate. For me, the key is staying on top of things and treating the minute anything seems off. Slight off smell, slight but obvious change in discharge and i immediately insert  a capsule and that usually takes care of it. I will also treat preventively if i know something will trigger an infection, like if my partner and i are having lots of sex and he cums in me a lot (semen is alkaline, vaginas are acidic). You can also take the probiotic orally and that will also help recolonize the good bacteria, but delivering the probiotic directly to the place it's needed works faster IMO. I have been treating myself for years this way to great sucess.
