You misread.  The dad is the CEO.  He did *not* get tearful (why are you trying to make it look as if he got tearful?)  The daughter (COO) and VP got tearful and he rounded them up firmly.

They did not get tearful until the OP began to protest, she laid out her side of things, the daughter and VP responded.  The CEO did not.

I think you can interpret that as the CEO was okay with the decision and the mixed messages (recent pay increase), etc.

Some options a reputable, ethical company would have given:

1) reducing pay to pre-raise levels, after explaining economic situation
2) reducing pay but also reducing hours, to be fair (better)
3) reducing pay and hours significantly, but giving a choice to the OP

We do all three of things where I work.  The employees are able to choose (and they are given time to do it).  Sometimes decisions are made by the highest-ups to eliminate a position, and it is a tough decision, but frequently our organization is able to use some other option, if it's only about money.
