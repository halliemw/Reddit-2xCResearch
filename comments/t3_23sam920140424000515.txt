But whats in the womans body is a part of someone else- and caused partially by someone else.  I just wish there were a way for it to be fair for both parties involved, all around.  I feel bad that men have absolutely no say in the fate of their unborn child, legally. Im not in any way saying that they SHOULD have a say.. its just complicated and theres no way to make it fair.

Tonight my SO and I are writing out a contract that states 2 things: 1) if i were to get pregnant, we would terminate it unless we BOTH agree to follow through with the pregnancy.  And 2) in the event of a termination or health complication due to the pregnancy, we would both be financially responsible for the medical expenses.

It may not be conventional- and i dont know if it would even hold up in court if either of us tried to go against it... but it makes me glad that we are together on this.  At this point in our lives, i think we trust each other not to need a contract.. but who knows what will happen in the future. If we got in a huge fight and I wound up pregnant with his child, Id hate for either of us to abuse the pregnancy as leverage against the other person.

Wow, this whole situation makes me sound like an awful girlfriend.
