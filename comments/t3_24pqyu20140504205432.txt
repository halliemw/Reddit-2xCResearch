Regarding the Disnefication of your life: The first step is realizing your expectations are unrealistic. Your next step should be identifying your usual narrative fantasy path, and how/when you start heading into it. The step after that is telling yourself "No. Stop." whenever you start.

I'm in therapy for this very thing right now. I am a writer, a Romantic, and have an overactive imagination. Narrative fantasy is like crack for me. I manipulate not only myself, but the people who enter into relationships with me into fitting this ideal storyline that not only doesn't make any sense, but isn't even something I want.

So, don't be me. 

As for becoming stronger, I started going to aerial yoga three or four days a week and actually doing the things I dreamed about doing when I was a kid. I dyed my hair pink, bought sailing lessons for my birthday this year, and have decided I'm not going to do anything I don't want to. 

The world is full of magic, you just have to open your eyes to it. It's your magic. You don't need to try and live something that doesn't exist to feel special and magical.
