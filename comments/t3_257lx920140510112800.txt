I have no advice about picking a cup - I guessed, went with Diva, and got lucky. Let me address some of your other things though!

> I am just worried I'll leak or it'll be uncomfortable like a tampon.

I do have some leakage occasionally when I don't get the seal right, but it is /actual/ leakage - as in, a little bit - and not 'I bled through my tampon'. I have simply started wearing a pantyliner with my cup, which I do not usually need, but which provides me peace of mind. 

I have found my cup to be super comfortable, far more so than a tampon. I cannot tell it's in at all. Let me warn you - the first time you look at it, you may go 'holy cow that's never going to fit'. But it does, and it's comfy and easy once you get the hang of it. 

>Where do I even buy them anyway, the internet?

Yup! Amazon and other various sites!

Actually, I do have some advice about buying. Check out [this LJ community](http://menstrual-cups.livejournal.com/) and look at the resources on the sidebar. They have tons of info and compare/contrast charts you might find helpful!
