Well, that didn't help :(
Seriously, thanks Lasercows (great name!), I know you were trying to help, but as I sit here in my room waiting for answers, I got mom's tape measure and measured. Kinda hard to do the leaning one!

But, the stupid calculator came back saying I'm a 28F :(
THIS news just made my night much worse.
