Some people have mentioned patches, which are great. I would just mention that if you get patches sown in by your local dry cleaners or a tailor, they are usually closer to the fabric that is being patched, so not as thick as iron-on patches (therefore not exacerbating the rubbing), and sown in, so last longer. 

I'm a waitress, so I have a similar issue with going through uniform pants. I've found a bit of a solution in that polyester blends are much better for working than cotton, which always seems to be more of a problem with friction. Are there cotton/poly scrubs?
