I went to grad school in my partner's country because it was the only way we could live together for this year. The US and UK are very strict about partners and immigration, so it was better to have my own independent visa. 

The MA programme I've been doing is terrible, and so expensive. Moving here was something of a mistake, but not because of my partner. In fact, we've grown closer. 

But wait! Earlier in my life, I knew I wanted to live abroad and do grad school abroad. My partner at that time was unsupportive, and actively tried to discourage me from my dreams. He too was going through a terrible time in his life, but he used my desire to see more of the world as an excuse to be snitty. I eventually booked a ticket to Italy alone for after my undergraduate graduation and told him that he was invited if he wanted to come. We (thankfully) broke up two months later. 

I suppose what I'm trying to say is that living abroad can make a relationship stronger or weaker depending. If the relationship isn't working, make the decision for yourself and he might lose out. If it is, make the decision for yourself and you might get stronger.
