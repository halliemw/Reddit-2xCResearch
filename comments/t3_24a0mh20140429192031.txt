Iirc, and it's been a while since I took pharm, these both work on the same pathway. Percocet is actually an opiate and acetaminophen, which are combined because they work well together, and morphine is another opiate. There are different opioid receptors and different opiates have different binding affinities for the different receptors, so using two together can be very helpful but that's usually not done unless the pain is severe. And severe pain has it's own psychological effects.
