I agree with you, and the article seems to acknowledge that fact but in a dismissive way because it is not worth waiting for society to adapt since our resources are limited and our top heavy society is catching up faster than we can keep up with. Making employment more family friendly for men and women has always seemed like an obvious benefit to everyone to me. I have never understood why that eludes so many people in the United States. You often hear the counter argument that policies enabling people to take more time for family favors people who choose to have children, but these polices would also benefit people who want to have healthy romantic relationships or take care of an elderly and/or ill relative among other things. 

I also find it funny that this article, beyond simplifying the issue of having too few doctors to the problem of doctors not working enough, seems to think that by denying more women acceptance to medical school we could began to solve the problem. It is funny because less women in the field of medicine would lead to fewer primary care givers which would cause more stress on the system as a whole. Furthermore, in a country like Japan where it is very hard for women to stay in the workforce after having children and where their aging population is already causing near insurmountable stress on the economy their response is to make it easier for women to keep their jobs and take care of their families.
