If you don't want to, don't do it! No one has ever noticed that my ears aren't pierced. Or if they do, they've never said anything. 

I actually had my ears pierced as a child, so my experience might not totally count, since my ears aren't smooth like yours. But then I woke up one night with a face full of blood. One of my ear lobes is a lot smaller than the other and the piercing had ripped through while I slept. Now there's really no room for a piercing in that ear, since there's a little line where the skin closed up. I  envied other girls for awhile, and I still get earrings as gifts from people who don't know, but I stopped wanting them pierced. I've never felt less feminine for it and I think it suits me at this point. I don't wear jewelry at all and I remember the upkeep being a pain in the ass (I was prone to infections despite attentive cleaning).

You're not alone. There are dozens of us. Dozens!
