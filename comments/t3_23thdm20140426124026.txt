I think it's okay to be upset, but I wouldn't necessarily be angry at him. I realize that might not make a ton of sense, but grieving for someone can change the way you respond and react to a lot of things, so being bothered by what he did is something I can empathize with. However, I can also sympathize with him... sometimes you just flat out don't want to go to work, and if it requires an excuse, well, that sucks. 

He may not have wanted to tell his boss that he was taking a day to deal with personal stuff -- instead of making himself look weak, he sort of transferred that aspect to you instead and said he needed to take care of you. A bit odd, but I can kind of see where he might have been coming from.

I hope you feel better OP!
