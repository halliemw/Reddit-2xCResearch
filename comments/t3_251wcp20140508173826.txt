Using a throwaway account of mine for obvious reasons. 

I quit Reddit on my main a couple of months ago. I posted a story about how my ex/rapist was harrassing me and was followed and stalked and sent messages shaming me and calling me a liar until I had a breakdown. I deleted my whole account and probably spent an hour on the phone with my long-distance boyfriend crying. 

I hate being a woman on Reddit. I want to participate. I want to feel okay and welcomed. But the moment I bring up that I am female, that I am a feminist, I become reviled. It makes me want to cry. I have enough issues in my real life (PTSD and sexual assault victim and all that, yay). I don't need more from stupid motherfuckers who can't pull their heads out of their asses, and that's how Reddit treated me.
