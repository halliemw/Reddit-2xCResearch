I'm one of those rare birds who never drank coffee until about a year ago and now I am ALL about it. Does it wake me up? I have no idea! But pooping is easier and more consistant, and it's absolutely the only thing I can think of that might have had this impact on me. I used to drink black or green tea, and I still do to an extent but now I'm all about coffee.

I'm convinced people were hiding this from me. All they ever said was that it woke you up. I had no clue it helped move things along so well!
