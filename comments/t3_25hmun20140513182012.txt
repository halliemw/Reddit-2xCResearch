I'm hesitant to give slang a definite definition, but I'd call it a man thinking he knows more about women's experiences than he really does, and trying to explain those experiences very forcefully. 

For example, I took a website design class in high school. When we were making a web page about our hobbies, I put some screenshots of video games I'd taken on it. The guy I sat next to told me he was jealous I was a girl who played games, because all girl gamers get showered with free stuff. The funny thing is, I've never gotten anything just for being a girl playing a video game, but I have been called a whore by people who thought I was fishing for free stuff after correcting them for calling me "he." :\
