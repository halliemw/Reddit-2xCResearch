Yes, exactly. Catholic dogma states that life begins at conception and purposefully trying to terminate it is murder. This isn't the type of belief that is a stronger form of one's personal opinion about a matter. That a six week old fetus is equivalent to and must be protected as vigorously as a four year old is a moral absolute as far as he is concerned.
