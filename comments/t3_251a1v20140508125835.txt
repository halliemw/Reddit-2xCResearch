no one said "unregulated." Just not over regulated. Unions prevent those conditions MORE than effectively these days. using an example from 1904 hardly seems appropriate. the government simply does not need to jump in all jolly like they do quite often. and when they should, in the case of abuse and attempts at market manipulation  government does not even do anything about that.
