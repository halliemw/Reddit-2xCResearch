Here's my take on it, as a woman with a lot of tattoos engaged to a guy with none. I think it is absolutely never okay for a partner to "forbid" you from getting any particular body modification. At the same time, I do think that it is reasonable to take a partner's concerns and aesthetic preferences into account to a certain degree. For example, my fiance just really does not like the look of calf or ankle tattoos. This preference simply came up in passing, but my feeling is that if it bothers him, I'll probably just stick to other tattoo locations. 

Has your husband said whether it is the location, size, or subject matter of the tattoo that bothers him? If it's just one of those, perhaps there is some room for compromise.

As for the job issue, that depends completely on the type of job. The only people I personally know who've had trouble with arm tattoos at work are people in low wage customer service jobs involving a short sleeved uniform. In a professional job, you can usually either wear what you want (and in an office, most people wear long sleeves anyway) and/or people don't care about tattoos.
