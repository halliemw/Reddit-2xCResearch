But that's the point - the dress code isnt being reinforced with the boys too.   Why isnt the guy who wears a tank top showing off his muscles, distracting the girls and female teachers? I went though my entire high school education without being distracted by the 'cute boys' in my class.  IF I can do it, then the boys can do it too.  We aren't slaves to our evolutionary imperatives.
