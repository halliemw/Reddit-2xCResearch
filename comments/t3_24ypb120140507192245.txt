I am having a wedding for about $2000 for 40 people. The things I am saving money on:

* no bridal party
* two family members are doing photography
* I am doing the catering and buying alcohol, will buy stuff in bulk to save costs (estimated cost is $600)
* having it in my mum's backyard
* buying my (non white!) dress from China ($80-100)
* celebrant is my best friend's uncle so he is doing mates rates for us ($300, normally this will cost between $400-800)
* no flowers 
* make my own invites ($50 for materials + postage)
* my sister is doing my hair and make up

The rings are the most expensive part as it was important to us to have durable matching ones. We are getting two palladium rings for $1180. You can get cheaper rings such as tungsten carbide or titanium. 

Our ceremony will be special still :) We've picked out some nice vows and readings and it will be fairly similar to a normal non-religious wedding. That part is free anyway! (Other than the cost of the celebrant of course but where I live this is mandatory). 

And the reception is going to be like a big family lunch as I have always loved our Christmas get togethers and things like that. 

I think the best way to stay cheap is to really keep your guest list down. I had to exclude a lot of my family and a bunch of my friends so you have to weigh up whether it's more important for them to be there or is it more important to keep costs down.
