Our ten year anniversary is Wednesday.  We dated for 5 years before we got married.  We have made it through cheating, loss of loved ones, war, birth of loved ones, first home, moving several states away from where we grew up, making new friends, losing friends, losing jobs, miscarriages, and more.  He is my best friend.  Some days I want to choke him until his face turns purple.  No one has ever made me feel such deep and unrelenting anger.  No one has ever loved me more or made me happier.  I would not trade a single moment of hurt, pain, frustration, fear, or rage, because the experience of loving someone so deeply even through the shitty points in their life (and yours) is the true gift of marriage.  Our good moments vastly outweigh the bad ones, but surviving the bad ones is the only way to get the REALLY good ones that you cannot describe in words, that move you to tears due to their pure, simple, joyous wonder.  There is a solution to every problem in life--you just have to believe that your partner will be a part of each one.  Work to stay in love, it's worth it.
