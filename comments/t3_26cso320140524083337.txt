Molestation is never "only" molestation. Never. It's not something to take lightly, it's not something you can just get over like nothing's happened, **it's not insignificant**. Where I'm from, it's a serious crime when children are molested, doesn't matter if it's done by teenagers or not, child-molestation is inexcusable.
