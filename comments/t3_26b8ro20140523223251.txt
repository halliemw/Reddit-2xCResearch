I was glad to see this sub as default because I feel like the people responsible for that decision think that we matter. And I think the trolls are doing so, at least in part, because they think we don't deserve to matter. And by un-defaulting, we would be telling them that they're right.

Also I feel like giving up would be surrendering to assholes, which I'm pretty well inclined *not* to do.

I don't think removing 2xc from default would make them stop, anyway, I mean it's not like they're gonna magically forget it exists just because it doesn't show up on default. What if we had, like, a ton of mods, so that there would *always* be someone online monitoring new comments, etc?
