Nobody is saying they're the same thing. I'm saying that I have a problem with the idea of slut shaming because it feels like it's objecting to the idea of shaming but not objecting to the word "slut." I think the word "slut" is generally gendered, and very charged, as it has a history of policing the amount of sex a woman has. I do think, politically speaking, it is an objectionable term.
