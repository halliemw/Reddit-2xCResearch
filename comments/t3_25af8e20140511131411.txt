I know how you feel- my mother was absent from my life too. And I was single on valentines, too.

But just because the day stinks for me, doesn't mean it should stink for everyone else. I'm happy so many people have wonderful parents/mothers, and they have the right to celebrate that and give them praise. It sucks that I don't have that, but I'm not going to bring everyone down with my sadness.
