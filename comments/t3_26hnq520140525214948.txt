It would bother me, but that's not important. If it bothers you, he shouldn't do it. Part of a relationship is being considerate of what makes your partner uncomfortable, at least to a reasonable degree (asking your partner not to say a word that upsets you: reasonable. asking your partner not to ever speak to anyone of the opposite sex: not reasonable! use your good judgement!).

It's not a significant hardship for him to try to avoid using one word, so it would totally be a reasonable thing to bring up, if it bothers you. 

When you get to the point where you need him to eliminate huge swaths of vocabulary, then I'd question the compatibility of the relationship. But until that point, yeah, you can ask him not to call people bitches all the time.
