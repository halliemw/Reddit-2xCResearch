I like your response! I agree with boredwillow with everything she says above, but I think your response is a good one. It's got me stumped!

But, to respond, I personally think that wearing pajama pants and slippers to school is unacceptable. I wish students would realize that it's disrespectful to the teachers. Especially middle and high school teachers. I know the students *have* to be there every day, but guess what! The teachers don't! They don't have to spend hours outside of school planning lessons and dealing with curriculum and how their administration interprets the common core or some other such triviality that is slowly making teaching more and more nitpicky. They are doing all this and students are showing up not even bothering to get dressed and be presentable. The students don't have to care, but maybe at least look like they do!

But that's a bit of a rant! With the "appropriateness" of sweatpants and a ratty sweatshirt, I *do* think that it is more appropriate to be covered up than not in any adult office situation. If I walked into my office with jeans booty shorts, with the bottom of my butt hanging out, I think that would be less appropriate than walking in with sweatpants. Both not office appropriate, but I feel like the booty shorts less appropriate than being fully covered.
