Its good that shes acquainted with the topic so it won't come as a shock to her and she won't feel completely embarrassed (since she'll know its natural). As we all know, there is quite a wide age range this can happen in, so you can only prepare her so much verbally about it. When that day comes, just fill in what you've left out and ease her into knowing its all natural, nothing to be scared or ashamed about.
