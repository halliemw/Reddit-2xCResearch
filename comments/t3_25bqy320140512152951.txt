I know this is off-topic, but I see so many people say they can't edit because they're on their mobile. However, the mobile version of the site does offer an edit option.  It just doesn't show unless you rotate your screen to landscape! Infuriating and bad design i'm sure they'll never fix, but at least I can share this nugget of useful information to my fellow typo-ers.
