It's an emotional issue, I didn't mean to instigate discord, I am simply trying to point out that it is important to be sensitive about wording. It can impact how any person can view the advice they are receiveing, and how they then judge themselves and their own actions.
Again, I understand, this also was an emotionally charged issue for me in remembering how important that was for my ex, so I apologize for my over-sensitivity. I had only hoped some clarification would help OP (even if it was a month later).

Edited:Typos, grammar
