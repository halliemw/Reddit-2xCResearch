What you're describing doesn't really happen in my experience. There are a lot of men who post here. More than the women know, I think. 

There are people who use stupid terms like "mansplaining", but they're a minority and they draw downvotes in the better trafficked threads. Yeah, it takes a little while to acclimatize to this particular sub, but it's a relatively healthy community. It's a great little playground and you get interesting discussion and perspectives. 

>This is now a default subreddit, and excluding 65% of reddit's population[1] just won't work.

I think if you do the math on this one, you'll find you're wrong.
