So, my fourteen-year-old sister has a similar figure to the girl in the article, and doesn't put much thought into the clothes she wears. If she left for school one day in a pair of shorts just like the ones her friends wear, that meet the school dress code, and that my parents approved of, would it be fair for the principal to pull her out of class, humiliating her in front of her peers, just because a few teachers were "ogling" her?
