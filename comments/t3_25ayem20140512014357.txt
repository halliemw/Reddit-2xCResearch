I feel like she really skimped on the whole pregnancy complications, delivery complications, and birth defect issues while trying to be so reassuring. And while the rate of birth defects is still "very low" as you age, it's still 3 or 4 times higher than if you were a few years younger! Like how I prefer my contraceptives 99.3% effective instead of 87% effective, I also highly value keeping that likelihood of healthy normal pregnancy, delivery, and child as high as possible and a few percentages lower is Russian Roulette with someone else's life.
