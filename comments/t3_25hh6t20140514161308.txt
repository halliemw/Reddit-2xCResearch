Thanks for being a normal thinking person! Geez. There is nothing wrong with telling women to stand up for themselves. We teach that to children "hey if someone touches your privates, say no and tell an adult". Its not that different as a woman. Obviously, there are times when you are afraid of saying no, but this was in a crowd of people with her bf, and for blocks!

To play devil's advocate, if I was a guy and thought it was okay, I would assume she would tell me if she thought it was inappropriate. Yes, I know she has a bf, but some people cheat, flirt, and do all sort of things in front of or around their partners. 

You are completely right though about learning some confidence and assertiveness. Women need to learn how to have a voice and set boundaries and enforce them. She even responded to me that she would've acted the same way if she wasn't drunk. Thats the biggest crime here. Not knowing your own strength and not trusting your intuition
