Wasn't there are article recently relating this to the romanticization of tuberculosis in the 19th century? That's what springs to mind for me whenever this topic comes up. You know, the pale innocent young woman wasting away from TB while writing poems and making delicate sketches has sort of been usurped by the silent agony of depression and self-harm. 

There's a book by Sontag called Illness as Metaphor that was really interesting on the topic, although she was making the argument for tuberculosis and HIV as metaphors for different time periods.
