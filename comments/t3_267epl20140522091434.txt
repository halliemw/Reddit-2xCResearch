You can definitely have a baby and graduate! I am doing it right now. It can be hard because babies take time and money. I hope your parents can help you out with that. If you take spring semester off, that's plenty of time to get the child ready for childcare. I like center-based childcare myself, although it gets pricey. 

I also understand about your concerns with delivery and the effects it will have on your body. After I delivered my first child, I felt like a deflated meat balloon. I was young (so are you) and my body went almost back to normal in a couple of years without much effort on my part. I'm sure with a good diet and some exercise you will feel normal again in time. Pregnancy was hell on my body, but the child that resulted is one of the greatest sources of joy in my life. Good luck!
