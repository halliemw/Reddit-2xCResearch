Hahaha! No seems to be the overwhelming majorityâ€¦As you can see below I didn't know you could vote more than once, but if you go to the results and click next it shows you a geographical location of where the votes are coming from so I doubt someone is time traveling all over north america haha

edit: someone in bulgaria voted which I personally find particularly exciting hahaha
