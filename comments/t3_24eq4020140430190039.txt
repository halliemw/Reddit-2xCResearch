Ignore most of those rules, especially about what you can eat and drink. I made the mistake of reading "What To Expect When You're Expecting" when I was pregnant and it made me super paranoid. Just eat healthily and educate yourself about the reasons WHY you're not supposed to eat/drink certain things. Like yeah, mercury in fish is a problem, so just research which fish are least risky and stick to those as much as possible. You're obviously educated and have critical thinking skills... Do what you can to learn about what the real issue is and what the risk is. So many of these "rules" about pregnancy and babies start with minuscule chances of something mildly bad happening and generalize it to "avoid this all the time, no matter what." It's crazy-making.
