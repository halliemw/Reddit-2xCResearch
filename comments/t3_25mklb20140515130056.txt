I remember this exact topic coming up when GM took a new CEO who happened to be a woman. General outcries that she was being paid less because she was a woman. Someone pointed out that the outgoing CEO had a long track record of running companies and she was actually being paid only 100k less than his starting *salary* and she had no experience being a CEO, so they were actually being extremely generous. 

CEO's get benefits packages that compile over time that are written into a contract and deeply negotiated. They are generally pretty fair. If you look at total number of women in those positions versus men in those positions, that is where it starts to look pretty bad, but the ones that are in those positions are paid pretty fairly compared to their predecessors. (For example, it's unfair to compare the female CEO of GM to the male CEO of Target and exclaim it's unfair she is paid less. Two totally separate companies.) There are fewer women in the highest paid CEO spots, but if women were to take those positions in those companies, they would likely be paid very fairly. They just need to be offered the jobs first.
