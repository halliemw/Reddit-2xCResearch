Yeah, I wasn't entirely sure if "adult bullying" was the proper term to use there. I just had never encountered a situation where I truly felt like a bunch of adults were ganging up on me to in order to get me to conform to their wants; I agree that adult bullying should be reserved for harsher, more extreme situations.

The guilt trip thing, unfortunately, is another thing entirely. I have yet to master the ability to not let people affect me in this way.
