For the last time, *it's not just the trolls*. Trolls are probably the easiest problem to deal with when becoming a default. The real issue is that the **CONTENT** and **COMMUNITY** will go to shit. 

Nobody will be able to discuss personal things or things that matter to women because an overwhelming portion of subscribers will be men who don't care about this stuff, and they will downvote it and up vote things that pander to men like abortion political click bait trash and "how do I get laid herp derp" bullshit.

You would need like 100 dedicated authoritarian mods to continue to keep any semblance of normality around here and even then it will be a struggle.
