>I try to be positive, but how can I ignore all these things. I just want to cry after using ethos, pathos, and logos to try and show my perspective and still don't make a dent in peoples thinking... I just get so sad and discouraged, and mixed with other things it makes me wonder why I even bother with anything.

Are you having a problem with sexism, or are you having a problem with fatalism?  Sexism is a legit problem to try to address, but the issue you're having sounds like it has more to do with sadness and resignation in the face of the imperfect and ultimately futile nature of human endeavor.
