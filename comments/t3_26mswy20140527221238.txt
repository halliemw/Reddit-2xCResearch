I think it started off that way, big nerd/cute girl but it also showed problems. For example when Penny went back to school and Leonard kind of looked down on her and tried to push her to do things his way. Also the other love interests for Leonard have been smart women that were attractive in different ways. 

And I 100% agree with your second paragraph.
