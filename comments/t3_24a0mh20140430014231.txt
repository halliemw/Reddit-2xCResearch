Yeah, we actually had to transfer him to another hospital because of the way the nurses were treating him at the first one, and the *second* hospital is where the woman wouldn't clean him and the other one yelled at him for peeing the bed. 

I mean, I know not all nurses are that horrible, but we dealt with at least five of them over the course of a month, and I just never want to be in a situation where I'm bedridden and just have to *hope* my caregivers are nice and won't take their bad day out on me. :(
