I'm very, very uncomfortable not wearing a bra. If I'm not wearing a bra I can barely move without pain, let alone go up/down stairs, etc. I don't wear bras when I'm sleeping but I really prefer how I look and feel with a bra. If you don't want to wear one, you don't have to, but some of us genuinely prefer it.
