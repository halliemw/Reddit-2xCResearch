Thanks for the response.

Selecting only out of what is received in reports may be one of the reasons why you're seeing that sort of rate. In this very thread there are people talking about their experiences with receiving harassing PMs, but I wouldn't report those posts to administrators because I don't know if those posters would want to get involved like that. They also may not report them if they feel that it wouldn't be taken care of, which I can totally understand if an admin uses nebulous language to describe how many people are lying about harassment, especially if the motivation for the people lying/exaggerating isn't known.

edit:

Uh, speaking of wondering if a PM is real, [is this?](http://i.imgur.com/X9cMLxf.png) Because if so, that means it's bannable to send yourself rape threats to create "drama", but actual ones aren't.
