The thing is with the anti-abortioners and the way they treat those who decide abortions are the right choice for themselves, THEY DON'T CARE. Caring for another person means you must also realize they ARE another person, and that while their ideals and hopes may be different, we should try and accept them while respecting they will have different aspirations than us.

When we make it our own personal mission to crucify others for personal choices on what to do with their bodies, and throw them in jail for MISCARRYING, or force them to risk death to exercise their rights to their body, we don't care about them as people. What we're caring about, deep down, is the image we're portraying to everyone else.
