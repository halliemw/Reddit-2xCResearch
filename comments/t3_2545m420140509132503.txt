I get around 6 per year, with anywhere between 45 to 60 days in between (pretty irregular). I've had a standard blood test done, blood test specifically for OB/GYN hormones, and even an ultrasound. Everything came back normal and they have no idea why it's so irregular, and didn't tell me to worry about anything.
