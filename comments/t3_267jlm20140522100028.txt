My advice to her is go to his church and talk to the pastor, because if the church is good the last thing he will want is to see a family fall apart. If it is a cult church you will know right away, and then perhaps look for another church with a pastor that is God oriented for help. I hate churches/religions but there are good ones out there that will be abke to help you without forcing religion down your throat.
