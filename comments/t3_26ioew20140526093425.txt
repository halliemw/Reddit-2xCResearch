I wish I hadn't spent so much time sweating the small things. I'm only 4 years out of high school and already I barely remember any of it. The people who were mean to me, the number of friends I had, the things I stressed about, I don't remember any of it anymore. I spent so much time upset because so and so didn't like me, but everything really does get SO much better after high school.

Also, I wish I had been more assertive with what I wanted and believed in, instead of trying to make other people happy. Think about what you want and don't cave if people try to change that.
