Allow me to clarify what I meant. I feel that everyone should have access to a cheap, safe, and not-judged-by-everyone-and-their-dead-dog abortion. 

All these religious people keep arguing that if we legalize it everyone will kill babies left and right and the world will go to hell, when it's none of their damn business what other people do. 

I sign my petitions and send letters to the leaders of my country telling them to stop shutting down clinics. 

When I typed my comment, I was pointing out the fact that the leaders that try and push for this legislation try to make themselves sound like victims, when they don't HAVE to get an abortion if they don't want one.

Also, it was at 6 A.M., and I'm sorry if I wasn't clear on what I meant.
