If he was a girl you would be furious, if your boyfriend was bi or gay, your gay friends motive would be one for hooking up. I like to engage in some innocent gay fun at parties (kissing other girls) but my SO is okay with it and so are the other girls and their SO's if they have any. Gay is not an excuse for making a move on your bf.
