Have you had sex since the negative experiences when you were younger? How far have you gone and do you regularly go with your boyfriend?

I've met many women who don't particularly care about sex when they are not having it, they don't masturbate and don't seem to get horny, but sex itself drives their sex drive. When they have it, they start to want it.

Age is also important. I don't know how old you are, but plenty of women, who turned out to be highly sexual, weren't that into sex at all when they were in their late teens or even early twenties.

The fact that you were raped can *absolutely* influence things. You may block certain feelings or unconsciously avoid or escape certain situations. I agree with others that talking with a professional could be very beneficial.
