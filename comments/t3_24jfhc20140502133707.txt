Just because she's young and had had sex before, her not consenting should be taken lightly? She wasn't the victim she claimed to be, because for some reason rape isn't traumatic for a girl who has had sex and given birth before? What the fuck is this judge thinking.

Usually the comments section in news sites are despicable, but I really liked this one:

> I don't care if she were a 14 year old hooker. She still owns her own body and has the RIGHT to say no to sex. Period, point blank, full stop, game over. no more d**n discussion. She says no, then YOU STOP. There's literally no more to it than that. And that goes regardless of gender, ofc. If HE says no, you should stop also.
