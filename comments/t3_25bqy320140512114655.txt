I've never felt threatened beyond what common sense would dictate on the rare occasions where I've been in areas with high crime late at night or other similar situations.  But then again I'm an athletic, muscular, sport playing man who's weighed over 210lbs since he was 17.  There is a level of danger inherent for everyone in being in public and public interactions.  Some random person on the freeway could take offense to your driving and blow you away at the next stoplight.  I generally don't worry about taking a run in the early morning in my neighborhood though.
