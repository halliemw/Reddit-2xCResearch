That website cites no studies and is in line with the cultural view that women age like milk while men can be studs into old age. I bet they'd have reported on douching being medically necessary and hysteria as a legitimate medical condition. Did you know that the research showing women's fertility decline being in the late 20s is based on birth records from 1700s France? They just looked at when women were having babies in the 1700s, and that was it. Not very scientific.

Children of older fathers are also more likely to have birth defects, mental illness and neurological disorder. But people don't blame fathers for waiting until 30-35 to have kids when he has a kid with Schizophrenia or who commits suicide, the way society does with older women when they have kids with Down Syndrome.

I'm on my phone so I can't link to all the studies I've looked at, but I mentioned some of them in a recent comment on TwoX here:

There's more, people are just so deadset on women being the problem after having having been raised in a society that's obsessed with treating women as fertility objects, that they ignore studies that cast doubts on men's eternal virility.
