I had hair (gray) and baby teeth-like things in mine. The doctor showed me photos, I asked if I could see them but they weren't at the office when I had my folo up. Actually this whole thing happened after an episode of "ER" where someone still has their tumor in a jar, the doc and I were laughing about that. I remember such random stuff :)
