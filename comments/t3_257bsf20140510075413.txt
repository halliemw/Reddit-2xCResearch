"Slut shaming" is an important tool in maintaining control over women. The best example recently was the Sandra Fluke incident. She testified before Congress that she took birth control because the hormones resolved an issue she would have without them therefore they should be covered under the ACA. She was immediately attacked by many national figures as a whore who just wanted to have lots and lots of sex.

Its about control, as a girl you belong to your father until he gives you to your husband then you belong to him.  At least that is the way it has been for centuries.  Thankfully the world is changing, even if it is slow & painful.

You did the right thing for your friend, she has the right to have and enjoy sex as much as boys do but obviously needs to be more careful because boys don't suffer the consequences that girls do.  Both should protect themselves (both emotionally, which is really hard as a teen, and physically - use condoms) and be prepared to get plan B and tested for STIs if need be.

Ignore those shamers, you were strong and deserve credit.
