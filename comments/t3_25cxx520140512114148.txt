The only time I can remember (as an adult) this happening to me was super creepy. We were alone on an underground train platform. The guy had been singing to himself and marching around in that way some people do that makes you think they want attention. He stopped directly in front of me, turned around and ordered me to smile, without a smile on his face. I asked him 'what?' as I had been wearing headphones. He says, "you should smile" again, as an order.

Oh should I now?

Frightened to be alone with someone who was now demanding I perform for him, I asked him to leave me alone, multiple times. He ended up getting angry and yelling "Gladly, bitch!" Then stared at me for the entire train journey once the train arrived.

Definitely not a fan of people who tell women to do this.
