Westeros has a pretty strong rape culture though... and incest culture... and murder, torture, feudal, genocidal, infanticidal culture. Bad things happen to good people. Bad people don't get what they deserve. I'd say somebody like Terry Goodkind fetishized his scenes of sexual dominance, but for Martin it's just another color on the canvas. 

Rape happened in the medieval era in which the story is set, and Martin wants to recreate that world... except with dragons.
