Maybe he did feel weird about your grandparents passing and used it as an opportunity to take some time for himself. It's not really a big deal that he used it to run errands. If he's ever lost somebody important in his past, the death of somebody that your partner loves, or even just a friend of a friend, can still bring back a lot of emotions. 

Everybody deals in their own way, maybe he just doesn't want to make it apparent to you or his boss that he's grieving too or freaking out about how to be there for you.
