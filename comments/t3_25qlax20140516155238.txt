I should note that you won't find too many voices of dissent when it comes to the cup because they tend to get dismissed (try harder! keep trying! try *x* cup! try *x* fold!) by cup enthusiasts. I mean, they straight up evangelize when it comes to the cup. It's great that it works so well for them but it seems like they refuse to acknowledge that it just plain doesn't work for other people.
