What do you suggest then when someone makes an unconscious sexist  decision??? What should I do in that situation?? 

>That's like saying you're not going to be vigilant/careful walking down the street at night because "I don't worry about it unless I have a reason to worry about it."    

Right, I will walk down the street per usual until I have a reason to walk down the street differently. In that case I would walk down the dark street on alert because it's dark. Would I walk down a sunny street the way I would walk down a dark alley? No.
