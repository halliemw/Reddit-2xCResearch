My sisters both got their ears pierced when they were infants as tradition, but I didn't for some reason. Now everyone insists that I do it. I have a lot of metal allergies and I know I could wear stainless or gold, but it seems like more of a burden than it's worth. I do have two pairs of vintage clip ons, though, that I adore and can wear on a whim.
