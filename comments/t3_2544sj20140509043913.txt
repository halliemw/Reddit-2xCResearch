Oh sorry, I more meant that we're probably hearing more about it because it sells papers (or clicks/adverts), so media agencies love picking up on things like this. Hence it tends to LOOK like Australia is going the way of the US, but it's very likely this guy's bill won't pass. Like this article says though, it doesn't mean we should be apathetic about bills like this and it's always great to bring it to people's attention.

He probably has the best of intentions in his mind, and stories from his constituents to support his bill. I'm making this up but perhaps people from countries like India come to Australia for gender-screening and abortions because revealing the gender in an ultrasound is illegal in that country. However, here gender-selection abortions are carried out due to genetic diseases which impact one gender over the other, and a fetus of that gender would never survive for that couple, but the other gender would.

I suppose the repealing of section 8 would be to protect the rights of doctors? But the medical needs of a patient should always supersede the moral/ethical beliefs of a medical professional.

I think Victoria frequently sees these sorts of bills but they're often turned down. If you're in Victoria, absolutely call your state representative just to express your point of view on this bill. It will make a difference.
