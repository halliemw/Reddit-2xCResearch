You know how old people don't give a fuck about things?

*Yeahhhhh*

Your period is no different. I started mine when I was 10. I'm almost 30 now. That's 20 years of dealing with cramps, sore tits, waking up to once white sheets no longer being white, countless destroyed underwear, feeling like the walking dead a for a whole week before the fucker even starts, and let's not forget probably the worst part of it all: period shits. Like it's not enough of a train wreck down there to start with, let's top it all off with horrible bowel movements. And when it don't start I'm constantly worried I'm pregnant. Even when I've not had sex. You really can't ever win.

In the end I'm not going to deal with all that *on top of* dealing with someone else having a problem that I'm having a visit from aunt flo. Those people can just go fuck themselves.
