I'm not calling her a child. I'm saying anything that can make you *like* a child, even if it's within a really small scope of your overall life is a really terrible thing. Not to be taken lightly.

Imagery can trigger powerful reactions. They can take away all your self control.

The point I'm making is that once such associations are formed it can make life like walking through a mine field. You never know when you're going to step on one, and even if someone warns you it's often impossible to avoid anyway.
