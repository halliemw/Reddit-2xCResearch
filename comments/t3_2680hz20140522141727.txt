From a guys perspective:
I'm going to go off the assumption that all of these guys are not only after sex(they could be, but bear with me).

I'm a 31 year old married guy who has been out of the dating game for over 10 years.  However, maybe this makes me a jerk too, but this is what I would do also were I looking to start dating a girl.  Let's say I see an attractive woman, who I did not already know, the first thing I would do would be to ask her out for coffee or dinner or something.  Yes, it was based completely on her looks, it's important that I'm attracted to her.  Maybe I'm just out of touch, but I thought that's what dating was for, getting to know a girl and find out if we mesh or not, if there is any connection or not.

I think of it like online dating.  You don't look at a persons profile if you're not attracted to their profile picture.  If you are, then you go and learn more about them.  But in the online world you can do this anonymously, there is no worry about mistaken intentions of "I thought you just wanted to be friends."  Out in the real world, if a guy walks up and asks you out, there is no chance of you mistaking his intentions.

Again, it's been a long while, but to me: 1st Date = do I find you attractive, 2nd Date = do I find you interesting / do we share common interests etc.  As for guys not getting the point when you say you're already in a relationship, sorry, some people can't take a hint / have no respect for an ongoing relationship.
