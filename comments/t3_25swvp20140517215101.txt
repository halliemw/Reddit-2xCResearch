I was actually, at one point. Very confident. I didn't feel like the world targeted me. I didn't feel this way till consent touching, grabbing, and belittling me. Not only that, but my dad would agree with them. My dad was my world to me, and I felt he left me behind to go with the male>female mind set he has. He says to me that "The most powerful thing a woman has is in between her legs." I'm sorry but I don't believe that. This isn't medieval times. My most powerful "weapon" is my knowledge.
