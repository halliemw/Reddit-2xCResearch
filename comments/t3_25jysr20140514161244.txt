I think these are awesome and I will definitely contribute to the Kickstarter, but I think they are missing one thing: some kind of cartoon or comic. The boy super-hero toys already have identities, origin stories, etc. I don't know if these will do as well unless they have some kind of story element to them already. It would be awesome if they could be packaged with a small, short comic about each action figure to demonstrate why their quality is an important characteristic to have.


Edit: Of course, now that I think of it, there could be advantages to not having a pre-conceived identity for each action figure. I guess it could go either way.
