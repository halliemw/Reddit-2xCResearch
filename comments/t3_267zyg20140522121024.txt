Firstly, congratulations on the job!  That's great news.  

Second, you know your relationship better than I, so all I can say is people change and he might have changed, so prepare yourself.  Maybe you two will get back together, but unless you talk about what happened, I doubt you'll be able to move on from it.  You don't want to rekindle the relationship if you have this big ugly shadow from the past hanging over you all the time.  

Third, make sure you get to the Netherlands and carve your own life for yourself.  I don't know how old you are or anything, but going to new places always makes me think I can reinvent myself a little bit.  Have lots of fun with it!
