(A) is technically true, although lots of states have 'Romeo and Juliet' clauses to prevent absurd outcomes (March 9th 2 15-year olds have sex and it's consensual, March 10th one of them turns 16 and it's rape, March 11th the other turns 16 and it's consensual).  If age were the only factor, I'd argue against legal action here.

(B) is a reasonable argument if it's true that she was too medicated to give consent, but beyond a lot of insinuation, the article doesn't actually give us enough direct information about what meds she was on, the dosages, or her actual state of mind and behavior patterns, to make this determination.
