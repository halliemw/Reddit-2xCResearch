I have Paragard, and I thought I would die from it triumphantly bursting through my uterus for about a month (made my boyfriend spoon-feed me ice cream after I got it inserted), but eventually it settled. You might expect some cramping slightly more intense than a usual period for about the same period of time as your period, I have heard Mirena is gentler than Paragard. Ibuprofen helps a lot.

You should schedule a follow-up appointment about a month later to make sure it's in the right place and for some trimming of the strings now that they've settled. The fastest way to check that the IUD is still in the right place is to check the strings yourself semi-regularly (technically once a month, but I only remember about twice a year).
