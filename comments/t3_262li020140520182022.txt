Middle schoolers are in a stage of their lives where they want to experiment. I'm guessing the dress code is in place to keep that experimentation in check when it comes to attire. In high school most of your peers will have grown up a bit and start dressing appropriately. So the dress code is probably there to stay. Sorry.

That being said, is your username from Grey's Anatomy? :)
