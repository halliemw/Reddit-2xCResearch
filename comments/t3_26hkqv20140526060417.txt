Two months is really not very long; my periods were pretty irregular for about 5-6 months after I got my Mirena, including several heavier periods.  After that they became lighter and then basically stopped.  I've had mine for four years now and haven't really had a period in over three years.  YMMV of course, but I'd say just hang in there while your body is adjusting and don't worry too much about it.
