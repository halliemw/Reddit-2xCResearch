I think the unsettling part for me is that one friend said I have to be making it all up because I'm too much of a feminist to have let someone treat me like that. 

I'm not saying you aren't right that the best way to think is forward, and how to help myself not let it happen again. But hearing that I wouldn't have fell for it if I loved myself more really hurts. I know that's not the intention.
