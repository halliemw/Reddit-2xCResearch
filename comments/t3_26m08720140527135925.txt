If you're already going to the doctor it should be a quick and easy thing to check. You just pee in a cup. I've gotten UTI dipstick tests at the store for when I first had a UTI and didn't know if what I was feeling was that or not. Usually when you get a UTI there is some burning either during or at the end of urination, but if you have a mild infection you might not experience this. But yeah, checking with a doctor won't hurt.
