After the two of them specifically made an effort to be honest and work out a difficult hypothetical situation in a way that they're both comfortable with, potentially strengthening their relationship along the way, your advice is to plan on ignoring all that and lie?

I can't imagine being in a relationship with someone who, after having a long conversation with them about an issue deeply important to me, resolved to do the very opposite and lie to my face about it.
