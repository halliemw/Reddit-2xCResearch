Sex only decreases your value if you don't feel you gained something from it. This is what needs to be explained to young girls (and boys). When you decide you are ready to have sex, you should think of all the good things that sex will bring you, It will bring you a new life experience, intimacy with a partner, perhaps taking a already committed relationship to another level of commitment, You may discover things about yourself and about your partner. All these things increase your value as a person, and because of that having sex can be a very big deal. You run the risk of losing part of yourself if you have sex when you are not ready or with someone you don't trust, and that can make you experience emotions like regret or worthlessness, which is why virginity is still an important concept, But its only important to the person who has it, Like you said, you are no one's property and your actual worth is not tied to your genitals, its tied to your experiences and thoughts and the love and kindness you give and share.

I think OP's mother handled it better than some might, it sounds like while her views are outdated and objectify her daughter, she explained it in a calm manor, and didn't just scream or yell at OP.

Its sad to think that a mother, a woman, can think that virginity still matters so much, Because it says a lot about how she feels about her own self worth.
