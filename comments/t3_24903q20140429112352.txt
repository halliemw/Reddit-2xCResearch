Until the young get old and are reaping the benefits of money put into the system. Even if, starting at 18, you pay like $60,000 in insurance by the time you're sixty, you're almost guaranteed to withdraw that much or more in medical services after that age. I know it's hard to pay those costs when it feels like you're not using it, but think of it as a savings plan towards future health care costs.

That said, it's still a really tough burden to bear when young. I'm not saying it doesn't suck gigantic balls when youth these days can't even afford to live on their own, let alone other basic things like accessing a dentist.
