She is an awesome lady. The picture is from one of our outings to the local small-town bakery/old person hangout spot she has been taking me to all my life. She gave me my first coffee there and told me that I needed to learn to drink it black. I was six and a half at the time.

Gram isn't awake much right now, but I have been there for about four hours each of the last two days, at least to sit next to her. She isn't eating anymore, so bringing her a doughnut and coffee would be for naught. 

It is really hard not to stress, but thanks for your support.
