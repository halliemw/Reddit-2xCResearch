I read the direct paper the article internally cited/linked, and all they did was find children called fat gained more weight than those who weren't called fat. That only demonstrates a correlation. For it to demonstrate a direct relationship, they would need to include and explicitly discuss a large pool of children who weren't overweight but were called fat and follow them to see if they gained weight as well. This is absent from their study as far as the available links/the article which is being cited goes, so it cannot be claimed as true.
