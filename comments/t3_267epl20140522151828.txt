This is exactly me.  I found out I was pregnant in my first semester of college, at age 19.  I was with the father, but he was abusive and terrible-- never held down a job and relied on me and my money.  I was always the payer of the bills and was trying to make something of myself. 

I am pro-choice, but abortion wasn't an option for me.  I stayed in school (in a very Mormon area, as a pregnant 19 year old this was just awful) and had my baby.  He's almost 7 now,  and I have been a single mother for most of his life.  I have no family support around and did it all on my own, and I wouldn't change a thing.  It was hard-- I went years with no glasses or contacts just investing everything I had in my son.  He's the best thing that ever happened to me, and I feel we are closer because of our years of it being just me and my boy.  Do what you feel, but just know-- this doesn't mean your doom.  

I hope your boyfriend hops on board and is supportive!  Even if not, though, you can do this.
