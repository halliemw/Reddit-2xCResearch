How long ago was this? I know that now there has been a big push to get baby boomers tested because there are numerous ways they could have been infected before we even really were aware it existed. My laboratory started performing the test in house and I typically run four or five a day. A doc that would still put up a fight today over HCV testing isn't worth your time. 

You are right, though. HCV is still not included in the typical STI panels.
