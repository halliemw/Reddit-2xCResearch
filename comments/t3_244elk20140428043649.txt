Not only that, but why does a supposedly omniscient god *need* to test anyone? If a god is truly omniscient, then he already knows the result. If he chooses not to know certain things to preserve 'free will', then why is he testing? If he *cannot* know certain things, then why put so much faith in a fallible being?

Sounds a bit insecure, really!
