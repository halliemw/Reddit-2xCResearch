What did you expect, it is Salon. Salon is a very biased publication that prints incomplete and misleading click-bait. Expect as much real journalism from Salon as you would from Jezebel, which is to say absolutely zero. These publications are like the Fox News of the left, they have an agenda to push. I prefer to read Bloomberg, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, Foreign Affairs, The Associated Press, Der Spiegel, etc. any day over the garbage journalism at Salon or Jezebel.
