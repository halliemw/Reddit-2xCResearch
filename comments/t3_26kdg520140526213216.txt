It's not worse, it just means that you were pretty close on the 32DD - a 28F is the exact same volume as a 32DD. [Its all about sister sizes](http://i.imgur.com/6KJjw.png) - all the sizes in the same row have the same cup volume. Actually, your cup size is one size small than your mum's 38C.

28F is a normal size. I look pretty average and wear a 28E. Browse through /r/ABraThatFits and look for "fit check" posts. You'll see that many women wear bras your size. It's not freaky at all.

The tighter band in a 28 just means that more support comes from the band and less from your shoulder straps. That helps prevent back pain, and if you ever want to wear a strapless bra, it means you won't spend all night tugging up your bra (or at least hopefully less of it...)
