It's doesn't matter who's kid it is. It's never mattered who's kid it is. 

Biological fathers never get a say in abortions. The only person who should ever have any say in a woman's abortion is the woman herself. 

Her body, her choice. To say otherwise, it's to deny autonomy to her her and women in general. 

She has the right to abort or refuse an abortion. It's her body, her choice. There are literally no exceptions. 

It's sick that people think they have the right to force a woman to abort or give birth against her will. Nobody has that right.
