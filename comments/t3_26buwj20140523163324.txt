I accept compliments on the rare occasion that I receive them. The guy that I briefly saw this spring called me pretty and I cried - partly from happiness and partly from sadness that I rarely get called pretty. I was talking to a friend yesterday and mentioned a mutual friend. My friend said that it was kind of me to think of our friend and be concerned about them. Which made me feel good, although other people might interpret what I said as being nosey.

I want to like myself, I just can't find much to like. I thought people who say that I should ignore what others say. But if I come across to them as someone who is judgemental and doesn't listen to others, then I possibly do to others.
