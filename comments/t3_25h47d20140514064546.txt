The reason why I don't bring self defense is because it is a side issue. Of course it is important to be able to defend yourself. But self defense won't guaratee you are safe. The most experienced, highly trained marine soldier with 10 years of combat experience... Can be taped and murdered if caught by an intelligent predator. Heck, he could be at a bar with his mates, and a trusted mate slips him a date rape drug and brutally rapes his unconscious body. 

So yeah, self defence definitely helps but it's not a guarantee. By far most situations of being attacked as a woman are when your defenses are willingly down or compromised. Even in street situations often the attack happens without any time to pull out a gun let alone realize what is happening. 

Sounds like your way of dealing with rudeness is perfectly fine! That is exactly what I would do too. The point was a lot of people feel justified to throw slurs because they perceive they were turned down in the wrong way. And tat's exactly whar you call it - escalation. And my overall pont was to show that this can be pretty scary. 

And more so, it's frightfully common. Go to /r/creepypms. Not only women post there but most are. Most engage either in regular interactions on the internet or dating website ones. Many refuse politely even take much effort to be nice. The amount of hostility, threats of violence and rape, and wishes of horrible shit to happen to you ... All for merely refusing an approach.. Are insane. Like, "hi...Sorry i am not interested, have a nice day! Fuck you bitch i hope you get raped and sodomized by a dog"
