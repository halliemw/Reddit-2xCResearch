That's the point of the question though - why is it OK to lie on resumes? Because it's expected. Because confidence gets you places where experience does not. 

It's not like every single man does this and every single woman does not, but I've read a few profiles of my colleagues and some things just jump out at me as outright lies, and some people really talk themselves down without realising it. It's more important to be CAPABLE of doing the things you're talking about. Obviously OP's example wasn't capable, but all of my colleagues are certainly capable of what they put on their resumes and more.
