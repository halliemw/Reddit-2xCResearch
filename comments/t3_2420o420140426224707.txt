Haha, I think I saw the bad Willow episodes (though my Buffy friends assure me those don't exist) because she just so, so...annoying or irritating or something. Like nails on a blackboard. I'm super intrigued though from your description of her character- so I'll give it a go!
I also saw the Buffy musical episode and was not a fan, but I also didn't know anyone in the show so maybe that's why I thought it was painful.
