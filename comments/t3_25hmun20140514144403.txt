How about just explaining? Or "explaining when you don't know what the hell you're talking about."

The experience mansplaining describes is 100% not unique to men. Try being a teacher sometime and see how many women (and men) think they know your job better than you do.

Mansplaining is a generally offensive term that somebody came up with because it's catchy and would draw attention to them and their work. It's unnecessarily polarizing, it's an explicit attempt to shut down debate on the basis of the other person's identity and, frankly, it's ugly word to look at. It's also a jump to offense when none is really necessary. People who try to explain something to you, even when they clearly have no idea what they're talking about, isn't intentional disrespect. It's just something that people do when they converse. It's the other person trying to put things in their context so they can understand it.

If someone says to you, "I would have done this," simply answer with "I couldn't because I'm a woman/POC/giraffe and the situation is different for me."
