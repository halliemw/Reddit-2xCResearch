Thank you for the advice!  I'm a full-time graduate student that also holds a full-time job and I've purchased personal insurance for myself so I could theoretically see a counselor.  My biggest issue is finding one that won't make me uncomfortable.  You mentioned that you went to counseling-- how did you find yours?  Word of mouth, through insurance, or by another means?
