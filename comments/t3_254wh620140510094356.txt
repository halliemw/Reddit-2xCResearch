Acceptance is a process, and tolerance is phase 1.  You were never going to get slave owners to *accept* or *support* free african americans in society, but you might get them to *tolerate* them long enough to teach their *children* to accept and support.

It's a political tactic, and one which we desperately need in order to make progress.
