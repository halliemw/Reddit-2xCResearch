Sorry to hear that you haven't found relief with the surgery. Not what you want to hear, but Mirena has been a godsend for my endo symptoms. I also had terrible experiences with just about every BC pill I tried, but this past year has been about 90% pain (and period) free.

I read all the horrible things about it online and decided to go ahead anyways, and I'm so glad I did.

Also forgot to mention that I no longer get debilitating migraines. So that's good.
