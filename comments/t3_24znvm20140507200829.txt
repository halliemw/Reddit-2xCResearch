I guess what the thing I, and I think many other people, enjoy so much about twox is the camraderie. You're all actually complete strangers but feel like friends, because we're all in this together as women. This is a safe place to talk about issues we experience as women, seek advice and experience, or vent, post relevant articles, blogs etc because there's always the atmosphere of "C'mon, ladies, I know you know what I'm talking about". When you open up the community so widely, you open it up to judgement from a wider spectrum of people, and a lot of people feel like they can come here for constructive advice without being heavily judged by the Reddit population at large. Am I going to post about my period problems if it might front page? No. This is somewhere for people who are expressly invested and interested in women's experiences, and a lot of people do not need to hear about my mammogram, or a personal sexual assault or the latest article on abortion or sexism (I imagine the comments on abortion related issues are about to get pretty interesting).

It's like we all found this little shoebox to chill out in together and discuss things. And everybody was welcome if they were respectful and stuck to the rules, and could contribute if they wanted to, and people would come strictly because *they wanted to be here*. This stuff was only here for people who came looking for it. But now they've taken the lid off the shoebox completely and anyone passing by can see everything, whether they actually want to be involved in the community or not, and throw in whatever passing comment they have, whether these are issues they understand or not. If the mods or reddit wanted to move this thing into a bigger box with more people then that's perfectly fine. But taking the lid off completely was not the answer.
