My like second or third week of work, I was down in the testing lab with some of the other engineers while they were talking about a part that one of the suppliers messed up (sorry but I have to be intentionally vague here).

They had found out that apparently the person who was responsible for making the part was a woman, so as the guy was describing it, he looked me right in the eye and said, this part is "woman wound." Meaning that literally the part was made by a woman. It took *so much* effort to keep my expression neutral; it sort of felt like he was intentionally being inflammatory to get a rise out of me by wording it that way and not *quite* saying she messed it up because she's a woman. 

Luckily the most senior engineer (and I mean *the* senior engineer) jumped in and did his best to re-word the statement after seeing my face. All of the other engineers were silent. This senior engineer does actually try to make an effort to curb what he says, at least around me. He is an older gentleman so I try to give him slack because of the way he was raised and the environment in which he was raised. One time he made a joke about how a manager we were meeting with changed her mind about the conference room, "eh she's a woman they always change their minds," or something that. He immediately corrected himself and said "er well I guess all people change their minds." It hurts, but at least he's trying, you know?

I don't know how to tell him how much he is doing for me, even if he doesn't always "get it right" every time.
