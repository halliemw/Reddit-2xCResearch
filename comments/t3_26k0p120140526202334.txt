>cat in to kennels

Just chiming in to say that cats should be fine being left over the weekend. You could always take the dog with you too, if he's well behaved.

Anyway just extra bowls of food and water is fine. You could even put out automatic feeders if you wanted, but it's not necessary.

It's just I've never heard of bringing cats to kennels. We've always put up extra stuff for ours. :)

I hope your discussion with him goes well. Good luck!
