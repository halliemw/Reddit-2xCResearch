I played with barbies as a kid and can honestly say that I never looked at her and thought I wish I was like that. My Barbies did things like fight with GI Joe and whatever other things my brothers and I came up with. I started to have body issues when at the age off 11 my dad told me I was fat, even though I've never been bigger than American size 8 at my heaviest. He told me I had a pudgy belly and to this day when I look in a mirror it's the only thing I see, and when I look at models and actresses in magazines with flat perfect tummies who I know well are photoshopped I think, I wish my tummy was that perfect. Barbie is a toy. Why does the world think little girls are so stupid today we strive to be a toy?
