A lot of the "rules" are really medically motivated but others are so country specific that it makes no sense. Like the raw meat stuff is logical, who wants to risk parasites? But the "no lying on your back" and "no massage" isn't typical where I live so when I went to the US I had the impression it was just for litigation purposes.
