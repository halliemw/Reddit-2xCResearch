I spent a lot of time on this site: [A Practical Wedding.](http://apracticalwedding.com/) Good tips, essays to read, etc. etc. May or may not help in the planning, but I thought it was good for the various perspectives (there's more to getting ready for the wedding than just wedding planning! take time for yourself and your emotions! this is a big step you're taking). 

I'm getting married one month from today (!) and I've been engaged for a little over a year. I've tried my best to keep my wedding simple, but there's only so much you can do if you want to have all your family and everyone you've ever known there. The best thing you can do to keep down cost is to be brutal about your guest list.
