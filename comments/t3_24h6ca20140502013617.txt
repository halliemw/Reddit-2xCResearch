1) I really don't mind taking a pill every day, it's easier for me to remember than switching something every few weeks. I needed a hormonal BC option because I went on it originally to try getting my horrific cramps under control and I was only 16, so the copper IUD was out. As I said I was very young, never even had sex, Mirena was not a first-line option. 

2) Already kind of addressed this. TBH I already take another daily medication it's really not a big deal. I've now been on it for almost 5 years and it's just part of the daily routine. 

3) I started out on a tri-phasic pill which made me throw up several hours after taking it, and I just could not adapt to the side effects. Switched to a monophasic and it's been my BFF ever since! No major weight gain (just gotta keep the night-time appetite under control), no mood swings, no issues!
