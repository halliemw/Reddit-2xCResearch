No, no. Wait. In no way could the young woman be asking for it and in no way was what this man had done right. All I know is that if I had a 14 year old daughter, after making sure that she was safe and okay, I want to know what the heck she was thinking. I would want to know why my daughter would think it was an OK thing to allow a stranger to talk her into that situation in the first place. Maybe he was a family friend or something, but she's not 9 or 10. She's 14. Again, he's a horrible person for having done this but I would hope at 14 years old my daughter would have a little common sense and be able to know something was wrong before it progressed to that stage.
