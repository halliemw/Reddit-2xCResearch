An older distant relative asked me just yesterday what am I planning for my 18th birthday. I'm 24 :D

I'm walking my neighbors' dog, a 100 - 110 lbs German shepherd, and I'm not intimidated by its strength (but I'm not belittling it either). In fact, I enjoy those walks, the dog is really awesome and has the sweetest smile :)

I found out that I love biking and I'm trying to get into pilates. Also, my skin cleared up and I dare say my health is generally better than before. Yeah, I kinda like this time of my life!
