To the deleted comment that I can no longer reply to::

Like I said, Abortion is not a easy choice to make. It's not a rash decision. The government should not put a waiting limit on it. It's been thought over a million times before that women step into that clinic. 

You might not want to have one, and while I never had to get one or want to place myself in a position to think about getting one. I still respect people choices to do what they want in this department.

I'm not gonna go around thinking that people who gets one, just skipped all the way to the clinic, throwing flower petals, going "YAY! I'm getting an abortion. Fuck you motherhood! " 

Like I assume you do.

It might be moral wrong to you. But I understand that there is a bigger picture to it then "omg you killed a baby"
