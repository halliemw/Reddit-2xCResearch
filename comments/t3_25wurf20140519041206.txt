I wonder if my neighbor is like this. My mom jokingly called him the "crazy neighbor" but he's not nuts. 
There's just an off-putting vibe you get. It seems like he's really excited to be socializing with you and stares at you intensely and speaks just right at those moments you expect a comfortable pause or silence to sit. Not fast or off tone or anything... it's just... very different. And I've always liked and respected different. 
It's off putting but then it makes me feel guilty that I didn't chat longer. Because everyone likes social interaction. I'm going to try and chat with him more when if I see him. Maybe he's feeling similar to you even if for a different reason.
