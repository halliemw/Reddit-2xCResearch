Assuming you already went to your gyno, I'd probably go back to see if there are any other options. Everytime I had sex, I would get UTIs a day or two later as well. After several visits to my gyno he finally sent me to a pelvic floor therapist and it turns out that the reason I was getting so many UTIs after intercourse was because of poor pelvic floor muscles (they press against the bladder) which had to be fixed. Although I also began having painful sex a few months after the UTIs started and from your original post it seems you don't have anything like that.
Still might be a pelvic floor issue, who knows. I do remember my gyno talking about some sort of medication he was going to give me. I'd take one before sex and apparently it was supposed to get rid of UTIs. Never went on it due to the onset of my dyspareunia tho.
Anyways, I STRONGLY recommend you visit your gyno again, and if not I suppose just drink LOTS of cranberry juice. Which I still do and it helps a bit with the weird feeling in my urethra I still have. Also, try your best to stay away from a lot of caffeine (ex: coffee). My therapist said that could cause even more urethral pain/UTIs.
