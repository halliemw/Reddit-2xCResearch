I'm having trouble phrasing this in a way that doesn't come off as confrontational, but maybe someone who is more diplomatic than I can help with phrasing. Basically, I think there are two issues you need to address. The first is that it's wildly inappropriate for an adult to be making those kinds of judgments and statements about a child. The second is that it's just generally inappropriate to make judgments about someone's sexual proclivities based on how they dress.
