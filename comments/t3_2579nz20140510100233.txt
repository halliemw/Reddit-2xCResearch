Tell your parents everything, have them talk to the school and the police.


Keep everything he's sent you in case you need it later.



You'll be okay, I know it feel icky but you *will* be okay and you will get through this. You just need some support :) telling your parents will help them keep an eye out for you, and will also force other people (like the school) to take this seriously.
