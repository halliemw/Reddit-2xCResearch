I agree that there is an enormous obstacle in terms of social conditioning, glaringly evident in OP's avoidance of rejecting directly a person who has directly said "nasty" things.   

Also, I admit it's far easier to say "call the police" than it is to do it.  We're able to remember the stories of "*those* women who cry wolf." (Besides, we've read or been told that no one is listening).  

And the tug of that (conditioned) insecurity: "I shouldn't bother anyone about this because I'm probably just being dumb/silly/weak/on my period/blonde/brunette/five-foot-four/it's a Tuesday..."

Additionally, how disturbing that anyone has to strategically/delicately consider the weight of personal safety vs. employment.  Is any job that valuable?
