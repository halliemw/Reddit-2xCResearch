Ugh yes, I lost my mother suddenly a couple of months ago. I still get the voice in the back of my head that goes "Mom would like hearing about this, the next time you talk to her." Even when we were pulling together photos for her funeral collage that happened. It's such a jarring pang back to reality when I realize I can't do that anymore.
