I found that it was often a lot to do with me not being able to cope with him not 'liking' me. We'd have an argument or something would happen and I would get upset, he'd dismiss my 'emotions' as irrational and become really cold. I wouldn't be able to cope with the horrible atmosphere so I would always be the first to apologise and try to make up with him. It's ludicrous when I think how I've behaved.
