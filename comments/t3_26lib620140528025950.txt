I'm so sorry you had to experience that. :( I think it happens so much more than we realize. My boyfriend just confessed that he had a babysitter that showed him her breasts when she was 16 and he was 6-7. Normally, you'd hear guys cheering or whatever. But that (along with other inappropriate behaviors) really damaged him as a kid, just like those girls to you and me. Everyone deserves to be a child while they are children, and not have to worry about sexual things. It makes you grow up too fast. 

Kinda also makes me never want to hire a babysitter.
