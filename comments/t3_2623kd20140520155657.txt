I have a question, and please don't read into it more than is there.  I recently read  an article on Slate.com about the use of "So" as an interjection to begin a sentence.  I wonder why the OP began the first sentence with the "so" interjection.  I"m just curious.  I'm not insulting OP's grammar.  It seems to me that the "So" is unnecessary.  the sentence would mean the same thing if the "so" was deleted.  My question is:  OP, is there a reason why you began the sentence with the "so" interjection?  If yes, then what is the reason?
