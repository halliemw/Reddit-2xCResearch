> However, he penetrated you after you had said no and that makes it rape in my opinion

I don't know how clear this situation is.  She said she was bored, not into it and wanted to stop.  He stopped immediately.  He began jerking off, she joined in.  He asked her to turn over...Now, to me, that reads clearly as him requesting sex again.  I cannot really imagine a situation in which I am jerking a sexual partner off and he says turn over and I don't assume that means that he is instigating sex.  In the real world most people don't say "would you like to commence intercourse" before each new penetration.  He was "asking" her to have sex again by asking her to turn over.

Then he/they arranged himself I am assuming, indicating his intention and they started to have sex again.  Now, I am not saying that there can't be coercion, intimidation etc. in these situations, but she just indicated how surprised she was by it all.  And when she said after the fact "I didn't want to do that" he seemed (by her description) generally surprised and sorry.  

Basically I am saying that her "No" doesn't have some warranty that lasts 24 hrs.  I don't think he was crazy to think they were both getting back into the situation again.

He sounds like a complete asshole in general though.
