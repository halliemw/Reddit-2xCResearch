I live in Portlandia. I've been asked how much. I've had a guy and his girlfriend come to my aid while waiting for the bus. I've had a guy on the light rail stare at me, ask the people behind him if they know me, then sit in front of me and strike up convo, then say "I know I'm not that good looking but..." When I make it clear I don't want anything to do with him. (Maybe it's cuz you're creepy? Just putting that out there.) I also got whistled at in Vegas three years ago, only to be chastised by my mom and told "think of it as a compliment!" After I flipped him off. (When I came home crying cuz of being cat called at after a stressful day at work, she stopped having that attitude. Creepy lesbian hit on me, told me she wanted to fuck me and could do better than by bf w/a strap on, I lost my shit and yelled at her.)

Seriously. STAHP.
