Exactly this.  

I've been in a very similar situation; the company fired the NINE people who had the role before me because they were all apparently "incompetent".  They then hired me (I was completely up front about having NO experience relevant to the role), and after 3 months of receiving no training they fired me too (only job I've ever been fired from, in 15 years of work).

Life's too short to put up with psychos like this.
