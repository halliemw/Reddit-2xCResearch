I also suggest therapy. I don't know about BPD but I do know about attachment disorder. I'm an avoidant type personality when it comes to attachment and a lot of the things he is doing sound like the classic avoidant cycle. Creating distractions outside the relationship, creating distance, avoiding physical intimacy, etc. He might need to explore the possibility of childhood trauma. I know it sounds cliche' but... he just.. sounds a lot like me in my younger years.
