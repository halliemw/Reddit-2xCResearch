Honey it's only been three days. It's totally ok to feel like shit for a while after a breakup.  It doesn't mean you're weak or aren't independent. It means you're a human with feelings. 

Try not to wallow in the sadness though. Force yourself to get out of bed and go outside. Treat yourself to something nice. 

Just because your relationship with him is over doesn't mean your life is over.
