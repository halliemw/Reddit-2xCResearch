So true. I was once in a situation where I was visiting one of my LD clients at his day centre. As I stood at the reception desk, a guy with Down Syndrome (who I had never met before) grabbed me in a bear hug from behind. I was a bit shocked, and I reacted by telling him off in a very harsh tone. I went on with my meeting and then afterwards the centre manager asked to see me. She thanked me for reacting 'normally' to the situation. "He's always doing that, and people just shrug it off. But we want people to let him know that it's not right to just grab random strangers. His parents agree."
