It seems kind of silly to apply the test to one episode of each show - wouldn't that be like testing one part of a movie?  I know it requires a vastly greater time investment, but if they really want to get any meaningful results, they should test a variety of episodes from a variety of seasons and give it an overall pass/fail.
