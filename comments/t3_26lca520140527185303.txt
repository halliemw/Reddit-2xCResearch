This guy shouldn't put you off dating.  You clearly ran into a really, really, really awful example of what's out there.  I'm a guy and I have a lot of guy friends and I literally don't know a single one who talks like this.  Obviously I can't say for certain that nobody I know *thinks* like this, but regardless, this guy is not typical.  At least not in my experience.

I do think that the number of guys who are like this will generally show up in higher numbers among the guys who will hit on you or ask for your number.  It sucks but men who think of women as objects are much less likely to be intimidated by them because they simply don't care.  

All that aside, you sure you got the right twitter handle?  Internet is a big place.
