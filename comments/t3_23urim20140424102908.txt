Are you anywhere near a big city? If so, there will be women's health centers available to you that will not be judgemental or cruel.

How is your relationship with your mother? Even if you're not best friends, but you feel that she respects you, talk to her about it. Yes, she will be crushed and angry and disappointed, but I think you may benefit from the support of someone who loves you. Your relationship may even benefit from the honesty and shared pain.

If you don't get along with your mom, maybe call a favorite aunt or teacher or even your best friend's mom. When a friend of mine had her abortion she tried to go through it with just her girlfriends as support, and while we tried, I'm not sure we were as helpful as an adult woman who was in a position of authority would have been.

If you're in Toronto and just need someone distant from yourself to talk to and go with you to your appointment,  please feel free to pm me. No one should go through this alone.
