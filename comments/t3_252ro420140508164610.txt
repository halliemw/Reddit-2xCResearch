Basically when you sign up for Reddit you are automatically subscribed to certain subreddits. It used to be based on the most popular ones but now they are doing it a little differently. The admins added some new ones yesterday and took away a couple (for example /r/adviceanimals) and now this subreddit is one. It has no effect on current users but anyone who is new or anyone who browses Reddit without being logged in could see /r/TwoXChromosomes posts on their front page. I really don't know why people are getting upset about this and downvoting stuff here because it doesn't affect anybody who has been on Reddit already, only new users. When I joined I unsubscribed from the defaults that I didn't like.
