I'm not sure you're aware how cultural your preferences are, it's more than a dab! Your two points seem to be that our society pressures a certain aesthetic and then some tips to help conform to it.. It's nice you can keep up that lifestyle, but she didn't ask for diet tips, so that was weird (edit: not that you're the only one in here with diet tips or plugging thin-ness). Eat what you want, my SO and I have found edible bliss so there's no reason to force yourself to conform - instead speak up for those that dont beat themselves up even if it means going against the messages of media and society.

Way to go, OP. I realized recently I'd be more proud of losing twenty pounds than I am of my college degree. That is fucked. Up. No more punishing and calorie counting, and if I get fit it'll be because I'm going to let myself do the activities that I was afraid of because of how it looks when a fat girl does it. Hopefully by not fearing my French fries I can stop binging on them too! It sucks to feel so guilty around food and I'm getting so sick of it.
