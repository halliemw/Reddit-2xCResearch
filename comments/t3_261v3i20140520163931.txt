I was in the same position at the same age... Well except the wanting kids part... But really, I'm about to turn 30 and couldn't be happier. I'm not super thrilled with my job, but I'm able to save a wee bit and I'm currently living with my amazing boyfriend. It's easy to sometimes get lost in the idea that we're suppose to have it all figured out by "x" age. But there is no age that things magically fall into place. It takes work meeting people and it takes stepping outside of your comfort zone. It's a rare day that anything truly amazing happens in your comfort zone. It's true work wise and with relationships. My current job I took to get to a city I love. I left one job in one state on a Friday and started the next job in a different state on Monday. But if you're looking for work success, apply for things that interest you. Talk to people who are in positions you want and ask about doing informational interviews with them. People are ALWAYS flattered when someone thinks their job is fascinating. If you attended college, see if they have a career center that could look at your resume or give you a jobs list of companies they know are hiring. And always talk to friends. It really is about who you know! 

Sorry for the wall of text... I'm on my cell and just realized I did NO formatting! But good luck!
