2 now, plus internship. I actually did work with a lot of women at my internship, one was even my boss and head of app Dev and support for a gigantic investment bank, another was a fellow intern and a good friend.  I did not include that initially because it's not a traditional developer environment in terms of the kinds of work performed.

Notice my phrasing, "at a good company..." In which I acknowledge that there are crappy ones while relating my own experience that there are places more than happy to employ good developers regardless of their external appearances.

EDIT: I'm also not quite sure how anyone could read my post and think I'm saying "sexism in tech is over". I don't think anyone could or will say that for a long time, I was saying there are good companies out there that will hire people including women if they are good devs.
