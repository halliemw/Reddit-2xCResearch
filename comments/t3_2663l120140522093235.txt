If I were you I'd simply ignore, freedom of expression = he has his right of expressing things you don't like and you can only state your opinion, nothing else. He has his rights of expression so do you. The way I see it is that you are just whining about how you are feeling offended by it. So shutup and suck it up girl. FYI I'm a girl so you won't accuse me of being a "white MRA scum" with too much "male privilege"
