Fellow tall lady here. (6'1"). 

It is harder to find men who are ok with you being tall, which is stupid because it's not like you can choose to be short magically. Tall women bear the brunt of a lot of gendered bullshit that other women don't necessarily, just by virtue of our existence challenging people's ideas about how a woman 'should' look. It's crappy, but there are men out there who will date you for you, whether you're taller than them, shorter, or the same height. 

Don't give up hope, and stay away from the red pill. Those guys are toxic. Keep being who you are and doing things you like, and you'll meet someone if you want to.
