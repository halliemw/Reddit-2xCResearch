Honestly, do you think it would help if there were a class on clothing and its social impact? I don't think most kids understand just how much what they wear colors how people interact with you or layers of sexual dynamics if they even realize how a cut of clothing draws attention. Even a suit can be sexy or cold, and beyond parents not wanting to spend the money on clothes, most people are scared of trying major changes to their fashion as they really have no idea what they're expressing with clothes they've never worn before.
