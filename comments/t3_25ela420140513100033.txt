It's true. There was a time when women were *urged* to breastfeed in public because it kept babies from crying. I don't think it's any coincidence that breastfeeding is only now seen as embarrassing or inappropriate, a generation after most mothers in the US used formula. There was a brief period of time when most mothers didn't breastfeed, and now it's seen as abnormal.
