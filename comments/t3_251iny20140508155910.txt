>He only has had two girlfriends

That's not an excuse. I've had *a* boyfriend before my current boyfriend, but I know what's right and what's wrong. Experience has nothing to do with this; you don't do things that you know will make your SO uncomfortable.

Not that I'm saying you should dump him or anything, I'm just saying that thats not really something that can be used as a defense.
