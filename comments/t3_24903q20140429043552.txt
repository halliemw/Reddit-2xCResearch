That's good to know. I'd still prefer to wait for the Skyla because it's been specifically designed for those who haven't had kids yet. 

I haven't had a great track record with BC (I'm on my third Pill, but everything is fixed now that I'm on this one). 

Thanks for the info, I'll keep it in mind :)
