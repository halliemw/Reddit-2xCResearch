This comment really resonated with me, and got me thinking about a part of my personality that's been there for so long, so deep at the bottom, that I can't remember a time before it was part of me. While I was raised to have good manners, my family is not well-heeled--we're just people. I was taught how to behave at a fancy dinner, and how to be polite to the waitress at a greasy spoon. 

But personality-wise, I've always been ultra-feminine and interested in being polished and poised. When I was a little girl, I loved books and movies set in the Victorian or 50s/60s era. I wanted to wear gloves and hats. I wanted to learn how to speak at the knee of someone like Henry Higgins. I actually taught myself how to walk around with a book balanced on my head. I never could connect with novels where a heroine from a high-bred family bucks against her upbringing...I would have *killed* to be sent to a high-class finishing school, or something like that. To me, it sounded like *fun*.

It occurred to me after reading your comment last night (sorry I didn't respond then, but it was late!) that maybe some of that puts people off. I know I stand and sit very straight--because that's what the antique self-improvement book from 1955 that I found at a garage sale told me to do, and I did it, goddamnit. When I was in high school, kids thought I had an accent--when I grew up down the road from them. I was just interested in speaking well. And sure, maybe I've built a very pretty package for myself, but maybe it's too fancy a package for people to feel comfortable around. Like a dress you love, but never wear because you don't want to ruin it.

So thank you for this insight. It's very interesting *and* potentially useful!
