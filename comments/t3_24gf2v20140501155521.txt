Dude, even a very badly wanted pregnancy is HARD.  It's terrifying, it's physically taxing, it's emotional overload 24/7.  You're uncomfortable, you feel like shit, you're exhausted, and your emotions develop emotions of their own.  I'm 7w right now and I feel you.  Some days I just want to cry because it's too damn much.  My anxiety spins out of control sometimes.  

You definitely need to seek out a counselor and/or a doctor.  This is hard enough on us as it is, and you shouldn't have to suffer.  

It's really, *really* common to develop depression/anxiety issues during pregnancy.  It's something nobody seems to acknowledge or talk about, but it happens - just like post-partum depression happens.  

I'm so sorry you're going through this, but you are not at all alone.  /r/cautiousbb is a great place, and /r/babybumps has a lot of sympathetic folks, too.  But I definitely recommend seeking out your doc and a counselor to help you work through this.  You're not alone. <3
