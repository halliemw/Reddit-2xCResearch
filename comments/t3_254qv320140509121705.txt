When trying to address an issue, it makes sense to be specific in the audience you're addressing, correct? There are lots of campaigns that address specific factions of the population in order to make the most meaningful impact to an individual that might be viewing that poster/ad.  It's not constructive to be generic/faceless with campaigns because it makes them impersonal. Think about political ads during campaign season--they always feature an actor with a personal story, vouching for a candidate. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with placing heavy emphasis on female sex trafficking as they comprise the majority of victims. I think to ignore the very real link between sexism and sex trafficking does an injustice to those girls. That said, of course there are male victims. Why not have many different faces to the campaign to address the different sides of trafficking? 

I don't like the #realmendon'tbuygirls campaign, btw.
