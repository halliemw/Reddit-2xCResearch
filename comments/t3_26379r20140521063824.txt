I don't pretend to understand the complex race issues this article brings up. But from a 'society ideal' perspective i get it. I am very very fair with dark hair and i always get people advising me to go to sun beds or try different tanning products. Im friggin (mostly) irish and i have no desire to look like an oompalumpa. My maternal grandfather died from skin cancer that literally ate his face (im not kidding he had a new nose constructed from forehead skin, new zealand actually pioneered this kind of cosmetic surgery. Kids still ran away from him and called him a monster. For a naturally gregorious man that fuckin sucked) so yeah i don't really give a shit about the beach babe ideal. Im so pale people ask me if i feel ill on a regular basis. But dammit, im not going to risk dying to look how people think i should. People always want what they cant have. So 10000+ points to OP .
