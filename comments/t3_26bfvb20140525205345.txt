Not really sure how to explain it. To me it seems like they are shoving her into a boxed-in role because they're unable to write her character to actually have any depth. Not that she doesn't have some depth, but it bothers me that the female characters are basically the caretakers of the guys on the show; forcing Bernadette's character into the "mother" role just makes her character have less...diversity, I guess is the best way to put it. There are lots of different types, personalities, etc. of women and the writers can only seem to write for one kind.
