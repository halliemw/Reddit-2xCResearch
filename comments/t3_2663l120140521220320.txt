I recently read something (on reddit) that said people respond more to differing opinions when you appeal to their emotional side. I am, among friends, a pretty blunt person. In my circle there is a unbalance of men and women, with the men outnumbering my fellow ladies. So, I can relate because sensitive topics like this can tend to be laughed off. I've learned to navigate these waters well, and I think there is hope for you yet.  If you can't get through directly, try an indirect approach.  

I'm not sure the inner workings of the club but maybe suggest any comics shared are shared with the understanding that if someone wishes to discuss it further as a group- they can. Instead of Mr.Uppity getting private talking to's. And of course, this goes for mainstream work as well, so no artist feels singled out. Ask to incorporate an "open discussion" situation. People should be able to express themselves freely without fear of shunning. Clubs shouldn't feel like a professional environment where you must go to "higher ups" to voice concerns. You don't have to vote anyone off the island, or banish yourself. I honestly suggest you bring it up in the next gathering. And frankly, any artist willing to share there work should be expected to handle **constructive** criticism.
