I can back this up.  I had one in October, and it took me up until about early April for me to feel normal and okay again.  What would have been my due date just recently passed, and I felt a little sadness about the situation, but I finally felt okay.  I also second your recommendation to talk to someone understanding, it helps so so much to get that load off of your chest.
