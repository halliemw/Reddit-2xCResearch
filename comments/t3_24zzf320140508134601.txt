Unfortunately I can't speak from the perspective of a woman, but I work in a professional environment and know the feel of both being younger than those you work with and looking even younger, as well as the need to demonstrate confidence in your opinion and work, while constantly being moved around and meeting/working for other people.

It seems like you just have a healthy level of concern, which is a good sign because it shows you care. Being slightly nervous and having some concern is by far better than walking in and thinking you own the place.

Sometimes people like to make comments such as the chewed up and spit out because it makes them sound like a battle-hardened veteran or wiser. This may even just be to get you to shake in your boots a little so you get over it quicker. I wouldn't read into comments like this too much.

Continue to do your best to learn your new job every day and the confidence will follow. For me, I always feel a bit shut-in for the first month or so as I'm taking in all the new information, meeting new people, etc. Once I get more comfortable with the daily routine, I open up more, and the confidence follows.

If you want a few tips, there are a few things that I've found that have helped me along the way. Personally I've found that if you're confident in your abilities, it'll always come through eventually. Its gaining other's respect that is the most important.

* Slow down your speech and pause a lot. You don't need to rifle out all your ideas as fast as possible. Calm, collected, and slow. This really demonstrates confidence and intelligence.

* Be patient and let people talk. If you give people the time to speak their mind, uninterrupted, it shows you care about and respect their ideas. Never cut people off.

* Keep eye contact with those you are talking to. This demonstrates you will give them your undivided attention.

* You can drop the ego and still be confident. There doesn't always have to be a winner and a loser, someone right and someone wrong. There can be two great, valid ideas that simply come from two competing schools of thought. If you're wrong, admit it. If someone introduces a fact that you didn't previously consider, admit it. Dropping the ego is important to be able to work with people as a team.
