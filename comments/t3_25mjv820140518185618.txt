If someone has actually said to you "I do not like your breasts".... well, that is a very mean and rude thing to say regardless of how they said it. If you pestered them into saying it, that's a little different, I suppose. 

I have very saggy breasts as well. I used to hate them but I have lived with them for long enough now that I'm used to them. Buying really good bras has helped, as has my current boyfriend who loves my boobs.

One more thing that helped: /r/saggy 

Full of women with saggy boobs that the men there love. Have a look around and I bet you'll find an example that look like yours... or if you're feeling bold, post a picture under a throwaway :)
