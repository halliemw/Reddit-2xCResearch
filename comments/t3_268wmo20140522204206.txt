There is a wonderful video with Nina Hartley with some good practical tips and ideas.  It does take practice though.  Your partner is not going to just start out an expert, and you won't know what you like at first either.  Communication is key.  Something that I had to work out with my husband when we dating was that he would want to quickly get to the oral sex so that we could move on to penetration, or "real sex".  I didn't enjoy it as much because I wasn't anticipating it all, and my having an orgasm is all about headspace.  You may need more foreplay to be aroused enough to really enjoy oral.  Set a timer for 10-15 min and then see how you respond.  You can't compare yourself to the ladies in the videos either.  You may just not enjoy oral that much.  It's ok, you may go for other things.  Not everyone likes chocolate either.  It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.  I would think of it like a treasure hunt.  You get to discover together what you each enjoy together for the first time.  That's pretty exciting.
