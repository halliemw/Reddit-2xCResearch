I waited until I was 18 to do PIV sex. Had oral when I was 14 - definitely peer pressured into it by sexually active group of friends. Other people mentioned the control issue. I think you should explain to her how not having sex until she truly feels like a woman, truly ready to be a woman and what that means to her (ask her what she thinks milestones of being a woman are besides having sex). It can give her back that sense of control. 

I remember at 17 feeling "Im ready for sex" but the guy I was dating..he was kind of a flake. Didnt seem to care about me or my feelings very much. Didnt care how I felt if he didnt call. That type of thing. I just felt in my gut he would be the wrong guy to lose it to. The next guy I dated when I was 18 - we werent in love or anything at all - but he treated me well, was respectful, cared about my feelings and followed through on plans and promises. I knew I wanted to do it with him and it was a great first time and though we separated a few months later, I never once regretted the decision and THAT has been very empowering for me. Very proud of myself for choosing the right guy and doing everything in my power to make it a positive introduction to my adult sexual life.
