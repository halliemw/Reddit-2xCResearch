The sacrosanct is undoubtedly cultural. probably down to the need to keep the peasants from killing themselves to escape their miserable existence. 

You have probably heard of Frankl's book, "Man's search for meaning". He really lived on that "event horizon" between life and death. most people around him were the walking dead. (I know I would have been) but some were survivors. He was a scientist, and he wanted to know what made the survivors different. (That's real science, considering his circumstance). Sometimes, I look at some humans, and see transcendence. They seem so much more than animal, and that gives me some sort of hope. Then I see the apes at a football match, and feel despair. 

Given that the universe is just a huge expression of frequencies, inflating faster than the speed of light, and reality is of necessity simply a construct of the mind, I honestly try not to be too certain about stuff, but it is absolutely feasible that we exist outside of matter. Not our personality, or memories, they are physical. but our concious awareness, that may immortal. (not what I want, I might add, I am a big fan of the big sleep). 

Here is the thing. time is not actually real, essentially. it is relative. Light that is travelling from the big bang to earth, 13.8 Billion light years, arrives instantaneously, from the perspective of the light. (if it had one. that blows my mind.)

Sorry. I don't get out much. I get stupid when I perceive I am communicating with intelligent or insightful people. I have paid people to listen, that worked out really well. (They were professionals, not some guy in a bar.)
