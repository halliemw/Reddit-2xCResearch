Wow.  Is it really that bad?  I would love to know where your figure comes from and I promise I am not being an ass about it.  I get into debates where this could be really useful.

>Really, victims should go for both, but I believe there is a legal issue where you're essentially forced to choose and are unable to do both. Something like police will not investigate when a Title IX case is on going.

I don't understand this at all.  It seems to me that both parties are being denied their due process if the school handles it, and I don't understand why would anyone choose the school as we have seen in the past schools siding with the accused over and over again.
