I find the punch down fold pops open easier, but if you run your finger around the cup once you've inserted it and turned it (yes, that's a pain! I have to pinch the base between two fingertips and nearly dislocate my wrist, I think I'm doing it wrong), you should feel that it's opened into a nice round cup shape (i.e. the cup shape has gone). 

Mine sits quite high too, which is annoying because my cervix is lower at the start of my period, meaning the cup leaks a little when it's nearly full because the cervix displaces the cup's contents. 

Use a kegel to squeeze it down and grasp as soon as you can feel the base. Carry on pushing down as you pull and wait for that oddly satisfying squelch noise :)
