Seems like you're making way too big of a deal about it... It was prom night and she made out with her boyfriend even though "boys aren't allowed upstairs" I could understand you being upset if they were having sex on your bed, because that can get messy and you probably don't want to sleep on that. But why so upset about her making out with her boyfriend on prom night? Kinda lame that you told your parents and got her in trouble. Doesn't seem like what friends do, maybe you two should rethink your relationship?
