this is so lovely. thanks for sharing. I feel like getting to reflect upon the joy I have with my lover is a) too good to be true, sometimes and b) fodder for resentment and underhandedness on the parts of those who don't have it so good (which is generally not about having it bad, but a lack of the self-awareness that is pretty pervasive in society when it comes to relationships and entitlement and I feel like a huge big jerk just typing THAT out). but yes, more happies, PLEASE! it's so refreshing to hear about good relationships.
