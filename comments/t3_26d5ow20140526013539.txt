I started my period at 9 years old, and after 18 years of periods, I've never had a regular natural cycle. Birth control fixed that for me, but my doctors did tests and found nothing wrong with me. It could just be the way your hormones work and it is completely natural... *or* it could be something that needs to be addressed. Only your doctor will be able to rule it one way or the other.
