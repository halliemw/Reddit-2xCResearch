Don't forget the am I pregnant? Is my vagina weird? Do I have an STD? and let me tell you a one sided story about my relationship posts. 

Especially the latter, with over 100 comments from people who only have one side of a story and no knowledge of OP's relationship saying, "break up with him, divorce him, that's abuse, he's a worthless piece of shit and you're perfect."
