I would be pretty annoyed by this. I used to work in a clothing store where the manager and district manager used to say "a little lip gloss goes a long way!" and it would annoy me to no end. Wearing makeup doesn't make you look less professional. You only need to be properly groomed (no messy hair, no dirty nails etc) in order to be presentable and professional. 

It sounds awfully 1960's to me.
