While mace and a switch blade aren't inherently bad ideas, consider how telling a target of sexual harassment to carry weapons puts the responsibility to not be harassed in her hands. If she was harassed again, the first question would be "well, why didn't you defend yourself?" Being forced to carry a switch blade is less empowering and more dehumanizing.
