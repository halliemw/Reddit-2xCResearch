Feeling alone and completely isolated by language is a hard spot to be in! 

So vent your little heart out! 

To me, it doesn't seem like a divorce/career change is necessary, but something needs to change for you to be happy.

SO many people say that they would loveeeee to work from home. I did it for 4 months and hated it. I chose to be unemployed rather than make bunches of money (for my age). My work involved many confidential documents that meant I had to work from home on my secured network. Is your job something you can do from a cafe with a laptop? Maybe even a public library? That way you can kill two birds with one stone-get out and get work done. I've also heard of groups for people that work from home and get together for lunches perhaps you could find something like that? 

Being an expat is hard, but you don't have to do it alone. Try your cities subreddit/meetup groups and try to connect with people who are going through something similar. 

I'm currently an expat SO, following my boyfriend. His company offers tons of stuff for the husbands and wives that are displaced because of their spouses. They do events for all sorts of interest groups and there are always interesting people there. Maybe your husband could talk to his boss/HR and see of there is something you can get involved in there. 

Most importantly talk to your husband! Let him know you love him, support him, and am trying to be there for him but it's very hard for you at the moment. Try to work out a game plan for how you can both make things improve for you. 

Ask him to reach out to his colleagues and see if they have any spouses that wouldn't mind meeting up with you (expat or native Italian , either work). I rolled my eyes the first few times my SO suggested it because it felt like he was setting me up on play dates, but in the end I was so grateful to meet a lot of intelligent, talented, beautiful women.

I'm wishing you all the best, OP!!
