A family friend of mine died of cancer a year ago. Her kids were 4 and 7. Before she went, she took the whole family to get lots of professional photos taken together, and a bunch of her on her own. She then got photos of herself printed onto comfy cushions, one for each of her children. I thought that was a really nice idea.
