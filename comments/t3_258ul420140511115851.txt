Are you in an abstinence-only state? Do you know what your state dept. of Ed recommends? Or does your school administration or event the teacher set the curriculum? In the US, politics is determining what children are taught in sex ed, or even if public schools are teaching sex ed. Has nothing to do with public health or science for most states and districts, has everything to do with which political party is running the show. 

If it is the school district's choice, are your parents the kind willing to make a stink about the bad job your teacher is doing in creating curriculum? School board needs an education of their own then. But then YOU and YOUR family become the subject of vicious attacks, nasty backstabbing, letters to the editor and general abuse by the righties. 

The good news is you have Google and can research on your own. The bad news is this crap is getting taught to your peers.
