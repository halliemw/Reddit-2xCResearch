She's great in the animated Justice League cartoon in contrast with the other characters. I like her a lot in that. She really is a cool character, but we're talking about a feature film which would probably have her origin story. Her support characters kind of fucking suck.  I don't think they will make a feature with her though especially considering how slow DC has been with releasing blockbusters.

I mean I find movies about Greek mythology to be boring so that probably has to do with my opinion.  If they were really smart they could make it work but considering their track record, I doubt it.
