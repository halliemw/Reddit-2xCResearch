Women dating men they think they can save is a well-known trope as well.

It seems to me that assuming a person who says they find a traumatic past attractive has a fetish, to the point where we imply that it is the singular characteristic they are looking for, is also reductive. More so, even.

I can say I like redheads or strong women without reducing my partner to only those things.
