I was in a relationship a few years back where I was out of work and taking care of the house and running errands like it sounds you are. It was a little difficult for me in similar ways sometimes.

I started looking for a full time job and my partner at the time seemed uncomfortable with the idea. What I finally fished out of them is that they preferred I stayed at home, they enjoyed the cleanliness, security, and comfort of my constant presence more than the meager wage I would bring home.

I am not sure it was best for ME at the time, I was in a very strange place...but looking back I realize how my emotional turmoil was just feeling unfulfilled personally and having a lot of free time. Knowing what I know now and being more mature emotionally, I could definitely fare better in a similar situation.

So... take heart! Try to do what is best for you, everything will work out.
