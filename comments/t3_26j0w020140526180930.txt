>To let him know that he was not alone, and not unique in suffering indignation at the hands of women while trying to vie for their attention.

Didn't Rodger interact with plenty of like-minded people on those appallingly misogynistic PUA forums he frequented?

>I hope that people would learn from such tragedies and show more compassion towards others. Especially women, because it is to you that men look to for comfort and compassion.

I'm sorry, but this ridiculous. You are putting part of the blame for a mass murder on the women who Rodger believed had rejected him (we don't even know if they did). While it is right to always look at the social context, the moral responsibility is all on him.
