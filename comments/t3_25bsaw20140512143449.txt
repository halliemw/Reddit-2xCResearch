I have a painful condition that is often poorly treated, misunderstood, is invisible, and is often considered to be "not real" by people. Anyone who has known someone with severe fibromyalgia understands how debilitating it can be, yet we get no empathy from doctors, no pain relief or real treatment, and everyone assumes that if you're in pain you just aren't "trying hard enough" to get better. 

I have thought about killing myself so many times because I don't know if I can deal with this much pain AND this much shame for the rest of my life. I'm so alone and everyone makes me feel so guilty for not being able to do it all. They just don't get it.
