I had my first child at my Indian reservation's public health facility. Went in after water broke. They said was only 1 cm and said I wouldn't have the baby until the next day and sent my husband home. they even put me in a non maternity room. Pains picked up and by about 3am I was in a lot of pain but nurses kept saying the doctor would be back at 6am and he could check my progress then. I was convinced I would die before then but toughed it out alone in the room determined not to be a wimp. Then, in the midst of a big contraction, I felt a huge movement and pressure and hollered for a nurse. Baby's head visible. Then it turned into chaos. One nurse bringing a wheelchair to get me to delivery, another screaming at her that she was a dumbass for bringing a wheelchair when baby's head was visible, me hollering at another nurse to call my husband back to the hospital, and the ER doc I had never met before delivering my baby on the fly. Add an episiotomy to that plus a hastily placed IV blowing out of my arm with that added spray of blood and permanent scar that makes me look like a hardcore junkie and that birthing experience was pretty damn magical
