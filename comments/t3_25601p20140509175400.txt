Take another pregnancy test if you are concerned about a potential pregnancy.  It's hard to know what is going on, and it may just be odd change in your hormonal cycle, due to stress, weight gain, weight loss, etc.  It may or may not happen again- it's really hard to say.

I have implanon as birth control for almost a year when I had problems a few months ago.  I had bleeding for the entire month and pretty bad cramps.  I saw a medical professional on a weekly basis & she didn't have any answers.  She encouraged me to get checked out for cysts if I continued to have long & painful bleeding, but the next month, it was fine.  So that's basically my advice to you, wait to see if this continues & if it does, investigate further.
