I think maybe you need to question his motives for getting into this long distance relationship. Did he really want a proper relationship? He made changes to his life to bring you two together, but are you sure he didn't have serious intimacy issues?

It seems like everything was going great til you met in person. I can understand how you would think that it was your appearance that put him off (you describe yourself and pretty but chubby, so while I don't think you're a mass of insecurities, it seems you have some worries about your appearance). But what if he just has a problem with real intimacy?

I'm sure he convinced you and himself that he wanted a real relationship. People with intimacy problems still get lonely. But it sounds to me like he has some problems to work through and it's nothing to do with you. This relationship started long distance, but I think he got uncomfortable when things got too real life.

Don't feel bad about yourself. There's no way he couldn't have known what you looked like - you said the pictures were clear. You don't need to see below the waist to tell someone's body type. 

Do what ever you need to do to feel sexy again. Get dressed up, wear sexy underwear even if no one will see it and pamper yourself. Forget about this guy. Sorry he wasn't what you hoped he would be.
