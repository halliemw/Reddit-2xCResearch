There have been a lot of great comments so far and I don't want to repeat too much, so to the sports thing I'll add try horseback riding - long legs are a huge benefit, plus riding builds an incredible amount of confidence/maturity because you're in control of a 1200lb animal.  
Also, if she's having trouble finding jeans that fit (was a huge problem for me for a long time and I'm 5'7) designer jeans with a longer inseam (Rock and Republic, Joes, Citizens) might be worth the splurge to boost her confidence.
