>As long as you are respectful about it (DON'T pester the police...it seems like common sense, but you would be surprised how many people do) more than often they will be receptive and try to let you know what's going on.

This is where I see a problem. Cops are not meant to be drama queens. Every single person in a job gets pestered on a regular basis. She has been sexually assaulted and she is expected to not "pester" them.. Hell, if I'd been assaulted, I'd be pestering a lot, especially if they seemingly ignored my case.
