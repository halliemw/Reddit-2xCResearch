TL;DR- I was in a somewhat similar situation and it worked out. But not without a SERIOUS conversation, constant reminders, and some major changes in my (and my bf's) behaviors. 

I was feeling disrespected and as though I was more invested in the relationship than he was. I would go out of my way to visit him, accommodate his preferences, and work around HIS schedule with HIS friends. And he would not provide me with the same considerations. 

I became withdrawn and bitter, but eventually a straw broke the camel's back and I told him what was bothering me by reading it from a letter (I knew I would stutter and lose my words if I didn't have it on paper in front of me). 

He was completely clueless. Had no idea he was doing those things and had no idea how it made me feel. In the next few months he made changes - seeing me more often, not rescheduling our dates around times his buddies spontaneously wanted to hang out, bringing me "just because" flowers. And I started being more open about what I wanted from him - communicating more often to him how I felt and reacting VERY positively when he did something that made me happy. (...Blow jobs. I gave him blow jobs.)

It's been two years since then and even though I sometimes find myself being more complacent than I should be (and he sometimes finds himself being more inconsiderate than he should be), we both are still together and still make the effort to correct these things in ourselves on a consistent basis. And it's been working out pretty well :)

Have a talk with your dude. If he's receptive and promises to change things, promise him you'll also be more open in the future about what you want from this relationship.
