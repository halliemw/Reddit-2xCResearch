I don't understand why colleges are expected to handle criminal cases like this, but wouldn't be called upon to handle homicide or other serious crimes. 

Let law enforcement take it. If there is not enough evidence for conviction, then appeal to the school to review and decide if there is enough evidence to removed the accused.
