Well, here comes a rant...

This is typical small town school politics run amok. Conservative districts  are influenced by the surrounding society- it's very likely that teachers and kids attend churches in a place like this and that churches influence the local social systems-and it comes down to a teacher who subscribes to the "punish the girl (and in this case her child too) for having sex" belief system being a holy hypocrite on facebook (though I do realize there is no express mention of the teacher's religion or lack of- it just isn't a stretch, because the idea that this girl is setting a bad example is definitely connected to the fact that she had sex, and the child is the evidence of such on display- these are the ways that a small minded and heavily religious community perceive a young woman who becomes a mother while still in high school.   As if leaving her name out of your post makes a difference! 

Thankfully, there was no facebook when I was a kid in a podunk school district in the 1980s. I knew teachers like this one. I was made to go to church, and there were two little busy body teachers there who were terribly concerned for my soul (and my hymen) when I was at school. 

Edit: I know I'm going off in several directions at once, but I think the religiosity of a location affects even those who don't attend the churches, since there is a push to spread the particular vision of morality that is held by these groups, and they have a lot of influence on small towns and often schools.
