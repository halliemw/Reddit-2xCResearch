Alright, good. If I have to deal with them staying the same that's fine. I just can't handle anything worse. My boyfriend used to be one of those guys who thought periods were a walk in the park and made comments about it. Once he saw me with mine he felt like shit about doing that. We just barely started dating when it came unexpectedly. I was crying because the cramps were so bad. So held me and rubbed my tummy and fed me pasta and that's when I realized I was marrying this man one day. Haha.
