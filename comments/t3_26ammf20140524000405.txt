I'm American, so this may be wrong.

There's a local 2 year school (a community/junior college in the US) that has a lot of coursework for higher functioning individuals with LDs. As far as I can tell they don't earn a degree and the classes are mostly geared around adult social interaction, job training, and transitioning to living on their own.
