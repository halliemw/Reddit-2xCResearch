This is exactly what I do. I've owned my fattiness lol. I'm fun and flirty and that's what gets me dates. Unfortunately I'm more of a flirt than I realize and I'm super open about everything. This leads me to many men just looking for sex. Which I have taken advantage of but now that I want more than that... Hard to break old habits.
