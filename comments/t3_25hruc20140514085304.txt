1. Red pill is no joke. Stay away from there. 

2. I'll come out at say it, you probably should have started hunting at 22. And I'll tell you why, TRULY GOOD PEOPLE ARE VERY HARD TO COME BY. Oh yeah, you can go out and have a bunch of encounters a la Sex and the City. You can party, you can get drunk and dance the night away. You can do anything you want, but by the time you get out here (30s) age is against you. 

I made that mistake, I had many fun years where it was just me me me. Then by the time I hit 27, I looked around and wondered "WHERE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SERIOUS." I kept finding more of the same, people looking for good times. All the good ones were taken because, I'll tell you this right now, a good catch will not stay on the market for long. 

For a moment there, I was seriously worried. I found my catch, but I spent many nights full of regret. If I would have known how hard it was to find a good person, I would have not spent my younger years just messing around. Your mileage my vary. But that was very stupid of me, I was expecting a good catch to fall in my lap simply because I had reached a point where I was all partied out. From 27 to 29 was filled with regret because I was serious and not a person was to be found. 

I did get my break, but it was sheer luck. Something as important as a lifetime partner should NOT be banked on luck. 

Of course, it's not over, you can catch a break. But all I'm saying is most people will kiss a million frogs before they find their prince(ss). That takes time, years even. Its a process that should be knowingly started early, because it's a lengthy one. Even though I got lucky, if I could do it all over again, I would have started seriously looking at 21. Because I have no doubt it would take me at least 5 years to find someone who was a good fit.
