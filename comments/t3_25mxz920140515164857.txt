Guy here, not sure if I'm welcome. I guess I'm answering because it's not just women who have "second thoughts" so I felt maybe I could chime in.

You're talented, go to Bali, to and do it because simply put if you don't, you're going to wonder... what if.

Chase your passion, chase the art that you love. It may not lead down the easiest road and I can't promise you that it will work out. What I can hope (not promise) for you is that it leads to bigger and better things.

DO IT :) and someday hopefully you'll relay this story to someone who's in the same position as you were and give them the little push they need on their journey.
