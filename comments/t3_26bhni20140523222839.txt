My mind is blown (not in a bad way). I've always felt like my life was missing something, a relationship gap that seemed like it would never be filled. I've always felt like a little brother without a big brother. Maybe this kind of relationship would fill the gap? I had never considered the domestic dynamic of a poly relationship before either, more help for chores! Although i have 10x the libido of my wife so not sure how that would work out. Who knows, maybe it would bring her out of her shell.
