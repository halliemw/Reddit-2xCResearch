I had something like this happen when I was 12, when I was walking to my grandmother's house. Unfortunately I didn't have a bag of dog poop, however my 90lbs German Shepard tried to lunge through the window. It was really disturbing to me, and I'm super wary of people pulling up to me in cars since. But I still giggle like mad every time I remember the look on his face when my dog went into "MURDER!DEATH!KILL!" mode.
