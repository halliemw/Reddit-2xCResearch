>I could see how it would be frustrating to point out a blatantly sexist situation and to be demonized because people want to split hairs

All the downvotes she's getting is ridiculous, but I don't think all the comments are just splitting hairs. Sexism in fandom is a complex issue--the multiple connotations of the word "fangirl," the histories of each connotation, the fact that gender is automatically applied to "fangirl" and "fanboy," the histories of sexism in each individual fandom and the way they interact at multi-fandom events like big cons, how the shirt relates to that particular con--and I think it deserves to be dissected as much as possible. After all, can you really call the overall pop culture and fiction fandom a "particular community?" There are so many different communities contained under the banner of "fandom."
