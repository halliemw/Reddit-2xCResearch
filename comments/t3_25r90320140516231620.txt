It's not just that. I've noticed significantly more downvoting happening than before. Even this post, just asking a simple question, or wanting some discussion on a topic, is heavily downvoted (to an extent that can't be accounted for by Reddit's vote algorithm). 

It's like people in /all see the posts and downvote it automatically because it's from this subreddit (oh no, women are trying to post about woman stuff). Or they come to the "new" queue of 2x and downvote everything they see. 

Sure, other subreddits have their fair share of trolls, and people are abused all the time. But people in this subreddit are being targeted for abuse *because they are women*.
