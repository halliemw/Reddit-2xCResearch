But this issue doesn't only effect women. Every man, woman, or child ever born on planet earth has had to deal with verbal abuse like that. It's not a sexist thing, it's a natural part of human behavior. I don't agree with it, I think that it's terrible. It's a reality though for everyone. I don't like that this article seems to only address this issue with women. It makes a sexist argument where there really isn't one. Men call men 'bitchs' and a plethora of other derogatory things. I just get this poor me vibe from this article when I go through the same crap as a man.
