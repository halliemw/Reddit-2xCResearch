I have Higher functioning autism, dyspraxia and dysgraphia [and epilepsy! thanks brain, way to go. stellar job you're doing up there.] Luckily, i was diagnosed when i was quite young, and my parents were also super supportive.

Something interesting i realised a few years back - the part of my brain that should pick up on social cues doesn't do its thing automatically, but that doesn't make interaction impossible... I function on manual, constantly keeping an eye out for the usual triggers and keys in conversation and responding as expected when i spot them. it doesn't work 100%, but i'm much better than i once was... and keeping my ears sharp for that sort of thing also makes me good at wit. 'oh, they said xyz! you can say that funny thing you read/thought about a few weeks ago!'

I guess I'm kind of rambling here... but yeah. conversation is a bewildering jungle, but with practice and training you can learn to navigate it.
