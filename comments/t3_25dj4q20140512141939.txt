Among some progressive/liberal people, there's an idea that you can't criticize a member of a minority/oppressed group for their actions or beliefs, because your own privilege makes you blind to their situation and an inappropriate judge of their behavior.  While this is in some ways a good and important issue to be cautious and thoughtful about, it can also produce absurd and damaging outcomes in situations like this where it goes unexamined.
