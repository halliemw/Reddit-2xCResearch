If you sent save-the-date and then find out your budget is too small you call and explain you can't invite them. Personally. 

Do you even understand what saving the date implies? Often, taking a holiday day off and locking 2-3 days from anything else. In summer, prime holiday time. It's already an invitation to make sure people can attend , but misses the details (like venue , times etc ) because those are set a tad later.
