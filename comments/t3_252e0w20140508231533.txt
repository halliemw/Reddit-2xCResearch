I think in this case, in a world where rape is still a huge epidemic, where rape culture is very real, I think it is. I don't think it always have to make some grand statement, but if you're gonna use rape over and over again to show how normalized it was back then, that's exactly what's gonna happen to the reader: they're going to become normalized to it, they're gonna stop caring because it's happened 50 other times in the novels. Then, if there was any sort of message to begin with, it gets completely lost.
