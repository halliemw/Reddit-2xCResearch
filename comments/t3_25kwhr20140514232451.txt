I'm pretty sure we just got a shitload of downvote happy trolls since this sub became defaulted. Notice how every comment in this thread alone is being downvoted to hell for no reason. 

I kind of want the mods to remove the downvote button just so it's just a little more difficult for the masses to do so.
