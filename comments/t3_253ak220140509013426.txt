I too was flashed once...I laughed. Erm I'm sure it was just too chilly for him.

The thing is I'm tall and lanky and a minority and I stick out so I try to conceal myself. Half of it is to hide my minority status so there are less things to yell at me about. The catcalling thing is one aspect of my life. The minority thing is another. Even if I didn't have the catcalling, I would still hood up to deter some of the hate.

Honestly, I think I get this worn down because I get hate on multiple aspects. I think I would handle one, but multiple is overwhelming

(Also I love how people keep putting the disclaimer that they aren't professionals, when some of the worst advise I got was from professionals.)
