Seriously, what was that judge thinking? This whole thing seems completely wrong. It seems like this judge is trying to say that there are some cases that 'aren't so bad' or something. And apparently they felt this one was so 'understandable' that this man should do his community service in the most inappropriate option possible. If this judge would've really seem this case severely there is no way they wouldn've picked a rape crisis center.
