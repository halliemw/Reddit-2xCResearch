You should come hang out on r/loseit.  There's a lot of good motivation to be had there, and lots of good advice.  

You could jumpstart things just by hopping onto MyFitnessPal or LoseIt! to start counting calories.  Put in your applicable stats, and it will give you a caloric goal based on how quickly you want to lose weight.  

Good luck!
