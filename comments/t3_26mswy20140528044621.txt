Hmm, in much of the romance kind of plots I've seen, the evil dude is either the macho jock or the "boring business" type, and the more sensitive shy type of person will be the one getting the douche's girlfriend at the end. However, while shy, the more sensible guy does have a persistence... like holding up a boombox near the window of his love interest at night.
