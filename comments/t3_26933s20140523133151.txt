I run a code camp that attracts about 500 people each year.  A few years back we tried to have a "Business Track", incorporating business oriented track for project managers and business types.

The feedback was simply: We don't want to be seen in a public setting with developers...they make us uncomfortable.

Side note: I'm a guy, I also get this all the time.
