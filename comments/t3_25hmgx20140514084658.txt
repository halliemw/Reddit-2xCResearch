I had a teacher that was a literal communist, which obviously inst the same thing but I confronted her constantly about it (in a constructive way) by debating when the issue came up. Ended up being one of the best classes i ever took. In your case I would wait until AFTER grades were official then use some of that energy from your beauty sleep to complain like hell
