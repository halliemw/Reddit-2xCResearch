The thing is, it's hardly ever intended as a compliment, because people usually have enough sense to know it won't be perceived as a compliment.

A catcall is more like entertainment for the catcaller. It's like trolling irl. I hope that makes sense to you. They want a funny rise out of an innocent person. That's been my experience anyway. I've talked to several of my catcallers and that's the answer I get usually, or they were just raised that way and don't see it as an unusual thing, but no one has ever said it was a genuine compliment.

Now with that being said, from the receiver's perspective, it's definitely not flattering. It's more like, you're hearing someone vocalize their intent to hurt you. I know that may not make sense to you right now, but think on it.

If you were vulnerable and were afraid of being hurt physically, and people kept indicating that they might want to hurt you, you would mind. Especially if these people were bigger than you, you didn't do anything, it's the first time it's happened, you didn't expect it, you're just on your way to work or you're just trying to get groceries, etc. I know you don't see a catcall as an indication that someone wants to hurt someone, you see it as a compliment, but you're looking at it from a different perspective.

If a stranger walked up to me and told me politely "You're gorgeous", I would take that as a compliment.

If a stranger, from the other side of the train yelled "You're gorgeous", i would take that not as a compliment, but rather as something somewhat threatening, embarrassing, and possibly alarming.

You're right, it's not the end of the world, but it's also not okay. Because you never know which instance might escalate to the end of your happiness and possibly the end of your life. It's not the end of the world, it's more like a possible bad omen.

Does that make sense?
