It's been a rough year honestly, and I haven't had much free time lately. The result, is me having a day alone in my thoughts and having some big ups and downs.

I ended a relationship I'd been in for 7 years a couple months ago which ultimately will be great, and I have really been doing pretty awesome in spite of that recently, but it's still hard. Lots of more responsibility at work, which is ultimately good - but overwhelming since it's still new. Saw my parents today and that's always awesome, but my father has a long term/incurable issue that wasn't too bad today but it's always hard to see him struggle some. Also, today, had the ex call, which I didn't want to deal with on top of everything.

I also have not actually sat down and watched a good cry-ish movie (like I said, I'm not overly familiar with many) since the break up... so it's a long time coming.

So ultimately, a happy cry is ideal - though lovey is good too.
