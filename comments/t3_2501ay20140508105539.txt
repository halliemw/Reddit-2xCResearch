Oh okay I disagree fundamentally with everything you are saying in that case.

She has accurately perceived him as a threat because he has done several threatening things:

1) took compromising picture without permission
2) was reluctant to delete said image
3) was defensive about his right to take and have said image
4) has not apologized for the above
5) had not sought OP to discuss the above.

This guy is obviously shitty, and completely undeserving of the sympathy and self-sacrificing kindness you think OP owes him.

So yeah we disagree utterly and completely.
