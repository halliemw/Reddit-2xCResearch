1) She is in counseling though currently inconsistent due to her insurance. She is committed though and pursues it. I definitely agree that I can't be her counsel for this.
2) This is an interesting one and a hard one. We openly talk about this and it has led to some good but hard discussions.
3) I ended up writing this post because of the mood swings for the past five  days at that point and I didn't know how to reach her and communicate my love to her when she is for lack of a better term rageing. I am definitely aware that this will be hard. I am also aware that I love her deeply. When I put on the engagement ring to me I was symbolizing for better or worse. Thank you for the reminder of my need to keep up support.
