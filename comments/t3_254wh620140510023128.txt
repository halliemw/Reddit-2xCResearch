I agree with your belief that discussing things helps you better understand and flesh out, but *no one here asked that this place become a debate club*. Its just a place where ladies can be silly ladies, smart ladies, serious ladies, hurting ladies. I don't want to have to guard my every comment for fear that someone is going to jump down my throat. I do that in all the other subs (for certain topics), please let us have just this one sub where we can speak like we do with our friends.

A lot of people want this place to be a place for ignorant users to be educated on the female perspective. That sounds like an amazing idea! Why not make a brand new subreddit that exists for exactly that purpose, and any women that choose to become those educators can press the "subscribe" button and engage in such discussions.
