I've had a ex literally cringe when I tried to touch him, even though he was very attracted to me, because he decided my desire for affection and personality wasn't what he wanted. It was humiliating and hurtful in way that said little about me, and everything about him. You put yourself in a vulnerable place, and got rejected. It's crushing, but not because it indicates something about you or your faults, but about the situation. 

You are not repulsive, he was not attracted to you. He didn't love you, he loved the idea of you, and when you didn't fit that idea (which could have happened in so many ways, unrelated to your appearance) he was cruel. Everyone has different tastes, that's fine. What is not fine was the way he treated you and the way he acted. You dodged a bullet. You don't have to deal with him anymore, so don't let his meanness guide how you feel about yourself in the present.
