My last semester of undergrad, I had to take 18 credit hours to graduate on time (due to my own and my advisor's lack of attention to how my credit hours transferred from my first college) and it was a nightmare - all-nighters, gym classes at 8AM across campus(seriously WHY), online courses that required volunteering, etc.  But I did better than I had in almost my entire college career and made the Dean's List.

My point is, if my lazy ass can do it, you all will be AWESOME.  Hang in there and allow yourself to do some serious partying when you're done!!!! :-)
