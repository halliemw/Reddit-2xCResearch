Its not gender specific either, which is why I really dont have an issue with it. The opposite gender generally sees things as "cute" when they aren't associated with your gender. 

I'm a guy, my main hobby is cooking and I'm extremely in to it. "Aww, thats so cute" is probably the most common response I get from women after I tell them.

Girl who works on cars? Probably cute. Guy who enjoys dancing? Cute. Cat that plays fetch? Cute. Dog that is afraid of water? Cute.
