If he withheld a reference it might be considered harassment.   Notice how you have to keep adding a new action to make what happens actually harassment?  You have to do that because what happened here ....was creepy because she wasn't into him.....but certainly not the same as groping her crotch, which she compared it to.

I feel you are being ignorant to women who are being actually sexually assaulted when you intentionally conflate the two to exaggerate his actions.
