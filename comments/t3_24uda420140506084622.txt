This is going to be an unpopular sentiment, but why should your mutual friends have to choose between the two of you?

Neither of you cheated on each other (I'm guessing you guys had an open or polyamorous relationship).  While the both of you did not end on good terms (how many relationships do), it's not always that there's one villain and one victim in a break up.  While the reason your friend gave is bullshit, I'd say ignore it/them, and move on.  Keep them if they're important to you, or find new friends if they're not.

Also, you didn't mention any physical or verbal abuse.  My sentiments would change in that situation.
