Clearly nursing makes you uncomfortable, since you've compared it to public urination. Which happens every time this issue is discussed on default subs, for some reason I will never understand. So you're saying that because it's a bodily function (JUST like peeing!), other people's opinions matter because that function can be regulated. And my point is, because breastfeeding is currently legal pretty much everywhere (at least where I live in CA), probably because it nourishes a baby, it does not matter what other people think about it. A nursing mom has better things to think about.
