I don't know that this is the case for you, but sometimes insecure women (and men?) take offense to stuff that doesn't even register in our heads as even remotely offensive, so we never have the chance to think twice about saying it. I used to have a really good friend that one day just pretty much stopped talking to me. To this day, she has never told me why, even when we finally got back to a point of civility. Her mom told my mom that she thought it might have been something I said about demonstrating something for her (we both took private music lessons). I'm pretty good about remembering things that I felt had even the possibility of bringing offense, and I had nothing on this. So, if she's been acting weird lately, it might be a similar situation?

Whatever the case, don't beat yourself up over it. It was an honest mistake, and she decided to change the rules without telling you. If it were me in this situation though? I would set a clear boundary about how she is allowed to talk to you in the future. That behavior is unacceptable from anyone, even a child.
