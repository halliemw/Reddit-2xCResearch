I use the pill simply because it is the cheapest option at my local Planned Parenthood. When I get enough money I want to get a copper IUD. 

They don't offer the patch at my pp and I don't like the idea of the ring. I'm worried I wouldn't be able to put it in right. Getting used to taking the pill every day was hard, but now I find it no big deal to remember.

I really have had no bad side effects. I have been taking it for six months now and it has been great. My face has cleared, I didn't have a ton of acne before but I have noticed that I haven't had as much. I haven't gained or lost weight. I don't think it has affected my mood. My period has only gotten slightly lighter as far as flow, but I've had less cramps.

All in all, I like the pill. It's a good fit for me right now, and I plan to continue taking it until I can get another form of contraception.
