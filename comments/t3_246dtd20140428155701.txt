Thanks!  I think it was the hardest week I've ever been through in my life.  I also had to take all 3 of my kids to the doctor for allergies/uti and I held Easter. But really, my Mom made Easter happen for us.  I have so many wonderful family and friends.  I feel blessed.

Now to make it through 3 more exams and two finals in the next week and a half!
