It's not creepy because a father and daughter have a nice night out.  It's creepy because she is forced to place her sexual identity into the hands of her father.  It's just such a blatant way of enforcing the patriarchy.  Not that I wouldn't find placing your sexual identity into the hands of your mother also creepy, but at least it would be better than this.

What's ultra creepy about this is that it removes control of your body, of your self, from yourself.  You pledge it to someone else.  And if you ever decide to explore your sexual identity... You are now a "pledge breaker" and a liar, etc.  That is so not what you want to teach young girls so they grow up into strong, independent women.

You can see the 'ball' as not part of the whole purity culture, but I'm afraid it's like seeing 'jail' as not part of our court system.
