I'm sorry I was just speaking from my own personal experience. I of course didn't mean that Ireland is a completely non sexist and welcoming country for women in tech. I had simply not experienced sexism in the industry myself. I'm in Dublin and a lot of the tech groups I'm from have a large number of women in them including my hackerspace. The gamecraft group in my area is also run by two women. I realise that I've had a very different experience from other women and that I'm quite lucky for such a positive experience.
