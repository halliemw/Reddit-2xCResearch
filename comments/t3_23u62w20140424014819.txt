I don't believe the city I live in has a women's health clinic, for all it's size. I know for certain the city I lived in as of December:
1: Had no Women's Health Clinic
2: Had no physicians accepting new patients

While I absolutely love the Canadian healthcare system, sometimes I feel like, unless I were pregnant, I should bend over and take it because screw me if I want an actual doctor and happen to have insane parents who wouldn't 'enroll' me early on so that I'd have a doctor through the years.
