Thanks for your response, I'm glad I got one from someone who knows what I'm going through. Although I wish no one had to go through this... I'm sorry all that happened to you. 

At first I just assumed that since he wasn't talking to his friends about it that was why he was posting all over reddit. His friends know me and they know I wouldn't do anything like that... But then as time went on, I stopped talking to all of them, except like one. And he still continues to post even after all his friends have supported him in all this. I figured he would stop once he had real people to complain to.. I don't think he is reddit stalking me,  and if he is then he hopefully he reads this post and gets a damn clue. Thanks for the support!
