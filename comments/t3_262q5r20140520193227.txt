> you owe him nothing.

Ehh, I don't know about that.  She may owe him the truth.  It's obviously ultimately her decision to abort but I think she has an obligation to tell him she's pregnant.  I know if that were me, I'd want to know and I'd feel incredibly hurt and angry if someone both lied about birth control AND didn't tell me about being pregnant.
