Good lord, she made it very clear in her post that she didnt think there is anything wrong with being an admin. But it isnt her job.

And honestly, it very well might be beneath her. We only have one admin, she works part time and probably only gets paid around 15/hr. I'd say that is below our graphic designer who works 40+ hours a week and gets paid at least $20/hr.
