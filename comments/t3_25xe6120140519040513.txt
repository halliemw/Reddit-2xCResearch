Well, as a female with OCD, some of his behaviors sound obsessive compulsive, but some don't. What you can do to tell the difference is ask him what he thinks will happen if he doesn't do what he says he has to do. I don't know if you've done much research on it, but OCD is an anxiety disorder. The reason people engage in compulsions such as cleaning everything or counting is because they think something bad will happen if they don't, and by doing the compulsions they avoid that bad thing from happening and alleviate their anxiety. The obsession with hair sounds like it could be related to trichotillomania, but I don't know much about that disorder (although I've never heard of people with trichotillomania picking hair on other people's bodies). 

To be honest, while some of his behavior could be due to OCD, a lot of it seems just plain misogynistic and due to personality to me, such as calling other women sluts or constantly talking about their and your appearances. And if he was really anxious about hair, I don't know that he would be stopping to send you and other people pictures of it, I know that I would just be concerned with getting whatever was bothering me clean, not saving a reminder of it.
