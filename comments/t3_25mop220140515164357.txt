It sounds like he really needs a therapist. I say this because he sounds a lot like me. This behavior isn't normal or healthy. It's unfortunate that we stigmatize mental illness as a society so much. I thought I was just an anxious, nervous, perfectionist person. It turns out, after having visited a therapist, that I have Complex PTSD from abuse as a child. I would have never thought that. Knowing this has made my life significantly better. I have no idea what might or might not be going on in your boyfriends head, and I know that suggesting that someone see a therapist is hard for everyone involved, because of previous experiences as well as the stigma. I also have had awful experiences with therapy. But it was so worth it once I found a good one. I can't suggest therapy enough.
