My problem with a social worker is that social services once took us (my brothers and I) away from my father and we were assigned to a shrink with my father. A family therapist or something of that sort. 

She told the court that my father, who beat my brothers mercilessly up until that point and then after we were returned to him among other numerous abuses, was a stable parent and that his children were lying. 

I'd rather spread my legs for a doctor than I would open my mouth for a therapist! 


That all being said, I know my health is at risk because of all this. But between my legs is me. No one's seen that but those I've given consent to. 

And I know the psychological defenses in that statement (not being able to consult a therapist due to my problems I started researching to improve stability) but darned it.  

It's a war that wages inside of me. On the one hand there's no family history of anything (we're absolutely bonkers but physically fit as a fiddle) but on the other hand history develops from folk who thought they couldn't get sick.
