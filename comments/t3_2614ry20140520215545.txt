On a completely different note, this is something that I see much more often in women than in men. But at least in my experience, it seems to me that women are less likely to do things that are difficult or have a high chance of failure than men. And I think a big part of it is when we have people who go, "Oh well, that's very difficult."

I think this is probably one of the few places where guy's education is right in that guys are allowed to fail. But I don't think we allow as much freedom for women. STEM in general can be really fucking hard. And this reputation I feel as though keeps many women from applying into the field. Moreover, I also feel as though men are much more willing to put up with constant failure while women are much more willing to, "cut their losses," so to speak. It's strange because I've met women who are much, much, better students than me. But many of them flat out quit for fear of failure. 

I don't believe it is as simple as a confidence issue. There are nuances that make this complicated. Confidence I feel can be translated as, "Oh this is easy I can do it." Easy reward. But with a lot of other things, confidence also needs to translate as, "I can finish this if I don't back down." The latter thought process I think needs to be impressed onto girls at a young age. 

I remember talking to a girl who wanted to do what I did at the time (I was a route setter at the university climbing gym). And I basically told her the truth, "Look, it's a lot of real physical work. When you start you're going to get a lot of criticism. You're never going to please everyone. It takes practice, and it takes time." That was enough to dissuade her from doing the job. That should never be enough to dissuade anyone from doing anything.
