And this is why I never interact with women. It's not even that I want a girlfriend or something, I just want friends that are girls. I can empathize with where you're coming from, too, I'm a small gay man so I have been in similar situations. I just ask for the sake of those that are genuine to try to keep the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes the fellow who says hello to you on the train really just wants to know where you got that bag.

Or is it just me...?
