It honestly sounds like he's hedging his bets, like he wants to break up with you and go see this other woman, but he doesn't want to burn his bridges in case it doesn't work out for him.

It might just be harmless flirting and a coincidence, but if you aren't sure you can trust someone, there's probably a reason for that.  Especially if you regret not breaking up; you might as well just make it a clean break and move on.  No reason you can't start seeing each other again if you're both amenable to it down the line.
