I completely get what you are saying, and no I don't think it is mean. I think the point though is that we are all very different, and yet most of us still struggle with these issues of 'not being perfect.' it gets shoved down our throats so much that even people who look great feel terrible about their bodies. No one should ever be made to feel terrible about the way they look. I struggle with this on a daily basis, some days I feel amazing in my body, it is strong and can do really great things, and other days I have severe depression because I don't look like I was cut out of a fitness magazine and clothes never fit right. I guess what I'm trying  to say is, don't feel worse about yourself because someone you perceive as more beautiful also doesn't always feel perfect. Let's all stop comparing ourselves to one another and think about all the awesome things a healthy and active body can do instead of worrying about how good your butt looks in a pair of jeans.
