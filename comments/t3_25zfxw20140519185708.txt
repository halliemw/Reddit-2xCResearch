I think I really found out about it around 4th or 5th grade because one of my friends got her period really early and my mom freaked out. We had a talk definitely before 5th grade but my mom and I are really open about everything. All of us girls had this book: [The Care and Keeping of You](http://www.amazon.com/Care-Keeping-American-Girl-Library/dp/1562476661).
