I agree.  I have mixed feelings about this whole thing, but I am happy that this situation has allowed new users find this sub.  Even though I am more of a lurker than a commenter, it meant a lot when I found this sub about a year ago.  I just hope that this community can bounce back from these growing pains provide a really good space with good content for our new users.

EDIT:  Oh I forgot: Welcome new users!  I hope you enjoy yourselves here as much as I have over the past year!
