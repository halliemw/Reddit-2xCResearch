I'm not on Welbutrin but it's been discussed in my program because it's part of an experimental weight loss drug and we look at obesity.

What I know about it is that just like most antidepressants/mood stabilizers/anti-anxiety meds, it takes a few weeks to adjust to it. It's not uncommon to have side effects that seem like a worsening of your symptoms in the first few weeks and especially the first few days, so as long as you aren't feeling suicidal or having any severe acute symptoms, I'd recommend giving it a while longer before calling your doctor if it's not unbearable. It also may take some trial and error to get everything actually figured out. Your dose may need to be adjusted or you may need to be on something different altogether. Just wait it out for a bit and if you don't see any improvement, call your doctor next week sometime to see whether they think this is temporary or it means your dose needs to be adjusted.
