Oh, I know. Biologically, it probably isn't actually a matter of how many times you pull it out (that's how I've seen it phrased, and I just parroted it), but how roughly/violently you pull it out the last time that damages the follicle.

PSA: probably don't start ripping your unibrow out as hard as possible to test this theory, I doubt it would be enjoyable.
