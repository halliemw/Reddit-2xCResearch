My bestie has had herpes for about 10 years. She doesn't have a hard time with the actual outbreaks but when she dates a new person it makes it difficult as far as when to bring it up, etc. Wait for the results of the test - there's no need to spend valuable energy on stressing out and it's entirely possible that there's no problem. If it turns out that you have herpes, please remember that you are lovable and don't regret the past. We all have baggage. All of us.
