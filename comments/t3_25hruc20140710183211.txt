Okay, many people here are advocating that you keep doing what you've been doing for your entire life: wait for prince charming to come along and sweep you off your feet. The problem is that this hasn't worked in the last decade for you, so why on Earth would you continue down this path. If you want a husband, it's time to get serious about it. 

(1) Do you know how to be seductive to men? If not, learn. Read *The Art of Seduction* and practice. Go to bars, and practice every time you go out. Seduce everyone you meet. Many of the world's most seductive women haven't been the most beautiful (Marilyn Monroe), but they knew how to wrap men around their fingers.

(2) Put yourself in a position to meet men. Sitting at home binging on Netflix is not going to get you a husband. Make it your fucking job to go out twice a week to social events. Go to bars, parks, auto shows, the clubs and bars around male-centered events, and the hot social places near your city. 

(3) Men want sex. If you do meet a guy, he will want to have sex with you, so the better you are in bed, the happier he will be. 

(4) Go to the gym. It's a great way to meet guys and it will help you stay attractive. 

It's time to take control of your future and not leave it up to chance.
