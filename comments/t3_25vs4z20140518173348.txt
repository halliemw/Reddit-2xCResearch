That's beautiful! :) That's how I feel about my fiancee, we started off as best friends...and then it dawned on us that we were in love with each other (think Zack and Miri Make a Porno, that kind of romance lol.) He's always treated me so well, and like you, it confused me at first when he was sincerely, genuinely kind and caring to me. I'm happy that you have a loving partner like that, especially after all you've been through, that's fantastic :)
