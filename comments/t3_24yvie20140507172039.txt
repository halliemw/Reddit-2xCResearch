I'm glad it's all worked out for you! Before I probably wouldn't have but as someone who is going to be a middle/high school teacher I feel especially responsible for being proactive about issues like this. I want to be able to have conversations about situations like this with my students and hopefully encourage them to be a little bit kinder and wiser online AND in person.
