> Would you rather see your heroine getting beat within a inch of her life by some overpowering male super villain?

If it means we get more of Angela del Toro as White Tiger, then YES.  As long as she keeps picking herself back up again and keeps on fighting, even if it's another day, why wouldn't we.  That's what makes the "hero" part of super hero.  (If you not familiar with White Tiger think of Kickass except with hero has amulets that grant super powers.)

Also, why does the super villain have to be male?  Why can't we have more female super villains as well?

That 13% would probably grow, without losing male readers, if female super heroes weren't treated like walking pairs of tits (which is exactly what Black Widow is if you're new to the super hero scene).  I know this is the reason why I (I'm a woman by the way) can't bring myself to get into [Grimm Fairy Tales](http://zenescope.com/).
