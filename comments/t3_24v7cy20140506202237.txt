This happens to me! Once or twice while I was out walking around, I could feel it poking out. I've been using it for about 4 years so it's not often, but eesh! I know that your cervix changes position throughout your cycle so that might have something to do with why sometimes the nuvaring doesn't fit properly.

One thing you could try--if you don't mind--is arousing yourself (mentally or manually!) because that's quick, natural way to elongate your vagina. Usually once it's back up in there, it stays put. For me, it usually when I first reinsert one that I have trouble. Sometimes vaginas are just finicky.
