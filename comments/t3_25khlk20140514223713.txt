> you said that you've noticed that men tend to talk over you in conversations

Given that the experience stood out so starkly to the OP, I'm going to guess that it was a gendered experience for her. In other words, he(?) didn't find himself being ignored, dismissed or talked over as frequently when interacting with groups of women before the transition as she does now when conversing with multiple men.

Btw, you were respectful. I'm sorry you're being down-voted. I suspect the down-voter(s) are having a knee-jerk reaction to the "this happens to men too" point. So often, that argument is used to derail the conversation rather than engage with it as you were trying to do.
