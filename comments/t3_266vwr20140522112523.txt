You absolutely do not need to sit for an hour and be berated by your mother over your sexual choices. I think you should cut her out of your life if she intends on being hateful towards you for no good reason. You are an adult now, and you get to control what sort of relationship your parents have with you! If your mother wants to be a part of your life, let her know that she will either be a constructive part of it, or not a part at all. 

My wife lived with her parents all through college, and her parents took advantage of her, manipulated, and guilt tripped her constantly right up until she started planning on moving out. Now they're on their best behavior because they love their daughter and don't want to lose contact with her. The best thing you can do for your relationship with your mother is to put it on hold until she shows you that she's willing to a positive element of your life.
