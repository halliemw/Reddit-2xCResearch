Thank you so much for your comment! Your first paragraph hits really close to home. I have heard a bit about mindfulness from my therapist and online and whatnot and I know it's something that I should really work on... but I'm having a hard time knowing how to start. Is there like a "Mindfulness for Dummies" that I can check out from the library or something? How did you get started and what kind of resources did you use?
