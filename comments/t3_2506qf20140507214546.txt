Nutrition, cooking and fitness. For both the boys and girls.

There's a good course on Coursera out of the University of Hong Kong called, [*The Science of Gastronomy*](https://www.coursera.org/course/scigast). Lots of ideas that could be translated into age appropriate material.

If you're interested in this idea, hit me up with a message and I'd be happy to help. I'm a former teacher and designing instruction is now part of what I do for a living.
