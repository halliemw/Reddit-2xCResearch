I've never understood why we're supposed to be excited about it. My mom never really talked about it with me, so maybe that's where I missed this building excitement for it, but I just remember hoping I didn't get my first period while at my dad's for the summer. I was not excited or happy to get my period, just relieved at its timing (which, for the record, was the exact day I made it back to my mom's. Bullet dodged for dad and I both!).
