I'm 100% in favor of equal pay, but she was pretty notorious in the newsroom for being disliked, and, importantly, appointed several people to very, very prominent positions in the NYTimes who didn't last very long at all. It sounds like she burned her bridges in more way than one.

I'd also like to point out that it is not like she is being replaced by Lincoln C. "Sailboat" Smith Smythe Snivelsworth IV - she is being replaced by a black guy. 

Not only that - she was effectively the CEO - and she didn't know she was getting less than her predecessor? That reminds me of the bit from Social Network where Zuckerberg says to Saverin, when cutting ties:

> You're gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company?

The buck stops with the CEO. If she appointed people to top positions who couldn't cut it and didn't know the financials of her own organization, then was replaced by a black man, well... the accusations of misogynist bias seem weak. 

Is it still possible there was some bias? Sure. But there seems to be a whole heap of legitimate reasons to can her as well.
