I'm not a lady but I have investigated my fair share... for science. That being said, this is my  experience with UTIs: My girlfriend got one everytime we use Trojan condoms. After several months of that we determined that the spermicide Trojan uses was causing them. She is a scientist, so she could take samples into the lab and test them, making it an awesome experiment for me and a painful experience for her. 

As mentioned down below in other comments, peeing afterwards is absolutely crucial to expell whatever could have gone into the urethra. Furthermore, it might help to have a healthy culture in your lady bits and a regular regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus could be helpful. Cranberry juice on helps if you're into the less invasive methods of treatment, but give them all a shot at the same time, then add them back one by one to see what causes it.
