His parents bringing this up in front of you seems extremely intrusive. I think this is the kind of thing your boyfriend should be able to decide when and how he wants you to learn about it. 

Since you were there and you did hear about it you should probably ask him if it's something he wants to talk about, but if he says no I think you should respect that. Be supportive so that if at some point he does want to bring it up he can, but also give him privacy if that's what he wants.
