> but notifying the OP that there is a more specific subreddit sounds like a good idea, as long as it's active.

That's a great idea as well, and the community is often pretty good about doing that. Often that type of stuff is better from the community. If I say it, even without putting on my mod hat some users think that means they're being told to go elsewhere. If a regular user does so in a nice way it often comes off more as a suggestion, if that makes sense?

>We also agree that this will help smaller, more specific subreddits rise and flourish. 

I can't agree with you two agreeing with me more. There are so many awesome lady communities now that not letting others know just feels selfish. When 2xc was started we were pretty much it, an article once described us as the "female ghetto of reddit"! Now, with so many awesome places spouting off from here it's hard for anyone to say there are no woman on reddit. As for the guys downvoting... part of that will also be about educating new users in general how to customize their front pages. The admins have been talking about ways to do that recently as well.
