I think you need to understand that this sub is not always a place for keeping up a tough front of womens equality, this isn't /r/feminism, its not exclusively political. Its just a place for women to express themselves.  Also its really encouraging for women to have some kind of solidarity, not many people are comfortable going into jobs where their gender is in the minority.
