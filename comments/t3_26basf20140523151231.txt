Lots of things!

Boss has been gone for the past week. It was pretty hairy around here, but I think I did a good job of keeping the boat afloat while he was out! /backpat

A coworker and I are going to try out a new whiskey bar I've been dying to try to celebrate making it through the week.

I have enough loyalty points at the salon I go to to get an hour long spa pedicure for $15 and I also have a $10 off coupon for my birthday :D. Hell yeah!

I've stopped freaking out about my wedding and managed to figure out what the *real* issue was. Husband (legally married, going to do the "real" thing in a few months) has been pretty super about it and helped finalize the travel plans which took a HUGE load off of my shoulders.

MY AWESOME HUSBAND IS TAKING ME TO CANADA FOR MY BIRTHDAY AND I AM SO FLIPPING EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
