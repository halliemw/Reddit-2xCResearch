I'm sure you're right but (don't hate me) I don't see what's wrong with that... they're a site and they're trying to appeal to the masses, cos that's what they do. That's their purpose of existence. There can still be nice little safe corners in reddit, that's what's so good about it, every subreddit community is different.
