Have a search on /r/birthcontrol for experiences. Mirena definitely can reduce or even stop your periods, but there is no guarantee exactly how you'll react to any contraceptive. Another option you could consider is the Nuvaring. There's a lot less to remember compared to a daily pill, but it doesn't have the potentially scary insertion that the implant and Mirena do.
