I do. It's to me the most concerning thing about a group of women using subterfuge to manipulate the readership. It inadvertently confirms a bias that women are deceitful and will go to great lengths to get their way and the preferred methodology is by attacking and discrediting men.

Because that's exactly what they did. It's about as fucked up as it gets as far as I'm concerned. I've only gotten a couple of hostile pms, I don't really care about that crap one way or another although I would prefer to not get them; but I wouldn't have been surprised if they were sent by women.

It's not a great feeling, being embarrassed for them.
