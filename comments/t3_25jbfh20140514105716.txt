Ah, thanks for the edit, makes somewhat more sense now. Sorry you have to put up with rude or ignorant folks. My fiance used to work retail to support herself through school and she eventually got fed up with all the remarks she received about her height and how young she looked.

Also, I apoligize if I sounded rude in my original post. Downvotes make it seem like I said something wrong?
