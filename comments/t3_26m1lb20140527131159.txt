The problem is that some of the arguments behind this #yesallwomen thing are a little offensive. Take this tweet mentioned in the article:

"No, #NotAllMen are violent against women, but #YesAllWomen have to navigate a world where those who are look the same as those who aren't."

Imagine that in another context. "No, not all blacks are engaged in street crime, but all whites have to navigate a world where those who are look the same as those who aren't."

A similar argument was made in the article itself. Both things are technically true, but it's still offensive to the group that are being judged as potential rapists based purely on their genetics. I would even go so far as to say such things are "unhelpful" to the conversation. But I'm apparently not allowed to judge what's "unhelpful" or "derailing" - only women are. Especially on a sub like this, where my views get downvoted if I make a point that the majority view dislikes.

EDIT: Oh look, downvotes. What was that about people needing to *listen* more and to *not be defensive*? Oh wait, that's just for men hearing women's arguments. Not vice versa.

EDIT 2: Looks like I'm getting upvotes now. It seems like things might be getting more open-minded here. I apologise I can't respond to all the points as previous downvote experiences limits my posting.
