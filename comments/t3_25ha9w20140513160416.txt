Ah thank you. I am sexually active but and my partner has had one other partner. Even though the chance is slim of me having HPV, I got to thinking if the test is negative, what's the point?

The clinics where I live don't require exams for birth control, thankfully. I'm thinking if it comes back negative, then paps might not be a health priority for me; just wanted some clarification. Thanks for the insight!
