I guess a point in her favor would be that since he moved out a year ago she hasn't been mean to either one of us. She does nice things sometimes, well acts like she does at least. For example, her husband grilled some food and they brought it over to our house to eat with us, but she went on and on about how she loves feeding us and taking care of us even though she didn't grill it, and she doesnt work so it's not like she constributed to buying the food. 

I dont mind her seeing the baby in the future, but I'll never let her babysit or even let it in her house. They've smoked in the house for twenty something years and never clean.
