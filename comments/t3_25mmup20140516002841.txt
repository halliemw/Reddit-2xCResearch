I don't know if "many reports per year" is a good indicator.  Maybe.

I know that where I work, things are publicly reported, zealously, because a bunch of us are listening/watching/training, etc.  The school nurse and her professionals are not exactly comatose.  They do operate by a kind of gentle force, though.  

All of this goes to say:

REPORT IN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING.  RIght away.  I was assaulted twice at university, it never occurred to me to do anything but contact police (aside from running to the nearest office for safety).  I truly believe that's what most of us did (there was a student newspaper with ample reporting about the 4 murders in my freshman year).

But "many reports each year" is not necessary a great thing (the place where I teach right now has fewer than average reports, and I think it's because we have a commitment to safety).
