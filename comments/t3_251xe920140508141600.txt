This is really great advice. In order for counseling to be effective, those being counseled have to feel comfortable opening up to the counselor. If there is some reason not to like or respect the counselor, the session will probably be ineffective. Individual counseling is also a great alternative suggestion. It doesn't matter how the process goes down, just that these people are able to find something that works for them.
