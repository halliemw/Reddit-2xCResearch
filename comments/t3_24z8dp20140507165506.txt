Oh my god I've never thought of this. You're totally right. u/JCollierDavis points out that they might scratch the inside of your ankle, but I don't think my ankles would be close enough when I walk normally.... Still at this point, it would look weird to wear shoes with buckles on the inside. I've clearly been conditioned. :(
