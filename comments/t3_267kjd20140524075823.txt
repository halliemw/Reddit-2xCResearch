I've never heard of a provider refusing to insert an IUD due to the increased chance of expulsion and it doesn't make any sense that a provider would refuse to insert IUDs due to a higher expulsion rate, an additional 2 to 4 expulsions out of every hundred IUDs inserted isn't a logical reason to refuse to insert an IUD.

"The expulsion rate for a nulliparous woman is 5-7% and for a multiparous woman is 3-5%"

The IUD companies are covering there own behinds, but the research only supports the increased risk initially due to prior diagnosed infection and studies that controlled for this do not find any increase in PID among IUD users. In a study that compared  teenagers with and without IUDs no difference was found in the rate of PID (Berenson et al. Obstet Gynecol 2013;121:951â€“8).
