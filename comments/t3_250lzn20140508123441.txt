Honestly, I don't want to turn this into a big argument, but I would like you to understand the viewpoint of the other side here.

>You're free to do whatever you want, no one is going to try and stop you, you're a grown woman. 

So why did you make your original post? I don't believe you think you were actually informing anyone of the fact that being drunk increases the chance of being raped. I can't imagine any grown person being unaware of the fact that being significantly impaired increases your chances of getting into dangerous situations, and I don't think you give us that little credit. So when you then say that it is a "good point" that "some rape ... is easily preventable if proper measures are taken", what am I going to read into that? I am going to see you pressuring women to take said proper measures, in this case for example, "don't get very drunk".

If you say that certain rapes are "easily preventable", I'm smart enough to think that through and see the flip side of that. If I become the victim of a rape that you consider "easily preventable", how will that affect how you think of me? Probably not very highly, like you wouldn't think very highly of the person in your ATM example. So this makes me feel like I shouldn't do it, or I will be lowered in your regard. And it's not just you. You're far from the first person to make this exact point, on this exact subreddit, in fact.

The thing is, when I read your original post, I see a post attempting to (among other things) influence women's drinking behavior. That is how it's going to come across. That's why people feel angry.
