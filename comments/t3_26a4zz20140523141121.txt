>Also Rule #1 says to follow Reddiquette, so why was I downvoted as my comment was clearly adding to the conversation without being inflammatory?

I think your blanket assumption that all workplace environments should have the same social rules might rub people the wrong way, along with the idea that "nobody wants to hear about cleaning under the foreskin while they're at work." Firstly, as other people have stated, workplaces are different. Relationships with coworkers are different. Things that might not be appropriate for you might be very appropriate in other workplace environments where interactions are less formal and relationships aren't as typically professional.

Secondly, you don't know what other people want or don't want to hear about while at work. Some of us don't mind hearing about male bodily functions at all.
