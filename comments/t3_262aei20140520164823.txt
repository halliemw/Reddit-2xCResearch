I'm very happy for you and your growing family, but I think with a little introspection you'll find your pro-choice self again. It's possible to reconcile your pregnancy and baby as a blessing with abortion being a necessary legal option for other women, even if you morally disagree with some of their choices. There are many people who are adamantly politically pro-choice who don't want or even approve of abortion from a moral standpoint. There is a pretty diverse spectrum under the pro-choice umbrella, and it's ok to fall anywhere on it or even in the pro-life category. 

To me, though, it sounds like you're currently in awe of your own miracle and it's blinding you a little bit to why it's not a miracle for everyone and why abortion should probably be a legal option whether you approve of everyone's reasons or not. Most people don't really approve of the attitude that having four or even one abortions is something women should do casually, but I don't really think that I want someone who clearly doesn't want children badly enough that she had four abortions in what sounds like a relatively short timeframe to be raising children, either. Moral disapproval of her reasons doesn't make me want to make her actions illegal because it doesn't change her underlying attitude. It just makes me want to give her access to really reliable, fool-proof birth control for as long as she wants it.

But even if you do find yourself permanently somewhere a little more conservative on the spectrum, that's ok. We all change over time, and it's more important to be honest with yourself about how your stance and beliefs are changing than to adhere to a belief system that you don't identify with anymore just because you think someone would disapprove.
