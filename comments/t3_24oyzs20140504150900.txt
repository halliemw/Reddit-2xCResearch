I agree, I also get suspicious when a guy expresses his type as "Asian." I realized it recently when I made a friend and he said this. It made me wonder if he just wanted a woman to be his bang maid or actually his partner. It makes me instantly lose respect if a man can't see a woman as an equal. I have had many men tell me that women should be submissive to men... So infuriating!!
