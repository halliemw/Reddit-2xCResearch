I have clergy in the family, old-World clergy too, and the prevailing view amongst many European churches is that actually, loving God is best done by doing good on Earth.

Your best option here is to try and make your partner understand that your atheism does not in any way affect his personal beliefs - atheism and Christianity are one of the most 'common' and 'compatible' mixes - I have seen a neopagan and a Muslim work things out before, gods I've even seen a *protestant* and a *Catholic* manage it so it is possible!
