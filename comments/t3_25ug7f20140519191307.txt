I know one thing at least, if it were to ever work out, we both need our space to figure out who we are alone. We both jumped into this relationship just weeks after leaving our first long term relationships. (both were 4 years long, and spanned the same time frame.) We need to be solo for a while, maybe then there'd be a chance. As much as it pains me to think about.
