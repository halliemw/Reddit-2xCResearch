There's something about the short/long hair issue that makes it a particularly big deal, more so than thigh gap for example. I think it's to do with society's perception of femininity. It's a marker of gender - boys have short hair, girls have long hair - and in addition, a woman's hair is seen as being a crucial part of her physical attractiveness.
