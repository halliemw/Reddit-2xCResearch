Goddamn, this infuriates me and tugs at my heartstrings. Experiencing miscarriage is easily the worst thing that has ever happened to me and I cannot even begin to fathom how much worse it would have been if I'd had to fend off accusations of inducing it myself. I definitely agree with /u/rockfan2012: restrictions on abortion can lead to really terrible consequences that are 100% not okay.
