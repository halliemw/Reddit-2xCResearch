Ugh. I remember being at warped tour when I was 15. Some guy obviously waaay older came up and started touching my butt and grinding on me from behind. I turned around and glared at him then he disappeared. It was disgusting and made me feel unsafe.


People who do this shit are disgusting and pathetic.
