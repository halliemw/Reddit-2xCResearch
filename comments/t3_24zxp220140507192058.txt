1. I'm actually largely undecided. I want to see how it will go over the next few days or weeks. Obviously right now there's a lot of attention, but that won't be sustained for ever. I think it's great for new redditors to be exposed to the portal of related 2X subreddits, and I feel confident that the mods can do a good enough job of moderating the discussion here to keep it civilized. AskScience is heavily modded and it did fine as a default. Atheism was not heavily modded and it did not do so well.

2. If you see people breaking the respect rule, report them and/or downvote them.

3. Rule 4 is the most subjective rule. In the end, it's left up to the community to decide. I think a woman graduating college and wanting to celebrate it is relevant to our experience as women - women throughout history have come together to celebrate things. If someone likes the community here, why not celebrate it?! I think less relevant things would be things like a submission to an article about raising the minimum wage. That has a more tenuous link. Not that its not applicable to women, it's just not women-centric. Now an article about how raising the minimum wage would impact women, relevant.
