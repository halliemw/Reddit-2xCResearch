Hahaha, no, I was just very intent on bringing a "date," but it was going to be someone I knew. The event was a fundraiser and it was one of those things that was "optional," read, go or there will be negative repercussions. It also cost $400. I am not senior staff, so if I was unoccupied, I would have been put to work manning the press line, helping out the Diplomatic Police, checking people in, recruiting volunteers for the election, etc. I had no intention of paying $400 to go to work and I knew I wouldn't have to if I had a date.
