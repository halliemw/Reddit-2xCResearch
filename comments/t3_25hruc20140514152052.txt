Wow. You're overreacting just a tad. Why change the subject? It's not complicated. It was a sexist remark which is seen as no problem at all but if the tables were turned I'm sure many people would be up in arms. This is simply based on my observations on what gets upvoted in this subreddit. I never said anything about being a social analyst or trying to be an inspiration to anyone. I am sorry that you took it that way. I guess I shouldn't have given my burger to that homeless man because you might end up thinking I am trying to be a world-class philanthropist tying to put all the others to shame.
