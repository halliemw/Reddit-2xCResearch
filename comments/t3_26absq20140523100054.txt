Playing devils advocate for a second.

Based on his texts to his friends it sound like he didn't really want to go, but he went for you. That sounds like he might at least be trying to be a team player. Granted maybe he could have put on a better show and not complained about it while he was there. 

I know that if my partner wanted to go to some sort of art exihbit with a bunch of friends that are also super into art I'd go to make them happy but art isn't really my thing so I'd be mostly feeling lost and left out.

That being said, if you feel like you don't have any respect in the relationship I think that's a much bigger issue and something that you really need to talk to him about. Let him know that you don't feel respected and why you don't feel respected. 

Make sure that when you do talk to him about it you don't accuse him "You never think of us, you only think of yourself!" instead tell him how his actions make you feel "When you spend time at the game saying you're 'stuck with crazy girls' It makes me feel like you don't respect me."
