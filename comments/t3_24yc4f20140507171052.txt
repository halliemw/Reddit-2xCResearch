As someone who has had both, I definitely don't agree!

The prep was a little traumatic but after I was knocked out properly it was nothing. They don't generally sedate you to the point of sleep with an abortion unless you pay extra, and that was the terrifying part for me. I had a little sedation but was definitely conscious.
