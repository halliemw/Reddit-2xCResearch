Cam girl here.  First off, I *highly* recommend you reconsider unless you're cool with losing the teaching job.  Being found out is inevitable.  Getting posted on a tube site is inevitable. Secondly, I don't recommend livejasmin.  I know some girls make decent money there, but most people consider it one of the shittier ones to work for.  Third: someone posted that you'll not make decent money.  Depending on your looks/personality/the site you work for, that's probably not true.  You'll need to buy a decent camera (~80$) and a couple toys.  You'll need a computer with enough processing power and ram.  I know I tried to use my little mac, and it couldn't handle the traffic.  I had to switch to my boyfriend's beefy gaming laptop.  Finally, it's not always a super positive experience of exploring your sexuality.  For one, people are dicks.  If the internet has taught you nothing else, people are dicks.  You'll get mean comments and trolls and threatening ones.  For another, it's a helluva hustle.  And you need to work it.  To be honest, the constant begging for freebies and shit is more annoying than the rudeness.  If you decide to go through it, feel free to PM me or comment here for helpful links, toy advice, ways to deal with the physical or emotional side of it, etc.
