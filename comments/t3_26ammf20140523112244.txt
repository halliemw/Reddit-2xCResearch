I would tell it to a supervisor so they could talk to him but me personally I wouldn't contact the police. But! if she really felt that she needed to, then report away. 

In all honestly when it happened to me it didn't bother me that much, I was furious though and talked to him about why he did it. He knew it was sexual assault and no one stopped him so he kept doing it until I said something. Thank God he stopped after that.
