Nobody has really answered your second question. I think if you still believe what you believed before about waiting for marriage, you should continue to wait. Yes, you may have had a penis in your vagina, but you didn't really have sex. Virginity is more of a mental thing, being that some women consider oral sex losing it, and some will have anal sex and still consider themselves a virgin. Many virgins who are raped still consider themselves virgin. Some women break their hymen horseback riding.  Sex is much more than the physical act of a penis in a vagina. So whether or not you were raped, you weren't having sex. You seem very upset at yourself. Go easier on yourself. If you want to consider yourself a virgin, you can. Who cares what anyone else thinks. 

I lost my virginity after waiting until my 20s to a drunk one night stand. I don't believe I was raped because I was well aware of what I was doing even though I was drunk. But I did have some feelings of regret and felt like- well I'm not a virgin anymore, might as well sleep with anyone who wants me. I was depressed. I had a few more one night stands and it didn't make me feel any better. I'm ok with sex now and not being a virgin, but it took me a while to get to a healthy viewpoint.
