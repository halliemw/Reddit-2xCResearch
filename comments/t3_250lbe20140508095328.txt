>Guys who can't grow beards know my pain, to an extent. They understand what it's like to want something that others have but they cannot have. But... imagine if 99% of actors had beards. If every guy on a magazine cover had a beautiful beard. Imagine if it was universally accepted that beards were attractive and no beard was what older or less-attractive guys had. Imagine if every woman they met was taken with beards and most guys could grow beards and beards were the absolute norm. Yeah.

So like balding early in life.
