> people **regularly**

Which is the issue, it isn't regular.

This is not attempting to suggest that murder for this reason is the same level of evil as drowning, but that the scale of the two issues is mostly the same. Attempting to suggest an entire societal manifesto based on these minority events is the equivalence of trying to suggest that society has a drowning abuse issue based on the current drowning statistics.
