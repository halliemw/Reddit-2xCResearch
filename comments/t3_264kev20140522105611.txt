She is singularly awful. Puts the kids down, puts her teachers down, and everything she does around here is on a whim. Plus she LOVES to get personal when criticizing. Nothing like her saying, "I don't know how your mother raised you..." when sharing concerns over professional matters or telling students to stop doing work I have assigned because "this is stupid." The best is when she said, "I best if you assigned a six page essay to the teachers here, THEY couldn't even do it!" um wat?
