I rejected my PhD offer. Best decision I ever made tbh. I was going off research by the time it was made anyway, and my field (computer science) has very good prospects without one. It's four years since I finished my masters and I really, really cannot imagine still being in academia. Software development pays the bills, is funding my wedding and allowing me to indulge my running, cycling and swimming passions.
