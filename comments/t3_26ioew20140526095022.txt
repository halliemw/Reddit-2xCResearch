Your standards should be high. Just because a guy is considered cool, or your friends think he'd be a good match, or because he asked you out and no one else has... These are not necessarily reasons to go out with someone. I mean if you want to, by all means go ahead, but there is no reason to date someone unless you want to.

I had pretty terrible self esteem in high school and went out with guys that made me feel pretty - even though they treated me like crap. After getting burned and hurt I would decide to never put up with that kind of crap again, only to find a slightly different kind of crap I hadn't ruled out yet.

I was so used to being told by teenage boys that "all men" do this or that, that "all men" had the same interests and needs, that I needed to learn and accept "the way men are". The truth is that no one, man, woman, trans, queer, child, adult, no one is the same, we each have different needs and desires, and mine were perfectly valid, even if they seemed "high maintenance" to some teenagers.

If I could go back and talk to 16 yr old me, all I would say is you have every reason to want to be respected and treated like a person with dignity, and some of the boys you date will try to degrade you or treat you like a piece of meat. Dump them without hesitation. No one needs to put up with that. There are so many men out there who will treat you with the respect you deserve.
