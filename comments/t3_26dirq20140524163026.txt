Which?  Chubby men were those again?  Because I'm coming up with like, Meatloaf, Big Pun and Fat Joe, and then I'm struggling.  To think of any.  At all.  They barely even exist, and those three chubby guys who did make it have Meat, Big, and Fat as part of their *names* like it defines their identity.  Meanwhile, not only is it pretty easy to think of well liked chubby and successful female entertainers from various genres, eras and fame levels....Queen Latifah, Beth Ditto, Jill Scott, Janis Joplin, Missy Elliott, Aretha Franklin, Etta James (none of whom have "fat" or "meat" or "big" in their  names)....but I've literally only ever heard or read over-the-top praise about their unconventional beauty and other references to their sensual majesty.  Do I remember Adele getting flack?  No, not really.  From who, a couple of youtube commenters?  I've heard fifty, a hundred odes to her beauty for every fat joke from a 12 year old.  But I do remember seeing one comment about "man boobs" and one about "man tits" in the video of Chad Smith that just went up yesterday.  He's not even a frontman or a main draw, barely a celebrity, he's a drummer and he's not even fat, and still he's getting shit.  But in your world women are being crucified for fatness, and there are a ton of fat male performers people love and never call fat?  .........what?  I mean honestly, this is an honest question, don't you people with opinions like these ever stop and go "wait....what the hell am I talking about?"
