well, i wasn't sure, which is why i asked. gotta love how i'm downvoted for requesting clarification. anyway, i was confused because it sounded like she was dismissing the author's confidence. like "i'm white and happy in my skin but i don't need to write a whole article about it". this is reddit; there's a lot of that kind of thinking.
