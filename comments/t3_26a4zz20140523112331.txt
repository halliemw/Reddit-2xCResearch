Except you have /r/grool (nsfw) so arguably some people DO find it sexy... I'm actually really surprised that you argue that only cum is associated with 'positive' sex when women generally get super wet when they orgasm. I'm bi so I'm a bit biased but I think that's hot and I'd hope that straight guys would think the same. 

Idk. It just annoys me because I think as a whole girls are far more worried about grossing out guys than vice versa.
