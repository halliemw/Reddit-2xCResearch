Public harassment is what it is, sometimes public sexual harassment. It makes a lot of women feel very unsafe, too. If the catcaller is breaking a social norm like "don't harass someone, or make loud and inappropriate comments about their body" then it makes one wonder what *other* social norms they will break, possibly more threatening ones.

And if they a re construction workers, the company should know that their workers are harassing passersby, and that's not good for their reputation.
