We can talk about the technicalities of the word, but what really matters is what people actually believe (most people don't read the manual).  I'd expect a higher proportion of religious people are against IVF compared to the non-religious population because of the playing-god aspect.  But, that proportion should be smaller than the proportion against abortion because the latter, at least in their eyes, also involves murder.

Individual cases though can throw the average to the shitter.  People, religious or not, do think about things and form their own opinion.  I handle survey data which includes several thousand religious people, and there's a pretty sizeable chunk (~16% from memory) whose opinions on social matters are not differentiable from the regular population.  Conversely, I'm a hardline atheist but I view abortion less flippantly than my peers or your average Redditor^1.

Things also get more complicated when you're the one having to make the decision and face its repercussions.

Anyway, in this case we don't need to think about it much.  She'd signed the contract so she knew what she was in for AND her initial response was to ask for another 5 grand before she'd do the deed.  It's pretty obvious she's just a bit mental and most of the religious talk is post-hoc.

^1 my opinion being: fundamentally, the trimester cut-offs are arbitrary; there's a reason people still get heartbroken when they have a miscarriage. Although I don't think abortion is on the level of murder, I also don't think it's quite as meaningless as taking a walk through the park.  So I'm not going to out there and bomb a clinic, nor would I pressure a girlfriend into keeping a 'mistake,' but if the final decision came to me I wouldn't abort my kid unless they were doomed to misery--even if that means significant misery on my end.
