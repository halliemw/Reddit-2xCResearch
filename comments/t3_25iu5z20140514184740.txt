We didn't even have that great of an emotional connection, but the night I first hooked up with him it was one of those spontaneous romantic nights with an attractive stranger that you'll probably never see again, and it was intimate in that way. I realized maybe the reason why I keep thinking about him is because not that I wish it was him as a person, but what I associate with him: good vibes of intimacy and not being centered on sex. 

Hahaha I will, that's great advice. Seriously, thank you
