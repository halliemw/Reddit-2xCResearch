Once OP has his name and company, she might also want to do a quick Google search and see if he has a Facebook or other identifying information online so she can look up his address and give it to the police.

Also, since OP paid in cash and was dropped off at a friend's, the driver does not have her real name and does not know where she lives. OP needs to do everything to keep it that way
