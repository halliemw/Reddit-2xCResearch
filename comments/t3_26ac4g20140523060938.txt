I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting to work fewer hours but if you decide to do that, regardless of your gender, you are bound to ear less. Perhaps where BigBramel comes from, men are the ones expected to earn (same as my country) and women take jobs with relaxed hours to play the house wife role (which is how it is in my country). 

Now, not all women do that. The ones working longer hours and much much harder than men are unfortunately very few and we earn well, more than men in some cases.
