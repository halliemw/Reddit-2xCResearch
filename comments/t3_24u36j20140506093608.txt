Sexist media. My parents didn't even meet until my mom was 35. My dad is much younger than she is, and I can assure you that he hasn't lost interest in her even now that she's in her 60s. My older cousins are either playing the field successfully at 34 or just settled in to their first long term relationship since college at 32. It's not as though the only thing you have to offer is your body, and it's not as though you turn 30 and your body immediately develops deep wrinkles and sags and everything anyway.
