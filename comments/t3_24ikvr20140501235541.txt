I get chronic migraines and noticed a significant increase in them when I was on the pill. I switched to Nuvaring (which I loved) and minus the occasional migraine here and there, they definitely decreased. I was able to continually skip my periods and only got 1-3 a year, and they were too light to even use a tampon with. All in all, I had a really great experience with it. I just got Mirena yesterday morning and so far I'm extremely happy with my decision. Can't comment too much on side effects yet though.
