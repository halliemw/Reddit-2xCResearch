Yes, first job. Bag boy at a grocery chain called Market Street. Had 3 different managers plus the GM with very different ways of dealing with things. Also had 3-4 supervisors. One manager was laid back and ok by himslef. Another manager was more strict but I was ok with him too. My third manager hated me, I don't know why she was just mean. 

All the supervisors were great except one time I told one of them I was going home and she gave me a look and told me: "You have to wait for us to tell you to go home", I said: "It's my clock out time though", her: "Doesn't matter, I tell you when to go". 

The GM was horrible. One day I was scheduled for 7 or 8 in the AM for the first time, I think it was Valentines and I was sick. Anyway he tells me to: "do the things on the list I showed you", I never knew a list existed, he thought I was someone else (I didn't even look like any of the other bag people). When I told him he never showed me a list he seemed ticked off and then showed me said list and had me start.

All in all I hated it and quit around 2 months later. 

Edit 1 and 2: Every few months people leave and new ones replace them, constant 'Now Hiring' sign in the window. Part of the job was smiling and barely anyone does it in that section of the store. It's kind of sad but they are horrible at management.
