There are probably going to be bullies, but just remember that they are just as scared and insecure as you are. 

You are only with those people for 4 years so don't let them ruin the rest of your life. 

Find friends that are supportive and don't tear each other down. A toxic friendship is worse than no friendship.

Guys in high school are still boys, and their penis probably runs their life. Don't let them talk you into anything you are not comfortable with.

Be confident with yourself. 

Try a lot of different things till you find something you might enjoy doing for the rest of your life. And if you don't find anything of interest, don't worry, most adults still haven't figured out their life passions.
