God, this stuff is so frustrating.

The point where I lost it on reading your story was the comment she made about "women faking this all the time." I've heard this before, but luckily I never got this one since several people overheard the violence and my protests, and since I wasn't the one bringing it forward in the first place.

I have heard some pretty stupid stuff. For instance, my closest guy friend who was in the other room and overheard said, "why didn't you just fight him off? He's not that big of a guy you should have kicked his ass." 

Obviously I *did* fight him, as did my best friend when it came down to it. Why didn't you do anything when you were in the next room over listening to this? Why did you leave it up to our 90 pound 5'2" friend to help me when you were by far the largest and least intoxicated person in the house?

Or the other day my sister, who is an exotic dancer, was talking about how she's met girls in her industry who have been raped through their jobs, and she said "you have to admit though, some of those girls who get raped bring it on themselves."

I wish I had advice for you but I really think it sometimes comes down to luck. A lot of it depends on the lottery of who gets assigned to your case or who the DA is in your area. I think my story is proof that there are good people out there but without the right support it can be tough.
