Glad I could help. Not a counsellor, just a person who really struggles to connect with and understand other people, which made me lonely and I had to get a non intuitive  understanding of how humans work. It might be hard for you, but validating her feelings/struggle might make it easier on everyone, even if that's not the reality of the situation. Try and see her point of view, it will make it easier to manipulate her into not being difficult. Emotional manipulation is a wonderful tool for dealing with difficult people. 

Please, I'm going to repeat this, find strategies for taking care of yourself and the people around you. Make sure that your sisters and partner take care of themselves mentally too, if they're doing the brunt of the work. Don't get lost in the crisis.
