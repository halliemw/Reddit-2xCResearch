An add on to this post is that if you go to counselling first to help you figure out what you can do to help him and yourself that might give you a chance to ease into asking him to go by simply asking him to go in with you. Something to the effect of "I've been seeing this therapist for a couple months and they have really helped me out, do you want to come in with me and sit in on a session so the therapist can meet you and talk about the things me and them are working on together?" Most therapists should be willing to have him in to talk about what they are working on with you and might be able to get him to open up and talk to them about stuff he might be going through. Good luck :)
