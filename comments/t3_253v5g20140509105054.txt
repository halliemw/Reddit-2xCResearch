This sounds like a bad reaction to the diflucan/phenozopyridine combo. (Antibiotics can sometimes cause skin peeling in some people- that plus the yeast infection and diflucan....) **Go to the ER!** I'm sure it will be fine, but you really need a doctor to take a look, like, ***today***. 

You probably don't need an ambulance (ask a friend to drive, 'cause I'm pretty sure you really don't want to be sitting upright right now), but **you really don't want to mess around with this on your own.**

In the mean time, **don't take anything else** (Including pain relievers! Just in case. You don't want to provoke a further reaction), and **if you must use an ice pack, wrap it in a clean cloth or sterile gauze**, and wear a nice loose skirt and clean cotton underwear to maximize airflow and minimize discomfort. 

You probably want to **bring an extra pair of underwear and some pads and tampons** just in case they want you to remove your tampon to take a look or want you to stay overnight for observation.

Oh, and bring a book and a cell phone charger and headphones, and a snack and a bottle of something to drink. Waiting rooms in ERs are *soooo boring*.
