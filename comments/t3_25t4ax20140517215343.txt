> sometimes one of them is not as reliable 

do you have any links where i can read about this more?  the nurse dated the pregnancy to a day when i was out of town and had not had sex for five days, which was also during my bc placebo week.  the overlap of those two situations does not really comfort me, even if there is no relationship.
