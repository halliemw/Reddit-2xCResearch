I am man but I can speak to one particular incident that my girlfriend and I had a while back where she was certain that she was pregnant. We had a bit of an "oops" moment that brought on a lot of emotions the next day; fear and paranoia being the main ones. All of the worry and stressing caused some real physical symptoms. Nausea, cramping, fatigue, among others. Our minds had her body completely convinced she was pregnant and it was nothing. Anyway, especially at a time like this, It's important to try not to psych yourself out too much. It's utterly amazing how effectively your mind can trick you.

Also as a side note, after spending so much time preparing ourselves mentally that this was a possibility, it was actually pretty devastating when we found out she wasn't pregnant. After all that worrying, we were never relieved that she wasn't pregnant. After a couple of sad weeks we decided to give it a try. Fast forward to today and she's 18 weeks pregnant. Sometimes, what seems like a curse turns out to be the greatest gift you've ever been given.
