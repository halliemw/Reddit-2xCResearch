It's not an unpopular opinion, it's actually flat out false. http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts The most relevant ones being 

-One indoor UV tanning session increases users’ risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma by 67 percent and basal cell carcinoma by 29 percent.55

- The risk of basal cell carcinoma is increased by 73 percent if one tans six times per year.27

-Just one indoor tanning session increases users’ chances of developing melanoma by 20 percent, and each additional session during the same year boosts the risk almost another two percent.

So yes, even the small amount of tanning that OP is looking at is fucking dangerous.
