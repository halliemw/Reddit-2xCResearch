I had just been dumped the last time I went to a wedding, so I went alone. Be prepared to mingle, as the bride and groom may not have the ability to spend much time with you. Also, and this depends on who are involved I the wedding, don't feel any shame from hiding in the bathroom during the bouquet toss. I knew they'd drag me onto the dance floor, so I hung out with a self-proclaimed 50 year old spinster who also was hiding from the toss.
