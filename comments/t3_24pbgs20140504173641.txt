The first computer was not invented by a woman. What the author probably got "inventing the computer" confused with was the fact that Ada Lovelace wrote a program for a theoretical computing device designed by Charles Babbage in the 19th century. Either way I don't see how feminism takes credit for an invention that predates feminism.
