I dont agree with you or your example.  Your example is invalid because nowhere in our planet except for tribal societies do women go around topless.  This is about equality.  women are forced to cover parts of their bodies which men do not have to cover.  Women cant do things not because they are wrong, but because men have said that they cannot.  Case in point, most things women are forbidden to do, are the ones men can do easily.  If it was about not showing your private parts, the conversation would be about covering up all these topless sluts and douchebag guys walking the street swinging their dicks in everyones faces.  But no, the conversation is always one sided where your argument completely falls apart.  This has always been about control.
