We have a pretty wide array of birth control options now, which is awesome! But, it can be frustrating to find the option that works best for you. No two birth control methods are exactly alike, and chances are, you will not have the exact same experiences with birth control as your friend. I recommend talking with your gyno about your concerns, and decide together what may be a good option for your lifestyle. Unless side effects are horrible (i.e. scary depression, etc.) try and stick with it for a couple months and see how your body adjusts (disclaimer: I'm NOT a doctor, so if your gyno suggests differently, listen to them). Listen to what your body is telling you - not rare horror stories that most likely have nothing to do with your body.
Personally, I had to try a lot of different methods before I found what worked for me. But, being patient and having open communication with your gyno makes the whole process pretty doable, and very much so worth it.
Ultimately, it's your body, and if you don't want to go on birth control you don't have to! That being said, do what YOU think is best for your body and listen to its needs.
