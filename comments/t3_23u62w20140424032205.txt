I haven't had one since before that study was published, so it'd be interesting to see if my doctor's policy has changed.


I thought HPV was only one cause of cervical cancer, even if it's the main cuase? I have family members who've had cervical cancer so maybe that's part of the reason?


I did a little googling though and I read a lot of doctors encourage their patients to do pap smears after a certain age because "they don't always know if the patient is truthful". Which sounds pretty stupid to me, especially in my case. I couldn't undress in the doctor's office without a nervous breakdown, did she really think I could do it in front of a boy? Jeez.


Either way, thanks for the tip. Don't really know how to feel about it now that I know.
