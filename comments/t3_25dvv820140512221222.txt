Choking is one of the Domestic Battery incidents that, at least here in IL, is a felony. 

That said ... everyone here is an adult. Your siblings can chose to live elsewhere, no? You cannot force your dad to go to detox, or AA, or make any changes in his life. You cannot force your mom to make a police report, or leave him, or go to a shelter. It is her choice. 

I am saying this as an adult survivor of domestic violence. I love my dad, but he is an ass. However, my mother CHOSE to stay with him, for a multitude of reasons. She chose herself and her wants and needs over those of her kids. She stayed with a man that hurt her and hurt her kids, even tho she had many opportunities to leave.

Now she is 70, in early stages of vascular dementia. I've said "mom, if you want to leave him, it is not too late. We can make that happen."

And after nearly 50 years living with an abuser, she chooses to stay. I can't change that. I can't make her move. At some point, she is scared to admit she made a mistake 50 years ago. It is still her choice to stay.

The only people you can protect is yourself, and maybe your siblings. YOUR choices are the only thing you have control over.

This will probably get me down votes. But you have to look at what YOU need to do to project yourself from that disfunction. 

Edit: adding here ... choosing to cut yourselves off from your parents lives MIGHT be the kick in the pants they need to get their sh!t together.
