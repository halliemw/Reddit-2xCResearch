If I don't tell him, I take the heat on my own. If I do tell him, I get him involved and he shares responsibility. It's difficult because it almost feels like I'd be a coward by telling him that I got pregnant. Why even bring him into this mess of a deal when he thought he was protected? I feel like I'm punishing myself by not telling him that I'm pregnant. I'll be paying for the abortion and (from what my friend told me) will be in enormous pain for a day waiting for it to pass. What would he benefit from me telling him?
