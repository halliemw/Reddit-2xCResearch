That's very weird; in my country if you bring up a fact that you have a sick child, spouse, parent, or grandparent, everyone is super cooperative. Your gender doesn't matter. You are given considerable leniency at work, work itself will be managed so that you can spend time with your family, and people generally step up to help you through it. Of course, this perk comes only if you are a hard worker, not if you have a relative conveniently dying every other week.
