More info on the bike rescue:

My friend and I are part of their"learn and earn" program. We volunteer for 6 hours, and then give us a bike of our own. It's very, very cool. We get a free bike that we can customize to look however we want while learning bike maintenance and repair. I'm so excited ðŸ˜Š
