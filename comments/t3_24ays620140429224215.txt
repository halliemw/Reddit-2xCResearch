That care package idea is something that I would have never thought of. I love the idea and will start buying things to give to her. Thank you so much. But yes, I will definitely be going with her to the appointment. And will be there for her to lean on as much as possible. It has been hard on me as well but I ultimately want to take care of her and be strong for her while I can.
