There's been such a huge outcry for this, but it's not only about what content goes into a making one show, it's also about cultural perceptions of nudity and how we feel about male and female bodies.  It's maybe a little unrealistic to expect one TV show to tackle these social issues while they're trying to appeal to their same audience from previous seasons.  I don't know that it would be entirely welcome.
