Srsly? Then us law is stupid. Like most men, I never heard a woman say "yes lets have sex" so follwing this reasoning i never had consensual sex (okay some said sumthing like "i want u inside me", guess hats ok). Or should i ask "do u want to have sex wirh me?" And then she replies yes/no?

The truth is: if a guy asks that every woman, he is most likely tp never have sex again. Women dont like to be asked like that... yeah feminists, vote me down, but its the truth and any guy who has slept with a hand full if women can confirm.
