I really appreciate you chiming in. I do want to be patient, but it was also important for me to express some concerns. I hope there's a way to keep some of the positives of defaultia (increased views, new blood) while keeping the tone and positivity that has made 2X such an awesome sub.

EDIT: PS - As an educator, I *am* happy to answer any questions about trans identity and issues, so go for it! :)
