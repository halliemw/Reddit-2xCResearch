You're not imagining things. He didn't care about how you felt at all and coerced and manipulated you into sex. I hope you don't let this get you down though, it's happened to me and I felt violated for a while but now I am just angry sometimes - and angry only at him. Even now I'm only angry if I think about it, which is rarely.
