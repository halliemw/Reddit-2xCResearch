I'm honestly not sure. She tried online dating initially and said that there was a similar problem to your mom. The only guys that initiated contact were the ones in their late 80s+ and the guys her age were all chasing 50 year olds.

I think it helped when she got into a bunch of activities and started broadening her social circle. Meeting people naturally gives them a chance to get to know you and your personality which can help develop friendships and chemistry at an older age and get people interested. Our city has ton of 'senior' programs that she's gotten involved in, as well as church stuff.
