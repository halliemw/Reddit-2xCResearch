My fiance proposed to me with my great-grandma's engagement ring. My great-grandpa was a jeweler and he made it for her when they were just dating, saved it, and then proposed to her years later. It was crafted in 1912. My grandparents gave it to me on my 18th birthday, but I told my mom to hold onto it until I found the right guy, and then to give it to him when he asks permission to marry me. Even though those traditions are a little dated and patriarchal, when I saw the ring for the first time in almost 8 years, it was so incredibly special. Apparently my mom had such a hard time waiting she texted him every day asking if he'd asked yet. 

My sister has our other great-grandma's ring, and she's going to do the same thing. I like how it connects the women in my family in such a strong way. I'll wear the ring for the rest of my life, just like my great-grandma did. 

I also have her mammoth ivory necklace with her name carved in it. It's pretty darn cool.
