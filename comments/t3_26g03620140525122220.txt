> But we are talking 40 victims. 40! The Justice system failed the victims and the community

First, it says he admitted to 40 victims, it doesn't say what he was charged with or convicted of.

Second, how is this a failure towards the community?  Are you simply filled with bloodlust and want to see his head on a pike?  Or are you genuinely interested in seeing the system protect society and rehabilitate offenders?

Third, your entire argument boils down to supporting life without parole for sex crimes.  Is that something you're comfortable with doing?

>I think a big problem here is assuming someone Can be rehabilitated after hurting 40 people.

The science shows sex offenders are much less likely to reoffend as they get older.  Which begs the question: if the science says he's rehabilitated, what purpose does keeping him in custody serve?
