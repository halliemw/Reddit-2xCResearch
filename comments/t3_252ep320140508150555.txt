I got my first period when I was around 12 or 13.
I had a feeling I'd get it soon but actually looking at the first stains and globs of black made me freak out!
I cried for three days and refused to go to school because it HURT, I felt gross and disgusting and I could smell it all the time.
My mom made a point of aducating me on that matter, so of course I knew my options and what the hell my body was doing. She never held a "womanhood party" like one of my then-friends had to endure (drinking champagne with the whole family because your daughter bleeds? Seriously?) and I didn't think it felt "amazing to feel the blood slowly oozing out" like another friend said.
My only thought was "I don't want to have children in my near future. THEN WHYYYY?"
I still don't like shark week but I have an amazing bf who knows when the right time for chocolate, icecream and cuddles is and isn't angry at me for being emotional, irrational and a bitchy princess during my period. Also he's not afraid to talk about it or get me some pads or pain killers which is an A+ thing if you ask me :)
