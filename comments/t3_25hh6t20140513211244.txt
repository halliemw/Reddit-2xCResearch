Yeah, I'm Christian, which doesn't help the matter here. It seems like people assume that because religious people are willing to marry younger, means they all make bad decisions about who to marry, make rushed decisions, or simply can't be 'ready.' At least in my case characteristics of good relationships were drilled into our heads from the beginning of middle and high school. I was "lucky" and started dating a guy at 17 who has grown with me into someone I immensely respect and value. So we've been through thick and thin together for 4.5 years and will probably be getting married next summer. I think one thing that gets forgotten is that at least in my culture we value 'waiting' but we also value learning to be more mature in how you handle relationships earlier.

What is frustrating is some people in the Christian community value waiting late to get married while still holding the anti-sex viewpoint. You can do one or the other without too much difficulty, but doing both (unless you just don't date until you're older) is a bit much.
