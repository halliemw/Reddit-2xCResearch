Im not leaving.  Why? 

I think this move to make /r/TwoXChromosomes a default is the best thing to happen to it. Imagine if the USA had decided to keep other people out so no one would disrupt their majority way of thinking? We can't fear debate or different ideas to the point of wanting other voices to stay silent our out of the majority group. Let's face it, the PRIVILEGE in /r/TwoXChromosomes is ours to check and we should attempt to make it equal for all.

Feminism only works when equality is equal.
