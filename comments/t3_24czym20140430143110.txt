I'm so happy for you!

I work at 4:30am most days, so by the end of my shift at 1 or 2pm my customers will be asking me "what's wrong?" if I don't wear at least a light foundation, concealer, and blush. As a makeup artist, do you ever have issues with your eyes running/tearing up early in the morning? It's the reason I don't take the time to do my makeup for work. I usually do my hair/makeup after work and running for when I meet up with friends. If I do no makeup, I look exhausted, and if I do more my runny eyes mess up what extra effort I did put in.
