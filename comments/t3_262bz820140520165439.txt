I was irritated by that too. 

Oh yay, finally a female programmer!

Oh, and of course she just gets the guys to come do it for her. *sigh* Super frustrating, and its such a funny show otherwise. I mean, is it really THAT hard to include a woman in a show that isnt *just* a negative stereotype?

Its making me quickly lose interest in this show. Theyre lucky theyre on after Game of Thrones otherwise I'd probably have stopped tuning in after the 3rd episode or so.
