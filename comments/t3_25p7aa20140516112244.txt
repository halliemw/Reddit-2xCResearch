You hit the nail on the head.  It seems as if this sub consists only of; Was I raped? Do I have an STD? My friend was raped. Is my boyfriend abusive? I'm afraid of being raped. Is my vagina weird? Rape. And don't forget the bevy of posts about one sided looks at a relationship where 95% of the comments are, "break up now, divorce him, he's a pig, you're wonderful, that's abuse." 

Oh and rape.
