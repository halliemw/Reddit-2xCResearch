No one asked about money yet but I wanted to make it clear anyway that I will pay everything myself. It's a huge amount of money and it will take a big chunk of my savings,  but I can afford it. I could spend that amount on a long holiday or invest in an apartment but honestly, my nose is really affecting the quality of my life and I don't want to feel guilty about my own happiness. I realize that sounds really silly but I'm serious.
