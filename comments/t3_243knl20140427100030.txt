I'm recently single but haven't tried online dating because i'm not ready to date yet.  However, I'm in the same boat with wanting to meet new people and make new friends so I joined meetup.com.  It's pretty cool, like a website filled with clubs for adults!  There's something for everyone.  Maybe you'd like to check it out.
