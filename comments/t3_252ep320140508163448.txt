Ah, 14th October 2000 was the day. I just turned 10. I can't believe I've been menstruating for 15 years now and I have 20 more years to go... I actually didn't know anything about periods except incomplete information I overheard from the older girls. I put two and two together and went on with my day, I didn't even put on a pad, I didn't think I thought about it too much. Next month, same thing. My mom found out. I cried for hours, I was so ashamed of having it. She really wasn't prepared for the emotional outpour and made me put on a pad and that was that from then on. Wish she told me about tampons, they're so much easier to deal with. I also felt very lonely because I was the first one to get it out of my peer group in school. I felt so different, and the huge boobs that went with it didn't help. I think I still carry scars from then.
