Maybe that's the problem -- you've never stuck with a doctor more than a couple years max? 

You can't just expect to start seeing a new provider, ask for surgery, and get it right away. It doesn't work that way, at least not in my experience. 

For example, I've had chronic sinus issues my entire life that cause me a lot of pain and missed school/work/etc. I finally got a referral to an ENT and after my first consultation, his decision was "Well, we can try [everything you've already been doing your entire life]. Maybe after a year or so we'll talk about surgery."

If you establish a relationship with a gynecologist, humor him/her by trying less permanent BC options, and after a few years you're STILL adamant about your decision, chances are they're more likely to agree to a surgical sterilization at that point.
