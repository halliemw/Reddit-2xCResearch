I have this right now.  I'm a female physics major at a prestigious undergraduate school.  There are currently NO female professors in the physics department.  They just hired a new professor from a shortlist of three female candidates and one male candidate.  I thought for sure they'd get a woman, I had faith in them that they'd made this issue a priority.  Guess who was hired?

Until earlier this year, there was a men's bathroom in the physics lab with no corresponding women's bathroom.  After enough fuss was made, they finally put a unisex sign on it.  But, they failed to install trashcans for sanitary napkins and tampons, so it's still not sufficient to our needs.  I am not going to carry my used tampon dispenser out of the stall to put in the main trashcan, it is not a single-person bathroom and someone could very well see me.  NO.

This issue has really been getting me down lately.  I don't want to continue in physics, I want to go to engineering grad school, but I haven't thrived in this environment so I know it'll be a struggle for me to get into a decent institution.  I was such a promising student before I came here, and now I am not.  I feel like this system wants me out of here, and it is close to succeeding.
