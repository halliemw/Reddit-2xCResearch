This happened when I had just turned 18 and on my first night out at a bar. I'm enjoying the perks of being an adult (legal consumption of alcohol) and generally just having a good time out with my friends. This group of guys come and sit with us, and naturally we were all flattered. Guy sitting next to me opens with the worst opening line ever, **"Want to give me a blow job"**. That was it. I naturally said no, he called me a slut, he went off with his mates to chat up other women.
