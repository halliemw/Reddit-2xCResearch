Right. They seem to have this vision of depression as longing and heavy sighs... But really, it's just emptiness and filth. It's not pretty.

Bipolar mania is even worse :/ We now have this "manic pixie dream girl" archetype, but in reality, mania is terrifying. Sure, sometimes an up-swing just means extra energy and getting stuff done... Other times, it means a total disconnect from reality. A person with bipolar disorder is more likely to hurt/kill themselves during a manic episode than depressive. Before I was diagnosed, people thought that I was "quirky" and "exciting." Truth is, I would go through these terrifying periods where my brain WOULD NOT STOP and it was so fucking scary.

ugh. I'm ranting. Sorry.
