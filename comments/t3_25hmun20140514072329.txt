My last name is French (and I'm in a French-dominant area) and very old. It's also the least-common variant of a very common name and I'm a native English speaker fluent in French. I can't tell you how often I've been told I'm mispronouncing or misspelling my own name by Francophones male and female.

Edit: To people who may not be familiar with Quebec culture and therefore wonder how this comment is relevant, French is by *far* the culturally dominate language and English is often sidelined and maligned. So here, we have members of the dominate group informing a member of a minority group that she can't possibly *know her own name*. This is the same dynamic seen in "mansplaining."
