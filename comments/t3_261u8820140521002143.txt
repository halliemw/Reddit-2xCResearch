I also would totally read your memoirs if you were willing to write them. I think it would be a great perspective to have that, when safe, working in the sex industry can be fun, a legitimate career and can help someone achieve a sense of self and purpose in life. 

Someone here said start a blog; what about teaching seminars? And/or taking a part time job at an adult store? I have friends in the burlesque and the sex-positive education world here who are able to keep their lives separate from their "day jobs" by using an alter ego. There are a lot of fun things you could do with your experience!
