Used to live in Hackney:

- Have someone meet you at the bus/train if you can.
- Bike if you can.
- If you have to walk, stick to well-lit, main streets with lots of traffic. 
- Walk on the side of the street that is best lit/closest to shops. Keep crossing over if you have to.
- Get to know your local cornershop owner and stop in on the way home.
- Carry a fake wallet with a few Â£5 notes and coins in.
- Use a crappy mobile phone.
- Totally ignore catcallers and keep walking. Don't let them engage you in dialogue.
- Always be aware of who is around you and how close they are to you.
- Know where your escape route is.
- Learn to run away.
- Read Dead or Alive by Geoff Thompson.

We shouldn't have to, but I used to change into baggy clothing (trainers, jeans, hoodie) before leaving work to make myself more androgynous and hopefully less desirable target.

I ended up moving somewhere a lot safer. Good luck.
