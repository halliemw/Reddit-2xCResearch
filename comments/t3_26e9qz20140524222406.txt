I'm so sorry. I have experienced a lot of what you have, as well. I really recommend trying to get some counseling if you can. I did, and it helped a little bit, but I also did some reading and work on my own to help re-program my brain. And then I started taking Lexapro which has seriously been a miracle for me. I took SSRIs and drugs before and they never worked, and now I feel like a new woman. It's taken a LONG time to get here, but there is hope! PM me if you ever want to talk!
