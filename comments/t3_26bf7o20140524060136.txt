While I agree with you, it's hard to ignore that DIY is not something some women want to do. Also, Home Depot is trying to target women with that class, and some don't care to know how to sweat copper pipe, but would like to unclog a pipe and hang a picture. If they called it DIY 101 some women would not look into it and/or show it to their boyfriend.

It's a double edge sword, I knew more DIY stuff than my sister knew when I went to college, but I didn't know how to brown ground beef. 

Truth is everyone needs all of these basic skills to function as an adult.
