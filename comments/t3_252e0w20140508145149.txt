At what point was the word 'ban' or 'banning' used? The issue is that in the show murder is taken seriously, but this instance of rape is brushed to the side quickly afterwords. The issue is how that the show takes rape very unseriously, and it will create an issue later on because in the book one of the women who was raped later falls in love with her rapist.
