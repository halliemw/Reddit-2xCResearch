I'll reply to this! Sometimes one of the top comments might be something like "I'm glad you're feeling better after confronting her, but do you think you might have been a bit tough? ..."

An example is that someone was looking for a very late term abortion and most of the comments were saying this wasn't really possible and were offering supporting comments with alternatives (adoption, e.g.). 

We just like to feel like nobody is judging us, and instead we're all here to help!
