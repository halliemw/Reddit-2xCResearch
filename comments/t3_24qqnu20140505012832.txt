Last time I spoke out strongly against him was when I was 18 and a few months away from leaving for undergrad. I had enough of him and I pretty much verbally lashed out. Basically, entire family got involved, my mom stood up for me, he threatened to throw me out of the house and threatened divorce with my mom because "he wasn't appreciated enough". I had to walk home from school for a week because he refused to pick me up, and he refused to talk to me for a few more weeks.

My mother and I were so scared from his reaction that we actually mentally prepared to leave without notice, because we didn't know what he would do (would he take a knife out and threaten to kill us if he heard we were leaving? No idea what his brain was capable of thinking). In the end, he ended up changing himself for the better. No clear reason why, don't know if my yelling had any life-changing effect on him. He's MUCH better now than the dad I remember growing up, but it's still very frustrating dealing with the crappy parts that are still left.
