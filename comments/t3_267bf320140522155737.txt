I never expressed an issue with the words you mentioned, congressman etc. Given that most people accept that the -man part means person and not literally male, why is the word feminism being gendered towards women an issue when men also have words gendered towards them? Feminists are a diverse group of people so I can't generalize them all, but the majority of feminists I know also care about harmful male gender roles. For example, feminists want men to be able to be more involved in parenting. They advocate for more flexible work hours and paternity leave for dads. There's a huge amount of discrimination against men when it comes to child rearing and I have not met a feminist who didnt want to change that. Feminists want men to be able to do traditionally female jobs just as much as they want women to be accepted into male dominated fields. Yes there are radicals who want female superiority but the majority of moderate feminists just want to get rid of limiting and harmful gender roles. Feminism is for everyone, not just women. It just happens to be called FEMinism due to the roots of the movement.
