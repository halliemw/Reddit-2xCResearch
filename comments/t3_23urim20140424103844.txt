This is so inappropriate here. Look, if you want to suggest that she consider adoption, that's ok. But injecting judgment about how an abortion is unfair to something that can't even think yet is completely uncalled for. This girl has a lot to face. Pregnancy and childbirth at this age are not easy on your body, and she could very well see her grades suffer, she could lose prospective athletic scholarships if she's an athlete, she could get kicked out of any religious groups she's associated with, if she goes to a private school, she could be kicked out of that, too. 

She faces social ostracism and then, if she chooses to adopt, there's a whole host of emotional troubles that often come with that. It's not an easy process, and she'll be left with a pretty torn up body (that will heal) and hormones telling her she's supposed to have a baby to care for but no child, and a lot of conflicting emotions. It's a great option for those who choose it, but it's not an option everyone can face. 

Neither is raising a child at 15. If she does that, she's facing all of the above plus the responsibility to care for a baby at the age of 15 and she's basically in a position where if she wants a university education, that's out of the question for a while anyway. So get your judgment out of here and reserve it for a thread where we're debating the legality of abortion or generally where there's not a terrified 15 year old trying to get help.
