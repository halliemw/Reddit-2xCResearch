I had a positive experience going off the pill recently after being on it for several years. I noticed that my cravings for junk food definitely diminished, and I lost a few pounds. My boobs shrank about a cup size. Also my sex drive increased, or rather it went back to normal after being weirdly subdued on the pill. 

I got a Paragard IUD a couple of months ago. I strongly recommend going to someone who is experienced in placing them if you do decide to get one. My NP said she does a lot of them every week, many for young nulliparous women like me, and the process went very smoothly. I just took some Advil before (no cervical opener or anything) and went in near the end of my period. It hurt but not unbearably, and it was over quickly. So far I love it! My last couple of periods were crampy and rather heavy, but nothing like the horror stories you hear sometimes.
