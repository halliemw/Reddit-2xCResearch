Wrong, actually. I know that this is wrong because I grew up in a similar community. They don't "do their best to avoid sexualizing their children." They actively teach them that they are inherently sexual and that that's terrible, and that these girls (never boys, because boys are actually people, not things to be owned) should make hiding and denying and self-shaming that sexual nature the highest priority, because boys (the same boys who aren't taught to be "pure") will try to get them to have sex and if they give in, even under intense pressure, they're worthless whores because they didn't do "their job as girls" to say no. This starts being taught *really* young. You might benefit from a jog over to [NoLongerQuivering](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/nolongerquivering/) if you want to see what happens mentally and emotionally to girls who are raised like this.
