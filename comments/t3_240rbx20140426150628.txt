I got the non-hormonal paraguard iud 7 months ago.  Not gonna lie, the insertion was really uncomfortable and creepy feeling, but still manageable and I went and played a soccer game that evening.  It was about a week's worth of cramping and bleeding, like an extra bad period.  The next 2-3 months were heavier than normal periods, but after a few months, all is back to normal and I don't notice a thing.  I also do a lot of squats, deadlifts, running, and am in general super active, so no problems yet.  They'll tell you just to check for the string once a month after your period to make sure everything is still in place. Overall, I'm super happy I did it and happy to be off the hormones.
