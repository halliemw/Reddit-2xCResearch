I gathered that after looking at again. There isn't anything inappropriate about the article, it's just the way it's written. There is nothing about the article that is "wrong". I just don't really like how it's presented, but me not liking it doesn't make it wrong. She's allowed to express this how ever she wants, I just think it risks alienating some people when the point she is making is something that is very true that people don't really hear enough about.

I think it's mostly the sarcasm. Which is strange, because I usually like sarcasm. I think I would appreciated a more straight approach to this subject.
