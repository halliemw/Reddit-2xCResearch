Actually, I think this kind of throws water on the "teach rapists not to rape" theory.  These rapist know that rape is wrong - they are just psycopaths and don't care.  It's not like most of the rapes are committed by well-meaning guys who honestly don't understand concepts like consent and stuff - these guys are vicious criminals, ones that posters and educational campaigns don't work on.
