> Research is actively done to prevent people from dying of natural causes. However, the anti-choice movement isn't lobbying the government to research what they should consider to be the biggest tragedy and greatest killer ever. 

First of all, this is a false comparison. What does lobbying the government have to do with medical research? 

Anti-choice lobbies don't campaign for this treatment(?) because it is not physically possible. The entire concept of lobbying implies you actually have an influence on whats being decided. This is why, as you stated, they target actively induced abortions. 

> Plus, a fetus cannot be a person for the majority of the pregnancy.

Personhood is just a flawed social and philosophical construct. I'm not even getting into that argument.

> Currently, states like Iowa have introduced bills that classify abortion as murder, targeting abortionists and women who consent to them.

Even if they are targeted, and I agree that the women shouldn't be, that doesn't mean they'd be convicted, or even prosecuted. 

In the past, states had similar laws and there is no record of women being prosecuted, much less convicted, for getting an abortion in America. Most states had specific supreme court rulings that stated that women were not considered accomplices in the act of abortion. The laws targeted abortionists.
