If your best/good friends are really your friends, they'll understand and make time to meet you away from the others if you explain. If not, they weren't really your friends to begin with.

(In the UK, so different school system) when I was 10 I moved to a completely different town over 150 miles away from where I lived previously. A lot of the people at the new place were hostile precisely because I wasn't "one of them" but I made one of my best friends on the first or second day at the new school. During (our version of) high school I was getting completely sick of the group she was hanging out with. They were never as nasty to me as these people are to you, but they really weren't very nice/friendly people at all, especially since I was one of the kids the school dickheads didn't like. I eventually drifted off and started hanging out with other people or just in the library on my own in lunch breaks, but met up with my best friend after school/at weekends. She's still one of my best friends today.

What I'm basically trying to say is it's not worth hanging out with a bunch of people you don't like and damaging your self-esteem in the process, for the sake of seeing one or two people who - being friends - shouldn't mind making time to see you if you're happier and healthier being away from the other people.
