She needs to leave him, not only for her own safety but more importantly, your bother and sisters safety. I personally would drive three hours to beat the living snot out of him/disown him. Father or not. There is so much wrong with this scenario and how he's been acting. Reading your post has me literally jittery/shaking with anger at the thought of that happening to my mother/family.  I truly hope everything works out for you, your two siblings and your mother. 

I would go as far as advising a sibling to record it if possible, call the police.  Something needs to happen.. Don't wait.
