Even when it is shown it's on at weird times... the Sky Sports women's show is on at 10:30am on a Tuesday. What non-SAHM is going to be at home for that? 

At least track and field is relatively balanced... equal coverage in the Diamond League and major road races in general, but the overall coverage is a bit crap in non-Olympic years.
