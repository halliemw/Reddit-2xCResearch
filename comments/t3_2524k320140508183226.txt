This is how this sub will survive.  Be welcoming, ignore the trolls and accept that being a default sub will have good and bad aspects.  How this sub handles the increased traffic from people that are not like minded will define it's success or failure.  If the "sftu and listen" attitude or rules become the norm, this sub is over.
