I was torn because I've had moles removed for cosmetic reasons, but I also have one that I held back on because I was afraid of scarring - and I still want to get rid of it. However, your face is a scary place to risk a scar like that, and as my derm pointed out to me, we tend to overlook moles as being natural more so that scars. I would also consider what another commenter said about the possibility of the mole coming back. One of mine did and I had it removed a second time. It might not be worth the trauma to your skin if it's likely to come back again.
