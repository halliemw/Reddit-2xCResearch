Have you tried seeking out a counselor to take about this to? A neutral party like one will help you to come to the proper conclusion you need to see to make things right, whether that is staying or leaving. You don't deserve to be abused, even if it's "just" verbal or started "only" when you had your daughter.

Best of luck to you all.
