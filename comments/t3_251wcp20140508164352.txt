There's probably more women here than you think.

I think a lot of female-female relationships are built on conversation, including a lot personally meaningful conversation. They may not necessarily be seeking an outlet where they can gab or get opinions or share things with strangers, because they can gab or get opinions and share things with friends.

A lot of male-male relationships are activity-based. They go to the gym or watch sports or play video games together. A lot of their conversation is based around that activity. They may feel uncomfortable is being too open with each other, so the seek an outlet here. You can still be judged, but there are no *my bro thinks i'm weird now* consequences.

Just throwing that at the wall.
