I mean I understand your point but it's not like we don't have movies with female leads (you just listed 3 that have done well recently).    

 I don't really understand your sex scene point, as it's usually from a 3rd person point of view (if you could elaborate that would help me understand).    

There was a female masturbation scene in American pie, and other movies. And honestly I don't even see that much male masturbation in most movies....the only one that even comes to mind right now is American Beauty. But it's not something I see in most movies female or male.     

There is a lot more wrong with the rating system, granted sexism might be a problem, though I think your next example does not illustrate that.    

Everyone in magazines is photoshopped to look like a particular standard of beauty, so even though I agree that it's wrong I don't see it as particularly sexist.    

I guess it's just difficult for me too see these as primarily sexist issues because they are complicated issues. Do they have traits of sexism, sure. Should these issues be fixed, sure. Do I think sexism is very prevalent for me...not really. I guess it's just the way I was raised. I've never been told I couldn't do something because I'm female. I was never pushed away from science because I was a girl. So it's just not a focus for me because it's never hindered me in anyway (that I've been able to see). 


Edited: I know it exists and that it has effects on society as a whole. I know many women experience that, and it's not okay.
