This situation has so many parallels to a situation I've been going through its a little crazy. I'm sorry you had to go through that with a close friend, it is most certainly difficult. But I agree that for the best chance to mend the friendship, give it time before you try to bring up the break up. It's important to share your feelings, but if you do it before you guys are solid again, it could backtrack all the success you've had. Best of luck! Pm me if you need anyone to talk to!
