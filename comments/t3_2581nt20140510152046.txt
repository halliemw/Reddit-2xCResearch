I think the main issue-- along with the questions of choice and etc., which are important-- is that most doctors are reluctant to do elective surgeries on young people, because even the best elective procedures do have the potential for complication. 

In their view, it's better to wait for ten years than to (potentially) endure an *additional* ten years of surgical and medical complications that could have been avoided. Obviously tubal ligation (the most common sterilization) is a pretty standard procedure, but it still has some major risk factors:

> Major complications include heavy blood loss, infection and wound separation., general anesthesia problems, organ injury during surgery, and need for a larger laparotomy incision during surgery... Although fewer complications occur with laparoscopy than with other kinds of tubal ligation surgery, these complications can be more serious. For example, in rare cases, the bowel or bladder is injured when the laparoscope is inserted.

So basically most doctors are of the belief that it's better for a person to take birth control for ten years than for a 20 year old to not need birth control, but potentially suffer from bowel complications for years afterward.
