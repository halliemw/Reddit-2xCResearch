Thank you!    

Every year, Vancouver, Canada (and many other parts of the world!) organize this street festival to celebrate what used to be known as the harvesting season. It is also the day to celebrate the founding of the Sikhism community. All races and religions are welcome during this event, and it is a lot of fun!   

During Vaisakhi, local communities, companies, and families set up booths on the street to give out free food to the passersby. Think chana masala, naan, samosas, ice cream, candies – everything! On this day, everyone puts others first before themselves. It is an extraordinary time to give back to the community with love, good thoughts, smiles, and wonderful food!  

Vaisakhi is a religious experience as well as a fun, rambunctious one! There’s live music, multiple floats, and performance artists throughout the day. It is a crazy, fun, wild, sacred event! Around 100,000 people come to this festival too. I do encourage you to go one day. It happens every year in the month of April. :)
