its not as bad as the news is making it out to be.  As a student i can confirm that it is a small minority of the "popular" guys deciding who gets dibs on asking whom to prom.  there is no way to make a girl say yes and money was not involved except for one student.  Its simply a fun way to choose who gets to ask out the prettiest girl in kind of a fun way
