I wouldn't. To me, the problem with this mostly isn't sexism, though the fact that it's only fathers and daughters participating is rooted in sexism. It's that it makes any person's sex life the business of someone else and makes the statement that they don't have any agency when it comes to sex. That's not ok at all, no matter which gender(s) are involved.
