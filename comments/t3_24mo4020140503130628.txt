I too grew up with a similar dad and mom. Her position of peacemaker in the face of bad behavior caused much confusion and took me years to figure out. Your natural instinct is that his behavior is wrong and you should understand and accept your instincts. That being said, my advice is to ignore your mom, trust your gut, protect yourself, and REFUSE to even consider forgiving your father until he makes an acceptable apology AND works to fix his behavior. In the meantime, make your exit plan to remove yourself from this ongoing situation and find your own place to live. 

You deserve better than to be treated in such a way, and should not put up with it, regardless of his threats. He's wrong, and any position to the contrary is unacceptable, IMHO.  I would not have long, angsty conversations with mother, either. State your position, say it once, and then go on about your business. If he wants to be an ass in the future until you move out, leave the room. You don't have to tolerate it or witness it. Once you're out of the house, it's up to you who you visit with, and you can decide then. 

And if touches you in anger, or makes good on his threats, go straight to the police and help him learn a lesson in consequences.
