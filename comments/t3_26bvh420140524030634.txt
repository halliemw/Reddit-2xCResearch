Chick physicist, here! No words of advice, just commiserating::

Honestly, most of my peers are really chill when it comes to being in the classroom/not questioning my brains. Sometimes, they say shitty things in casual, non-physics conversation that make me snap at them. Sometimes, I get really pissed. There's one dude in particular that I cannot fucking stand ("Feynman is my favorite physicist because he wad so smart, and also good with the ladies!" Meanwhile, Feynman was a complete womanizer who often took advantage of women over whom he had some amount of authority/power...) I'm lucky, though, because there are 2-3 dudes who will actually support me when I call out sexist crap. They're good people! :)

My worst experience was actually with a professor. She's an experimentalist from China, and she's good at what she does, but she's got done crazy ingrained sexist beliefs, man! I used to sit in her shitty lab class and just fume about it every time she'd say anything related to gender. We had to give presentations at the end of the course, and she asked us to dress like we were presenting at APS. She was like, "ladies, no heels - they're ridiculous and make you found goofy when you walk - if you don't wear sensible shoes, no one will take you seriously." I don't particularly like wearing high heels, but I dislike being told I can't wear something if I want to be taken seriously even more. Especially when that something is stereotypically feminine. It took me forever to get dressed for that stupid fucking presentation, because I was worried that she'd think I was too girly (and thus not to be taken seriously!). Ugh.
