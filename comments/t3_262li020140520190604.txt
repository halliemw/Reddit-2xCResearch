For sure! I, for one, am definitely not the rebellious type (in fact, quite the opposite). But when you're given the freedom all of the sudden, you take it. For instance, when we got to junior high, we were allowed to leave school grounds for lunch for the first time in our lives. You better believe we went to 7-11 every day for the first few months, just to exercise our new privilege!
