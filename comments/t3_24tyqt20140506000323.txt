> Hep C which is controversial if sexual transmitted or not

I have never heard that it was controversial. I know a lot of people got HCV from blood transfusions before we started testing the blood supply, but I learned in clinical microbiology that most people now are getting it from sexual contact or needle sharing. You're right on to get tested, and you might also want to get tested for Hepatitis B which is transmitted the same way and has similar symptoms. Unless you work in healthcare at your age it's unlikely you were vaccinated against it and it can be just as bad or even worse than HCV. The test you would want (your doc should know this too) is called HBsAg.

Also make sure you get really regular pap smears for a while, and you might possibly be asked to be tested for high risk strains of human papilloma virus, which causes most cases of cervical cancer.
