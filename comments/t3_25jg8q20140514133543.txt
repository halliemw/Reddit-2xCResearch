This happens to my work jeans (I am a waitress). I buy some decent ones (usually from Gap) so they last a while, but they eventually tear between the thighs because the fabric rubs together so much from running around and bending down to pick things up. I've just learned to deal with it.

However, for dresses, I have found that Monistat chafing gel works wonders for when it's hot and my thighs rub together!
