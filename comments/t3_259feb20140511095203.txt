Encourage her to do what she wants to do, regardless of what her friends are doing. If she likes dolls, that's fine. If she thinks dolls are only for girls, or girls can only play with dolls, not so fine. If she likes playing with dinosaurs, that's fine, too! If she stops playing with dinosaurs because someone tells her they're not for girls/only for boys, that's not so fine. Really, she doesn't have to forgo dolls/a play kitchen/makeup (when she's older!); she just shouldn't be limited to those things, and you should give her examples of all the possibilities she has.

Basically, encourage her to be comfortable with who she is and stand up for herself.

Really, I haven't had to deal with too much. Yeah, having a period sucks, so I do what I can about that. Being ogled isn't at all nice (though it's rare that I'm treated that way), and I just give the guy a death glare. Having clothing companies assume that women all have one body type... really sucks. I have really broad shoulders and am somewhere between pear and hourglass shaped. Finding jeans that stay up and t-shirts that don't rip but also don't make me look like I'm wearing a burlap sack is awful.

But I also got through college with a Bachelor's in computer science, and now, I'm a software developer at a company where I make as much as my male peers because I'm as competent as they are, and that's recognized. (Granted, there's still a long way to go in wage equality in most places, but there's a lot of awareness now; the ball just needs to get rolling and stay rolling.) I have awesome, strong female friends, and my female relatives kick so much ass because we're all comfortable with who we are. My male relatives also rock and support all of us in our endeavors.

Be there for her, but don't try to shield her from every blow life may deal, or she won't be able to cope.
