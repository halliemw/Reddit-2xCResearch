Therapy is a great idea. 

I think it's entirely possible that he initially thought that he also would be fine with a happy accident, and now that there's a scare, he's realizing just how mistaken he was. I had horrible breast pain for a couple weeks in January and hadn't thought about pregnancy because I have an IUD. Although my husband and I had agreed earlier to rely solely on my IUD for contraception and that we would continue any accidental (and healthy) pregnancy, while I was waiting to hear back about the results of the blood test, I was panicking and trying to figure out how to justify having an abortion. I had thought I could be ready to have kids and that situation was a huge wake-up call telling me that I'm not. 

People who are scared generally aren't great about verbalizing what's motivating their actions, so OP's boyfriend coming off like a selfish douche instead. Of course, it's possible that he actually is just an inconsiderate douche, but hopefully talking more about the situation (especially with the help of a mediator) will help OP figure out which category he falls into.
