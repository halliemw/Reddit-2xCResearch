They did not call everyone liars, far from it. They said that most of the random commentors claiming that they received multiple harassing PM's were lies. There's a big difference.

Those reports were through admin mail and coming from users other than the person making the claim (because the person making the claim knew it was a lie) those were the reports that were false flags. The scaremongering comments about a sudden deluge of PM's were trying to incite worry and fear in others were the lies, not every instance of harassing PM. 

Those comments not only worked to make others worried but they also likely emboldened actual trolls to "get in on the action" so to speak. Those are the people you should be mad at, the ones that claimed to be on the side of this community actively sabotaging us by lying and sending their own harassing messages.
