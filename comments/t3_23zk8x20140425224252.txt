I'm a mom to a 4 year old and 2 year old. 

I know a *lot* of other mothers (clubs and play groups and such), and I can tell you that this is a common theme among parents (or at least moms).  You try so hard to do what needs to be done, and, at the end of the day, you feel like you didn't do enough. Like you need to be better. Give more. Be kinder. It's so easy to beat yourself up.

Here's what you need to know. Your child has a loving mom who works to support him and reads to him and plays with him when she gets home. He also has a father and grandparents who live with him, so he has more loving adults in his life daily than most kids. He's a very loved little guy, and you're making it work! 

Everyone deserves time to step away. I think it's best to talk to the adults you live with to figure out some good boundaries here. Do the grandparents care for your son all day? When you go out after work, does that mean they continue to care for him? Is the dad capable of caring for your son, or not? If he is capable, then I think it's reasonable for you & him to be able to work out evenings when you can each get time away, guilt-free. If he's not capable, then I'm afraid you're going to need to work things out with the child's grandparents. If they watch the child all day and are too tired to watch him in the evenings, too, could your son go to day care once or twice a week to lighten the load? Find a solution that works for everyone so you can get some healthy time away and so the grandparents aren't overburdened.
