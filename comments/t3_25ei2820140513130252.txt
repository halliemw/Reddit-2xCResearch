The Democrats have been doing that all along. Did you watch the last national convention? It was one big inspiring tearjerker geared mainly toward women. Not that Republicans haven't tried the same thing - they just generally suck at it. The Democratic Party is very, very good at marketing and Republicans are just starting to realize they have been out-marketed. A lot of the anger some women feel towards ALL republicans, in fact, comes from the effectiveness of the Democrat marketing genius. We don't like admitting it because it means we have been manipulated, but nearly every large organization in the US is trying to manipulate our emotions at all times. It's the norm. 

And women aren't the only folks who succumb to it, but the narrative is slightly different when targeted toward us than toward men.
