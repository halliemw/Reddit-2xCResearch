>Q: How much does an abortion cost?
>
>A: Under the Canada Health Act, a woman should not have to pay for abortion services. However, access is variable across the country and women are charged fees at some facilities. In Ontario, a valid Ontario Health Insurance Plan card (OHIP) will cover 100% of the cost of service in hospitals or in a licensed clinic. Non-licensed clinics charge a fee.

>University Health Insurance Plans and the Interim Federal Health program will also cover the full cost directly. If you have other provincial health insurance, you will be required to pay for your services out of pocket. You can seek reimbursement from your home province.

>If have no health insurance, you will be required to pay for your services out of pocket. At Choice in Health Clinic, surgical abortions cost $400.00. At this point, medication abortions are only available for clients with OHIP.

>Q: What if I can't afford the cost?

>A: Don't worry! There are a number of patient-assistance funds available to help you cover the costs of your procedure. At Choice in Health Clinic, we are committed to providing access to all women, even those unable to pay for services. Please call us if you have any concerns about your ability to pay, and we will discuss some of the options available with you.

>Q: I am a member of the Canadian Armed Services. Will I have to pay for my procedure?

>A: No. Members of the Canadian Armed Services have National Defence cards, which allow them to access health services in their province of residence. Choice in Health Clinic is an authorized abortion provider for members of the Canadian Armed Services.
