You didn't do anything wrong!!

I work in a very male dominated industry, and we have one of those guys at my job too. He started the same week as me, and at first we got along pretty well even though he would say a lot of sexist things (not specifically about me). Then, after a few months, he decided I was a bitch, unworthy of his "kindness" and he will now constantly try to bring me down, scoff at me and tell me I'm not as good at my job as I think I am. 

I just try to ignore him, because he's one of those who will try to bring others down to feel better about himself.
