I'm sorry for your loss.

Mother's day can be difficult for me as well, because although my mother is alive she has a lot of mental health issues and wants nothing to do with me.

Its been two years since I've spoken to her and I will never be able to have an adult relationship with my mother for other reasons. It is definitely not the same severity and issue that you have, OP, but I agree with the sentiment that all people with good mother-daughter relationships should appreciate the love and guidance they bring. It's something I wish I could have but I have had to grow up without.
