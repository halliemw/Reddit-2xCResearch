Your roommate is super rude, but the good news is that there are often rules in place because landlords/neighbors hate rental properties with too many people.

How many people are allowed to live in your residence according to the lease? My apartment is allowed 2 and my landlord needs to be notified if someone stays over more than 7 days in a month (if so, they're considered a tenant and I'll be asked to pay more). Every place I've lived has a rule like this.

If it isn't stated in your lease, there may be a limit according to city ordinance. College towns often have a 2-nonrelateds-per-address rule. 

Once you know where you stand, you can have a conversation along the lines of "hey, your girlfriend is nice and I don't mind having her around but it wasn't cool that key giving + open door policy was done without discussion [especially because our landlord or city law, if it applies]. What I'd like to propose is [limiting around the clock visits to Fri thru Sun, you picking up a higher percentage of utilities, her pitching in just like a roommate, shared spaces continue to be shared, clean, available when you need them, whatever it is that you need to make this liveable]." 

There's nothing wrong with you addressing this retroactively, especially when it sounds like they just sprung it on you then coasted on the sea of you being too-busy-to-notice.
