Sure, I get that we're only hearing one side. But therapy isn't going to hurt, esp. if they are just fighting and not actually using the conflict as a catalyst to solve problems. I would hope the therapist could suggest strategies for actually resolving the problem, which is why it would be good to have both parties on board with it.

Also, I thought she said that she was looking onto therapy covered through their insurance. Let me check...edit: yep. exactly how much is covered, I have no idea.

Finally, some other posters had mentioned that she should force him to go. Well, she can't. If he isn't going that's up to him. But she could still try and get some advice.
