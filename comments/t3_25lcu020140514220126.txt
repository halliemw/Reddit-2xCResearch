There's an insult behind every word, look, and action if you're looking hard enough for one. He probably doesn't know anything about bikes ( hence, buying bikes at Costco), but I wouldn't confuse that with him thinking you're incompetent. 

If you've been riding as long as you say, your dad is getting old, and he won't be able to ride bikes with his daughter for that much longer. You have a choice of either enjoying his active years or driving yourself crazy trying to change him.

EDIT: Costco employees must be down voting me like crazy.
