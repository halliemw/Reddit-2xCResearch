>Is there something like that, that you deal with on an almost daily basis, living in the area, that you live in now?  

No, not even slightly. But to be fair, my wife would give you the same answer. Like I said, I live in a relatively safe place. It's May and my town has not had a single violent crime this year. It isn't about me being male, it is about me living in a town of 3000 people. I will admit that all other factors being equal, women have more reason to be afraid, I was never really trying to argue that point. Again, you asked for a male point of view, if we ever feel scared or in danger, and I was just saying that yeah, sometimes we do.
