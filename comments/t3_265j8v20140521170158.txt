Just because *you* don't think you're pretty when you're coming in from gardening or whatever, doesn't mean that *he* doesn't think you're pretty then. Like I said, he clearly does... or he wouldn't be complimenting you. Even if you don't agree with him, honestly I think it's rude to just retort to a compliment with "No I'm not." You could at least say, "Aw, thanks for complimenting me. I don't feel so hot right now but I'm glad you think I do!" 

If you want him to compliment you when you're all dolled up, then tell him! He's not a mind reader! Just say something like, "Hey I really appreciate when you compliment me but I would appreciate it if you told me I looked nice a little more often when I get dressed up."
