I'm only 5 years out of college, and all I can say is, prepare for a LOT of mansplaining. 


 Especially upon first meeting older male engineers - I think part of it is they just don't quite know how to interact with young women, so that's what they default to. I find that smiling and nodding and acting genuinely greatful for the advice they are force-feeding me (even if it's common sense shit and it's kind of insulting that he thinks I don't know it) leads to a good first impression and they usually stop doing that and learn to respect me once we get to working with each other. I'm ok with temporarily swallowing my pride so long as it's for some one more experienced than me and I can prove myself as we go along.


I still don't know how to handle mansplaining from men my same age with same or less experience though... Grrr they bug me so...
