I am opposed to vigilante justice, and would certainly hope that no one would suffer negative consequences as a result of the list and that it would only be used by other students to protect themselves and exercise caution. 

However, that doesn't change that posting lists of administrators (while perhaps more just and certainly less harmful to the accused) wouldn't do anything to actually protect students in the short term. It may shame administrators into more action in the future (although I have doubts about how powerful students are, the extent to which administrators care about their opinions, and whether there would even be enough evidence to expel or otherwise punish students determined to be guilty by the administration - which is something that is impossible to address from the information we have but I think is sort of crucial when discussing what action the administration should have taken), but it would take quite some time before it would actually affect the campus atmosphere and probably not affect any of the students on that list (if they are guilty) or protect their past or future victims.
