I guess because of that whole sex=pizza thing. (bad pizza is still pretty good). We all need to make human connections, no reason to beat yourself up. You did what you did, you might have made some mistakes, you'll move on. It does get easier, I've been single a while now and it's actually pretty great. I'm still jealous of my girlfriends who can have casual sex and feel great about it. For years I wanted to be like that, but I'm just not, and that's ok. You too.
