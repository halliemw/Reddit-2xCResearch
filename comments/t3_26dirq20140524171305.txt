That is my understanding as well,  but if we ran with Neko's position,  what would this mean?   Are we to never discuss men and women as being distinct?  That doesn't seem helpful and has the potential to just brush discrimination faced by both genders under the rug by giving us no way to discuss these issues.  

I don't think you can just pretend that men and women are exactly the same, especially when they aren't treated as such by society.  So being able to say "women in x" or "men in x" is frankly just really useful and,  at times,  necessary. 

You mentioned highlighting differences.   Don't you think that is what happens when you're allowed to say the phrase when men are the subject,  but are then ridiculed for doing so when the subject is women?
