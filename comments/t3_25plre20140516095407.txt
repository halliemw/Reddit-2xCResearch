Yeah I thought about a tag too.  I was amazed at how much better the "Serious" tag made AskReddit.  But yeah, you can't really make it ban "stupid questions."

So far, I actually haven't been as troubled by the posts as much as the comments.  Most of the posts have seemed on topic and interesting, or at least unchanged from before the defaulting.  It's the comments that are gettin' me down.
