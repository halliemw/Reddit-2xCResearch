Good on you for seeking help. I truly think she needs to speak to a professional. 

I had post-natal depression after the birth of our second child, and it was hell. Our baby wouldn't sleep for more than an hour at a time, and that was if she was lying on me. She would be on the boob for hours at a time. I was exhausted, a hormonal wreck, I felt like my entire life was slipping away from me because I couldn't keep on top of the baby, toddler, house, meals etc. 

What would have been the most help for me (and it may be different for your wife, ask her what she needs) would have been someone taking the baby off me and letting me sleep for a few hours. Take the baby where I can't hear her cry, and just let me sleep. Everything is so much easier to handle after a few hours sleep. 

Just remember it won't be this way forever. She might be feeling hormotional and she's directing it in hurtful ways towards you because she doesn't know how else to deal.
