So what's the point of making 2x a default then? To prove that you guys exist? Isn't that somewhat excluding women from the club, as if to say "hey, you guys need your own place," then putting you in one subreddit? I think making 2x a default is going to raise awareness that women exist on reddit, but it's also going to make males irritated that they have to see content that is absolutely irrelevant (to them) on the front page. I propose that we add /r/oney to the defaults as well, so it doesn't polarize all of reddit vs females only in 2x. The way the defaults are set up now, it makes it seem that the rest of reddit is male, and 2x is female. I say if we add /r/oney we end up getting /r/oney (male), /r/2x (female), and /r/rest (neutral).
