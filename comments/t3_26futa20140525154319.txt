I agree that the guy has lost it, but disagree with the inferred connection between his feelings, the Men's Right's movement, and online body building forums.  He sought those groups out with the belief that they may share his frustrations and his anguish, and he did so through the internet.  Aside from being an inherently detached medium, these internet forums seemed to disagree with many of the views he espoused.  

This is a case of a lonely, sad, desperate man.  Any inference that these views are related to the communities that he was briefly associated with before his crimes, is ad hominem at best and prejudicial at worst.
