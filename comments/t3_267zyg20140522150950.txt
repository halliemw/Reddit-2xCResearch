Much. 

It was a period of much growth for me. I realized sometimes asking for help is the most adult thing I could do. I started therapy to learn to better deal with conflict (I used to just avoid at all costs) and recently was told by a temporary supervisor that they really respected the way I handle conflict, that they felt they had learned from me, and were using my techniques with their family. I also began exploring non-monogamy which has let me find several lovely relationships since. It also gave me an interesting stint in NYC, which I'm glad is over, but I'm sure will give some stories a little bit of awesomeness just because they'll start off â€œwhen I was living in Brooklyn".
