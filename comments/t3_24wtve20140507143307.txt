You're welcome. While I did not study law, I did study in a subject known for eating it's young and I've dealt with plenty of criticism in the past. I currently have an micromanaging boss and I've learned a lot from dealing with that situation. I'm not suggesting that your boss is doing you a disservice by not coddling your or pointing our your errors, I see the way in which he's doing it is not conducive towards you actually improving or helping his bottom line. He doesn't need to be super nice or sugar coat the message, but he does need to allow you the space to fix your own mistakes. Law is not the only profession that requires strict attention to detail, nor does it excuse one from being unproductive in the face of errors. I do think it's best to keep the job until you find a new one, but as a few people chimed in to note that this office is hardly representative of the environment of most law offices I would not jump to the conclusion that you're not cut out for the profession. Best of luck with your interview :)
