Honestly I think /u/whoatethekidsthen misread it, although the wording wasn't the most clear.  Personally I understood the original post but I can see how someone might misinterpret it.  Anyway this sub is supposed to be a respectful space and I'd be disappointed if it devolved into a place full of name-calling.  Finally, why do you automatically assume /u/whoatethekidsthen is a guy?  I feel like that might be a bit telling about your mindset.
