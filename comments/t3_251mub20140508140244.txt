This brings up the annoying issue of agency.  Qualifying the statement of "you can wear anything you want" with "except for that, if you choose that you're conditioned and brainwashed" isn't really helpful in terms of women's rights.  This obviously doesn't apply to countries that enforce the hajib with stoning, but if someone can call themselves a Feminist and live, they probably don't live in such a country.
