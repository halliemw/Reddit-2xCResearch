1. He showed up in person to your house
2. He will not respect your wish for him to stop contacting you.
3. You are scared for your own safety.
4. He made thinly veiled allusions to death.

Those four elements should be taken seriously, for the both of you. 

Although it's quite common for guys around that age to use threats of suicide as a last resort tactic to guilt the object of their unrequited love into showing care for them, 99% of the time nothing comes out of it. BUT, it's always better to err on the side of caution. Aside from the obvious issue of your own security, there's also elements here that could point to him being a danger for himself and/or having developed some mental health issue. 

At this point, I would advise you to report him to authorities, for your own safety and his. If he wasn't dangerous at all, he'll get a good scare that should stop him from ever bothering you or any other girl the same way ever again; and if he had real plans to do something bad, it will bring it into the open and snip it in the bud.

Hope for the best, plan for the worst, act decisively.
