Yes, this! Lara was a fully rounded, well-crafted character with her own story, and the game was focused on her journey. She was feminine without being stereotypically girly and it was more about her as a person than as a woman. She was the main character so she did the rescuing rather than getting rescued.

I absolutely loved this game despite its other flaws and I'm hanging out for the sequel. I firmly believe that having more games with female protagonists similar to Lara in the sense that the story is about them as a person rather than as a woman will get more women interested in gaming.
