I got my Mirena put in at 21 without any problems at all. My doctor never even mentioned my age or relationship status as a factor in the decision. If your doctor won't give you a safe and reliable birth control method just because you're young, then they're outdated and not providing you with the best possible care. Find a new doctor who will.
