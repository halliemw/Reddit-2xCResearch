1. So? She has the right to feel creeped out, the right to not like it, and the right to have to not deal with her boyfriend's dismissive shit.

2. She got sexually assaulted. The guy who did it is creepy, because he sexually assaulted her. What don't you get?

3. Her boyfriend can't see that his attempts with a willing partner isn't the same as her x's continual attempt with full knowledge that it wasn't ok.

Her boyfriend is wrong.


ETA: I'm not condoning the violence in 2. though. That shit is fucked up.
