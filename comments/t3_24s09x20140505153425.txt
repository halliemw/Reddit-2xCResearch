Lisak, one of the authors of the study cited, has stated that undetected rapists have very traditionalist attitudes toward gender roles - they think men should be in the dominant role, while women are submissive. It seems likely that such attitudes could be combated at the societal level though it would take more than a poster campaign to do it. I suspect that they will slowly fade away over time, even if we do nothing.
