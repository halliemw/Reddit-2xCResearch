Absolutely do this! It really is wonderful. I did a ton of volunteer work after my last breakup and it was a tremendous help. It provided a break from routine, I met a ton of new and interesting people. Most importantly, it gave me something bigger than myself to focus on. At the end of the day I felt like I had accomplished something meaningful, that's a real self esteem booster.
