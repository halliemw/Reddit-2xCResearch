This type of comment is precisely why people see that as a good thing.  Even when girls prove themselves as equal or better than boys, there is the presumption that it does not come from knowledge, or from the capacity to acquire knowledge, but from being good at "building relationships."  It should come as no surprise that after being branded as baby making machines for so long, we celebrate the fact that we can be as good as boys in every field.  Good grades generate pride, a feeling of self-worth and it could encourage more girls to go into stem related fields, if only society would back off from pressuring girls to get married and reproduce, and if people would just celebrate their grades instead of assuming that they come from "kissing up."
