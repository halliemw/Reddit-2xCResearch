ermagad, college sex stories. so many medal winners in the cringeolympics.  
1st time i had sex (ever.) i was on day 5/6 of my period, with a just-in-case tampon in, and at this guy's nearby childhood home, in his bed, for the first time (we'd previously only hung out on campus). EVERY NERVE ACTIVATED. so naturally, brilliantly, i let things progress and *never take the tampon out.* we do sexing, i drive back to my apt, unholy freakouts commence.  
no one picture me in full squat in the shower, heart racing, weeping the weep of the wretched repentant sinner, prayers and swears flowing freely, hoping with all my hopes to pinch that godforsaken string between my fingers. no pics; didn't happen.  
my hopes were dashed, nay drowned, as i began to accept i'd dug as far as i could dig and discovered nothing.   
i went to the campus nurse and lied about being too drunk to remember if i'd had a tampon in when my ~~coworker~~ boyfriend and i ~~shared in the loss of my virginity, among other things~~ made sweet committed love. she was understandably dubious and, likely reacting to my poorly masked panic, commits to a certain exercise in futility. she spends 5 mortifying minutes spelunking in my newly deflowered vag, before finally coming across the little hellbeast, cowering in a corner at the unspeakable horrors to which she's fallen victim. few tampons have seen what she's seen.  
no idea if the guy ever knew, or what that hero nurse must've said about me to her nurse club friends. (that's a thing right?)  
Edit: crafting actual words out of letters  
**tl;dr: mine eyes have seen the horror of the cumming of the sword: a tampon's worst nightmare**
