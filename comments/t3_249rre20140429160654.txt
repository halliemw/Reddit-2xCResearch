I think "the Christian view" is an extremely broad term. Traditionally? Yes. However at this point in time I do believe there are many Christians, and even Christian leaders, who believe in egalitarianism. I always try to weigh my beliefs with what the bible says but the fact is, even though it was divinely inspired, it was written by men and was therefore colored by their worldview and the worldview that long ago was very different than what many people believe today. I'm not trying to start an argument with anyone, I was just sharing my opinion and personal experience.
