You have a choice. 

You can waste away your life imprisoned by your own fear, or you can get out there and start trying stuff to make your life better.

Go get that page of in-network psych folks and just call the one that is closest to your house. RIGHT NOW. Just dial the number and make an appointment or leave a message to make one later. Go to the appointment. Start taking action and just see what happens.

If you continue down your current trajectory, things will only get worse. It's going to take some courage and some blind experimentation to push forward. But pushing forward can only IMPROVE your life.
