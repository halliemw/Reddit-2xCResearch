I kinda have to stick to a routine or i break out like crazy.

For me it's just basic wash my face, toner, and moisturize with a mix of Argan oil and vitamin E oil, then put on an overnight face mask (one specifically designed for using before you go to sleep, not the normal clay ones), and read a little bit while waiting for it to dry enough that it won't get all over my pillow.
