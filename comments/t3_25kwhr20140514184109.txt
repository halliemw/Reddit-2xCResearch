I was thinking about this earlier today. Stunned by the amount of downvoting in a subreddit that is supposed to be a supportive community. I go through cycles with reddit, sometimes being here a lot sometimes hardly at all. I've recently come back after an hiatus. I'm curious has the downvoting pattern changed since the move to being a default?
