>a lot of women don't want to state otherwise...

#I've often let Ã‰owyn say it for me. :p http://i.imgur.com/C5EU0Wi.gif

A while ago when someone gave me extensive help in a thread, another person made a sexual "joke" about (the helper) and me. It was clear that Mr Jokester thought we were both men.

When I (attempted to) humorously respond by saying his joke failed because I'm not a guy, he went into full lunatic mode... including a delightful spiel about women always wanting everyone to know we're women.

Weirdest thing was that it was his 'joke' that had brought gender into the conversation....
