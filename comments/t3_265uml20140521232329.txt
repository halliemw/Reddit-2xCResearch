I have known several women who got abortions and told their BFs that they had miscarriages because, I was told, that was what the guys wanted to be told. The abortion gets them out of child support etc, but making it a miscarriage absolves them of guilt. So the question is, do you care about them enough, or want to keep them enough, that you would conceal it from them?
