I used to agree with Feminism, I am a guy, however the way I see women use this denomination is truly repulsive. The whole point of Feminism was to put women on par with men in all opportunity of life however; most women nowadays use it as a means to get ABOVE men. The whole 'i'm a woman so hold the door open, buy me food, a new purse, and if you don't your a jerk' is really pathetic. Human beings should be treated equally as human being regardless of their color or gender and any sort of single denomination empowerment just turns into a way of getting ahead of anyone else.
