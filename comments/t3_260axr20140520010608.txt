Ugh is right... India is a huge country and a better functioning democracy than the US as The Daily Show pointed out.
 

Luckily where I live in the bay area there are so many minorities I don't think it's common to get blatant racism (or I don't as an east Asian). I haven't heard of any glaring incidents of racism from my Indian friends but it's not like I've asked.  From my perspective here there is racism, but it's quiet.  Hopefully as globalization continues the world will not seem so full of strangers
