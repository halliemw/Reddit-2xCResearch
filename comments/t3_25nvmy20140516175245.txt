You say only 6% of rapes are false because only 6% are proven to be false claims. However, using your same logic I could say only 15% of accusations result in a conviction, meaning that 85% of rape claims are false. It's impossible to determine exactly what percent of claims are false, but ask any cop who works with rape and rape victims. They'll tell you that a huge amount of rape accusations are women who got a little drunk, had sex, regretted it in the morning and cried rape.

>So when you operate from the ground that the victim is lying right from the start, you're making a huge leap in logic. If you want to talk about logic.

What did the officer say in OP's post that implied he "assumed they were lying." What if I said "LeBron James raped me." Then when they asked for evidence, I say "why are you assuming I'm lying?" Just because he asks questions doesn't mean he's "assuming they're lying." Have you ever heard of innocent until proven guilty. When you say someone commited a crime they don't just take your word for it.

>Its also an incredibly misogynist and pervasive myth against rape victims based on the idea that women just lie all the time and just lie about rape to hurt good men. Its incredibly rare and incredibly damaging to perpetuate, because the more numerous actual victims don't come forward or aren't believed.

Of course, you're hiding behind the usual shield of "oh, if you're suspicious about rape claims then you are hurting real victims!" Also, that paragraph reeks heavily of someone who believes in rape culture, which if you are one of those people tell me now so I can stop wasting my time on you.

>So no, I'm not out of my mind.

You might be a smart person in most instances, I don't know you, but in this case you're definitely wrong.
