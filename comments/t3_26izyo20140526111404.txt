Wow, I've never once heard chemical castration come up as a male birth control method. That's like suggesting a hysterectomy for female birth control.

Anyway, I wish the FDA would let Vasalgel through. Also I think vasectomies should be less expensive. Both these methods are relatively easy, safe, and in 99% of cases, reversible, unlike IUDs, tube tying procedures, and other medications and methods only women can use. I wholly believe the biggest reason they aren't out there is because BigPharma and the medical community will stop making money off hormonal birth control for women (and the associated health problems that stem from them).

I'm glad you're asking about this as I think the first step towards getting men to share the responsibility for birth control is talking about it.
