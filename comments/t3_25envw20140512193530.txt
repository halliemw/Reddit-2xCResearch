Right now, it may just be best to read and think. This is a good place to be exposed to some of the gender issues. 

This subreddit is going through a stressful time right now. I think regulars are eager to ensure their voices are not being drowned out by the new influx, and therefore may be quick to downvote those who express an alternative opinion, or expressing a corroborating opinion but do so clumsily. We are now getting more posts than ever before that come from a place of ignorance and prejudice than ever before, and it is easy to be so on the defensive you misinterpret someone's post and/or assume the worst of someone.

/r/askwomen is not going through this upheaval. If you have specific questions, that could be a good place to go. That subreddit tends to be generally friendly to people who come from a place of compassion who just want to learn more.
