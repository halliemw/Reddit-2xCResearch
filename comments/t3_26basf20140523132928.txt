I got a full scholarship to a top grad school in my desired field and guess what...IT ALSO COMES WITH A LIVING STIPEND! So instead of taking on a lot of debt, like I was expecting, I'll come out even. I'm incredibly excited.

On top of that, I'm leaving work in a few days to take a real summer vacation before I start. Because I can afford to do that now. Hell yeah life!
