Meeting men is like trying to get new friends. Actually, the best way to meet men is to make new friends(male or female). Get out of your comfort zone. Do new things, be open to new people in your life. Invite them to eat/drink in restaurants or at home. Go to music shows. Just be out there, get out of your house, will meet people that will present you people and I guarantee you'll find one. 

Also fuck dating sites, it doesn't work. Didn't for me at least.
