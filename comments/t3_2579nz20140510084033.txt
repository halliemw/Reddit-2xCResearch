I'm so sorry that this is happening to you! 

I had a stalker in college, and the worst part was that somehow he made me feel like the bad guy, like I was responsible for his actions and feelings. After telling my sister the story, she convinced me to go to school administrators and they were super helpful and supportive and you deserve the same!

So my advice is this: go to a teacher or someone else that you trust and like. They will help lead you through the process, even if you end up talking to someone you don't know. Remember that you don't need to apologize for your actions or his. I felt embarrassed airing my dirty laundry to others, but it's not your dirt! You are blameless! And do please try to talk to others about it. Even if they can't do anything yet, it's good to have it noted that this has happened so far and will make them more able to help if he continues or escalates. Take care of yourself!
