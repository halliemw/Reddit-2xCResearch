I had been on BC since like 13 up until a year ago. I got off of it while I didn't have insurance and a job. It was the worst time of my life. Every period was agony, regular drugs didn't touch the pain, and I couldn't get anything prescribed. It was awful. I could hardly think at times it hurt so badly. I had to pay an ungodly amouny of money in tampons. I was incredibly emotional around that time, almost bipolar in a way because I would just suddenly snap on my SO. I didn't loose any weight and my boobs didn't shrink. 

I had an awful time off of it because my awful periods and emotional Rollercoaster. I got on the nexplanon two months ago and I could tell be happier. Hope it works out better for you.
