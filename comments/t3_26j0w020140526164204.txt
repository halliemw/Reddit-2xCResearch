>When you say "get", you mean "have sex with".

No. I reject this premise and thus your entire argument.

>If instead of using "get" to mean get sex, we use it to mean get romantic needs fulfilled, then no, it's not easier for women to "get" men than vice versa.

The first thing either sex needs to do is get the other sex to take interest. It's easier for women to get men to take interest because men are typically interested by looks first. As long as a woman doesn't do anything insane, if she walks up to a dude, and he's single and says "Hey, I think you're cute. Lets get a drink sometime" everything will go fine. The reverse will not work most of the time unless the dude is either REALLY smooth or REALLY good-looking and at least a little bit smooth. Any awkwardness and that shit gets canceled. If there is awkwardness on the woman's side it's probably not going to be that big of a deal, as long as it isn't egregious. That's just in a one-off stranger approach type situation. I'm not even getting into the repeated exposure situation which requires MUCH more finesse.
