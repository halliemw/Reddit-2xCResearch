What everyone else said, plus: don't pull a "what about the menz?"  This is when we are discussing a woman's issue and someone comes in and says "it happens to men, too" and tries to reframe the conversation away from the female experience we were discussing.  While there is nothing wrong with discussing men's issues, this tactic is used as a way to silence women's concerns and belittles their experiences.  

Ooh, found a cool blog post on what is wrong with the ["what about the menz?" stuff](http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/10/18/phmt-argument/)
