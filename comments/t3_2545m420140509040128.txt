I've never had a super regular period and can never really predict when it's going to come (I'm also not on BC so I don't have anything regulating my cycle). It never comes early but usually anywhere from a regular monthly cycle to 2/3 weeks past when it should come. Luckily, it always tends to start with a trickle rather than a flood. What I do is pretty much stash a few tampons in every purse/backpack I own so I'm never far from one when the time comes! When we started dating my boyfriend briefly thought I used to stash bright colored candy in all my bags because I use U by Kotex. It was pretty funny when he asked about it. Funny enough, the one time I did need him to run for tampons he didn't even need a picture because it's the only kind in a black box!
