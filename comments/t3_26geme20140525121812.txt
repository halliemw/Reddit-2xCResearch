Sounds like you guys are friends, and he didn't have any bad intentions about the question... I believe he was genuinely concerned about your current health, and blurted out what came to his mind instead of carefully choosing his words. Who knows, his words might be what you needed to do something about the situation. You stated that you are ashamed and disgusted, thinking about it doesn't change a thing. If you don't want negative consequences like depression or a steadily deteriorating self image that will lead to social isolation, you need to choose between these two options: Embrace that you are who you are, don't be ashamed and come to terms with your own weight... or find a solution to your weight problem. No, not a crash diet, or extreme workout program... figure out what has changed to make you gain weight, what needs to be changed, and try to switch over to a healthier and more active lifestyle.
