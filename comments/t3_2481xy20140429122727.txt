I had a vestibulectomy. I was placed under general anesthesia. I was not really supposed to/allowed to move around for a week after, which I was very good about. I iced and took hydrocodone for the first couple days and then just took ibuprophen as a precautionary measure for another day or so, then nothing. I started to walk around seven days after. The second week I worked from home and tried to move around very little so as to not pull any stitches. They were also dissolving stitches (yours will be too). I was allowed to work out I think during week four. There was no infection and pain was surprisingly minimal during the healing process. I think the biggest problem for me was mental (I was very nervous and scared of pulling a stitch or pain). I feel a very minor difference down below, but it's not really visibly different and my partner can't tell. No change in sensitivity, except decrease in pain (which was the point).

I had some additional problems that you will not, so for me I did start experiencing pain due to my spasming muscles (vaginismus) about a month or so after surgery, which I had to get dealt with. However, now I have much less pain! Yay go surgery!
