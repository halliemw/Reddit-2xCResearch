That is so dumb people are blaming you.

I wonder if there is a support helpline you could call? Maybe try googling that, and some insurances have health line people to call.

Maybe if you talk to her about how you feel about it and suggest that you guys work together to both eat healthy and cut down to one treat a week or something. If she sees you are willing to cut down treats with her, it shows you can sacrifice for her, too, so she doesn't  have to see you eat food she wants but shouldn't eat.

If you feel guilty getting her unhealthy snacks, maybe explain to her why.

Also, there are a ton of diabetic cookbooks, so maybe you can get one and try a bunch of new recipes?

If you know what healthy foods she likes, maybe make sure those are available all the time.

Changing a middle aged woman's eating habit isn't going to be quick and easy, it will be long and hard. My mom is so stubborn about it.

My mom and I are currently doing a weight loss challenge together, it's ok.
