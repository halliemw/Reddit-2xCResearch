Thank you for taking the time to comment.


I'm glad that there have been positive conevrsations about unexpected pregnancies changing lives for the better without negative comments or disagreement on this. 


What I was really referring too- and I most likely didn't make this clear enough- was that if a person were to post a pro-abortion statement on a thread about a woman who doesn't know what to do now that she's pregnant,  and isn't too keen on abortion,they would (judging on the pattern I've seen in this sub) probably be supported by others in the thread. 

On the other hand, if a person were to suggest that the woman consider keeping it or putting it up for adoption, when the poster implies that they are not ready for a baby, the suggester would be pretty hevaily rebiffed by others.

This is the point I was trying to make: Pointing out the pros of abortion to a unenthusiastic person seems ot be OK, but pointing out the pros of keeping a baby to an unenthusiastic person oes not seem to be tolerated here. Why?


"I have never seen someone come on here and declare themselves to be "pro-life" in the sense that they morally disagree with abortion. At the very least I would have to commend them on their bravery if they did"

This is the point I am making-- Statistically, there MUST be people on this sub who morally disgaree with abortion. Having never seen one post something to that effect here seems to indicate that they aren't posting for a reason, e.g. for fear of backlash.
 
I know that I myself have refrained from posting anti-abortion opinions in the past because I knew I would be downvoted and my inbox flooded by people telling me that my opinion is politically incorrect or even just wrong.
