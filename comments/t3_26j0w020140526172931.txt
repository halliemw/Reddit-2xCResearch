>As long as a woman doesn't do anything insane, if she walks up to a dude, and he's single and says "Hey, I think you're cute. Lets get a drink sometime" everything will go fine.

Okay, that's just not true. Women can't just walk up to random men they don't know and get guaranteed dates, at least not anymore than guys can. If you're a woman, you must be exceptionally attractive to think this is the case, and if you're a dude, then who on earth told you that this is how dating works for women? 

Asking total strangers out to drinks will almost never net you a date, regardless of your gender. People (men and women) have better shit to do with their time than go on random dates with people they know nothing about. People who will definitely say yes to a date from anyone are extremely desperate. I don't know why would use this as an example anyways, since it's not something that anyone actually does. I get that you're trying to reduce the situation to it's most basic premise by forgoing any conversation topic or whatever, but this basic premise doesn't get dates IRL.

Anyone who has told you that they would hands down say yes to someone who asked them out on a date without any prior conversation has probably never had someone ask them out on a date without any prior conversation.
