I'm a female with a bachelor of science degree with some engineering classes. I have been graduated for 2 years and have spent 9 months in the oil field and another 9 doing construction, environmental remediation type things (environments with few other women). 

Today I reported behavior that was inappropriate to a company that had hired mine as a sub contractor. The man I reported it to took immediate action. He said he was "glad the civil rights movement occurred, and that he is glad this is not 50 years ago. Women deserve to work in a professional environment and be treated like co-workers". We had a closed meeting with their partner who actually subbed the man that I made the complaint about. He said he would take action immediately and did. 

When I called my supervisor to report what was happening, he wanted me to leave site immediately. Keep in mind the behavior I reported was certainly inappropriate but nothing was actually stated point blank and there was no contact or anything like that. I was sure to tell everyone every detail, because I was worried it was being blown out of the water. And part of me felt bad for the man that I was complaining about. However every person I talked to, including the vice president of my company (35+ y/o males) assured me I was in no way in the wrong, I would not be working on this project anymore, and that there would be plenty of work for me to do at home.

So while I have experienced sexism in other places, and was worried about even reporting this, you are a person. If you are a working professional, you are entitled to be treated as such. Go out there with confidence and as long as you are doing the best that you can, people will respect you. Those that don't won't matter, and the people that do matter will take care of the people that are not respecting you.
