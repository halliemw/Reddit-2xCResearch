It took me two years before I realized that the tampon goes INSIDE the vagina, not just tucked between the labia. I thought the applicator was for people who weren't okay with touching their labia. Having the tampon between my labia often ended up hurting, but I just assumed it was normal and carried on.

My first time, I thought I was using pads - but I was just using pantyliners. For quite a while I preferred tampons over 'pads' because of the capacity. I didn't use a real pad until a few years later when I needed a tampon at school and asked a friend who only had pads. So much capacity!
