I did the same, I stopped speaking to my friends, but mostly because they sided with him. I needed to take time out, and that apparently made me guilty of doing things I never did, because I was not there to defend myself.

But to play devil's advocate for a minute, is it possible he's shittalking over reddit because it's his way of venting? I know it is for a lot of people who aren't comfortable talking to their friends or family or therapist about it. 

But on the other hand, he could be doing it because he knows you can see it, and it's his way of indirectly calling you all the names he wants to. 

I dunno, I would honestly just ignore them if you can. 'Cause that shit ain't worth it. I hope he sees it as well so he can bugger off!
