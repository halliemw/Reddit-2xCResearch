> simple: speak up when you observe sexist, objectifying behavior among your male friends.

You are making a ***HUGE*** assumption that feminist men both:

A) keep a bunch of friends around who objectify women

B) fail to stand up to them

As someone who doesn't do either of those things, there's literally nothing else I can do. There's no Rape Club I can go join and infiltrate. You know that.

That's a big part of the problem, you and I can sit around all day and talk about how much we respect women, but there's another huge group of people that we don't associate with who violate women's rights in whatever way.
