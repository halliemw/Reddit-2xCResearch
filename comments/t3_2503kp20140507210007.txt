> I am not sure why you feel that he is allowed anything...

Are you seriously saying that he is not allowed to have an opinion? Do you realize how emotionally abusive this is?

Forcing someone to carry a pregnancy to term is crazy, of course, and it's quite clear that while he is expressing his desires, he is not acting on them... but forcing someone to not have opinions that disagree with yours is just as crazy.

It's completely reasonable to say, though, something along the lines of "It is completely healthy and valid for you, OP, to make a decision based on your outlook, and not consider his in the process." But this is very different from "He is not allowed to have and express a dissenting opinion."
