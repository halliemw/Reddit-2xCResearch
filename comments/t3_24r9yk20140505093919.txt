Sex isn't some magical activity, it's the same as any other.  You can definitely purchase food, hail a cab, and do many other activities that require consent without anyone balking, why would sex be different?

If you can communicate effectively, you are capable of consent (barring special circumstances like involuntary intoxication).

I don't really like to have sex drunk or to have sex with drunk partners.  It used to be from a condescending and patronizing viewpoint that I knew best for them, but I got called out on it by my partner at the time and realized I was being a jerk.  I still don't have intoxicated sex, but it's now because of my consent (or lack thereof) not theirs.
