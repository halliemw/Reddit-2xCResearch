I felt exactly the same thing reading through this.  I went through exactly what I also tongue in cheekly called a "quarter life crisis."  I know now that I was extremely unstable.  I had a very stressful, yet very well paying job that broke me.  I was in my mid twenties and I was trying to live this life that I thought I wanted (well paying job, SO, plans for house and family) and I just devolved over the course about two years. I just felt like I didn't know who I was anymore. I left the job, got deeply involved with some internet friends (I didn't go out and stay out until 2am, I compulsively played an MMO with a group of 'friends' until 4+am every day).  I had crazy dreams/plans to leave the country and start over.  I didn't give a flying fuck about everything I'd worked for until then.

Eventually, it got really out of hand and I was having hallucinations and full on psychosis.  I finally did seek treatment but it was only after I couldn't keep a grasp on what was real anymore.  I know now, in retrospect, that I lost a good 5 years of my life to true chaos.  

Please, OP, I highly suggest you help him work toward deciding he needs help.  I'm not saying this is definitely a bipolar episode, as we all know, everyone is different.  It seems extremely suspicious though, especially since you've already said he's definitely diagnosed.  I wasn't diagnosed until I was almost 30, but now that I know, I can look back in my history and pick out every single episode.  I wish I'd have gotten help much earlier, maybe I wouldn't be struggling so much to rebuild now.
