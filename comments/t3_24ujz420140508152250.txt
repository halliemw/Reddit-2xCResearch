The issue isn't really the gift. The bigger issue here is that she tried to talk to him about it and at the end, she is still left there, on their anniversary, having given him a gift and having paid her own way.

Even if he doesn't care about gifts, he knew it was important to her. If he isn't interested in compromising on such a small point, it isn't a good sign. 

So, OP, if you are certain that he understood your feelings and still disregarded you, leave. You deserve a chance to find someone who won't dismiss you.
