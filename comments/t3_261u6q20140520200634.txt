While the numbers should increase. I think the problem in this case isn't an women's representation in the judiciary though. I think the real problem here is that the judge is a bastard.
I think if you poll this with both sexes, they'll both be disgusted with the verdict.
The real problem here is how did the judge get confirmed by the legislature with such screwed up views?
