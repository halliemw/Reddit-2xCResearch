There was something else going on. I don't know what, but if anyone is blaming you it's out of ignorance or jealousy that he has left their life.  Men hide their emotions from everyone. We have to cause no one will listen.  We close them up inside because we believe that to show them, to admit to them, is a weakness. We're supposed to be strong and immune to "feelings."  He was your rock because he felt ashamed to admit he too suffered from something, and unfortunately, in his stubbornness to conform to the expectations of a man in your small town, he had no outlet, and the desire to end it all took hold of him once, and that's all it takes. 

You didn't kill him, if anyone did, the intolerant, ignorant and obtuse people in your town did. I assure you he tried to reach out to someone who shut him down. And that was it.  Everyone can blame you, but if they do, they don't have a goddamn clue how depression works. If you haven't been to a doctor, go to one, if you can't afford one, see about going to the nearest free or reduced cost clinic. YOU NEED HELP from someone who knows what the hell they are talking about, and it sounds to me like everyone in your town doesn't have a goddamn clue.
