That men and women think differently is not really true. There's lots of girls who like math. There's boys who like playing house. Does that mean they're not really the sex they were born as? 

That you were happy being treated like a stereotypical girl was just pure chance and luck. You could just as well have wanted to be treated more like a stereotypical boy - lots of girls like that. And then, your father's behaviour would have been alienating and possibly damaging. And as for your father knowing "how boys work", er - I'm a woman and I honestly don't understand how every single woman works, so how should he be in the head of every single guy you may ever come across? There's nothing wrong with someone (of any gender) liking being treated like a girl, but there's something wrong with parents treating their children differently solely based on their sex.
