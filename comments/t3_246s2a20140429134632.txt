It was quite clear in the book, since we're inside Tris' head, that it was about her overcoming the Abnegation part of her that kept her closed off to other people (especially a guy she was interested in).  She wanted to be with him very much but just couldn't let go and let herself be.

Looking at it from the outside, that definitely was NOT clear in the movie.
