My counselor told me something that might help you when dealing with stuff like this. Imagine that whatever people say to you is like a package and it's sitting on a table between you, look at the contents and think about why they are giving you this. Is it worth taking anything from it? If there is nothing helpful or good you hand it back.

Remember there is nothing wrong with having emotions. Sometimes people don't think and they say callous things without giving it a second thought. So give them that second thought, "Don't you think that's a bit unnecessary?". They'll probably respond with something like "you can't take a joke", remind them that if it was a joke you'd be laughing. 

Do not blame yourself, your emotions are valid and not something you should have to bury.
