I have done billing for physical therapy for years, I can't think of a specific code that she would have used to have linked directly as sexual. Have your referring dr rewrite your rx as something not sexual and go back. Also make sure your therapist sets up a peer to peer review. If you don't mind sharing some personal information with a fellow Redditor I would be happy to help you with the appeal process.
