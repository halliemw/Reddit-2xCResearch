I don't think it would be a negative thing to dedicate 99% of the space here to what OP originally intended and then have one post with no comments, just up votes, contribute 1%. Part of derailing it trying to discredit someone's point which is absolutely not my intention. However, that is why I am asking (and OP can answer for herself) rather than doing.


But as it stands, people are already commenting and saying that they have been assaulted.

Scientifically it would make sense to just have a small control to compare against the "Yeah, I've never been assaulted" comments. OP is for all intents and purposes doing a comparative study with an emphasis on an underrepresented sample, so my suggestion would actually assist.
