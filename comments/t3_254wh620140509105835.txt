Yeahhh. Unfortunately the mods have not been responding with much other than that they think this is a good idea and that the problems will die down. Color me unimpressed.

Some people have started alternate subs, but they're kinda scattered (in the sense that there a multiple options and no front runner for a reboot of 2X). I hope they'll become active communities and supportive spaces for trans folks.
