Nope, the legal age to purchase alcohol and drink it in public is 18 but it's only illegal to actually give alcohol to a child under 5 if it's in a private residence with parental concent.

Oh and 16-17 year olds can drink beer/wine/cider in a pub so long as it was ordered by an adult to accompany a meal.
