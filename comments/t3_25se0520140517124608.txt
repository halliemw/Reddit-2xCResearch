Honestly? Right now it's leave the house. :P I live on the third floor and crutches + stairs = doom. At least it does for me. Though even on a good day the stairs are a formidable foe. Even my "good" leg has this terrible grinding noise every time I go up or down a step since years of relying more on one leg over the other has worn it down a great deal.

Truthfully I don't go out a lot. My folks love doing things like going out to karaoke and stuff like that, but I pretty much never go anymore. I haven't told my mother this, but a large part of it is that I know I wouldn't be able to handle the back strain for the usual amount of time they go out for that sort of thing and the idea of making them leave early just because my body can't handle it.... I just couldn't. 

But on a more normal note, I loved to dance when I was younger. I was a "tomboy" type. All the tree climbing, karate classes, and stuff like that. Even a few years ago I still managed to do some tai chi and the more low impact stuff, but right now even that's kind of out of my reach.

So a good part of it is that the stuff I want to do is tied to my own physical disabilities admittedly. Which are, predictably, made worse by my weight. And, of course, the sort of thing that could help with my knee issues and stuff like that are pretty much off limits because with the weight I'm at I'm not really a candidate for that sort of thing.
