I'm not supporting any thread that would advocate for "The theme bout women not knowing whats good for them or being nasty vindictive and withholding creatures who manipulate men".  Those opinions sound ridiculous of their own accord; as a society we don't need to associate them with a killing spree in order to disregard them as nonsense.  I think that we are on the same page here.

I'm not certain what the author of this article was aiming for when they made the connection between Men's Rights and these killings, but I am inferring that it was an attempt to suggest that many of the views espoused by Men's Rights forums or activists are dangerous.  This form of argument has a specific title, it is called [Ad Hominem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem).  Ad Hominem, is when a person is discredited, and by extension, their argument is discredited.  It is widely considered to be a poor form of argument.  Here we are stating that these Men's Rights opinions are dangerous and inaccurate because this one person believed in them and he was a murderer.  

Imagine this hypothetical situation.  Say that a woman is raped.  She is traumatized by the incident.  She has spent many years incapable of a normal healthy relationship and this incident has taken an enormous mental toll on her life.  She begins writing vitriolic comments about Men in general, not just her attacker, on any web forum that will listen or help her find comfort.  Now imagine that the entire scenario ends in catastrophe, in a situation similar to what Elliott did.  Does this mean that we should categorize her anger and despondence as dangerous?  Something terrible just happened to her, clearly we should be more comforting, shouldn't we?
