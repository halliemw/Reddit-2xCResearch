I think I have a pretty good relationship with my dad. The biggest reason for this, in my opinion, is that he has a powerful unconditional love for me. He's told me that he never even really wanted a kid before I was born, but from the moment he saw me, he was so overjoyed to be a dad. He took me everywhere when I was little. Sometimes he took me to work and left me in the nurses station so he could see me during the day. He was always talking to me and teaching me things and reading to me. He shared his interests with me, which is probably why I grew up to share some of those interests. 

When I got older, we had lots of disagreements. At the time he was really sad because he truly believed I hated him. I never actually hated him, I was just being a bratty preteen. Keep that in mind, as your kid grows up. He wasn't really involved in my social life enough to be a dick to my friends or boyfriends. I think that was good. No teenager wants their parents forcing themselves into their social life. He met my boyfriends, and made polite conversation with them, but he never tried to intimidate them or be their best buddy.

The big thing my dad did wrong, that caused a lot of tension in our relationship, is the way he treats my mom. He loves me, but he couldn't give less of a shit about my mom. Since I love my mom very much, this makes me pretty mad. I watched my mom struggle for years to try to maintain a relationship with him, and he literally ignored her. He just stopped pretending to care about her once he had a couple of kids. As a result, I don't really have a model of how a healthy adult relationship works. Please remember to always work hard on your relationship with your kid's other parent. Even if it doesn't work out with them, and you break up or divorce, always respect and care for them.
