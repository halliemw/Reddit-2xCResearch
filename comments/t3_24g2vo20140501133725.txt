Try wearing below-the-knee length dresses/skirts ([like this one] (http://www.coldwatercreek.com/product-detail/69660/76784/knit-flare-skirt.aspx)). They look feminine and classic.

As for feeling self-conscious about your legs, I can relate. I have knock knees and have always disliked how they look. I have learned to be okay with how they look because there is nothing I can do to change them. Instead I find dresses and skirts that are flattering and comfortable.
