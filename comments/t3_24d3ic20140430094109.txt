Good for you.  

It's very difficult to get a doctor to take you seriously on this stuff.  I have a family history of ovarian and endometrial cancers, and even with multiple fibroids in both breasts and constant reproductive issues, it took until I was 30 and had a breast cancer scare to get the tests ordered.  I'm also an Ashkenazi Jew, which means I have genetic predisposition to a lot of things.  Thankfully my tests came back clear.  I got lucky. 

They were worth every damn penny I had to pay out of pocket for them.  Having that knowledge, especially *before* we started trying to have kids, meant a lot to me.  

I'm proud of you for taking charge of your own health.  You should be proud of yourself, too.  And I sure hope you get great results on the tests they give you.
