I did not contact the police after it happened. I showered multiple times after the incident and didn't leave my house for three days. I do have doctors reports of the bruising, tearing, etc. but no actual evidence that it was him aside from my word. 

He definitely knows I'm living here. I've tried telling one of my friends that I was closest to from the group and I don't think he believes me because he still chooses this guy over me and my boyfriend everytime, like everyone else in the group so I just feel it would be pointless to try convincing the other people that live around here.
