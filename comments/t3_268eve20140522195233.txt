Thank you for your comment.  I will consider talking to him about it, but I think I'll discuss it with my counselor first.  I'm not sure I should tell him if it would do more harm than good.  He's been involved in a lot of campaigns that try to raise awareness for consent, so I would think he realised when I said that I didn't remember it that it was wrong.
