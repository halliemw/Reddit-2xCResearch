I'm sorry I actually think we agree! I think dress codes are great and there is a need in both schools and workplaces to dress professional and I don't believe most articles when authors write things like "the girl was told to go home and change because her outfit 'distracted boys' or that the girls outfit was 'too sexy'". A teacher or principle wouldn't say that because they can get sued. I agree with you that workplaces and schools have a need for people to dress professionally and that the authors writing is actually quite biased. I don't think women should be ashamed of their bodies but I don't think dress codes cause that. Articles like this with rather biased writing also teach young women (who read articles like this) that dress codes are criticising their bodies and that when a teacher says that they're dressing inappropriately that they should be ashamed. In reality the teacher simply means that the girl is not dressed appropriately for a professional setting and the dress code is teacher young people what is and is not appropriate to wear in a professional setting. This is really important for the future and you're not going to get away with a warning or detention if you wear something inappropriate to work.
