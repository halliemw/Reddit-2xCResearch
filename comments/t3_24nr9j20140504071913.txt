It takes time, is all I can say. Break ups are the worst, it feels like your heart is being punched in the stomach every time you think of him and of course every damn thing reminds you of him. It probably hurts even more because it was a pretty one-sided break up, but you have to remember that you don't want a boyfriend who is still in love with his ex anyway. It wasn't meant to be. For now, allow yourself to grieve and try to look forward. You feel like complete poop now but by this time next week you'l still feel like poop, but much less so. And even less the week after that. And so on, and so on. 

To finish, *random internet-stranger-hug*. Stay stong.
