Safety and familiarity. In addition to basic safety/handling classes, most instructors also let you shoot a number of different guns/calibres to decide what you're most comfortable with.

At the very least you'll gain some knowledge about gun safety and philosophy of use (which is never a bad thing). Not to mention the fact that it's fun (something you could probably use a bit of right now.)
