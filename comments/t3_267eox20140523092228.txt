Statistics don't exist in a vacuum though, you cannot just use them as proof like this without considering the *cause* of them - which is exactly what this post is about, the environment around these subjects that make them incredibly hostile for women who are interested which in turn, along with other factors, decreases the numbers of women. The statistics are a symptom, not an explanation.

There was a post the other day showing that in communities with a large number of women in engineering/tech/science careers, girls are just as likely as boys to pursue these subjects in their own studies. I wish I had the link, sorry.
