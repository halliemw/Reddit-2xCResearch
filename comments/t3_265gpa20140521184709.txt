As a person who has PTSD, I would like to appreciate your input. On my behalf I will say that I don't care about loud noises or repeat guests. I actually find noises like laughter, music, sex etc...to be comforting sounds of enjoyment and I don't feel like participating mostly because I simply enjoy having it as background sound, it doesn't mean I don't like the people involved or that I dislike parties. Perhaps you should also consider that its not a rejection if you are turned down by someone who has something similar to what I have.  . . or is a serious introvert. That seems rather immature of you..to be honest, as if you are hunting for more justifications for what you are doing.

If you feel like you have to tip toe around a person, just fyi, myself I appreciate being approached with issues because I often don't know how to open the conversation. If that feels like work, consider how much more effort you are wasting simply being nervous about it all the time. Who is the passive aggressive person then?

I of course, have always been open about my issues. I may be a shut-in but when I do talk, I mean what I say and I am not passive aggressive.

I think you have had some bad experiences and you are letting that color your perceptions.
