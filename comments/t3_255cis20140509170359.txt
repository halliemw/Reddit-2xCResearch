I'm preaching to the choir because I feel like no one else is listening  - we are living in a time where we have the least amount of bigotry and more human rights than ever, yet it still feels like no one knows how to work together or have empathy.  But I never talk about that stuff because I have no idea how to fix it, and people would look at me as if I were some sort of crazy hippie/commie.
