You seem to have a reading comprehension problem.It is not a "what do you think about this?" post.  She didn't ask anyone to decided whether or not she was raped, she said she is confused, this is a post looking for compassion and support and how to move forward after a traumatic event. This is not the time or place to debate but even if it were the facts presented are not ambiguous. This was rape.
