What do I want? I want reassurance that it's not my fault that I was abused. And that it's not okay for people to make excuses for him. 

And I want to feel like everything isn't my fault. I know logically that only I can control my emotions and only I can choose how I react. But what I want? Someone to say that it ain't my fault for not leaving sooner. That my emotions are okay. And maybe normal. In some way. 

I don't feel like a year is a long time, I guess.
