I'm not sure what's happening here (perfectionism, fear of failure, trouble with planning, emotions about the subjects you're trying to study, general depression, (finally) rebelling against "what has to be done", burn out, etc), but I would also suggest counseling to find out. 

Plus I would try to be less hard on myself. I'm guessing there's now a "grandparent"-voice in your head telling you off whenever you do or even think something "wrong"... While I think: " Crohn's disease *and* working at least three full days at week *and* studying... To pull all of that off would be amazing!".
