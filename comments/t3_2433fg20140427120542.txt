Speak up.  It's rude and antiquated.

Story:

Over my counsin's house working on her router.  I needed some technical info from the ISP, so I called.

After giving me the info, the tech says that now I can give it to my SO, so he can complete the job.  I lost it.

me:  "Young man, if you were at this household, would you have to call the ISP to get this information?"

him:  "Yes, of course, without it the job can't be done."

me:  "So what century do you live in?"

him:  "Huh?"

me:  "What century do you live in that you think I, because I'm a woman, am unable to finish the job?  Has it ever crossed your mind that this woman has a Bachelor's in Computer Science and happens to be a hands-on IT Manager/Tech Support?  Has it ever occurred to you that your outlook on the role of women in today's world is antiquated.  Why do you think I need a man to finish the job?  Why do you assume that all women are incompetent and helpless?  Do you think women should be barefoot, pregnant, in the kitchen and quiet?"

him:  "No, no of course not."


me:  "Please put me through to your manager, so this paying customer can voice her opinion on your unprofessional attitude."

him:  "I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  You're right, it never occurred to me.  I never thought about it.  I can assure you this will never happen again.  Apparently, I have a lot of growing up to do."

I let it go at that.  My cousin and her husband were picking up their jaws off the floor.

Moral of story:  I call people out on it.
