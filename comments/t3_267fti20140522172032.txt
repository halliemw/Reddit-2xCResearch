You do realize that many religious people consider scripture to be largely metaphoric, right? And that many incredibly accomplished scientists are religious?

You don't have to be a young-earth creationist; some people are, but the *majority* are not. In the Quran, one passage mentions the idea of "the letter of the law" versus "the spirit of the law" and how intention is crucial, not fundamentalism. Religion is a guide to living one's life open to interpretation, not a factbook. 

Science and religion have no conflict unless short-sighted people make it so. They serve different functions.
