I sort of blame the boy's parents (they may be the reason for his behaviors OR they might not have been aware if the boy were being sexually abused himself), but at the same time, if I were a teacher I would be keeping any eye on interactions between students. Then again, I am a people watcher and I pick up on emotions/energies and situations easily.
