actually, having a lot of periods over your lifetime is the weird and unhealthy thing. 

in a traditional society, women would start their periods later, reach menopause earlier, and spend their fertile years pregnant or lactating, maybe having one to five periods their entire lives. 

in this modern era periods have become seen as normal and natural, so the guy who invented the first hormonal birth control designed it to preserve the period to prove to the pope that BC was natural enough not to send anybody to hell. this failed. but the useless birth control period remains. 

so no, skipping periods is good. I haven't had one in months (I've got an implanon in my arm) and I feel absolutely fantastic.
