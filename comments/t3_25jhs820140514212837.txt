Kissing...my parents got mad when the had heard about a boy making out with me. They told me that guys get turned on and they would only view me as sex (even though I didn't let his hands leave my waist). They said it was wrong for a guy to get turned on unless I was married. Took a longtime to not feel disgusting about sexuality. :( 
I mean now I'm glad I didn't go anything I regret, but still......:/
