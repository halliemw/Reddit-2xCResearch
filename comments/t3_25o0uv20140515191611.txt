> I'm terrified of confiding in my mom because she's wise to a fault sometimes. She would highly encourage waiting for both emotional and financial reasons, and while I clearly understand that, I also just want to be with my best friend.

You sound like you know you're rushing things and aren't ready if you're terrified of what mom will say.  If you knew you were ready you wouldn't go to her for advice; you'd go to her to show off a ring.  There's more to marriage than "but I love this person and want to be with them".  I think though, that if you both take a few days and go through a book [like this] or see a relationship counselor to discuss any potential issues married couples face, you'll have a better understanding of how ready you guys are for marriage (and will be more prepared for a talk with your mom).
