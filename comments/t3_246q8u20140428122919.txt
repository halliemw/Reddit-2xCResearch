It's best to discuss directly with her and work out a system, so I would suggest maybe texting her and saying something like 'Still on for lunch next week?', as if you have already arranged something, so that if he is reading her texts, she should hopefully be able to say 'oh well, we've already arranged it, I can't let her down'. Maybe even saying 'I'm really looking forward to lunch with you next week!' rather than posing it as a question that she/he could refuse.

I have absolutely no experience with this whatsoever, I just think it would definitely be best to get her into a situation where you can discuss this together.
