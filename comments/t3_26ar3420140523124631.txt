Yes, we are monogamous. 

Let me ask you a question, if this entire thread were, say, about me changing my weight rather than getting a tattoo, would anyone's opinion change? And while someone's weight is certainly less permanent than a tattoo, what if I happened to be over or under weight? Not to the point where I'd be unhealthy, but to the point where my husband found me less attractive. And let's say because my husband found me less attractive this way, he asked me to gain/lose a bit of weight, but *I* was happy with the way I was, would everyone still be telling me to take his feelings into consideration about *my* body? I'm just wondering.
