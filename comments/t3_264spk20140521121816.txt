This put a smile on my face. I'm happy for your daughter - that she has started taking steps towards becoming a mature, confident adult and that she has a mother who is literally overflowing with pride. The one thing I yearned to hear from my mother as a teen was "I'm proud of you." Despite how angsty/ moody I acted. 

More happy thoughts being sent your way. For both you and your daughter :)
