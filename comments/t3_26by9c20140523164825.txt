I know it may not seem like a big deal to some, but honestly when I grew my hair out it was because I needed it to survive, I needed people to be able to see me as who I was, and anything that would help them I wanted to do. It feels so freeing having short hair, I love the way it looks and feels I love it more than anything and I'm just so grateful that the people around me were able to support me through the fear that I suddenly would look like a boy and would lose the privilege of the world seeing me for who I am which was the most crippling fear I've had in a long long time.
