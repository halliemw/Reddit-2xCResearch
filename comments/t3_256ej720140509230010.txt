Long story, short, in May 2012 I posted a thread about my breast reduction.

He commented with a Lion King reference, which I didn't get, so he said, "If you're ever in Minnesota, come over and watch it."  We actually ended up realizing we lived pretty close, went to schools in the same area, and had a few connections (he's friends with my cousin's friend, his best friend did work for my dad, etc.), so we met officially in August 2012, and started dating in October 2012!
