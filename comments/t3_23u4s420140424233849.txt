Understand entirely - just remember that for anyone, job searching is quite often a horrible process, and it takes lots of people months to land a new job. I'd still recommend applying for one or two jobs that aren't your "dream job" or the "perfect opportunity" because if you are less nervous, you might find yourself performing better in the interviews, and you can take this confidence forward with you. 

The great thing is that because you have a steady job right now, you have the luxury of time to keep trying at your own pace. The best thing you can do is what you're doing now - try, reflect, reach out for advice, rinse and repeat. You will succeed :)
