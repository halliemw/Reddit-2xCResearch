I just want to say I really appreciate that you posted this and I'm glad I read it, because it says a lot about the ideas our society still has about women. I also want to say I hope you make mention of the sentiment you expressed (staying alive is a little more important right now, your value shouldn't be related to your ability to reproduce) to those who, as you said, first express concern over your ability to bear children.  Make them think about the things they're saying and thinking.

I wish you all the best; come back and let us know how you're doing, post-surgery!
