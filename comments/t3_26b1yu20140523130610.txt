I'm 5'2 and at my heaviest I weighed 206 so I can relate to how you're feeling. 

/r/QueenOfTea is right regarding working on loving and accepting yourself but what worked for me was trying to see my body in a new light. Instead of just accepting that this is how my body is and I had better make peace with it, I decided to challenge myself and reach my highest genetic potential. Not to get to a point where my thighs don't touch or to a certain weight or a certain dress/jean size. My goal was/is to see how far I could push myself to get healthy and fit all while doing so with self love and self compassion. 

There will be days you fall off the diet wagon, hell, there will be days you get run over by the damn wagon but don't get discouraged. Just try to do better the next day. And do it not to rub it in your coworkers face or to look like so and such in the magazines but do it for yourself. See what your body is made of, how fast you can run, how much you can lift! It's exhilarating! And shit, when you reach a goal or a PR get a fuckin pizza if you want to! Just know that it's a treat and not a nightly meal.

And the ladies at /r/xxfitness are so encouraging and helpful if you are looking for support.
