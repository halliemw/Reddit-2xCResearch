I remember an episode of House where the nun was allergic to copper and had a forgotten copper IUD from when she was homeless and gave birth to a baby.  Obviously, I would never trust House for medical advice, but allergies to copper and nickel aren't unheard of.

Honestly, it sounds like your IUD is a nightmare.  You might have just gotten used to it, but I think you deserve a pain free easy period!
