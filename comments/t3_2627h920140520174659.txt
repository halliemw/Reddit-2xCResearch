This might come across a little too cautious, but I know the kind of attention she's getting and being too cautious is quite literally a life saver when shit hits the fan.

I'm an attractive 19 year old girl who tends to get a lot of attention. There's been a few times where guys became physical and I just wasn't prepared. So I'm writing this for you now just so you can prepare her to defend herself because you can't be around to protect her all the time.

Firstly I highly, **highly** recommend you get her a rape alarm. That's the most basic of things. If pepper spray is legal where you live then I also recommend that. If it's not legal then a body spray (not perfume) can also have a similar affect or at least buy her time.

Secondly get her into kickboxing or some kind of a self-defence class.

Lastly make sure she understands that no one should take advantage of her. There will be guys who think they can but if she's both mentally and physically prepared then they can do no harm.

Talking to her can only do so much. Please make sure she's prepared to defend herself because there might come a time when she needs it.
