That double standard really sucks when it comes to girl/guy size.  It's really hard to do (and I'm working on it too) but I believe a woman should love herself and be confident no matter what size she is.  Back in the day the fatter you were the better (healthier) now the opposite is true. 
I recently read an article about the US views on postpartum women compared to the rest of the world.  We are expected to be back to rail thin after a few short weeks.  This doesn't help with women that already struggle with post postpartum depression. It is hard enough to bring a child into the world then everyone expects you to be back to you old self within weeks.
