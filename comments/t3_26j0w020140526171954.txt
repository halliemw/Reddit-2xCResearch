> to take interest 

A woman who is interested in a man won't necessarily respond to: "Hey, I think you're cute. Lets get a drink sometime" for the reasons outlined by /u/notsoinsaneguy 

Women look and are attracted to what they see. But that doesn't mean they will respond to an overt invitation. In general, it's too risky.
