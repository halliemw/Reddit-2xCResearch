They're bullying her because they're jealous of something and they want power over it. It's how it is with bullies, if they can't be the thing they're jealous of, they'll try to cut it down until it's as ugly as they can make it. What would help your sister is for her to understand the psychology behind bullying/abuse. From there she'll learn how to handle it, but you can't engage them or else they think they have power over you.
