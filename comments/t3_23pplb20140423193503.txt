Being happy with yourself as you are does not preclude wanting to improve you, whether its about physical body or not. 

I like to use this analogy to explain it: you buy a new house you really like. That doesn't mean you don't furnish and decorate it, or renovate it. You improve and augment it, but it's not because you don't like your house the way it is. You just make it more fitting for you. Some people like heavy decoration and some people like more spartan furnishings.
