Thank you so much for the detailed and thoughtful response - I really appreciate it!

>Do you notice anything else?

Yes. I've been having troubles sleeping and feeling really shaky during the day. Somebody suggested to me that this could also be a thyroid problem so I think I'm going to go get it checked out.

>The good news is that not all of us have much trouble with menopause. I don't miss having periods.

This makes me feel better too, thanks. Change is sometimes scary, but as an endo suffererer, I could honestly live with fewer periods in my life. :)

Thanks again!
