I have like 2.5~3 years left. Since I've transferred schools and changed majors between states and the like, my credit situation is a mess. As for jobs, I don't really know. I know there are jobs out there that require a 4-year degree (doesn't matter which, just there has to be a degree) and something like that may interest me.

I wish you luck with school!
