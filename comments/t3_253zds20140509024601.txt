Oh definitely. If she doesn't have access to healthcare for birth control she can't be in a good situation to deal with STIs. Are condoms the only bc method that protect against those as well as pregnancy? I must admit my ignorance, I only had a vague inkling that vaginal condoms existed until now. They should definitely be more prevalent.
