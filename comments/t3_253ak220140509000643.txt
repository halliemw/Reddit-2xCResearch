I want you to know I think that your attitudes are completely correct.

I fucking hate that I hesitate to speak about my experiences with harassment with friends and acquaintances because of the (likely) chance that I will be placated with the aforementioned excuses.  

I live in Austin, TX, which is supposed to be a liberal/hippie/feminist haven.  I swear I have experienced more cat-calling and other sexist bullshit at my (hipster, progressive) job and walking down Guadalupe St. than anywhere else.

It's like a form of cultural gaslighting.  You feel _______, and representatives of society (friends, acquaintances) make you feel like you're oversensitive, overreacting, with their dismissals of the perpetrator's behavior, when your reactions are totally reasonable and justified.

I am harassed daily.  A man made a dick-sucking gesture to me yesterday, while walking from my car to a friend's house that was less than 200 feet from my car.  

You said it best: NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO MINIMIZE THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO EXIST

Your infuriation is come by honestly.  You feeling less infuriated and minimized is NOT the solution.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

I don't have any advice, I just want you to know that you are fucking right.  We are living in a fucked-up world where people do horrible things to each other on a daily basis, and it's dismissed as being "just one of those things you deal with."  The goddamn world needs to change, not you or I.
