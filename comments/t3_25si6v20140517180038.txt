I'm of the opinion that, now that we have been forced into the public eye (default status), we need to step up and represent this sub as best as we possibly can. It sucks that that onus has fallen onto us, but somehow it has. Banning derailers would be interpreted by "outsiders" as "wow, this sub would rather bury its head in the sand than be open to even minor challenges, what a bunch of pansies!".

At this point, the damage is irrevocable; this sub is no longer the safe place to chat without fear of "debaters" barging in and questioning every minute statement. It will never be that place ever again.
