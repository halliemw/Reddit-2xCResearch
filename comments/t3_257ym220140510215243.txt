Some time into our relationship, I brought up kids with my current boyfriend. Having kids really late is popular now, which is totally fine, but I myself would rather have them earlier in life and therefore be free of them earlier in life so that I could enjoy my golden years without having to lug my expensive kids around on every vacation. So all I said is that I wanted to start having kids before I was in my '30s, and that I was annoyed by this anti-kid sentiment in our generation. 

He then started going on about how badly he wanted kids and how he wanted to settle down as soon as possible and how he would love to be a stay-at home dad, and he had just never said these things before because he didn't know how I would feel about it. I had always known he had a huge soft spot for babies because I would always catch him watching cute baby gifs/vines, but it wasn't until I said I was interested in kids that he revealed that it was his biggest goal in life, to have a happy family and raise his kids well. It's uncool for guys to talk about wanting kids to their friends and he didn't want to come across as un-masculine to me for wanting a family more than a big fat career. These guys are totally hiding out there!
