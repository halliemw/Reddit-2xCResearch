I'm really curious, how much upset would the *oh-so-wise* mods of this sub consider to be a sufficient amount of upset before you admit your mistake?

> wait a week

Screw you. Wait a week to go to *your* preferred sub because their mods self-importantly betrayed their existing subscribers in the name of...*visibility?* Wasn't one of the great things about this sub--the reason your subscribers weren't getting floods of creepy messages, and having to deal with an influx of trolls and ignorance--it's **lack** of visibility?

If the members of this community are frustrated with you, it's because *you deserve it.* Stop asking people who are fed up to "wait a little longer."

Do what a responsible team of moderators who care about their community would do: admit your mistake. Reverse it.
