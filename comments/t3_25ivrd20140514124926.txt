Right?! I suspect he mentioned his age because he feels her decision to break up with him was ageist or discriminatory in some other sense; it's another way he sees himself as a victim of her 'cruelty'. Despite the passage of 2 YEARS, he clearly thinks they are still in a relationship albeit a competitive one -- which he wants to WIN. I think that's why he hangs a lantern on her being a waitress while he's a big-shot software entrepreneur. He needs to be better than her. 

I live in Seattle. We have tons of restaurants. It's not typical to just run into somebody. I'm not buying that she "just happened" to be working there. Creepy as fuck -- I'd be pissed too, if I was her. Come to think of it, maybe she was just scared, and in his "I'm the highly evolved victim" routine, he misinterpreted it as anger.
