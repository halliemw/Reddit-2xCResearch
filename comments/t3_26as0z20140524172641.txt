Good post. I can't count the times I have heard friends complain that their husband doesn't clean often enough and all I can think is "why should he want to vacuum every other day when he thinks once every 7 days is enough? Because you say so?" You gotta meet half way or if that isn't good enough, well then you got to do it yourself.
