 It seems like a silly thing to get worked up about to me.  Many (I would hazard even saying most) women like to use makeup to express themselves and feel their best.  I don't wear it because of other people, I wear it for me because I like how I look with it on.  Unless the company is forcing women to do their makeup I'm going to say that it's supposed to be a nice and fun gift to their employees.  If you're concerned about the male employees having no equivalent, maybe bring it up to whoever organizes these things.  Who knows, maybe the guys wanted to participate but didn't want to seem like they were bitter about being left out.

Edit:  Downvoted for not jumping on the "this is obvious sexism" bandwagon.  Classy.
