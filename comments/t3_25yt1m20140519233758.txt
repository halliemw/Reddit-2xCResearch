I never really got the chance to be "friends" with my Mom, she was killed when I was 12. I have always been very close with my Grandmother as she raise me after my Mom died...she was my best friend (still living but she is 90 years old and doesn't have all her wits about her any longer).

I have a 19 year old daughter, and she says I am her best friend. I cherish that relationship with all my heart. Yes we fight, we argue A LOT, but some of the most fun times have been with her. I hope one day you can be yourself with your Mom, she doesn't expect you to adapt. We love our children unconditionally and she would probably love to see how you've grown on your own. Show her what a great job she did raising you.
