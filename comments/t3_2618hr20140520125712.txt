What makes me sad about the change to default is that suddenly so much of what goes on is teaching, rather than validating. Like, I would like to validate the OP, but instead I end up responding to a whole slew of other people who, instead of validating or supporting the OP, undermine her. Sure, I feel like I'm doing good work, but boy has the whole tone of the sub changed. It is now just literally one teachable moment after another. I feel like suddenly we became responsible for teaching people (usually men) very basic stuff about sexism, feminism, being women. It's so different.

And it's kind of tiring how much they DEMAND replies, because they think that is the point of this sub. Teaching them, telling them about the women's perspective. Ugh.

Edit: I have gotten a few really nasty PM's because of this! Hee hee! I guess people really want to learn. :-(
