**Last Tuesday** I had the final economic mediation session with my cheating soon-to-be-ex husband.  I had to take a Xanex when he said I'd be welcome to come with him, *his mistress* and my three children to Disney World If I didn't get so upset...&#3232;_&#3232;


**Last Wednesday** I had to take an Anatomy and Physiology exam.  This exam directly reflects on my grade and my grades are under scrutiny because I just applied for the Nursing program at my Community College.  There were 200 applicants for 100 slots.  If I don't get an education and a career in a certain number of years *I won't be able to feed and house my children.*

**Last Friday** I had my milk ducts removed from my right breast.  I had a discharge months ago that showed I might have cancer cells in my breast and a mammogram, sonogram and a MRI just couldn't rule this out.  Since my insurance runs out when my marriage does I chose to have them removed now rather than monitor them because I didn't know if I could afford treatment in the future.  The procedure is more involved than originally thought and my breast specialist thinks it's likely that the blood supply to my nipple will not reestablish it'self and *my nipple will turn black and fall off.*

**BUT**

I got everything I wanted out of mediation and all money and custody issues are resolved.  I'll have time to go to school so I can support myself and my children.

I got an 84 on that exam.  I'm calling that a win.

And the blood flow returned to my nipple it's just fine.  Pathology said no cancer!

TL;DR:  It's been a hell of a week.
