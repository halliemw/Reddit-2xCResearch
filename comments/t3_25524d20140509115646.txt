I extended breastfed my 3 children and am a huge advocate for nursing anywhere you need/want to. No one should have to eat in a bathroom. The more women nurse openly and proudly, the more ubiquitous nursing will become. I am all for psa's encouraging women to nurse, but those pics of women nursing their babies in bathrooms seriously made me sad.
