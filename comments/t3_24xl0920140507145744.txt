A lot of complications.

While I would love to help fund every TwoXer that is in need, starting a fund/charity, getting the proper documentation to do it, figuring out who is in "need" and what kind of needs are appropriate to fund, raising awareness for it, properly reporting taxable funds, etc. is a job in itself.

There are a lot of women's charities out there that help women for various needs that are established out there, from church groups, to organized nonprofits, to Planned Parenthood and awareness.  Thanks to your fantastic idea, /u/Rysona, I've gone straight to a local women's charity and placed a volunteer application.

While we can't help everyone, we can surely help one at a time to foster change and help our fellow TwoXers, for sure.
