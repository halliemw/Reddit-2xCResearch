The reasoning behind that advice is that if a guy is willing to ignore that you clearly don't want to talk to him, he's more likely also ignore that you don't want to fuck him. He's demonstrating a lack of concern for your desires which might translate into other areas, and hence he is a potential danger. A woman doing the same thing might be annoying, rude and unpleasant, but statistically she is unlikely to be a threat to another woman. Thus, in a thread about a woman avoiding potentially dangerous situations, there is in fact a need to specify a particular gender. 

She's not saying all men are like that or that no women are like that, as is obvious to anyone with a brain.  So please stop attempting to derailing the conversation. This isn't about you.
