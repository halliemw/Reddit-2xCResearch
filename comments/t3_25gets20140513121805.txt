I'm just not convinced that leg hair on women *isn't* feminine.  Most girls don't seem willing to give their hair a chance in the field.  They act like they're being super gross for letting it grow out, but even then never allow it to really flourish into whatever it might grow into.  They get stuck in that zone where the hair is too short and stiff to be comfortable--a problem resulting from shaving.
