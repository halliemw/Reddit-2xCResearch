You can contact a private gyno directly, but you need to be referred from your GP [source](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1094.aspx?categoryid=68&subcategoryid=153) if you want to be treated on the NHS. I ended up having to see a private one in a bit of a hurry and didn't have time to get a referral - ended up paying Â£200 for my appointment! Definitely see your GP again and ask to see a gynaecologist.
