The real problem is that 2XC started as a discussion forum by women and for women, and since becoming a default it's been treated (especially in the comments) as an education forum.  And the posters asking the questions tend to get really offended if you point out that the purpose of this place actually isn't to educate you on 101 level stuff and nobody is obliged to provide them with said education.
