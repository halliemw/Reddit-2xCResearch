You've expressed that your boyfriend has trouble letting go of failures that happened long ago. Do you feel that his failures or his feelings about them are pervasive as well as permanent? That is to say, do you think a failure in one area of his life effects his outlook on other areas? I wonder if he is dealing with a negative explanatory style, and pessimism in general. 

I am a pessimist with a girlfriend and a lot of what you said sounds familiar. I used to think about past failures, challenges and indiscretions and let them effect what I thought about current situations and relationships, even when they were completely unrelated. I also dealt with some addiction, and coping with life as an addict is a great way to unlearn how to healthfully recognize when things are wrong or how to help yourself, both physically and emotionally. 

I'm not big on self-help, but you both could consider looking into the work of Martin Seligman. Specifically his volume "Learned Optimism". If you (or your boyfriend) need to validate who Seligman is or why he's worth listening to, any online search about his work should corroborate the experiments and advances he's been involved with, and why he's not full of shit.
