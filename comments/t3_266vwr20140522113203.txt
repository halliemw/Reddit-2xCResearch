As a 29 year old from a very traditional family, I feel your pain.  Seriously, when I saw the title I just had to click, because I have been there *so many times*.

There was a time when I just kept my feelings to myself, and lied when need be, because I knew from experience that my mother didn't want my honesty, she wanted my compliance.  Over the years though, as I've gotten older, braver, and just more secure in my own opinions and beliefs, I have gradually moved into a more "adult" relationship with my family, simply by setting boundaries.  If there is something we disagree on, I say "I know we disagree, but this is how I feel/what I believe."  And while I don't mind talking with them about why I believe what I do, I make it clear that it has to be a two sided discussion, and I refuse to engage if I'm just being fussed at.  

One of the most empowering realizations for me was that as an adult, I had the power to walk away.  If I needed to, I could get in my car and go home.  Not that I have ever had to do that, but just knowing I have that freedom allows me to hear them out without getting upset, and allows me to love them for who they are, not who I wish they were.

As for being honest about sex, my hat is off to you. :)  I've only been sexually active for the last year (related to said conservative upbringing) but I would not tell my parents.  If the subject comes up, my plan is to lie, lie, lie. :)  Hopefully they'll never know I had 'unmarried' sex.   A can of worms I don't want any part of.
