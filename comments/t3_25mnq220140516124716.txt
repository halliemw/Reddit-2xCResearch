I tried breastfeeding, it sucked.  I didn't feel more bonded to my son, I just hated the fact that it was completely down to me.  The only position that seemed to work was lying on my side - hardly practical if you need to feed baby while out and about.

The midwife doing my home visits told me on her first visit that if I switched to formula she'd be "so disappointed with me" as though I was her kid playing truant from school.  WTF.
