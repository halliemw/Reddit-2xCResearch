It seems that you're conflating "not respecting women" with rape. If your son's friends are acting disrespectful towards women, he should probably find new friends. But to equate that with rape, a horrible and violent crime that will ruin a girl's life and send you to prison for the rest of your own, is crazy. Guys know that rape is wrong, they don't need to be reminded. Those that "forget" or never knew that rape is wrong, a small minority, should be locked up with rest of the violent criminals, murderers, etc. If you feel that your son is included in this group, get him treatment ASAP.
