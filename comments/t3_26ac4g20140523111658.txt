Thanks for this. 

Not to belabor the point, but I've also read that some of this can be accounted for different jobs in these sectors. For example, in the medical field, women pare more often physicians while men tend to gravitate towards things like surgery.

I don't know much about the subject, thb. Thanks for sharing that study.
