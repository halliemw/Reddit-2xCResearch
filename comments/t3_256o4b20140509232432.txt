That's ridiculous. Get a new gyno!
I had similar problems with my previous bc so I got my mirena last year at 22 and I've never had kids. They told me that its usually more painful if you haven't been pregnant before so they usually give you meds to loosen up your cervix but I didn't get any nor did I need them. No worry of infection or anything and I'm fine. I LOVE my iud. No kids, no periods, and I feel great.  

It must just be personal preference so if I were in your position I would look for somebody else to see.
