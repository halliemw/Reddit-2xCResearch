As a socially awkward male who is friends with other socially awkward males, I can definitely see some of us acting like this. It seems like its possible he is avoiding these things because he is uncomfortable / afraid of it.

That being said, there will never be "the right time" to talk to him about it, just sit him down and have a heart to heart. Because if he doesn't learn to deal with it and learn to reciprocate the feelings / actions you show him, then you have every right to be unhappy. However, there is also the chance that he is showing you how he feels in his mind as people express things differently. There are people out there that don't really like to touch people but do other things to show that they care (not saying this is necessarily his deal, just an example.)

So just go into the talk with an open mind and try to not attack him and rather position what your concerns in a non-aggressive way. Us awkward guys are like approaching animals, easy to spook and cause undesired results when we enter our uncharted territory.

I also agree with some of what /u/qagmyr says, as I have once made the mistake of 100% immediate response / involvement with the people it can detract from the overall attraction from that person.

All in all, gotta have a real talk with him and see how things go from there.

As for that second problem, if he didn't stick his hands into anything important, then it is very unlikely that you would get pregnant. Highly improbable, but there is always a risk.
