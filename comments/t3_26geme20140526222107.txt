Thanks. I have been sorta halfassed about starting a routine, to be totally honest. 

However for the last few days I've done a lot of research on r/loseit and other sites and have started a low carb routine. It's been really hard to ration back down to a normal calorie level (shooting for about 15-1600 as of right now) but I'm starting to feel a difference. Going for a majority of carbs from low starch veggies, eating reasonable amounts of fat, etc. Feeling a bit more optimistic. 

Just a bummer to have it pointed out how far I've fallen because I'm painfully aware. Oh well what can I do but take it one day at a time and try to be more mindful of all my choices.
