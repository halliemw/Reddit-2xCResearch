Really it depends on the culture. 

I've grew up calling adults "ma'am" or "sir" and I don't even think about it when someone calls me "miss or "ma'am". 

I know it's happened but I can't recall any specific occurrences. It's just not something I even thought to notice. 

Question for those of you who don't use "ma'am", what do you use instead?
