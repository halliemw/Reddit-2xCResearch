Roomies in college:

Roomie 1 - Graduated with honors, BS Mechanical Engineering. Now pursuing her MS in Mechanical Engineering. Should be graduating 1-2 years from now. Intends to work for Bell Helicopter/Lockheed Martin/that type of stuff.

Roomie 2 - Double majored BS Biology, BS Mathematics. First generation US citizen, bilingual Spanish/English. With honors.

Roomie 3/myself - Did not graduate, instead applied to the same pharmacy school (one year apart), both admitted and both on track. We will be graduating with a Pharmacy Doctorate. Courses prior to pharmacy school included: General Chem I/II, Organic Chem I/II (admittedly I failed OChem I, but she passed with an A), Physics, Intro to Biology I/II, Microbiology, etc.

We're all creative, just in different ways. 

FWIW I also know an Electrical Engineer. Graduated with highest honors, is now pursuing his Masters. Intent to graduate is this August. Has already signed a contract to work for Texas Instruments. His cooking is okay, but his talent is definitely in desserts. Certainly very creative though. But so his sister, a Nuclear Engineer, who is also picking up a Masters.
