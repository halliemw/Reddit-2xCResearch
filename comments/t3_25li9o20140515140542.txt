When I just searched, there was an article released a year ago (actually like 2 weeks before I had donated) that claimed they has over 6 million dollars worth of hair unaccounted for.  That must have been what I was reading when I was researching. 

I don't know if they've changed since, but the general consensus was they were producing way less than they should've been, so where did the money go? I was also most surprised that their wigs weren't free/close to free. That was disappointing.
