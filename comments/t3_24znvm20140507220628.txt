I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you ok? I got one of those once myself and it was awful. I know it's supposed to be the internet and we aren't supposed to be so serious about it, but it really hurt me. It was sad that someone actually goes around saying those things to people. I mean at the end of the day we are still all human beings behind these words :( 

I hope you are stronger than I am and it was no big deal.
