I highly disagree, and I believe misogyny may have been the outlet for the shooter, but is not the root cause. 

Everybody gets frustrated at something. Lack of romantic encounters, is one source of frustration. Poor job prospects, is another source of frustration. Dealing with customers, is also a source of frustration. How you deal with this frustration, is what separates sane people from the insane. This guy would have shot the shit out of something eventually. Why? Because life is frustrating. Shit goes wrong. The girl doesn't like you. Your job sucks. People are assholes. But there's a difference between bitching about it at the bar and shooting up the place. 

So his defining factor is misogyny. Alright, so he hates on women. How is this different than hating on your coworkers and shooting up the office? People are still dead.
