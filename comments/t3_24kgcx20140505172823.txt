Hm.  I've been taking the pill for over 10 years and have had occasional situations like the OP.  In the past, I clearly remembering going to the pharmacy, explaining my situation (without a renewed prescription) and getting 1 pack of pills at a much higher price.  Either way, she should try to get an extension through her doctor.
