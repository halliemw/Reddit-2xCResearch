Now? No, I live in a relatively crime free area. I grew up in a shitty place. I was scared a lot of the time, and with good reason. [Statistically men are more likely to be the victim of violent crimes.](http://nortonbooks.typepad.com/everydaysociology/2009/05/who-is-most-likely-to-be-a-crime-victim.html) Please do not think I am trying to compare getting robbed or beat up to being raped, but men have things to fear too. I saw people get shot, I saw people get stabbed, I saw dudes get jumped and stomped out to the point where they were in comas. Yeah, men feel threatened sometimes.
