Those cats are basically like her children to her now, so she does need to keep them. But first she needs to stay alive. If at any point you think she's seriously considering suicide, you need to call the police in her town. She'll be put in a psych ward for a few days, which will suck (also call a trusted friend or neighbor to make sure her cats are taken care of) but the big important thing is she'll get help and treatment. In the meantime, in order to keep things from getting that bad, see if there's any sort of free or low-cost counseling near her. Pastors often do this but have limited training, but if it's a small town with no universities nearby that might be a start, especially if she is/was religious. If there is a university or a sliding scale mental health services place, ask her to go there. Be careful in your phrasing because mental health problems come with a huge stigma in many places, but something like, "Mom, you've been going through a lot lately and I'm worried about you. Please try going to X place and talking to someone. I think it will make you feel better. I love you and I'm always here for you, but since I can't be there right now and you sound like you're having a lot of trouble, I really want to make sure you're ok and you know you're not alone."
