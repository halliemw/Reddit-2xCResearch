It can definitely be risky to answer like that, but you can choose to answer truthfully if you wish. I guess it'd be best to just play it by ear and try to decide which would be the better route. If a question like that comes up it can be a lose/lose situation for you in a way. 

Personally, if I was asked the question and refused to answer, and that upset or bothered the interviewer, I'd be glad that I just weeded out a bad employer. Sometimes an employer may not even know these questions are illegal, or perhaps misphrased a legal question and would be glad you pointed it out to them. I'm sure some would even appreciate your honesty and guts to do so.
