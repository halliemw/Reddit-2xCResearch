I was raised Catholic with a religious mom and a non-religious, hands-off type father. When I was a teen I made chastity pledges and even wore a purity ring (I know, right?) but that was a choice that I had made myself. I am no longer religious and am currently sexually active with my live-in boyfriend, but I don't regret being abstinent for all those years. I think a lot of people tend to treat sex like its no big deal and that no-strings-attached sex won't bite them in the ass and so I'm glad that I've always kept my head about me. I do agree, though, that a lot of the religious stuff is SUPER fucked up and doing it because your parents want you to do it is just so strange and unsettling. 

For instance, another girl I went to high school and church with recently got married and a video of her wedding was posted on Facebook and she made this big speech at the alter to her father about how she waited until she was married to have sex. She did it in front of all those people! And she was like, 24 or something and had apparently rushed into marriage because she wanted to have sex. Everything about that just struck me as icky and kinda silly. Even if you decide not to have sex, keep your decision to yourself.
