I also had my first real experience recently of the emotional rollercoaster shark week can bring. It took me till the next day to realize my intense, painful anger and sadness were purely hormonal. I cross my fingers that it stays as a rare side effect, I could NOT imagine dealing with those emotions every month. Just... fuck.
