We can discuss it, but no one will listen, as we as a whole haven't listened or payed attention to this discussion before and even a pop up reminding us of when we're supposed to use the downvoting button hasn't been enough.  The sub going default hasn't helped matters.  I think we are all a little unsure as to what to do next, but I agree with you 100%.  I have a personal "do not downvote" policy, except when it comes to personal attacks or something like that, which both fails to  contribute to the discussion and crosses the line of civility.  

Worse than the comment downvotes, really, are the downvotes to the articles that are being submitted, which is really selfish, self-centered and  disrespectful in my opinion, because while one person might not be interested in an article, we are almost 230,000 people here and surely, at least a few hundred of us will be interested in what's being downvoted into oblivion. 

EDIT 1:  To clarify.


EDIT 2:  Yay, downvoted while arguing against the downvoting happiness.  The irony!
