This is especially important in rural SC! The expectation, even in college engineering degrees, is that you get your Mrs. degree after marrying another engineer. I know several women I graduated with (from a SC college) who got married just after getting their STEM degree and became homemakers. I mean, if that's what they want I can't judge, but it just seems like a waste.

Let them know that having a successful career isn't going to make them less of a woman and showing strength and intelligence won't make them less attractive.
