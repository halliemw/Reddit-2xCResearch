Not really... I used to read a lot when i was younger and I loved it! I miss it a lot but I find that I just don't have the time or attention span that I used to have to really delve into a good novel. I like to bake but I don't want to do it all the time (plus I also like to eat what I bake which is bad for my waistline!). I need a hobby but there isn't anything that I've discovered yet that makes me want to give up my "de-stressing" time to do.
