It doesn't seem as if you read the title to this post. I was simply wondering if anyone else has been through something similar to what I've gone through. Thank you for responding and taking the time to read, but your argumentativeness is not appreciated. This is a delicate subject for me and I'd prefer for the responses to be respectful, not disagreeable.
