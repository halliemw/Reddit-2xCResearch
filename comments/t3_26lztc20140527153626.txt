I wasn't claiming to offer a magic solution. My experience has actually been different from OP's in that needing to end the friendship is a rarity, at least amongst my friends.

What I *do* suggest is to have these conversations about interest and boundaries sooner rather than later. Making friends is a bit like dating, and if things are going to end over this issue, you may as well do it sooner rather than later so that neither person is as torn up about it and so that you can move on to making new friends.
