Man, this hit really close to home. I've lost around 70lbs and I'm about 14lbs away from my goal weight but I still feel so uncomfortable in my own skin. Everything just seems loose, saggy and unattractive. I'm the fittest and the skinniest I've ever been and I'm still fucking miserable about the way I look.

I don't know if I'll ever be happy with my body, but reading things like this is really encouraging. Thank you for posting and sharing your story, I think you're god damn awesome.
