Sadly there are horrible people in the world, it sucks that you ended up in that situation.  As other people have said it's good you understand the fear of female friends is unreasonable, but I understand it's hard to get over.  I personally find that being in a big group of people (like a uni society) that share hobbies lets you find female friends (if not a huge number) and it's a comfortable place to get to know each other.  You will meet a lot of people that you won't always be comfortable around.  I think the biggest thing to get comfortable with is saying no.  Even with social situations its fine to just turn people down, don't feel obliged to be in a place that you aren't happy.
