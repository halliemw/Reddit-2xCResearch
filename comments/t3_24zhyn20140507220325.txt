Hey, this isn't exactly the perspective you may be looking for, but I was in your shoes 4 years ago.  And I'm still figuring it out.  Especially now that she's hit her independent, "I'm going to do whatever I want, however I want" streak.

Anywho, a philosophy that (I think) has been great for our relationship has been really staying on my toes and adapting to what she wants.  Some nights, this means tea partying and/or some cupcake board game that I really dislike playing...but I never let her see that.  Other nights, it's watching Star Trek and Lego building.  Still other nights, it's trampoline jumping or bike riding.  Point is, if you're open to it and act excited about it, then chances are good that she will be too.  And if she isn't, well...on to the next one.

The best way I can say it (for girls and for just being a parent in general) is that the things that you have years of formative opinions/teachings about...she has none of them.  If you act like something is exciting (or are genuinely excited about it) then chances are very good that she will be too.  To that effect, my best advice is to just play it cool, have a good consequence/reward structure for when she gets older (one that's fair and firm) and then just enjoy it with her.
