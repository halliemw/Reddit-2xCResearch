I was just saying that in my experience in high school the kids who made USAMO, USAPhO, etc. were all boys. In my experience girls are better at being well rounded high school students but the boys are the ones the shine brighter in STEM.

Also the critical thinking thing is a moot point at the high school level. You need to actually need to learn (via memorization) so much information before trying to even "think critically" in a significant manner in STEM.
