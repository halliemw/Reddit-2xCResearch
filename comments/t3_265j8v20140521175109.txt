Really? I love it when a guy tells me I'm beautiful when I don't feel especially pretty. It makes me happy when a guy can look at me with no make up on or if I'm caked in sweat and dirt and tell me I'm beautiful. I feel like I appreciate it the least when I know I'm beautiful but I still smile and say thank you. 

That being said, have you talked to your husband about this? Have you asked him why he doesn't touch you? I highly recommend two things: telling yourself how wonderful you are every day (it sounds stupid, but it really does help!) and talking to your husband. I mean, it seems like you've tried talking to him, but it seems that you haven't told him that it hurts you when he doesn't answer. I don't understand how he can just not answer. If he doesn't answer you need to find a way to demand one.
