I'm nearing the end of mine and honestly I've questioned it since day 1... not least because I moved country, left everyone I knew and subsequently didn't build a network in my home country so prospects look better here. 

I don't want to continue in academia nor am I particularly enamored by industry, but this is the first time in my life that I've felt at home, surrounded by people who think like me. 

However, if I wasn't sure (and it wasn't confused by my personal life) and I could see potential outside of academia I would say it's better to go into industry. You can always start your PhD later (or do an industrial or part time PhD) as many of my colleagues have done. In my department I would say that 1/3 of try-outs (we give 6 month trial periods) refuse the offer to take on the PhD and go on to enjoy their industry careers very much.
