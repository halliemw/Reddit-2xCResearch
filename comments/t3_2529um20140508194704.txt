I'm so glad you made positive changes in your life, and I think you're very brave for sharing your story. 

The guy was definitely a piece of shit. He shouldn't have fucked you in the first place if he was so repulsed by you. Please stop saying you should have done things differently and that you misled him. He should have been forthcoming with you. You are not an idiot, he's a dick.  

That said, you can't help who you're attracted to. You clearly both created expectations around each other that were unattainable (him of your looks, you of his feelings), and I feel like you got in too deep way too fast. You call him your ex even though you never had an irl relationship. I'm definitely not saying you're the problem, my dear Mortified, but it sounds like you're an intense person, to your own detriment. Don't close your heart to other men (they're not all bad), but don't put all your emotional eggs in one basket.

Good luck <3
