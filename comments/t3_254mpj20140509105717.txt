This suck so bad for you! I'm sorry that you're having such an awful time during an already stressful time in your life. 

It's nowhere near as bad, but I recently had my own hospital period embarrassment. 

My dad was in hospital getting chemo for an aggressive form of leukemia. It has been a long fight and he gets depressed staying in the hospital by himself, so my family makes an effort to have people with him there most of the time. I was there one evening after work. Dad had fallen asleep and I dozed off too, sitting up in the chair next to him. I started my period while I was asleep and didn't feel anything. In fact, when I woke up I got up and took a walk around the floor with a big period stain on my butt. If that wasn't bad enough, a nurse came to do rounds and saw blood on the chair and on the edge of my dad's bed (I guess I leaned on it?) and raised an alert. When I came back in the room people were pulling the sheets off dad, checking him over to see if he had pulled an IV or catheter and generally freaking him out. When they noticed me an orderly said, "OH, SHE'S JUST ON HER PERIOD." Cue me dying of embarrassment and guilt over disturbing my sick dad.
