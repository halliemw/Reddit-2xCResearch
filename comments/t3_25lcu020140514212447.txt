As a lady cyclist, your dad don't know shit about bikes.

Step-through frames are good for wearing skirts while biking, or for people who have hip or leg issues that make normal frames difficult to use.

Non-step through frames are not "boy bikes," they are *unisex*. If you like, I'd be happy to dig up a bunch of photos of professional lady cyclists. I can guarantee you none of them are using step through frames.

There are some ladies' cycles out there that have altered geometry to better suit women's proportions, such as a shorter top tube and narrower handlebars. But as long as the bike you have fits you, you have no need to seek out a women-specific bike.
