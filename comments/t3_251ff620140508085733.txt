In a word? No. [In a thousand words](http://imgur.com/7TQ3Bw8)

There are zero moderation tools that allow the moderators to counter the downvote problem. I don't even think these things are being downvoted maliciously in most cases, but the "default" Reddit user base aren't folks who want self-post, deep conversations about women's issues. They downvote them because they're not easily-digestable, funny or tech-related. They don't want our items in their stream.

If Reddit really want to promote this community, they'd skip making it a default and instead put it in the "trending subreddits" and use their advertising platform for it. They've recently shown they're willing to do this, because they promoted the heck out of /r/tech after /r/technology imploded. Then posters who are interested in our content could come check it out instead of everyone being dumped here.
