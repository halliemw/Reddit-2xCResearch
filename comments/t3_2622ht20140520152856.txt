Thank you! It's just difficult because it comes in waves. So I will be sitting in the doctors office telling them how I've been in excruciating pain while I look totally fine. When I was being seen for the stabbing pain I brought up endometriosis and no one took me seriously because I was "too young." I'm glad you got yours figured out!
