Great advice!  

My parents went to counseling shortly after getting married because they were fighting constantly about this stuff.  The therapist's advice was that a house cleaner was cheaper than therapy, and their only real issue was that both had demanding careers and didn't have energy and time to clean.  

My husband and I have a house cleaner come every-other week.  It's probably one of the best things we do for our relationship!
