The best thing to do is leave smelling like a rose. That's ALWAYS a good thing.

However.

Catch a coworker in private. Choose someone who has been there a long time. Find out what happens when people give notice - are they dumped instantly, never getting another shift? Because if that's company policy and you need a paycheck between now and May 9, do NOT give two weeks notice. Companies who do this to their employees deserve nothing beyond "Today is my last day." You sound like your boss is a good guy, but he does not set policy and may not have a choice. Ask.

If the history is good, then you give your notice ASAP, in writing. Do NOT apologize, because you are doing nothing wrong. Nine days notice for a min wage job is fine. He can replace you in about 12 minutes.
