I got into this with someone in the other thread, but maybe you can be more helpful.

How do we know the school actually found them guilty of anything? In every article I've read, the ***flier*** is the only thing that says the accused were found responsible. That being said, how would the people writing the names know one way or the other? It's not like the university is just going to hand that information out to anyone who asks for it, and especially not to a victim.

Can you imagine the liability that would come with "Yeah, we found enough evidence to prove _______ was guilty of sexually assaulting you, but we're not punishing him."

It just wouldn't happen.
