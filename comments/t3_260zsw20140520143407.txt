A wise old Family Law Attorney once said to me, "one or a combination of three things can destroy a marraige; sex, money or religion". She was the attorney who arranged my adoption as a child, my Sunday school teacher and a lifelong family friend. I wish, in a way I had listened to her.

What she meant was that if a couple are too far apart on any one of these three things, there will be intense friction leading to resentment because they go to the core of who a person is and especially how they see themselves. When it comes to money, an irresponsible spender will clash with a spouse who is a saver unless they can compromise. Sex is the same. Let's say, for arguments sake that you only want sex infrequently but he wants it all the time. How long do you think that relationship will last? Religion is evey bit as deep as any of the others. For example: Taking his comment about the whole Satan tempting him; I would conclude that he believes in heaven and hell and the corresponding afterlives. The way he's looking at it, at the end of your respective lives, you will be in hell as a non-believer and he will be in heaven. I would say that that alone, assuming his love for you, would cause a great deal of angst for him. The other thing about religion is the community aspect. You didn't indicate that he attends church regularly, but it is a firm possibility that he will want to in the future; can you be honest with yourself and wholeheartedly join in, or would you have to fake it? If you had to fake it would you be happy? Could you indefinitely keep up the charade?

You have a lot of questions to answer about the direction of your future. If it helps; this crossroads always happens to thoughtful, self aware people. I'm sorry to leave this as a cliche', but I wish you and your boyfriend all the happiness life can give, but happiness is something you can only give yourself.
