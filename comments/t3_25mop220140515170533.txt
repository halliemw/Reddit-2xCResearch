One thing is that a psychiatrist is quite different than a psychologist.  The former are (perhaps being a bit stereotypical here) pill happy.  The latter are more about talking your issues out.  I would suggest seeing a psychologist who can't even prescribe pills (they'll recommend someone to a psychiatrist if they think they are needed).  If he bad experience is with a psychiatrist, then perhaps he will be willing to give a psychologist a chance.

Also, like dar78 is saying, this doesn't sound like major depression.  This is something that I think could be handled with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (namely Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, which helps with stopping illogical thoughts, which seems to be his biggest issue), not pills.

If anything, study up on REBT.
