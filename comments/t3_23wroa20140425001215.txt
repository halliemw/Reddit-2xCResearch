OMG I completely know how you feel. My parents and family have thought I was a lesbian since high school (at least ten years now). Since that time, I have had more than one serious, live-in boyfriend, dated my share of men, and have not once been gay. And yet the title still stands!  Good luck breaking the rumor now: I've been dating a man seriously for months (yes they've met him) and they still think I should invite a "nice girl" to my sister's wedding. I think they just like the novelty of having a homosexual child now, even though they don't.
