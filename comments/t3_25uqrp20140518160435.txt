I typed this all up and then lost it! Screwy laptop! I left it as a side note because there is not definitive proof, and even if he didn't have a hand in her death I wanted OP to know people can be dicks. 

As far as what happened, my mom died of an accidental overdose. She was only supposed to be on 1 Opana, and all her medication was locked in a safe that she had no access to. Only my stepdad had access to. We got suspicious last summer after some people said some things and requested the police report, ME report, and toxicology. She had 15 medications in her system, some of them redundant. There were lies in the police report. There were lies our stepdad had told us. My sister who was there with her boyfriend that night said Mom was fine until she ate dinner, and then something was wrong. She asked my stepdad to check on her during the night. He admittingly did not, and slept on the couch. He also now claims that my sister and her boyfriend were never there. We all know they were there, I talked to my mom before she ate and she told me they were there. I saw the police photos of all the medications she had in the house, they had sent them all to the ME's office. But, when I moved in several of the ones that I would later find out were in the  toxicology report were in the safe. When I spoke to the police, the detective had very detailed notes saying they took the medicine from the safe. We have a whole report of little weird things like this. We know right now there is no way to prove anything, there is no "damning" evidence. But, we made a very detailed report and gave it to the detective and left it in their hands.
