Not to sound callous or minimize any family's personal tragedy, but that adds up to 108 domestic homicides per year.  In a population of about 65 million.  

To put that into perspective, about 6,000 people commit suicide in the UK every year, and 75,000 die of heart disease every year.  What this shows is that domestic violence homicide is not actually a significant cause of mortality in the UK.  This shows that such murders are actually vanishingly rare.  I'm actually shocked that the number is so small.  I was under the impression that women were at significant risk of being killed by a husband or boyfriend.  That number suggests that this isn't the case at all.

EDIT: I'm just responding to the article's contention that this number represents a "scandal" for the country.  That is simply a senseless conclusion given the surprisingly small number of deaths relative to the size of the population and the overall homicide rate.
