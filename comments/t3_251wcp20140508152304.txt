The first time I revealed that I was a woman on Reddit, was also the first time I'd heard of gonewild. So, there's that.

Also, the massively creepy PMs that happened. Just... HOW?! I know the anonymity of the internet is a double edged sword, but how can someone say such filthy things based on gender alone?
