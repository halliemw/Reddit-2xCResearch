Thanks for bringing this up.  I agree that the two forms of oppression often manifest very differently, and I openly questioned the comparison specifically because I realized in my thought process that the analogy might not apply directly.  The prevalence of gendered language was the main difference I thought was applicable to this particular scenario, but I'm happy to discuss others that you have in mind.  

I don't think that sexism and racism are equivalent or that the experiences of one are similar to the other.  I do generally believe movements against all forms of oppression can learn from one another, *but I agree that this must be done carefully*.  In my analogy above, I tried to make sure that the target of negativity and scrutiny in this case was directed at a person of privilege (a white man wearing a racist shirt) and avoided using any actual "negative comments about black people" merely to make a point.  

You might rightfully note that simply avoiding saying bad things about black people doesn't mean I can use the example of racism to aid in my understanding of sexism and other forms of oppression, and you could be right.  Maybe I could have made my point just as effectively (or less effectively but more appropriately) without making an analogy to racism at all, or maybe comparisons to racism are best left to those who actually experience it.  I do apologize if anyone feels like their own fight against oppression has been hindered by my reference to it.
