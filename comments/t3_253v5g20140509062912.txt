Having had a few yeast infections in the past, I thought I recognized the itching and burning symptoms and self medicated with yeast infection cream bought at the pharmacy, which normally clears things up in a day or two. This time though my nether regions seemed to explode, with itching and burning so bad that I could only pray for unconsciousness. Turns out, the infection I had was bacterial, not fungal, and using a yeast medication made it ten times worse. I really wish they would include some kind of pee stick in the box to confirm you have a yeast infection before using the cream.
Also, having never taken oral medication for yeast infections, are pills really more efficient in clearing up yeast infections? I know the creams can be inconvenient and messy, but they do a great job in the immediate area, and I can only imagine that the oral medication would have to be much stronger and affect the body as a whole, kind of like the antibiotics that mess up the balance in the first place.
