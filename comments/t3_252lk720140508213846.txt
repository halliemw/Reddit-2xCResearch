Yes.   Iran is ruled by a strict Sharia code of law.  They could be imprisoned and beaten (lashed).  For a severe enough breach of the...for lack of a better term..."dress code", they face being permanently disfigured with the lashes. 

Charmingly, in many Sharia law countries, the husband can also be punished for his wife's behavior, since he is her *wali*, and thus responsible for her.  Though this is uncommon practice, and I don't know if it happens at all in Iran.
