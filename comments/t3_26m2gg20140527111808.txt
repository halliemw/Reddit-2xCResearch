My partner and I visit regularly and do chores around the house.  My 20 year old sister lives at home and dutifully does whatever is asked of her.  My 23 year old sister also lives at home and while she's a mini-me of my mom, she will also help if harassed to do so.

Oh, and my dad has a visiting nurse.

I understand what you are saying and it's my fault for being so vague, but I'm telling you she is blowing it out of proportion and acts like she does a lot more than she really does.
