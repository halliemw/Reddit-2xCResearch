I have not seen anyone stopping an affiliation, but plenty of young well known women have declared they are not feminists.  Most with language like Shailene Woodley, who said she wasn't a feminist because “I love men, and I think the idea of ‘raise women to power, take the men away from the power’ is never going to work out because you need balance.”

Implicit in this is that feminism means you don't love men, and that you want to harm men.
