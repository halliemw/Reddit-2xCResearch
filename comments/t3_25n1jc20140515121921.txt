I'm still trying to avoid pregnancy (100% success so far, go me!) and I completely agree that it must be weird to switch to trying to get pregnant. I mean, it would almost be weirder if one *didn't* find it weird. 

Here's a substance we're actively avoiding, a condition we don't want to be in, an entire life change we're avoiding, and one day it's all reversed. It's almost crazy.
