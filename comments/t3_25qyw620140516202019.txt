Nothing wrong with it. When people are secure in their relationships they don't (always) experience jealousy in the usual ways. I personally enjoy seeing my SO with other women, because 1) it allows me to watch his mannerisms from an objective position and really see all the things I love that he does without the distraction of being a participant, and 2) it gives me a thrill because it reminds me exactly what I have to lose, and that I'm thankful for being with him.
