This sort of reminds me of a story I heard on the radio years ago.

This woman meets a great guy everything goes well and stays at his place, she has a massive poo in the loo but the toilet won't flush so she gets a carrier bag and scoops out the poo and wraps it up hoping to dispose of it outside, before she goes she writes him a note with her number and details for when he wakes up then leaves but she forgot to pick up the bad of poo which she claims she left on side.

So she's left the bag of poo and can't get back in, he never called her back.
