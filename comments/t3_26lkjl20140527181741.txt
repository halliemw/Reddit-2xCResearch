If you're looking at the UK stats 286 deaths = almost every day. That means it's happening on a regular basis. It's not like a huge percentage of women are being killed, but it's not a rare event or an anomaly. 

If you want to look at world wide murder stats: http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Globa_study_on_homicide_2011_web.pdf

Women are primarily killed by their spouses, then family members, then acquaintances, then strangers. For men it is the exact opposite in terms of who kills them. You can see examples and breakdowns by country in that report. It is a world wide societal problem that women are killed primarily by current and former domestic partners. 

There is a reason for that. To say it's just ... what? An accident? A statistical oddity that women get killed primarily by their domestic partners is flying in the face of reason. While murder rates go down in countries, the percentage of people who are killed being female goes up. Domestic murder rates drop at a lower rate than over all murder and there is a reason for that. 

In western democratic countries the it's usually guessed that 1 in 4 to 1 in 8 women (depending on the country) experience domestic abuse in their lifetime. If a quarter to a tenth of your population experiences a specific kind of violence, and most female murder victims are murdered by their spouses, that's a societal problem. It indicates a sizeable minority of your population thinks it's OK to harm women and that this problem has not been adequately addressed.
