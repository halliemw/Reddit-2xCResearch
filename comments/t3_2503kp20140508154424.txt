After a good nights rest, turning off devices, emails from work - I talked to her again and I'm now past the initial feelings of anger and disappointment when I was so very exhausted from the other external factors.  We had a very good talk today about the situation and I feel she's making the right decisions for the right reasons for herself.  We decided for her to come to where I reside, as it will be extremely discrete for her to say "Going to visit Mom a few days" versus why I made a surprise visit to a very small town.  Also it will be more comfortable to have her in my home, versus staying in a cramped and musty hotel room. (Slim pickings in a rural area) and me having a very short limited stay, where as in my home doors always open and she can leave when she's ready to travel.

The other advantage to her staying with me a few days is she can focus on her recovery without having to pretend nothing is wrong as she lives with her boyfriend and his parents...as they are not aware of the situation. And we can have some quality alone time.  

Was funny, after the divorce I was only making $10.00 and living in NJ (Housing and rent is expensive) and while we were discussing that she's barely able to support herself on her income, that I know the hardship of having 3 kids under the age of 5 and only having $35.00 for an entire weekend, with one in diapers.   She laughed and said "is that why we ate so many hot dogs with scrambled eggs slathered in purple ketchup and baby carrots? I told her yep... I put on my best game face on while I was completely trying to keep it together. 

So she knows on my end, right now I'm talking to her from the heart and don't want to see her needlessly suffer in an already difficult situation along to how unfair that would be to a child. 

The only thing to do now is for her to make the appointment...
