I'm a naturalist - douches are so bad for your vag.. So way to go on steering clear. Fishy smells are generally from bacterial infections. Guys can hold onto various infections, and then pass them onto you. So if you've been treated for an infection, he needs to be treated as well (read this as 'see your doc!'). If you are using lube - try using coconut oil instead. It is an all natural gentle antibacterial and a fantastic lubricant (seriously, try it). 

Perhaps it is just a mixture of your 'juices' like the other commenter said. Or there can be an interruption in your pH balance following sex. My sister had this and the advice her doctor gave was to not wear underwear during the night following sex. 

There are several options for you to try - talk to your doc, research online, try different options - but mainly, do whatever works for you :)
