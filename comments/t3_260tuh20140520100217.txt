I had a similar situation about five years back; I just had never felt "Interested" in anyone I met. Looking back I have noticed I had trust issues, and really didn't want to put myself out there. All of this changed when I met a female with similar interests as mine... We hung out for a few months and I slowly started too notice a change in myself. I had finally met someone that I was willing to open up to... This one person changed me completely, and transformed me into the person I am today. I am very thankful for that and hope "you" can eventually experience what I have. The three years I was together with this woman were the best three years of my life. I absolutely regret splitting up with the woman I loved, and still love today.
