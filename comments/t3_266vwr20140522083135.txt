I feel like we come from similar backgrounds here. My family is very conservative and active in the fundamentalist Christian community. I am still a Christian but much more liberal in my beliefs. I recently brought up the idea of moving in with my boyfriend to save money (even mentioning that I'd move in his guest room), and my parents flipped. I told them I was just THINKING about it, and they acted like I was already devaluing myself. My dad asked if my bf and I had had sex. I wanted to say that was none of his business, but I lied and said no... I'm 26 years old. I was expecting more of a, "We don't think it's a good idea, but you're an adult..." I'm still struggling to assert my beliefs and opinions around my parents, but it's a work in progress.

I am so sorry about what happened to you. Without knowing your mother, I'm guessing she's coming from a place of love and concern but is instead repeating the lie that was passed down to her by her parents/society. Unfortunately, it sounds like she severely damaged your trust and it will take time to build that up again. I know how painful and scary it can be to stand up to your parents and be completely honest, but I do think it's important. I would encourage you to write a letter to your mom about how she made you feel. That way, you can get all your thoughts out without worrying about losing the nerve to say it when you're face to face. Whether or not you give it to her (though I'd really encourage you to), I think it would be good for you just to put your feelings into words.
