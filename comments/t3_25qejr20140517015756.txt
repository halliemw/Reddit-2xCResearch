There is ongoing research [in the Netherlands](http://www.vumc.nl/afdelingen/Neonatologie/Moedermelkbank/donoreninfo11/) about this. Women can donate breast milk to babies in the intensive care units, they would like to see whether it improves their health. 

I don't see any health problems with donating surplus breast milk. I guess you might eat more (which costs money), plus it will take you some time to express the breast milk. So I guess it costs a bit of money (for food) and time (for doing it and for sending the milk in or having somebody pick it up etc).

As for receiving it: breast milk can contain medications and it can contain infections like bacteria or viruses. Of course with these organisations that collect breast milk, they try to reduce this risk by selecting healthy women, running tests, and limiting the kind of medications that they can take, etc, but the risk is never zero. 

I don't think that I would donate,  given the amount of time it would take and the fact that I don't expect it to be very beneficial. But research is ongoing about that, as I said...
