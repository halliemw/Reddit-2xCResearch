And you are assuming the exact opposite and dismissing his point without evidence.

At the risk of stating the obvious - assuming that there are inherent differences between male and female style thought, this doesn't preclude women from programming, since programming is an individual activity and not a collective one.  Furthermore, since programming requires different skills, it's possible that on average each group would excel at something different.  For example, it's possible that men would excel at algorithm design while women would excel at managing complicated class connections.  (both of these are required in order to design a program)
