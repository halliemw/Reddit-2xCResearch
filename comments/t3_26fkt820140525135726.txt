It can be really hard to break social rules by being "ungraceful", but yeah, someone treating you this way requires whatever defenses you need. 

But retaliation for defending yourself is real, too. I had to leave a job because I was assaulted by a co-worker. He was fired, but management made my life awful after that, too.
