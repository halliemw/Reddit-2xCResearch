> I realize this is anecdotal, but I've never had any problems emailing my professors, and the majority of them were male. 

This you can't really know. You haven't experienced any bias, which is not the same as that has not happened. I haven't, personally, experienced problems either but I can't possibly know what kind of reply I would have gotten if I had been a male. 

For instance, there are several studies where the exact same essay/application was given to two groups of people, the only difference being that the name of the writer was a male or female name. People rate the essay/application more positively when associated with a male name than when associated with a female one. Both women and men do this to the same degree and the results tend to be statistically significant. That said, this isn't usually conscious, those doing it do it regardless of their best intentions. So there's that.

I also hope it doesn't discourage anyone from higher education, though.
