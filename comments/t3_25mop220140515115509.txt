Agreed, to an extent.

I am actually in a similar situation, while having an unique perspective. I am not only that guy, but friends with that guy... And we live in the same house... And hang out a lot.

We support each other when we get down on ourselves, because we know we can count on each other. In fact, we feel that way with many of our friends. The problem is, we think it's silly or weak to reveal your sensitive side to the people you've called "the guys" for almost as long as you've known them.

Every once in a while, we have a breakdown, and often, we'll find one of our friends not far away, asking if we're alright, asking if we want to talk, and trying to make us laugh despite being sad. 

When they succeed, they make us feel way better, for a lot longer, than simply being boisterous and fun. At least, this is always how I feel, I would not know about my roommate, for sure, but he always seems happier afterwards.

The point is, I think you should find his closest friend. Someone who's closer to your boyfriend than any of his others (you'll know), and tell him what's going on. Damn, you might even get a response of "ah, shit... He's going through that again?" and he'd ask how you wanted him to help.(you would in my friend group, at least)
