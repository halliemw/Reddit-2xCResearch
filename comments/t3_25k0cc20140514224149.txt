I'm graduating from college on Friday! I'm so proud of myself for getting here, it was not an easy road and at one point I thought I wasn't cut out for higher education. I had to teach myself to adapt better self talk and realized that I am capable, I am smart, and I deserve good things. I love myself like never before. I never thought I could say that.
