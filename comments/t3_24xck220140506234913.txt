I understand the distinction between pro-choice and pro-abortion.


"Most people in committed relationships make the choice together."

I don't think that it is accurate to assume that "most people" agree what to do during an accidental pregnancy. That is a fairly large generalisation that there is often no debate between the parents of the baby when they unexpectedly become pregnant.


I am aware that contraception is not 100% effective. Neither is abortion. Contraception is, however, seen as safer than abortion. While there are certainly adverse reactions to contraception, there are side-effect of abortion as well, including not only infection and physical manifestations, but emotional trauma as well.

Contraception, e.g. condoms, will also help rpevent STIs. Having unprotected sex swith the view that you can get an abortion if you fall pregnant will not protect you from STIs.


I am aware that rapes happen; this was part of my reasoning behind my comment that there are some legitimate reasons for abortion.


I have the right to challenge pro-choice activists, as they do to pro-life activists and anti-abortion activists.


"Welcome to life. Everyone will always try to challenge your opinions if they disagree- which is also what you're doing to pro-choice activists now."

I posted to point out that pro-life posters are disagreed with far more than pro-choice activists, when in this sub both opinions should be equally respected and seen as equally valid.

Is this because it's become "cool" to think abortion is ok? Do people challenge people's opinion against abortion because they don't want to be seen as close minded or intolerant, like so many anti-abortionists are?
