Ticks which carry lyme disease can live on just about any mammal - stray cats, stray dogs, raccoons.  Doesn't take much to get one onto you, either, and if you're an indoor person you might not have noticed.

I'd say the next thing to do would be to see your GP - he/she will probably want to get a bunch of blood tests run, so long as you're not queasy about it.  Blood tests are super easy, and there's not much of a problem testing for something that comes back fine.
