(((Hugs)))

I'm so proud of you!#

Actually the police will stay there for hours. You can ask your mom to pack up your stuff. Not that she will but you can ask. It is best to have them there and the police there when you pick up your stuff. That way they can't accuse you of stealing from them and they can't attack you. 

I am SO proud of you!!
