>What you need though, is anti-biotics.

Oh I know. This is such an easy problem to solve and shouldn't give me so much grief.

Planned Parenthood does provide sexual healthcare, but there aren't too many of them in the Bible Belt. I think the closest one to me is about an hour away, and I still can't afford to take off work.

I will definitely pick up some probiotics. Thanks for the fact sheet - this thing needs to be posted up in American High schools...
