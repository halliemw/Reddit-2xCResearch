I direct you to the  sidebar "Welcome to TwoXChromosomes, a subreddit for thoughtful content - serious or silly - related to gender, and intended for women's perspectives."  The emphasis is on "Intended for women's perspectives". Y perspectives are welcome as long as they are following the guidelines which also are articulated in the sidebar.
