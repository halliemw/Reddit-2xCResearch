Im not the person you're commenting with, but how is it absurd to deduce that the women of twox are frightened/wary/whatever word you'd like to use of more men in the subreddit? Since being defaulted it's been filled with posts complaining about the change. There's this automatic assumption that suddenly men are going to take over and make this a sexist, terrible space. And the fact that this sub is going to jump all over the men who are interested in conversation is, quite frankly, disappointing and unsurprising. The reason im unsubbing from twox is because of people like you, not people like him. I dont want to be a part of a community where sexism against women isn't tolerated but sexism against men is not only accepted, but encouraged.

You want to be a feminist, really learn what feminism is all about.
