You have to stand up for yourself for the whole rest of your life, this is pretty much what it feels like, always. Good for you but do understand that your dad is only doing what he thinks he is supposed to do. If you can be kind to him through this you might be able to show him that you are more grown up than he thought. But it is OK to "fight" to be the person that you know you need to be. go girl.
