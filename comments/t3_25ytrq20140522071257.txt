Perhaps you were late to class that day when the teacher told everyone that there would be violent and disturbing imagery shown, or perhaps the teacher gave a small notice at the beginning of the semester.

The only way to make everyone happy would be to give a warning before every image, or at the beginning of every class. Either way, its redundant, given that students are given appropriate syllabi at the beginning of their semesters and know which event is being discussed beforehand.
