I dunno. I mean, I think the point you were trying to make was a valid one, but it probably could have been summed up as, "This isn't as new or unique to Frozen as people make it out to be. Even the original fairy tale did a better job at it." Which it did; in the Snow Queen, the girl saves the boy (though she's also not a princess and the resemblance between Frozen and The Snow Queen are more incidental than anything else.

I think it's also worthwhile to debate things and think about things, broadly, but I think it can be valuable to make sure the opinions expressed are your own, and you aren't just trying to rely on another person's expertise to back yourself up. There were a lot of things in there that I think were worth debating - for instance, who says that Disney movies are inherently harmless? I can think of a number of Disney movies that had problematic implications about women, race, etc etc.

I know it can be easy, also, to feel as though other people can express things better than you can, but that, too, is a skill to be developed, and when we put the effort into thinking about what we want to say, we also end up thinking about how we want to say it, as a side effect.
