I am sorry my dear. I had this happen to me three times. Twice I had a catheter inserted and the build up was drained. It was in place for two weeks and was uncomfortable but SO much better than the cyst.

The 3rd time I obsessively took Silica from a vitamin store. I took 4 times the normal amount along with sits bather and it went down. Please give that a try.

You need a better doctor. My gyno did the catheter procedure in her office and it only took 2-5 minutes. Please see another doctor ASAP. It shouldn't get do bad you need to go to the hospital.

Please pm me if you need any other info. I live in nyc and could definitely refer you to my doctor. She is amazing!
