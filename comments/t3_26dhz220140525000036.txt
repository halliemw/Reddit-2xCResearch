As with any breach of trust there are two ways it could go. 1 it breaks the relationship, one or the other is unwilling to change or learn. 2 It strengthens the relationship because both realize what they have to loose and they want to work on it. 

Your choices are to distrust and stay distant or to try to forgive (not forget) and work/focus on what strengthens your connection. His responsibility is to be open and not betray your trust again. Sounds like this isn't a drop the relationship and run. Maybe talking to a counselor would help.
