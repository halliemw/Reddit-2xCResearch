That's really weird. I don't completely understand how reddit works, but sometimes if you are getting downvotes, you have to wait a period of time before reddit let's you post again. Although, I have no idea if that is what is happening to you. 

The mods over there are good, you should try messaging them something short and sweet and they may be able to help you out. 

You might be able to gain some insight into your situation just by browsing old posts over there. The comment sections can be insightful. 

I'm sorry about your situation. It sounds heart wrenching. If it were me, I might just try to disengage from the whole thing, but I don't know if that is the very best course of action.
