Yes, except, well, when the one "oddball" is male and the rest are female, the females often give in to the male voice.  We're dealing with a very longterm situation of this nature at work, it's obvious to all outsiders, and I have gotten close enough to many of the women in the group to ask them *why* do you continue to do this (listen so carefully to Man and ignore so scrupulously feminine voices).

They look uncomfortable when I ask, they have no response (but they are slowly organizing "secret" meetings without this man...and I keep asking).  Of course, two of them actually quit their jobs over it (really competent women, potential leaders) and one asked for a transfer to another division (which she got, because the administration doesn't want to risk a sexual harassment charge...and because people are actually aware of the problem and want to fix it).
