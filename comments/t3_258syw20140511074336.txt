In most every other case, a plea deal is to a lesser crime that is about the scale of the crime or the mentality of the accused.  For example, 2cn being pled to negligent manslaughter would be a change from 'the accused intended to during the heat of the moment' to 'the accused never intended to but was being stupid in general'.  With rape to stat rape, it is about the victim.  It goes from 'the victim did not consent' to 'the victim did consent but it wasn't valid'.

Also to note, a stat rape plea deal for a case of underage rape is the same thing as saying the adult victim deserved it and letting the rapist go (because if you allow a plea that an adult victim did consent, then there wouldn't be a crime).

I'm not even happy with asking a victim if they want such a choice and would rather ban that style of plea deal in general (disclaimer: I'm against plea deals in general), but it is better than not consulting the victim.
