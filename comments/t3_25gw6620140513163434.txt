Usually when I get out of the shower, I let my hair air dry until it's just a little damp and then put in a few pumps of [Joico Leave-In Protectant](http://www.joico.com/products/k-pak-leave-in-protectant/) and something akin to [BioSilk](http://www.farouk.com/haircare/biosilk/silk-therapy). Of couse you don't have to use those specific brands, but that process does well to keep my hair from getting to frizzy. It also helps make it super soft, and smell like magic!
