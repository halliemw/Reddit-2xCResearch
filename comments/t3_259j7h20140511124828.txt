Haha, I thought about it and the street harassment definitely used to be more, uh, creative when I had shorter hair. It actually didn't bother me as much to have weird things yelled at me rather than sexual things. 

This thread is making me want to cut my hair off again! I've just gotten past the mullety growing out stage though and my hair actually looks like a hairstyle for the first time in 4 months..
