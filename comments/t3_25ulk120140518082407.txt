>I feel guilty about getting frustrated. 

Don't feel guilty because of how you feel. Acknowledge your feelings for what they are, you are put in a tough situation, tough situations really take a lot out of a person. Anyone would be frustrated in your situation.

I think it is important to communicate your frustrations, do not place blame on anyone (including yourself), and think about what you can do to go forward from this. It sounds like from the other posters there are resources for you to look into. Check them out and see what work with you.
