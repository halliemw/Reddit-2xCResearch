Definitely post to /r/selfharm with this same question. Your sister needs a friend, a close friend that she can count on to help her through this. Self harm's crazy addictive, and very serious. 

As for self esteem, I don't really know. I have terrible self esteem myself, and never really seem to help others with it either. My four best friends all have terrible self esteem, and three of them have eating disorders. The only thing I can do is to compliment them whenever I can. New outfit? You look pretty. Fitting clothes? You look really thin! Etc. It's started to kick in a a little; they're being less and less self deprecating. (Although it might be because they're starting to get better and better and fighting the urge to self harm)

But seriously, stay on top of the self harm issue. If she's done it more than once or twice, she most probably has a chemical dependency on the dopamine released from it, so it's going to be very hard to shake. It's just like a drug in that the withdrawal is Hell, and can make any other issues (e.g. self esteem problems) worse.
