"Speaking as someone who refused several people on the past (now in a LTR) people who feel entitled to a yes answer to flirting will call you a bitch regardless of what you say. "

I don't disagree with this, some people are too defensive and entitlement can be a problem, for all genders. 

"A man can say a disinterested "sorry, no" but a woman who disinterestedly says the same is somehow viewed as more rude. "

But this! I thought you were trolling at first. I can GUARANTEE that I have never been impolite or obnoxious when rejecting a girl, I always try to be sensitive and not hurt their feelings, yet I still get called an asshole or a dick. That happens just as much as women being called a bitch. BOTH are wrong, but you pretend that one side doesn't even exist. 

And lastly, it isn't about "owing" anyone anything. It's about being a decent human being. You offer a response of the same caliber as the request- if a guy OR girl begins with groping and "lets fuck," then be as blunt or rude as you want. If they are genuinely polite, then be clear yet polite back, unless they keep insisting, then you can be rude because that in itself is rude. Social anxiety is in fact a real thing, it takes a lot for some people to even talk to someone they're interested in. You're not required to be polite, but you could, ya know, be nice to strangers anyway.
