Pretty sure it's gonna be wrapped up in a sterile package. Doctor opens it in the office using aseptic technique so it's sterile when he or she inserts it, unless something happened to the packaging along the way. I am a microbiologist, so I am only speaking from the microbiology side of things. As long as the customer doesn't open the package before getting to the doctor, it should be fine.
