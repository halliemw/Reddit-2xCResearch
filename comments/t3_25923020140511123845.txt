Women get boob jobs - and other procedures - for a myriad of reasons. One of those is to conform to their *own* image of attractiveness - one that is certainly shaped by men's preferences, but not that factor alone.

If men's sexual preferences were hard-coded and biologically unchanging, we wouldn't have seen such wild changes in preferences over time. Used to be, a pasty chubby lady with shaved-off eyebrows was the sexiest lady you could imagine. 

Obviously, most men today would *not* say that that's their ideal. Men's pretended have changed, while their biology has not. I think it's reasonable to assume, then, that the biological urges of men are not the sole factor in what most people consider attractive.
