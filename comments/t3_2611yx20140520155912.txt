That's disgusting that grown women act like that! Sorry to hear it. Such a poor reflection of their personalities. Unless you're working a job that requires a solid backbone, and then actually these women are doing you a favour by gradually helping you build one (unlikely), I don't understand why they can't be welcoming and warm towards a new member of staff? It's honestly not hard to do! I hope things improve - and they wake up with a kinder heart!
