The killer's rhetoric was "women should love me, they owe me, why don't they like me, I hate alpha males, I drive a nice car, I don't understand". This is not at all the rhetoric of TRP, it's actually almost the opposite. (Please note I am *not* arguing for TRP, I'm just making a specific argument in this discussion about the comparability of these two contexts.)
