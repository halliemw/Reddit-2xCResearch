I personally have the arm implant (Nexplanon). I just switched a few weeks ago from the pill, which I had been on since 2007. The reason I switched was because I suffer from extremely bad migraines. Many migraines in women who are menstruating (as in, the time span between their first period and menopause) are from the hormones. The pill, patch and nuvaring all have hormones that can affect the migraines. The insert in my arm doesn't have these and is a much better choice for someone like me.
