You can't seriously be angry at 12 year olds for laughing at an adult tripping.  Remember being in 7th grade? Imagine your teaching falling down mid-lecture.  Would you respond with empathy and concern?  Of course not - adults are basically aliens at that point, and you're at an age where you're first confronting the idea of parental authority.  You would snicker with the other kids.

I'm not a fan of the phrase "toughen up," but if you're going to focus so much on people being empathetic towards your perspective, try to take some time to remember theirs as well.

Also, people falling down is funny.  Entire careers in the entertainment business have been built on this concept.
