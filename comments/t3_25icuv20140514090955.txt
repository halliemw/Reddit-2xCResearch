Let's get this straight. The guy knew that OP has a boyfriend, and it's pretty obvious that putting your hand purposefully on someone's arse is sexual. So there is no way in hell he would assume that she's into him in that way. 

He wasn't misinterpreting her body language, he was sexually assaulting her, and you're blaming her?

Also, "as a woman" isn't really a free pass to victim blame. Sorry.
