Three out of four questions being about violence tells you nothing about how many of the people were violent. From the study:

>Of the 1,882 men in the total sample, 120 (6.4%) met criteria for rape or attempted rape. A majority of these men, 80.8%,reported  committing rapes of women who were incapacitated because of drugs or alcohol; 17.5% reported using threats or overt force in attempted rapes; 9.2% reported using threats or overt force to coerce sexual intercourse; and 10% reported using threats or overt force to coerce oral sex. 

The actual number of violent offenders based on the study is between 17.5% and 36.7%, not 75%.
