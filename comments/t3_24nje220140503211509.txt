Note that it could also be food related.  My sister had to stop giving her daughter soy milk for a long time because it was triggering these changes.  Soy milk contains a high level of phytoestrogen, which mimics the functions of the female sex hormone estrogen in humans.  My mom had to take me off of meat twice (way back when certain hormones were being used) when I was three and when I was five.  Some people are very sensitive to these things.
