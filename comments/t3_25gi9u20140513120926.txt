Most people who don't have experience with a breastfeeding mother don't know shit about it. It's sad, really. My baby tries to put the bottle in my mouth or squirt it everywhere, and if it's not the perfect temperature, won't drink it at all. Everyone is so used to seeing a baby drink out of a bottle it's become expected. >.>
