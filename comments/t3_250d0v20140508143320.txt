One thing you might want to consider looking into is love addiction. The anxious fear of abandonment is what is tipping me off to this. One commenter got closest to this idea when they mentioned Anxious attachment disorder. However, I would only suggest this as a possible cause if these kinds of feelings are a common occurrence in your past relationships or if you have a history of abandonment or neglect in your early upbringing. If that is the case, I highly recommend considering a therapist as well as the behavioral modifications you've listed.
