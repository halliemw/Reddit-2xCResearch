If you just mix food coloring in the water and the plant absorbs it thru the roots, the leaves will turn shades of blue as well.  This is not desireable, because the illusion of a true blue color is lost when the whole plant is unnaturally blue.  To achieve the effect (blue only in flowers), you will inject your white orchid with, right behind where the flowers are forming, said food coloring.  Preferably with the smallest needle&syringe you can find.  Ask a heroin addict if you know one. their needles would probably work well.  But dont do any heroin, you would likely muff up the process of dying your flowers if you do.
