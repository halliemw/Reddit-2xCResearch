You might be referring to:"shaved portions of the scalp other
than the neckline." That could include a fade, it could include cue ball--it's all about what's considered "professional." The fact that the males section of the AR670-1 specifically states that men may shave their heads but does not state the same for women suggests that if you want to shave your whole head and you're a woman, you're going to have a bad time (unless you have dreadlocks, in which case they shave them for you).
