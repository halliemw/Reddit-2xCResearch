Don't be surprised if some of those nasty comments had a high vote count at some point.  I think it has to do with different times of the day, and you need to understand that all sorts of people come to reddit.  Sometimes I see rude comments or bad jokes (imo anyway) get a really high karma, and I don't understand why, but you just move on.  Karma whoring is definitely a reddit tradition though, most of the time it's fine because the top comments really are funny and original but sometimes it sucks because everyone's too busy trying to one-up each other that any serious or kind comments gets lost.
