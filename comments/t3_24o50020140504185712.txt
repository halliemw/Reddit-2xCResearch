I just had to address a problem like this with my friends. I'm trying to cut back on drinking (mainly cause I feel like feeling like shit is little return for turning into a ball of annoying energy.) But if I don't have a drink in my hand, they put one there or tease me to do so.

Mg BF has said that they're just trying to be nice, which is true. They know I'm shy, being buzzed gets me out there and it helps us all have fun. He doesn't want to stop them from helping me have a good time, because that's what they honestly think they're doing.

So, he's gonna back me up. He's gonna grab me a soda and play it off like giving me a drink. Last night he was great by simply saying "I don't want her puking in my car." (I wasn't throwing up, not even close, but he has a very nice car, so it kills the question.)

Sometimes having backup is all you need.
