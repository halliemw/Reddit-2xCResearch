I follow the LoL community management stuff pretty closely, and I'm not sure there's a fair analogy between the in-game abuse they're addressing ('nub raka l2p' type stuff) and the type of directed, sexualized threats against women which this community and the beginning of the article are interested in.

If we give credence to that analogy and thereby conflate the two types of 'abuse,' it feels like we open the door to an endless stream of 'men face online harassment too' and 'this isn't a women's issue, that's just how the internet works' objections which could completely derail the conversation.
