Of course you want to respect your wife's wishes if she does not want to see a counselor, but maybe if she can see it a different way, she might reconsider. Ask her if she thinks she is modeling a healthy way of dealing with her feelings to the children. Would she be OK with it if they refuse to go to their counselors anymore, as well as refusing to talk about their feelings? Because they will learn how to address their own feelings of grief from her, and her way doesn't seem very healthy (maybe it is for her- everyone is different, but like you said, it just seems like she is in denial of what is happening.) It might be hard for her to hear this, but it might help. 

I am sorry for what your family is going through. Godspeed.
