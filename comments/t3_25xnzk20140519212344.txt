It doesn't really highlight the absurdness. The poses and designs are all hyper-feminine in their sexualisation. Of course male characters are going I look even more rediculous - they're hyper-masculine in THEIR sexualisation, so you're making something masculine do something feminine which always looks a bit silly. It's like seeing a hairy man wear a two piece bikini. It looks strange. 

That being said, the hyper sexualised nature of comic book characters is painfully obvious to everyone.
