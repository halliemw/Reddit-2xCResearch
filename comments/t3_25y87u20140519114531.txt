Thank you, that was very helpful! I think it might be like you said, that I haven't found the right group yet. The girls from work are into going out to bars and nightclubs which I can enjoy, but it's not my favorite activity. Overall they just seem very energetic and excited, and I guess that's not my personality. I was focusing on a need to change my personality to suit these women, when maybe I should be looking for different people who already suit my personality. I will have to try out meetup.com. I admit that it scares me a little but it seems worth trying!
