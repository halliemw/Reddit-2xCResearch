I used the word vagina within earshot of my grandfather. I was pregnant and telling a story. He then asked me to "watch my language". It's a body part, get over it. I guess everyone isn't as comfortable with certain terminology. I'm in the camp that the more we use the correct words the more it's normalized and considered less taboo.
