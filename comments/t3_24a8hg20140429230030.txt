That's fine, and good for you. But there is certainly a difference between making that decision of your own volition, and feeling culturally coerced to undergo the knife. The pressure to under plastic surgery and obtain the "perfect look" (which is a very distinct, homogenous look--double eyelids, puffy under-eyelids, small nose, structured jaw) is totally out of control. This cultural trend doesn't need any more normalization.

But good luck to you, I hope you find what you're looking for.
