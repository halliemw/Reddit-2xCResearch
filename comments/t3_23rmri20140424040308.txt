I feel like she should thank them for the invite during the lunch, seeing as she wasn't automatically invited under the title of the event.

It's a polite and complimentary way to point out that she isn't one of the Admin Staff because it makes the inviter seem gracious and welcoming.

Plus, it's a nice and relaxed way to build work relationships with people you might not normally interact with extensively.
