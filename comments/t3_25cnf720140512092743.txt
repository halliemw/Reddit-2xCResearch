You may be beautiful, but being beautiful is not an identity. Don't center your value on whether you are beautiful or not - even if you're gorgeous, you won't be forever. Find your value in yourself through the things you do and believe. If you are a person who deserves love, that's all that matters, regardless of how you look.
