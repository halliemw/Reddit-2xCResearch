Thank you for explaining! :) 

I do agree with you that people prefer hairlessness. I'd always thought that hairiness would be a bigger deal than it actually is, too, which, to me, was more of a hindrance than I think it should have been. I don't want it to be that way for anyone else, which is the purpose of my post.
