I completely agree with you. If I were you, I would kindly but firmly confront him about the fact that you know what happened, you think it's unacceptable that he attempted to kiss someone who he knew was in a monogamous relationship and without that person's permission (even if he thought there were "signs," more explicit permission is definitely needed), and that you're offended and made more upset by the fact that he hasn't apologized. You can see from there whether he is interested in apologizing and attempting to salvage the friendship, and whether you're interested in accepting his apology and/or friendship.

I'm sorry this happened to you and to your boyfriend, and I wish you the best of luck.
