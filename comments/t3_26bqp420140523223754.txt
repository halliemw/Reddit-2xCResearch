This may sound strange. Part of his frustration is telling you you should clean. Not only does he do his own part, he has to micromanage yours. You wouldn't get inundated with a list of jobs when you get home if he was confident you would do them without him asking you to.

He is lucky in that he wants things to be clean, which gives him the motivation to do it. You don't really care so much, so you have no motivation to give you the energy you see him have. It's not that he is blessed with boundless energy, it's created by him caring. You need to start caring and you too will get the energy.

If you can't care about the house being clean, care about impressing your husband.
