I talked it over with a friend and my bf, and we have decided to relax for a weekend and then start attending the meetups again.  I'm not very good at confrontations, but I can do the cold shoulder.  "Avoid him like the plague," exactly.  And if he at all, in *any* way attempts to do the same thing or even brings it up, that is my green light to call him out vocally.  Additionally I will follow up with a letter to the mods of his (our) subreddit. I shouldn't have to limit my social experiences in a new city because of one asshole.     

Thanks for all of the advice TwoX, I really really *really* appreciated this, I was finally able to sort it all out.
