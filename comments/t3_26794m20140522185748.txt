Oh definitely. Yes to all of the above, and that is exactly how I work. 

It's very obvious when I send an email to the sister and she responds 1.5 later with an answer that clearly shows that she hasn't been doing her work. 

My work isn't in question. I work and I do my work well, it's their work that is questionable, and frankly the lack of work that eats into my time and annoys me. 

Thank you for your answer.
