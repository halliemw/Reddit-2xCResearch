These people believe abortion is ending a life, and that if you do so it can't be a rushed decision. It might be the wrong approach, but it's not about "women can't make decisions", it's about "abortion is a big fucking deal". The logistics of it are obviously dumb and the measure is obviously not well designed, but I can see what they're trying to do.

I personally don't believe such a restriction should exist, but I can understand why they think it should.
