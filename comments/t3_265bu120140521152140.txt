I think you two may just need to sit down, have a talk and then schedule a night of romance. I just kind of naturally have a lower libidio (I think it may be my birth control) and I found just setting up the situation so no one really has to initiate will help a lot. It sounds like your boyfriend is being a bit of a snarky ass which doesn't exactly help anyway.
