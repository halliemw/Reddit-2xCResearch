For my part, it definitely helped that my brother and I shared that experience of living in a toxic environment, because it did foster a sense of shared understanding between us on that basic level. So even when other people were asking me why he wasn't able to finish school or maintain a job, I knew that he had to do it in his own time, and he has told me that this approach helped him the most. The time to heal in a healthy place was very good to him.

It's great that your sister is reaching out to professional help as there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but two days in one hospital and another one the next isn't going to provide for her the continuity and consistency of care she needs right now... Especially with hospitals throwing out diagnoses in every direction. That doesn't seem accurate, either. I would suggest looking at some places both where she is and where you currently are for recovery and care, or outpatient treatment, and involving her in choosing her place of healing. This may help motivate her to keep trying or look forward to her recovery, it could give her hope! And it also provides her with options when she feels she currently has none, which will help her regain control over her life.


Whatever you choose to do from here on out, if you feel in your heart it is the best for both of you, then tackle it straight on. I wish you two all the peace and happiness in the world! You are being a very supportive and thoughtful sister, and I am sure she appreciates you tremendously :)
