it's so fucked you kids are having to shoulder all this. i'm livid 2 people would do that to one another with kids of any age in the house.  
i know nothing about this horrible shit, and what i offer is an unresearched opinion, but i think it's up to you to speak up. at this point, everyone is a victim (alcoholism, violence, and emotional damage), but your parents are both allowing these abuses to carry on and that is unacceptable.  
i'd contact a therapist or other professional (someone from your college? or maybe a church, or else someone in your siblings' community) and seek guidance ***immediately***. they'll know who first to contact and how to keep your brother and sister (and mom) safe, which they are not now.  
you are doing the right thing by involving yourself; most of us grow up trusting that our parents know best, but that is not the case in your situation. they can get their acts together now or face losing their kids (to say nothing of any professional or social reputations), and if they need to hear that from a therapist, neighbor, other adult family member, or police officer, so be it. the choice to involve others is no longer your mother's to make. you owe it to your siblings to be brave and act, even though that is the shittiest position your parents could have put you in.
