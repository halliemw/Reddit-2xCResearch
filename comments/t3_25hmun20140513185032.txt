AskWomen deletes comments that use the term "mansplaining" as a gender slur just as much as it deletes comments using "bitch" and "dick" as general-bad-things. It is sexist, you are right. It's not a meaningless little extra, you (as in the global you) can't claim that the "man" part is in really tiny font so it doesn't matter next to the whole word.
