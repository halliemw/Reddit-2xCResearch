That wasn't my intention at all. I can only speak for my industry and limited experience, which I made clear.  There are more positions open in tech/developer roles than can be filled by qualified candidates, thus we DGAF about anything other than "can you do the job" and "can you sort of kind of interact with people".

Thanks for the analysis though, I can see how that interpretation could be made by people used to hearing about/experiencing sexism in hiring.
