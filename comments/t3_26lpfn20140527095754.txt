I have friends who are child-free homemakers. They are active in the community, church, volunteer, etc. They are in charge of "social contacts" and maintaining the bulk of their social circles. They host and entertain about 2 times a month, whether it's a full blown bbq or just chill snacks and cocktails. 

Some volunteering ideas: play a musical instrument/visit/serve meals at a hospice/assisted living care facility, help out at a local food pantry or soup kitchen, pet the adoptables and help clean up at your animal shelter, or as you are going for a run/walk/exercise each day, bring a plastic bag with you to clean up trash as you go.

Going to school full time IS a full time job. Managing a household is, as well. Hope some of these suggestions help out a little!
