>That website cites no studies and is in line with the cultural view that women age like milk while men can be studs into old age. I bet they'd have reported on douching being medically necessary and hysteria as a legitimate medical condition.

The NHS is the largest public healthcare organisation in the world, they're usually pretty on the ball. 

> Did you know that the research showing women's fertility decline being in the late 20s is based on birth records from 1700s France? They just looked at when women were having babies in the 1700s, and that was it. Not very scientific.

I didn't say fertility declines in the late 20s, nor did the page I linked. 

>Children of older fathers are also more likely to have birth defects, mental illness and neurological disorder.

I've never heard this before. I'm going to read these links. 

>There's more, people are just so deadset on women being the problem after having having been raised in a society that's obsessed with treating women as fertility objects, that they ignore studies that cast doubts on men's eternal virility.

The studies in the link you provided don't seem to actually disagree with the original claim that male fertility decreases later than female fertility. For example, this one -http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(00)01679-4/abstract is comparing 30 year old men to 50 year old men, and this one - http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/5/1399.full says female fertility reduces earlier (the "late 20s" claim you mentioned, actually).

I'm entirely on board with changing my position if the evidence is compelling, but I can't go along with the idea that the belief is a cultural one until the scientific position is shown to be baseless.
