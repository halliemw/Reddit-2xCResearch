A lot of guys misunderstand the concept that "not-stereotypically-manly" can mean "feminine" OR "boyish", and conflate the two. I think that's what's happening here. I agree that he doesn't seem "feminine", just not stereotypically manly.

I've noticed that people keep using the term "attractive" as in a way that excludes his personality and social skills and basically just boils down to "good-looking". When deciding whether someone is attractive, don't we use all the information we receive? It seems you agree with me that this guy *could* be attractive if not for that immediately perceptible (if difficult to explain) creep factor the guy just oozes in his videos.

I think that similar to body types, different personality types will be attractive to different people, but there are some that are generally more or less offputting than others. Case in point, Rodger's entitled victim mentality and that "creep factor".
