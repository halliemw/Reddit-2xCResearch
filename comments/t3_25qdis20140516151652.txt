Totally agree. What if she can't go on hormonal birth control? Also, I think that we should get real painkillers for such bad periods. I literally couldn't get off the floor without 5 Advil and even then was still in too much pain to focus on much. Drs would never give me anything despite this. Sounds like being sick to me.
