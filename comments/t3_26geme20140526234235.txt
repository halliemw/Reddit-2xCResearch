I skimmed through the comments on your post so I wouldn't bore you with this but you might want to think about anti-depressants. If you haven't taken them before they correct a chemical imbalance in your brain. I take them (again) and since you mentioned family, yeah, you might want to check it out.

They're not mood altering, they're chemical balancing. You may not think of yourself as a typically clinically depressed person but it sounds like you might have an imbalance. You don't need to be suicidal to take them but if you're struggling with daily issues they could give you a bump. 'Normal' people use them all the time. Helps them be a little more normal. :)
