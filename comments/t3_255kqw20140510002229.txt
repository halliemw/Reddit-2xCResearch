When I was in highschool we did an experiment where we took swabs of the toilet seats in the girls' bathrooms, transferred the bacteria to petri dishes and then waited to see what grew out of it.

The other things we swabbed were our classroom keyboards and our cellphones... The keyboards grew about 5x as much bacteria and the cell phones about 30x as much as the toilet seats, which had hardly any growth after a few days.

So, unless you're licking the toilet seats, sitting down to pee is hardly the grossest germ-related thing that is happening to you in a day. Using your own cellphone is a lot worse.
