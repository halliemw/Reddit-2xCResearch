When my PMS is at it's worst, I take a long hot shower and pamper myself with all my aromatherapy products. They help, my favorite is from Bath & Body Works it's a eucalyptus-spearmint stress relief lotion and body wash. I then do stretches and some deep breathing, using my inner voice saying a positive mantra. (To try and stop the negative inner voice which tells me I have no friends, life, etcetera.) 

Taking walks also helps to kick up some endorphins as well as physical activity.  When my kids were young I would wrestle with them, my cloud of negativity would soon be replaced with giggling.  

It's not easy, but keep trying different things even diet, extra vitamin B, no caffeine, eating dark chocolate and almonds. Drink extra water to help flush the bloated feeling.  And just keep reminding yourself, it will pass:-) good luck!
