My boyfriend keeps telling me not to add anymore, like Abaddon from Supernatural or Irene Adler from Sherlock. I think I've got a total of 20 or so cosplays to do on my list and it keeps growing,

I'm not in California, but I'll definitely check it out! I have some friends over there so maybe one day I can go!
