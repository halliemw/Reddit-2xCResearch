Have you had a conversation with them (probably one at a time would be best) that the jokes that they feel are just jokes, or even to nudge you back into the "right" direction, are actually really painful to you?

I have a father who was big on "jokes" about my weight, and I didn't confront him about till well into adulthood, because... well... I was embarrassed to talk about it and I had enough engrained into me about authority that I was, frankly, scared to reproach my own father. But when I did he was literally *shocked* that what he was saying upset me so much. He still falls into old habits sometimes, but I can tell he's making an effort and it means a lot to me.
