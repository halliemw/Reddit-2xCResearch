Good for you for speaking up - that's not a small thing to do when faced with an "authority" figure and a class full of your peers.

Was this woman considered a sex educator? I'm curious as to what qualified her to speak in the eyes of the school. Like, do they get some nut job parent who does this as a hobby to come in? Or is someone actually trained and paid for this bs?

And just for the record, my bf and I use condoms as our method of choice, and we've fucked like bunnies for six years and are still very much child-free (but of course you should always have a back up, and I'm not saying there's not a lot else to consider before becoming sexually active, etc, etc).
