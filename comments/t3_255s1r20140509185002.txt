oh you need to watch it!! I love that woman!   They are so....human, and I totally relate to them.   The Captain is a transsexual and he (formerly she) and Joan are long, long time friends.  It is so fascinating to watch how their friendship evolves with Dee becoming Dennis, and how he and Joan interact.   It's real life.  

I don't have a transsexual friend but I do have friends who are atheists and homosexuals and it reminded me of how we have negotiated our friendships and navigated around our differences, and so on.

Last week, Joan and her husband went to visit her husband's brother and his wife.  They'd had a falling out.  And, you know, what a class act--nobody said specifically what it was over.

But at dinner, Joan looked at her BIL and said to him, "You know, I so appreciate you having us down here and meeting with us, and I just want to say to you, that it was so wrong of me to take that money and spend it.  I'm sorry."

My jaw just about fell on the floor.   The only one on the whole show who assigned blame, or said what the falling out had been over, was the one who needed to make amends.  And she made those amends without excusing her behavior, on national TV for the whole world to see.

She made a Speecy Spicy Meatball video last week too and that's what prompted me to make this my user name.

I love the Soup also.  Guilty pleasures lol!
