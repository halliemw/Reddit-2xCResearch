Based on his Twitter stupidity, he's not someone anyone should date. He sounds like an ass. It is amazing how the internet sometimes brings out the true identity of a person. They can seem great in person, but a look into their internet activity can show that they are actually a giant douche.

I would drop this boy. He sounds immature, and with the things he says on twitter, he is not a very respectful person, and may be just looking for a piece of ass.

Don't feel like you will not find someone. I felt the same way after getting out of my long term relationship. I met alot of jerks, and then one day, someone worth keeping came along. You will find someone!
