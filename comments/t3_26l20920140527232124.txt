People who think this is rape is why our society is going down the shitter.  You were drunk, but cognizant, of everything that was going on.  You said yourself, that you didn't say no.  So you made a rational choice to let it continue.  Now you feel bad.  Feeling bad is what happens when you make shitty decisions.  Nobody has accountability anymore.  It's a shame.
