Man here. I make similar, but tasteful jokes like these with my girlfriend all the time. Our sense of humour is on the same level, and she makes similar jokes right back. For us, stuff like this is a two way street, which is probably why we get along so well. Perhaps he'd get a laugh out of you making a similar joke, or perhaps not. If he reacted angrily to you making that joke, that's might be a red flag telling you he's maybe not such a nice guy, or a potential teachable moment for you to explain that those kind of jokes can be hurtful.
