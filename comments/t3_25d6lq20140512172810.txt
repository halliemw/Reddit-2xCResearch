We have talked about it but not in too much detail admittedly. I know most of that pinterest stuff is there for various reasons and she might not want something like that on our wedding. I am just doing that to be 'safe.' Weddings these days involve a lot of tiny creative things that just adds up to an outlandish expense. She discusses ideas with me about different wedding related stuff, like possible venues, her dress, invites etc. But if you can believe it it happens in passing very casually. We will be watching netflix and she will be flipping through her phone and then show me something "pretty" and "definitely have similar on our wedding."  I don't think she realizes that I am making mental notes about all of them. 

Having a second job helps with my resume too so I am sorry that it appeared that I just took it for the wedding fund. In any case, I plan on providing her with a truly special wedding and realistically speaking they are extravagant affairs.
