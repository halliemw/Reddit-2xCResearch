The term still utilizes sex to discriminate, though. If I saw someone walking around wearing this shirt, my first impression would be that he/she hates obnoxious fans of the strictly female variety.  You could argue that fan boys are just as annoying and just as deserving of admonishment, but in this scenario, you are making the separation based on sex. That is the reason it's sexist.
