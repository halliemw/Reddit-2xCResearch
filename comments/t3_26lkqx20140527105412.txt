I have a tendency to rest my hand on my belly when I lecture. I've had my (high school) students ask if I was pregnant. I tell them, no, I'm not. But that's a personal question and it's rude to ask, like asking a person's weight. I tell them if someone wants them to know that they are pregnant, that person will tell them.
