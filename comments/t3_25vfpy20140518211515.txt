But why did the parents seek out a surrogate for a 4th child if they already had children with medical conditions? What I don't get is why the parents were trying for a 4th child in the first place. It sounds like their plate was full. THey had to have known that a child with disabilities was a possibility. I think this a situation that should have never occurred in the first place.
