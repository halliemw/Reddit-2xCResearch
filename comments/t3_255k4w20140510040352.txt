Oh yeah, I always check sizing charts when ordering online. What really gets me is stores that sell cute designs but only in weirdly cut women's shirts. Like, Hot Topic makes some surprisingly cute retro designs that are only available on their women's style t-shirts. Their women's XXL is like a men's small. :(
