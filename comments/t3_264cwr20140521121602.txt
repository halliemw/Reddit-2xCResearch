You have several problems. You need to talk.

In the absolute best case he has some problems understanding appropriate humor. Perhaps he is a socially awkward penguin and thinks what he's saying is truly funny without understanding how it can sound to other people, and how it makes you feel. In this case, you need to sit him down, tell him how it makes you feel and see how he responds.

In the worst case scenario, he's telling you not only what he actually believes—that he is in control because he's a man—but he's also telling you what he plans to do, namely sleep with another woman when he gets the chance. Once again, you need to talk to him and see which it is.

Call me cynical, but in scenarios like this I tend to go the second option. I believe that people will tell you what they really think if you listen to them. If someone disavows a belief, but keeps espousing that belief under the pretense of a joke, then I very quickly decide they're not really joking.
