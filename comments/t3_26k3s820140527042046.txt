Consider yourself lucky in the long run. I did have that illusion, and it was a rude awakening when I realized it wouldn't always be like that. As a kid, if you're lucky enough to have a childhood like I was fortunate enough to have, you grow up having all your worries taken care of by your parents. It's a mind set you're born into that life is easy because my parents worked hard to provide for my brother and I. So when I started to grasp that that wasn't a fact of life but a lucky circumstance I'd enjoyed thus far, and that going forward I would have to make my own way, take on my own worries, be responsible for my own success or failure...that was terrifying. It still is.
