This is obviously a really tough choice that you have to make.  I would urge you not to go through with the abortion unless you're sure that it's what you want.  It's not a decision that you can take back.  You saying "I don't want to kill my child" makes me think that at this moment you're not totally confident in the decision to have an abortion, and I wouldn't want this to be something that you regret.  You do have other options, I would urge you to explore them. Whatever choice you make, please don't feel ashamed.  You've done nothing that is shameful.  Good luck with everything.
