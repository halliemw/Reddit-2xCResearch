You know what? You don't need to sit around and wait to feel passionately that you want to clean up, or go for a run, of do your taxes - that will never happen. You just need to buck up and do things you don't want to do because *that's what being an adult is.*

But once you do these things, you'll probably start saying to yourself, "man clean sheets feel nice!" or "hey, I don't get winded climbing stairs, excellent!" or "shoo tax return!" and you'll find yourself wanting to do these things because you enjoy the benefits.
