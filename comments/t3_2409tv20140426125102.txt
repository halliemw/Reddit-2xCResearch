Thank you so much for your response. I  only want the best for her, and I don't want her to turn into a statistic. Coming from our family, that isn't hard. I am the only one who isn't on drugs, in jail, and working on a college degree. She is very close to our mother (we have different fathers) but is starting to understand the severity of our mothers addiction. 

As a teen I went through through the same path, so I know we can relate to each other, and I feel that I can understand what needs to be done.

Where she is now is a mess. Each time she visits the hospital she is there for 2 days then they release her. At one of these two night stays one hospital tried to diagnose her with schizophrenia!! I could not believe that they could come up with that conclusion in two days. 

Her issues were very small here and have stemmed since she has moved with her father. I don't know if they would get better with me, but I think with my understanding of our home life and her trust in me, we could both try to get somewhere. Her father thinks this is something she is making up, and she can stop if she wants.
