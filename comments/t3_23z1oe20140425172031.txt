From what I can see, you've been nothing but a good friend to this girl and you absolutely did the right thing by clueing her sister into what she was doing.  

She might be angry with you over it (or even hate you) but if she has any sense at all, in the long run she'll be grateful to you for watching out for her. And if she never comes around (sadly, I've seen adults like her who never really grew out of it) I hope you can feel good about the fact that you did everything you could to be a true friend to her. 



This girl's behavior toward you is narcissistic, manipulative and borderline-abusive. If you don't believe me, imagine someone you cared about had a boyfriend who lied to her constantly, tried to ruin her friendships with other women in order to keep her all to himself, and forced her to cover for his reckless behavior.  You'd be telling her to get as far away from that situation as possible, no?
