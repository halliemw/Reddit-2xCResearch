>"Why would you care so much about gay rights if you're not gay"

Reminds me of last year when my boyfriend and his parents were talking about stop and frisk. We live in NYC and are pretty much socialists so it's something we both cared about a lot. His parents were like, why do you care, it'll never affect you. (He's white, as am I.) So?! He's a high school teacher in one of the poorest places in the country, his students are exactly those who would be stopped. Even if he wasn't - stop and frisk was majorly racist and terrible. It's bizarre how some parents in older generations can't fathom why you'd care about other people. Lucky for me, my mom is 64 and I'm only 23, but my compassion doesn't confuse her. If anything she's proud of me for it. 

(She was also totally cool when I came out as a lesbian, of course I've since realized I'm pansexual. I don't think she realized my attraction to women, but my asshole dad used to say "your future boyfriend... or girlfriend" in an uncomfortable, accusatory way. I didn't look or act stereotypically gay in the slightest, so he was basically saying my lack of a serious boyfriend in high school could mean I'm gay. One of many reasons I cut him out of my life.)
