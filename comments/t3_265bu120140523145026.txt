Oh Yay! I'm so glad you had some success. Baby steps! (as they say) I've always been a fan of the BJ as a tool for intimacy.  

Maybe with the therapy thing, you could work up to it? I mean, even if you go alone, to talk to someone specifically about your intimacy issues, it could help. If he starts to feel like you are connecting again, he may be way more willing to attend a little further down the road, or if you're all "I learned this stuff in therapy I'd like to try with you," and the stuff you learned is sex stuff, my guess is he'd be down.
