Uumm... it sort of, kind of is. For example, reddit is open to use in Iran, but /r/atheism is not. For some absurd reasons /r/trees is totally cool. 

But you know, it's the same with the booze. You can't get it or drink it in public, but you go to house party and then there's a full bar. People come alive in their homes, just not on the streets.
