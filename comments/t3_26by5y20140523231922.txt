Well hey there! Go Panthers indeed!

I've got a ton of future cosplays that I'm in the planning stages of. Angelina Jolie!Lara Croft, Android 18, Anastasia, Sailor Chibi Moon, Riddler, Spoiler/Batgirl.. The problem is, half of the stuff [mostly the Riddler/Batgirl/Spoiler/Sailor Chibi Moon] is really expensive and I have *no* budget after my Bunny Bulma, or I can't find the right color *whatever*.
