See that's the thing, I'm tall as well, and I have bitch-face. I'm really aggressive if someone touches me and all that stuff. I get people off me, I get people away from me.

If you met me, you would never think I felt this broken and sad. I don't show it. I'm the one my friends will say is the "scary girl".

This is just how I get when I'm alone.

Everyone thinks it's easy to deal with this stuff, especially if you're known as a bitch, but it's not. And it's really unfair that I'm known as a bitch because I'm reacting appropriately to people harassing me when I get them off of me. 

I don't know why anyone thinks I should be nice or polite in getting some creep away from me. Like "well you didn't have to push him away so hard..." He was touching me! What the fuck!

Everything is so backwards
