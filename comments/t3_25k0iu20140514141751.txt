good on you for getting tested! I've been in a 2 year relationship but when I got tested recently, I still got just as anxious -- you're not alone in that! I'm sorry you had a judgey nurse. I use the HealthGrades website before I go to any doctors and it has been **so so so helpful** in finding good doctors/medical professionals who have the bedside manners I look for. An upbeat, nonjudgemental, gynecologist really can make a world of difference.
