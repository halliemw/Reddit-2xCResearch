I feel that if his mental health professionals say he's rehabilitated then they should release him. I understand he was released before but to me it seems that they tried to rectify the situation by admitting him to a mental health hospital for a longer time instead of prison. 

We just have to try to trust the system. The community members sound like they are going to make it hard for him to be there. I hope there isn't any vigilantism
