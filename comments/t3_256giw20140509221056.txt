Yea, the mustache on it's own I don't find particularly problematic. It's just in combination with everything else that it becomes unbearable. That is definitely admirable, though, and makes me look at things differently a bit, thanks.

I tried honey and regular sugar on my lips previously as a trial before possibly trying it on my skin. I didn't really notice a change and the taste/smell were terrible (I'm not fond of honey). But the biggest issue was just that I realized how sticky and difficult to work it was. I might have to retry this with the brown sugar, though. What ratio do you use?

I've been wanting to attempt jojoba oil, but I've yet to find some that is either pure or not ridiculously expensive.

Thanks for the subreddit, that's excellent!
