I took myself off Ortho Tri Cyclen (though I loved that one the most) because I was tired of adding hormones to my body. 

When I told my gyno that I hadn't had a period in months, she was concerned and ordered tests. Turns out, I don't produce enough estrogen naturally, have super irregular periods, and the treatment: hormonal birth control pills!!

I'm on generic OTC (Tri Sprintec) and have been really happy with it (and is free through my insurance plan).

Definitely try the IUD, but know that it might not work for you. I tried it and bled for almost a year straight (full-on period, not just spotting). 

It's worth trying different things so you can be happy physically, hormonally, emotionally and sexually!
