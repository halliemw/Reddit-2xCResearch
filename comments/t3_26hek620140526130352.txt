Mine isn't mother daughter, but grandmother granddaughter. My grandmother had a beautiful collection of rings that she wore for special occasions. When my female cousins and I were young,.she would show them to us and had us all tell her which was our favourite. When she passed away, each of us was given our favourite ring. Every time I look it mine (a beautiful silver with several purple amethyst in a diamond shape) I remember her and all the time I spent with her. I remember being a child in her lap admiring all of her beautiful jewellery and placing the too big ring on my finger. Not a day goes by that I don't miss her, and the ring helps me remember some of my favourite times I shared with her.
