First, please consider taking off the last line. -.-  No reason to be antagonistic in the intro.

As for shame, I felt it when I had my first period and I had bloody underwear and had to call my parents.  But y'know what, it happens and the first time it happens you really aren't prepared.  And there's nothing wrong with it, timing is different for everyone!  Sure it sucks to ruin clothes, but what the heck.  The worst part is leaving the classroom in front of everyone. ;)

Second thing would have to be when other girls were getting their bras before me and I felt so much pressure to get a training bra as early as possible.  Again.... No reason to feel that.  Yeah, I wanted to be like all the other girls but we all develop on different timelines.  Early or later there is no *right* answer.  Just what our hormones dictate and when.
