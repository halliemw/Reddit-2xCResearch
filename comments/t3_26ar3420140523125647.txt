Well, I love my husband and I'm not against tattoos in general. However, one idea he had for a tattoo was something I found very trashy and unattractive and didn't want to spend the rest of my life looking at that and thinking "what a douchebag!" about the person I love. He *eventually* understood where I was coming from and we discussed what a good compromise between us would be. He ended up finding a different tattoo idea that still honored his heritage but was much more attractive (to me).

I'd be incredibly hurt if he dismissed my opinion and didn't care at all how I felt. I did fall in love with him partly for how I am physically attracted to him. I can't imagine taking those permanent things so blas√©.
