Hm, it doesn't seem to hyperlink for some reason. Anyway, I am glad to have found this sub, because my impression of feminism and the "women's subs" from the rest of reddit was, I now realise, quite wrong. I never thought it was a horrible conspiracy or any of that nonsense, just that feminism was something that was 'for women'. Now that I see all these posts here, it seems both feminism and the community here have a focus that is much more about equality and egalitarianism rather than I had imagined. And what's more, now that I looked up feminism in some detail, I realised that as a secular Humanist I already hold pretty similar, if not the same, ideas and opinions as most non-radical feminists. TBH, after all this, my first thought is "WTH is reddit fussing about with feminism. Doesn't make sense that a site that leans heavily towards irreligiousity would have an issue with what is, in essence, humanism."
