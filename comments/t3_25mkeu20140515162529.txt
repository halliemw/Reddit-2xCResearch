I don't see anything wrong with throwing away your tampon or pad at someone else's house. It's completely natural to have your period, nothing embarrassing about it. But I always wrap mine in toilet paper, regardless of where I'm at.

Once I was staying at a relative's house when I was on my period, in the basement, and there was one guest bathroom with no garbage can. No garbage can in the whole basement. And the only people living there were female, so it wasn't like they had no need for one. I'd never had to deal with that before, so it was a rough few days haha.
