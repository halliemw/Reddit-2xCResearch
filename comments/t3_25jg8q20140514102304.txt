You can get some patches for blowouts preemptively, it helps hold the fibres steady and reinforces them against stretching and can postpone (but not eliminate) blowouts. I recommend them for denim all the time, but I can't come up with a reason they wouldn't also assist with scrubs.

Iron ons are super cheap, too.
