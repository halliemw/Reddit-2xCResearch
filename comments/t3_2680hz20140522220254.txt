I totally agree. I feel like a lot of the time loneliness gets the better of people and they become so desperate  for the romantic interaction that they miss out getting to know people. Going with the flow is always the best recipe. Testing the waters for romance after you have a basic outline of who someone is ensures that you'll have a better relationship with that person.

When I first met my boyfriend, romance wasn't even a thought for a while. We established a friendship that was sincere, and the comfort that I felt with him in the process actually allowed me to be the one to propose a more romantic relationship. Not feeling pressured to "force" our relationship to work before we got to know one another established a foundation that allows us to have a very healthy and honest relationship to this day. 

I think your approach to women is a very healthy one and I commend you for being considerate and responsible about it:)
