The vast majority of rapes do not occur in "blackout drunk" situations by strangers. Most are within a mile of the victim's home, by a trusted friend or acquaintance. If you have the time, anthropologist youtube user HannibaltheVictor has [this rather fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=871zKEYgSeA) debunking everything you just said. His voice is a little irritating, but he knows his shit. It's also divided into sections of 15 mins with intermissions because like I said, it is very long.
I'm not hating on you for your opinion, but I'd like you to understand why I think it's incorrect.
