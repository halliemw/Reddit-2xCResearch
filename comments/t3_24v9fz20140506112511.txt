I <3 Tina. She's simultaneously so awkward ([what with all the moaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_XaIuw6K6Q)) and self-confident (see her dancing with Jimmy Pesto) and [has such a great imagination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1YV21i4MtA). And she's an [EQUESTRANAUT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_8XrbIElT8). And she writes [erotic fiction](http://bobs-burgers.wikia.com/wiki/Tina_Belcher).
