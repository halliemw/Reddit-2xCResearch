I do but would disagree with the adjective you've used there! It's been very good for me- it gives me an irregular cycle but with about 6 months between periods which is amazing. Apart from that, no other side effects. However the implant has different effects for different women and I am particularly lucky.

If you're having terrible side effects, getting it removed may be best but personally I think it's worth sticking it out for a while to see if it  improves. It's effectiveness makes it worthwhile IMO.
