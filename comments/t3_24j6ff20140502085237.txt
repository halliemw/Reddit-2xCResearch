This is amazing.  You found a winner.

In the grand scheme of things, you're still rather young in your family life.  My mom chose to have weird hours growing up in order to be more "around" as a parent when we were growing up, and it did wonders for our upbringing, but it wasn't really because she was the mom, but because she had the more flexibly scheduled career (a nurse).  My father's work became unsteady due to the economy and he got laid off quite a bit when I was a teenager, and finally when I was an older teen he got laid off for good even though he was nowhere close to retiring age.  While it was tough on him at first, my mother became the main breadwinner, and still is.  She even took a lot of her free time in her weirdly scheduled job and put some of it towards earning an additional Associate's Degree on top of her Nursing B.S. while raising us. Now that she's pushing 60, she's almost finished with her M.S. in Nursing as well, and my father's really supportive of that.

Putting your family in the best possible position doesn't necessarily mean that the mom stays at home.  Good on your family for taking opportunities that will give your whole family the best chance of happiness.
