Fuck I need to go to a foreign country to get any kind of care. Obama care is bullshit. Technically we qualify for "share of cost medi-cal" so I don't qualify for Obamacare. My monthly MONTHLY deductible is $3000 on Medi-cal. So if I go to the doctor I have to pay a $250 copay and $150 per blood test, Pap smear etc. Going to the E.R. Costs me $3000 every time.  Ugh
