To my parents:  "When you act like my problems would be much easier to get through if I only went to church more, prayed how you think is correct, obviously returned to faith, it makes me feel disrespected and hurt."

All I want is to be able to discuss troubles or victories with people I respect and care about without fearing a preaching session as the only response.
