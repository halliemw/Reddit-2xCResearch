Taking the test could potentially set your mind at ease....I wouldn't suffer through not knowing a few days more.  If you are pregnant knowing a few days earlier won't make it any harder or easier...you would simply know....if you are not pregnant checking could set your mind at ease within minutes.   It sounds like you are probably not pregnant, but find out. :)
