Ok, I do apologise for the phrasing of my comment. I meant that it's ironic that the chart was poor despite being about maths (ie I would have said the same if it was made by a bloke). And this absolutely is (in my opinion, feel free to disagree) a terrible chart. That has nothing to do with your personal qualities - you may well be remarkably intelligent (I expect that you are if you're a TA!).

Again, let me stress that this is all just opinion, take it or leave it I'm not too fussed. But half of my job is to present data in a way that is easy to interpret, and my main motto is "less is more." In this case I'd definitely suggest that two charts, one to show relative sizes of males vs females, and a second to show the grade distribution, would have made your point more strongly. Like I said, there's too much going on in your one chart and it makes the viewer take some time to figure out what's going on.
