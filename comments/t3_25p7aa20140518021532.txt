> Honestly, I would really consider being more tactful in how you respond to people. It's fine if you want to keep your opinion on what is respectful and rude. You're entitled to do that, but why do it if it make you come off as a jerk?

You are too invested in what other people think.  Reddit isn't my life, my friends or my family and it isn't yours either.  It's anonymous people on the internet posting (mostly) thoughtless opinions.  It matters ZERO in the bigger, (and even smaller) scheme of things if you or anyone else thinks I'm a jerk here or anywhere else.  I know who I am in real life.

Honestly, if I were you I would really consider being less concerned about things that are meaningless.  (like taking the 10 minutes - but we both know it wasn't only 10 - to lecture and hector a stranger on the internet that you thought was mildly rude.)  

Life isn't that long.
