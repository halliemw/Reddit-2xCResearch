Everything is gross sometimes.  Puppies shit on the floor, babies sick up what can only be described as exorcist juice, and genitalia is sometimes fucking horrible.  My SO and I don't sit around discussing the texture of our poop, nor do feel the need to share the more unpleasant things that emerge from our "personal areas", but in the OP, they were discussing a jizz crusted months old condom.  If it's acceptable to raise that subject, it's not unacceptable to discuss discharge.  If Reddit is happy with cumbox, it can't whine too loudly about period blood.  Let us not forget that one is a perfectly normal consequence of being an adult female of reproductive age, and the other is the consequence of someone wanking in a shoe box for months on end.
