Also note that there is no blood on the outside of the cup. I was surprised to see that you don't actually get any blood on your hands at all. It all just flows directly into the cup, so it's really not messy at all. I'd say it keeps you cleaner than a tampon, since when you remove the cup, unlike a tampon, no blood touches the walls of your body.
