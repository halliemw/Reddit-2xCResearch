I think that reminder about what makes TwoX what it is - the active support and defense of our members - is huge. 

When I saw /u/shinosai's post last night, I was worried. "Does she know the sub is default now? If she does, holy shit that's gutsy, and if she doesn't, I'm so, so scared for her...." So I kept it open, to check on it. . . 

I worry about the gross-out posts on the front page (although IFF shenanigans should move them down soon), and how they might be interpreted as a litmus test for entry by any women who don't have bloody stories to share - and that seems to be confirmed by one poster in this thread, already - not because bio functions should be off-limits, but because the avalanche of them and the sheer amount of traction/gold/votes/comments they got *sure makes that stuff seem important*. 

But worrying does nothing. Wading in, voting, reporting, posting, commenting - *that does something*. I am OK with helping make this a welcoming place for people who need to feel welcomed into it - whether because they have a history of being excluded, or because they just aren't sure they belong. 

I hope you feel comfortable staying. I hope the call to be deliberately inclusive and supportive - of all genders, especially those so used to being excluded, deliberately or casually - seeking this environment is heard and felt.

We need educators, and we need caring people, and we need you. More importantly, we want you here.
