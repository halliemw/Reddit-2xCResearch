I think mine was depression as well.  Eating better and exercising made a world of difference...  I remember about a month in, I'd promised myself I'd run that morning before work and didn't.

I was so pissed and down, that I called in sick.  Plus side is that I spent 6 straight hours cleaning my apt, top to bottom.  I never looked back after that.
