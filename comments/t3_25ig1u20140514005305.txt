Without getting the swab test there is really no way to know if you are dealing with yeast or BV. The problem with not knowing is that if you are treating the wrong infection, you may actually be making the other infection worse by upsetting the vaginal ecosystem. Until you do get a chance to see the doctor, I highly recommend starting probiotic supplements. These can really help with both yeast and BV.
