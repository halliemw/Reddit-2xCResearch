I just graduated with a degree in clarinet performance. Throughout my time at college, I had moments when I wanted to quit. I constantly questioned my choice to pursue music at the college level, especially because the longer I was there, the more I thought I didn't want to play professionally. I was very lucky to be appointed to the position of wind ensembles manager, introducing me to the field of artistic administration. When I found out that this was something I loved and was good at, I started working in internships with the local symphony and opera company. I am going to grad school to get my masters in arts admin and an MBA. This is perfect for me because I can make a difference in the musical community in a different capacity. I can make use of my musical training, for knowing the art form will help me make more informed business decisions and be an effective leader of an arts organization. I'm saying all this about myself to make the point that a musical education can be beneficial even if you don't want to play for a living! A lot of my peers are going on to med school, dental school, law school, and many of them have jobs totally unrelated to music!! I would make the most out of being in music school while exploring your other strengths and passions, music-related or not. I know how hard it can be to stick with it, classical performance really takes a lot out of you! In the end, I am glad I went through with this degree. I hope this is helpful!
