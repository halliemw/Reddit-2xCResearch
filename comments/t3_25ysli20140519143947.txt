Sometimes the fear of something is enough to give you the symptoms of that thing. Happens to me all the time. Gave myself an allergy to cheese for a week that way. Worst week of my life.

EDIT: Also, having witnessed four pregnancies and two children out of those, I agree with nameless_faceless, it is waaaay too early to tell.
