I don't have the source with me, but when I get back to my apartment tomorrow I'll try to cite it.  If I recall correctly it was one study, but it was supported mechanistically, and it makes sense that older fathers (the study specifically dealt with males, and only dealt with females briefly as a comparison), with their relatively exposed sexual organs, would accumulate potentially cancerous mutations overtime.  Many of these mutations would not be directly cancerous, as this would of course cause cancer of the father, but rather, potential mutations, which tended to predispose the offspring to cancer later in life.
