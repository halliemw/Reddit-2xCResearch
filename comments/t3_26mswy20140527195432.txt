The relationship between Leonard and Penny on Big Bang Theory makes me uncomfortable for this reason. It's like the writers wanted the big nerd to get the cute girl, even though the characters don't go very well together (They spend the majority of every episode insulting each other. Why are they even still together?) 

I think a good antidote for nerd misogyny is to learn how to have non-romantic relationships with others (male and female). Learn how to be a friend with someone, without an ulterior motive. If you can't talk to a girl like she's a human being, why should she give you the time of day?
