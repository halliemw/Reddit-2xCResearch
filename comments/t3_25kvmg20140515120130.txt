At other universities and colleges, they replaced all the stalls with graffiti-proof stalls so that people couldn't write on them any more.  People then started printing stickers, which are removed frequently, but stickers leave more evidence of who put them up.  

(the stickers have never been about sexual abuse nor are they anything like the things that should be written in graffiti...)
