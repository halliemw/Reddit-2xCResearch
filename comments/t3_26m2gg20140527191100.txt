You're not obligated to like her or respect her just because she's your mother. Respect is earned, it isn't something that just comes and goes, and that's okay. I get you, I dislike my mom as well and have a hard time accepting that because more than anything I want a normal relationship with her but I know I'll never have it.. it sucks, but it's better to accept my feelings about it than trying to deny them to myself.
