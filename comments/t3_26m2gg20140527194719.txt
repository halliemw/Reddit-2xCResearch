(((hugs))))

50 yr woman here.  I don't like my mother.  She is a terrible person.  She treated me very poorly most of my life and is still not pleasant to be around.  

I do see her about once every year or 2, for about 48 hours.  I try to call for 5 minutes on a weekly basis (get the answering machine most times) - mostly for weather updates.  I no longer allow her to drag me into her drama.   

I moved several thousand miles away.  And she doesn't visit.    

Keeping very strong and firm boundaries is really the only way to go if I am going to keep any type of relationship with my mother.  I have accepted that I will never have the mother/daughter relationship that so many of my friends have.  She will never be my best friend, or even a good friend.  She will be treated with kindness and respect, and that's about it. 

Out of 4 kids (2 stepbrothers, me and my younger brother), I'm the only one who even makes an effort - small as it is.  

No, you don't have to like her.  You don't have to see her.  You don't have to deal with her.    Having toxic people in your life is toxic for YOU.  I chose to have her in my life on my terms.  I have no qualms about cutting her out of my life again if necessary.  So she behaves herself now and our relationship is better than it's ever been.  

And I'm 50 yrs old.
