Hmm. I see what you mean. There's no real way to invite someone of the opposite gender(assuming hetero) to be friends without having it be expressed as romantic interest. Although it's worth noting that I can't recall ever attempting that as an adult(as a child it was simply a matter of "Hey, let's be friends"), so I'm not sure how it might play out. 

But asking someone out on a date is the closest thing to that idea I can think of. I asked out a grocery store cashier(came back when it wasn't busy) because she was physically appealing to me, and pleasant to chat with the few times I'd been through her line. I asked her out so I could figure if she was emotionally appealing and intellectually appealing, as well as to gauge her interest in me physically(since that's all she had to go on as well). On that date we learned that we wouldn't be a good match romantically due to fundamentally different ideals, despite having a good time together. We decided to not date, but be friends instead, and we texted pretty regularly until I left for college. 

Tl;Dr, asked a girl out because I thought she was pretty and I wanted to know more about her; romantically incompatible, still friends.
