I think it's great that reddit wants to feature a female-based sub for the masses, and I think it's awesome that the potential for more, fresh ladies increased exponentially. 

But I feel like the sacrificial lamb. Like the kid who did really well on her test so the teacher lauded her and now she gets bullied for being the teacher's pet. We have to fight the good fight IRL and it was so nice to have a haven for rants and support and camaraderie. We still have that, but now our guards have to be up. 

I wish there had been a vote, but I don't think that's how it works, though it should be. Would it make a difference, really, if we were taken off? The trolls have already targeted us, right?
