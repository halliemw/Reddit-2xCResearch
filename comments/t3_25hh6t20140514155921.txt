I read the same post and had the same reaction. Do I ultimately think it is his fault? Of course. But do I also think that the situation could have been handled differently on her end? Absolutely. 

I don't drink to excess with people I don't know. I let myself get drunk around people I trust not to act that way. Additionally, I'm not just going to sit by while some guy gropes me (for, if I recall, something like 4 blocks of walking - seriously?!) This should be a learning experience for her - maybe I won't get drunk with strangers, and maybe I'll work on being more confident and assertive so I feel like I can stand up for myself when I'm uncomfortable. 

When you live in large urban areas, you are taught some pretty basic shit - if you have headphones in, keep your eyes up. Be aware of your surroundings. Be familiar with your city. Have a plan of action for if the shit hits the fan.
