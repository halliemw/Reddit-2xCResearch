Tell all of your professors and see what your options are--the options will depend on your school's policies. Some professors will have you take an incomplete and finish the class when you're back on your feet. This happened to a friend of mine in my grad program who had a horrible car accident the weekend before her final in our cog class--she took the final two months later and passed the class. In cases of personal crisis, some professors will actually extrapolate final grades based on overall semester performance as opposed to one F due to extenuating circumstances. You won't know your options until you tell them what's going on.
