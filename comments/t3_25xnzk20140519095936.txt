Please don't downvote me to hell for this one but seriously, Why does it matter? Don't get me wrong. I understand (as much as a man could) women not wanting to be objectified. But this is a comic. Most comic book heroes/heroines are presented in an over the top, larger than life manner. So a heroine is presented as tough and sexy. Its really no different than the over the top Muscles that Heroes are given in the comics. They are Super. This is how it should be. 

Even in the live action movies, both sexes are objectified. Black Widow, Catwoman and Mystique are bent over in a skin tight suit. Thor and Wolverine and Captain America are walking around with their shirts off unnecessarily. I personally feel like this is the one area where objectification fits. These are characters that are designed to be gawked at. Am I wrong?
