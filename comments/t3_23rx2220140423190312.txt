Is this postdoc for a fixed term, or indefinite? I know this varies by country. If it's 2-3 years: perhaps you could go back to the U.S. and the two of you could simply visit each other for the remainder of his term there. While that could be tough, a lot of people make arrangements like that work. My fiance and I have agreed that this is what we will do if either of us ends up needing to live somewhere for a set term and it's a place the other person doesn't want to live/couldn't get a job.

If it's an indefinite position, then I would have a serious talk with your husband about your own career plans and happiness. It seems pretty clear that there are a variety of reasons why staying in Italy indefinitely wouldn't be appealing or good for you, and his career shouldn't be the only one that counts here.
