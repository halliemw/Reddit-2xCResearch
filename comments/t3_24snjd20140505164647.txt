You don't just become bipolar, take meds and then get over it and subsequently stop taking your meds...You're going to need to face the fact that most people that are bipolar need to be on meds their whole life. 

You CANNOT reason with him and fix your relationship issues while he is unmedicated and manic. 

You need to get educated on what bipolar is and you need to have a serious discussion with him. If he can admit that his behaviour has changed and its affected your relationship enough that he will go for an evaluation with a psychiatrist... Then you both will be on the right track. 

However, just being brutally honest.... The marriage will almost certainly fail if he isn't re-assessed whether or not he needs meds and if he's manic right now etc.
