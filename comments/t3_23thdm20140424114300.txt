Or a contractor, or a soldier, or a truck driver, or whatever. In almost all jobs there are other people relying on you to show up and do your job. If you don't go and do what you need to do, someone else does. There's nothing like being the person who is always getting phone calls because their coworkers can't be bothered to show up. Working to me is much more than making money, it's about being dependable and reliable. I feel good because I do my job well, other people can trust me to the things I have agreed to do by taking my job. I get the feeling that we are never going to agree about this due to differing core values about the value and importance of work.
