Congratulations?

I don't feel like looking up the definition of rights and pasting it here. 

Going on about some guys rights who hasn't been supportive of OP is kinda ridiculous, you all are more concerned about this guy who is going on about 'his' baby and doesn't sound supportive.

A fetus is not a baby, if you are going to be supportive, you should probably know the difference.
