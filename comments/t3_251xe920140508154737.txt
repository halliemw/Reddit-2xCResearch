One very hard but critical thing to keep in mind: a good counselor knows his/ her job is not to save your marriage. It is to open up both of you to evaluating your life and making that descion on your own. Many people get frustrated with the common " but how do you feel when they XYZ" but they want you to talk and be honest. They are not some magic wand to fix all your issues.
