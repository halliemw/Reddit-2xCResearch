I don't have that view generally. My partner's grandmother is amazingly modern. It's just my experience with doctors has been the older ones have outdated views. Not specifically because of their age, but because of how long it's been since they got their degree and not every doctor feels the need to keep their knowledge up to date. An older doctor who's only just qualified would probably be fine about issues like IUDs.
