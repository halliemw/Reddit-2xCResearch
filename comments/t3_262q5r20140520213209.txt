Just because he can't change the decision doesn't mean he doesn't have a right to know.  I'm a firm believer in people having all the information.  Maybe he'll decide he needs to not trust people with birth control so easily, maybe he'll realize he should have been more pro-choice because he understands now while people have abortions, maybe he'll go on about his day with no result, but I think that's up to him not for her to decide that he doesn't need to know. To me, lying about birth control and then not telling him about the pregnancy is doing two wrong things to him, just because he was ignorant of what happened doesn't make it ok.  People can and should think about their safety and obviously everyone is going to decide this on an individual basis, but I think people should also keep in mind (as long as they feel reasonably safe to do so) people have a right to know if their actions resulted in a pregnancy and/or abortion.
