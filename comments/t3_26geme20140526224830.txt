For what it's worth, I think you're going to be fine. My metabolism changed and it took 6 months before I started losing weight even though I had changed my eating habits drastically as far as eating healthier. It's a real mind fuck.

Remember though that what's going on inside your head is more important than what your body looks like. Once you get some clarity you'll feel better and look better regardless.
