From what I've seen, it's mostly enforced on guys - mainly making sure their pants are up. I've actually very rarely seen it enforced on girls in my own school. I'm not denying it's existence, but rather questioning its prevalence. It's obviously a problem wherever it is, but I mean the only thing the article mentions to support itself is the girl who was ejected from prom.

Is it a problem? Of course it is, and it should be gotten rid of wherever it exists. But does it happen as much as this article seems to claim it does? I don't believe so.
