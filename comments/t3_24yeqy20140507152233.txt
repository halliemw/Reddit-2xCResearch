it depends on the city, but it's not really irrational in my city. I live a block from a public highschool in south Philadelphia. there are fights non stop. The black kids constantly start trouble with the Cambodian and Vietnamese kids. this leads to fights, stabbings, shootings, etc. i think it was last year or the year before, there was a retaliatory shooting stemming back to the first for like 4 days in a row. there are 15 foot fences around the schools and bars on the windows all the way up to the top floor. it looks more like a prison.
