Not really. If it were a radical hysterectomy, where they remove your ovaries, we could guess ovarian cancer, but a hysterectomy is a treatment for cervical cancer as well as endometrial and uterine cancers. It wouldn't make sense to remove the cervix but leave the woman in a position where it was still possible to become pregnant. I'd imagine the results of an implanted embryo eventually tearing away from the endometrium because of not enough support since there's no cervix would be pretty bad.
