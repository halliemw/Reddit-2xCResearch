Thank you - when we'd set up the lease agreement, because my room was bigger, I naturally paid a bigger portion of the rent, I honestly felt I was as fair as possible and I guess I feel like now I'm just being walked over because I don't want to rock the boat because it's easier to say nothing and just build up this resentment and hate... and then just seethe and take it out in the gym or something. I've lost 15 pounds in the last 2 months so bonus?
