This might be a better fit for /r/askfeminists. While a lot of us on this sub are feminists, many aren't. 

I have a hard time taking suggestions that feminists don't support or work to advance men's rights seriously because I learned about men's issues in feminist spaces from women and men who cared deeply about them. Rape of men and boys by men and women, toxic masculinity/"man up" culture hurting men who don't fit the masculine ideal, the negative implications of circumcision, trans issues, gay issues, and others. It might not be the goal of feminism to focus equally on men's issues, but there's a corelation between the two for sure.

Kind of like how I came to feminism for women's issues and was made aware of a whole host of racial issues thanks to my time in these communities. Men's issues matter to feminists, but shouldn't be at the forefront of our activism
