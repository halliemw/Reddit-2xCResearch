Arkansas and Wyoming are the lowest at $5.15 per hour. At that rate if you worked 40 hours a week you would only make $10712 dollars annually. That's the equivalent to £6322 (which I made working for my dad when I was 14 and I still ran out of money quite often without rent, food or utility bills). Anyone expected to live on that is in for a rough time. 

On the other hand Washington is $9.32 per hour so that is £19385.60 per year. 

The difference between this is amazing. I couldn't imagine trying to run a household for myself never mind with children on such a tiny salary. The government would probably have to pay that extra $10000 dollars in assistance to help the people who are living on such a terrible wage.
