Somehow I've managed to say some incredibly personal, controversial, and sexual things on Reddit, not just here but other places that were default or more well-known boards without getting any negative or unwanted PMs.  

Got my first one last night asking about certain parts of my anatomy.  So... yay(?) I'm in the club now? :/
