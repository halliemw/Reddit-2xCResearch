I'm so sorry, I did indeed use the term in a misleading way.  However, the work required to allow censorship of "bullying" would easily allow censorship of material that falls under freedom of speech, and therefore could lead to far more harm than good.

I used the term "free speech" in a general and philosophical sense.  In the sense of an ideal, though clearly most people aren't nearly so principled or detached.  I'm not mistaken, however, and I don't need your comic to correct me about government.

But, yes, private parties can maliciously harm me because I suggest things they don't like! Soooo moral

Tell me, what about legitimate criticism that is shut down by your bullying laws?  Acceptable sacrifice?  "Mean things people say need to be shut down! !!" It's a pretty embarrassing position to take.

I've been depressed as much as many people, and presumably I've been bullied, though not harshly.  "Massive scale internet bullying" deserves action against whatever sort of conspiracy exists, not against the idea that people can speak online freely.  Call me when you start to take action against all the other facts about society that "can contribute to suicide."  Calling for the curtailing of speech to prevent suicide is laughable, living under modern capitalism.  rofl

Also please don't quote a (admittedly very good) webcomic to make a serious point.  Speak for yourself, as XKCD holds no weight to me beyond its ability to make scientific jokes and ideas commonly accessible.
