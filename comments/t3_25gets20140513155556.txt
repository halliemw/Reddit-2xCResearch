I'm going to have to disagree with you. First of all, body hair and cultural expectations about body hair are *entirely* and *categorically* different issues than menstruation or war. Your argument literally does **not** make sense. You're extrapolating where it makes absolutely no sense to.

To say that I'm being petty and juvenile demonstrates that you've missed the entire point of this thread.

Hair is hair, despite **obvious** physical differences between male and female bodies. Shave or don't shave, I don't care, but what the issue here is the social pressure to do it is *exclusively* on women; there's no need for that social pressure, and in the case of not shaving, stigma.
