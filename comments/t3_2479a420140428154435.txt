I don't entirely understand why it's so offensive that men want to participate in discussions this way. There are differences between how men and women are socialized and there's certainly a place for articles discussing these issues as they pertain to women, but it sounds like these guys were just commenting on how the content of the article applied to them personally. (I did not read the article or the comments, just going off your summary.)
