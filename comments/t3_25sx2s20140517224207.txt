If you think there are 'subsets' of women who are less deserving of respect because of what they choose to do with their body then that's misogyny.

The good thing about language as it evolves alongside humans, we don't need to invent new words every time something shifts. There's more than just the google definition of a word, there's about 163 entries for 'misogyny' in the Oxford reference site, all ranging from dislike, contempt, prejudice and hatred for women. 

Now, since 'sluts' are women, holding prejudice against them is misogyny. 

Hating your coworker for being a dick isn't misogyny, but hating a whole 'subset' of women is. You might love your mother and your girlfriend but as soon as you begin to categorize women in to who is more deserving of respect then that's prejudice and that's misogyny.
