> I'm just so sad and alone now, even typing it out to an internet stranger makes me feel somehow less alone. At least I know I'm not the only one going through some issues in my life.

*hugs* I know how you feel... that's why I made this post. I needed to get out a lot of my own thoughts and maybe find others to talk to regarding this subject matter. 

I moved to a new city/state almost 3 years ago and I'm still struggling. (I did manage to make some close friends, but they've all since moved away. Which sucks.)

For the people at work, have you suggested doing stuff after work maybe? Like getting drinks/happy hour? Even though initiating sucks and is hard, it might be better/easier than waiting for an invite from them or inviting yourself to their events if that makes sense. It puts you in more control.

As for meetup... I mentioned this above, but I find that if the event is centered around a particular activity (e.g. board games, a sport of some sort) versus just a general dinner get together or something. The activity helps to break the ice easier in my opinion. Then you don't have (as big of a problem) of feeling left out or ending up alone if that makes sense. Plus, it gives you something to focus on and you don't have to worry about constantly keeping a conversation going.
