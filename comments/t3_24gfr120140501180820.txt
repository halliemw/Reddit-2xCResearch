No, it's more like a speech that consists of "Women suck and are bad. They're stupid and have smaller brains then men. They're gold-digging whores and sluts. They should all be locked in the kitchen and kept pregnant and barefoot at all times, because producing children and cooking is all they're good for."

That's not a speech, it's just a sexist rant. There is no point to it other than expressing the speaker's sexism. Likewise a joke that just expresses sexism is just sexism.
