No shame in my desire to have casual sex, just major regret in seeing signs of him not really being worth my time and still going ahead with it but I fully agree. I hate that that was the first thought I had afterwards, and I would never think of anyone else like that ever if they had done the same thing/feel the same thing. 

But okay yes it's silly to legitimize it and feel that way. Thanks!
