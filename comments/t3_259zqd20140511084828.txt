I don't know how healthy it is to view things this way, nor do I know how well it works for others. But if you trust your significant other 100%, turn your jealousy into pride.

When someone hits on my man, I think "Heck yes, people want him and find him attractive but he is mine." I find it flattering when people want to be with or hit on my boyfriend. He handles the situations appropriately (turns them down, etc.), and then comes back with me at night.
