I don't think a perfect seal is an issue, the idea is not to fill the reservoir with pee as you clamp it to your smooth mons. You want to jam the lower end of the thing pretty firmly, so pee doesn't escape, but if you have pubic hair it won't prevent that unless you are very very thick and springy. 

A pee trough can be messy, but it is much less messy and less piss-in-my-pubes drippy than squatting. You certainly get less hey-let's-go-spraying-intermittently-sideways with the thing to direct the flow. I like to lay a bit of paper towel in the crotchseam of my pants just in case of leakage. I've gotten very good at it though. 

I think the thing to do is to try to pee slowly. It's not a penis. It's a trough. Men can pee through a penis at any speed, its not going to back up. But with a trough you can overwhelm the thing and overfill it and instead of pouring out the thin end it's rebounding onto you. So you try to control your flow, pee a bit more slowly.

I never shave, use it all the time. It's a Godsend.
