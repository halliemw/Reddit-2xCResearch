> It could be physically possible to reduce miscarriages. Miscarriages caused by the mother's body could be prevented. Certain immuno-suppressants, uterine supplements, etc. could work.

Is research in this field underfunded? I really don't see where you're going with this argument. Yes, they should support research into preventing miscarriage as much as putting an end to legal abortion if they value life equally. I agree with you. In the end, that no going to have an actual effect on miscarriage. Most miscarriages happen before  women even know they are pregnant.

> However, they spend their time trying to convince governments to defund Planned Parenthood, one of the largest contraceptive and women's health providers in the US.

Planned parenthood is also the largest abortion provider in america. Why shouldn't they actively campaign to defund them? Planned parenthood actively ends the lives of more unborn humans than any other conglomerate in the entire country.
