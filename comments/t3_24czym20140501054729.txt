I do wear a lot, but I do it so it doesn't look over the top, just to cover my flaws. Which I guess is why I was so shocked that he would think I look good, I have pigmentation on my cheeks from acne and because of health reasons I have had very dark circles under my eyes since I was a baby. Hopefully it will help me become more confident with not wearing it, as I currently feel far from confident without it.
