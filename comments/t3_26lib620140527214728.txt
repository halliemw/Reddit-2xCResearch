> I don't think I have problems because of it

This is the important part. Many kids do weird sexual things when they are little, and it is often mutual. There are clear cases of molestation/abuse, and those tend to be marked by both reluctance on the part of the victim and mental scarring. If you look back upon these experiences and don't feel angry, regretful, dirty: that's okay! If it is not affecting your daily life my suggestion would honestly be to not over-analyze it. Thinking about such instances might make you feel differently about them because of your adult perspective. Feelings might change. But, in most cases, it's just "weird kid stuff."

However, if you can say definitively that you WERE forced into doing these things and they made you uncomfortable/upset/unhappy or hurt you DURING THAT TIME then yet, it was abuse. BUT, if the kid was the same as you, it could also be unintentional. Anything involving two children is so hard to analyze. Of course it's a very, very grey area but I think digging into scenarios involving childhood messing around can be pretty damaging for the psyche if you start "looking for abuse." Tone is really hard to convey over the internet but I do not mean that antagonistically *at all*. I just mean that kids are innocent but also weird as shit.
