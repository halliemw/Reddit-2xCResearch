Tell her to get advice before she leaves the house. Legal advice and advice from a women's shelter. Depending where she is leaving the house can lean heavily against her in court. When it comes time to leave she needs to get someone she can rely on to be there with her if she fears violence. And if violence happens she would be best to involve the police. If she is leaving the house she would be better doing it at a time he isn't there ( ie: is at work) take all legal documents which are important to her birth certs driver licence copy of lease/mortgage wedding cert medical records credit card bills etc. But before anything else advice, legal and from an abuse support group.
