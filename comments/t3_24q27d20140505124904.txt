Thank you I really do appreciate your help and the help of everyone else! I should have mentioned that the work thing isn't really what it seems: I work a dangerous job in a bad city and he gets worried, I feel the same way when he goes to work as well. Luckily, I am changing jobs soon as he has motivated me to quit drinking and start studying to go back to school and use my full potential. We DEFINITELY need to talk more about moving so fast in the relationship, I've become very aware that it was a controlling move of his to have me living with him so soon.

Luckily, I've read so many stories of women who have started a relationship with a questionable character and ended up happily ever after. Obviously, G and I will split if he can't change. We,ll split if he keeps damaging my self confidence after I tell him he's being hurtful. I'll leave him in the dust if he lays a hand in me or starts telling me what I can and can't do, I'm better than that. I hope we can be the couple that stays together, the couple that grow to have more great times and less rocky ones. But I won't be so blind in the future, I've survived on my own before and I will again. 

I love G and I'm secure that he loves me as well, we're forgiving ourselves for our pasts and working for a better future for us.
