Honestly. For a community that ought to consider themselves strong, the children have crawled out of the woodwork. And it's not the new posters I'm referring to.

For a group that often self identifies as strong people, there are a lot of people here panicking about trolls. And an even larger group who can't 
handle disagreement without resorting to insults.

It's been a day and good portion of the community has gone in to full whine mode. Women don't want this primary internet real estate? Maybe I was wrong about this community after all.

In the spirit of the playoffs, welcome to the big leagues TwoX. Keep your sticks on the ice, grind it out in the corners and let the goons draw the penalties.

In other words, if you like the community and feel that women are equal to men, fight for your space. Report, ignore, respond politely and bide your time.
