I don't agree with your interpretation. I see it as a woman fighting for the "right" to have control over her own body. I feel that in this context, abortion is a by-product of fighting for bodily autonomy because other things are restricted/heavily controlled for women as well (birth control, sex therapy, etc.). She doesn't specifically mention abortion.
