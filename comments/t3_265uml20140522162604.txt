I use a mobile reddit app, and I don't know how to edit this into my OP.

You have all given me a lot to think about regarding the state of my relationship to my husband and my motivations for thinking about terminating the pregnancy. I'm not decided on it, which is why I posted in the first place.  I just know when I could do it if I were going to. I wanted food for thought while my husband was away yesterday and I have certainly gotten that. Right now I think I am leaning against it. I love the two I have, they are so sweet and silly and loving. I just hope with a third I can devote enough attention to them. They'll be 2.5 and 1.5 then. 

My husband and I do have problems in our relationship. A lot of it is that he's a bit younger than I am. Of course I knew who he was before I married him, but it's harder than he thought it would be and he hasn't always dealt well with that. Getting counseling isn't always as easy as wanting it, especially in rural areas.

I do thank you all for your replies. I knew I wouldn't get fluffy useless jokes here, which is one of the things that makes this sub so great.
