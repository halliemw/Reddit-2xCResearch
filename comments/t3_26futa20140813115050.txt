You have seen heavily upvoted rants similar to Elliot Rogers on /r/mensrights? really? I am a regular there and haven't seen them. I have seen some pretty negative views of feminism, but rarely of women, and the rare ones I have seen are usually downvoted to hell. If you are going by things linked from /r/againstmensrights keep in mind that they actually often use heavily, heavily downvoted threads as representative of the thinking on /r/mensrights.
