It's generally sad when two people are married and one of them dramatically changes their appearance in a way their partner finds unattractive. Your body is always yours, but part of marriage is thinking about two people instead of just one. I'm personally at a loss about why you find some imagery on your skin to be more important than keeping your work options as open as possible (especially when it's not just your life anymore, it's also the life of the person you're supposed to love who is being effected, as well as any possible children) and having your husband remain as sexually attracted to you as possible.
