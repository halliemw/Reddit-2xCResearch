You shouldn't be to worried. Everyones different when they take birth control. Sometimes it'll give you spoting iregular periods or no periods at all especially when you stop taking it. You wont see a period for a good two monthes and I say that from personal experience. I was the same when I was sexually active and on the pill. Just as paranoid but everything turned out okay. Maybe bc just isn't a good idea for you. If you keep on having problems you should stop taking it all together so your period can start coming on time without the spotting and weirdness. As for being less hungry bc has a lot to do with hormone control to so I don't think it would be to strange to hear if you appitite wasn't as large
