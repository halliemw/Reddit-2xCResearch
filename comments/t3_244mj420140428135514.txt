I am sorry, but you are, scientifically speaking, wrong. The mother and father recipients are the biological parents of the resulting child. I will also be the biological mother of the child, but that is a result of my being the genetic mother. Your response is offensive only because you are making a very bold normative claim based on faulty descriptive statements. Your statements are untrue, thus your argument, though logically valid, is unsound.
