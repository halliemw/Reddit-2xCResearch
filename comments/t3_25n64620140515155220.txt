It really depends on the situation. If it is a time when I am experiencing severe vertigo or motion sickness. If either of those are going on, then I don't offer my seat. The likely hood of me falling on some one and or vomiting on them in those cases are likely. I am  more likely to give up my seat to a person trying to hold on to a squirmy baby or toddler though, just because I have been there before.
