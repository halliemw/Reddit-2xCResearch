I love cleaning the house and baking cakes, pies, cookies etc. Nothing feels nicer then a lovely clean house and freshly baked banana bread to reward myself with. I love 50's style dresses too so I'm trying to attempt to teach myself to sew so I can make my own!

Also nail polish. Oh god I can spend far to long looking at China Glaze swatches and trying to pick out a new one to try.
