A lady who puts a profile on a dating site and gets guys who respond with dick pics and crude comments has a right to perhaps respond like the artist aboveâ€¦ but but.. and here's the part that needs to be emphasised - Tinder is NOT a dating site, is it? It's a hook-up site! You're not joining that app to date and meet some nice blokes you can go out on a date with. The whole point of the app is to get sex - and get it fast!
