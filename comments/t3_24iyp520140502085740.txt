I wear different kind of outfits that are always forced to be covered up. I was just particularly angry about this dress in general because it's my favorite, and I personally thought it wasn't all too revealing. I'm not allowed to wear tank tops, V-necks, or anything along those lines. I've seen other girls in the class wear them with no problem, whereas I always have to cover up.
