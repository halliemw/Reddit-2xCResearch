I'm so glad you worked out,  I know lots of redditors have had great LDR, but I'm personally not going to sing their praises. Especially when its really young people like teens.

  I think for a LDR to work out it had to stop eventually being long distance, its only really supposed to be a temporary thing. I think most people will admit it is harder and not as fun. To me it feels like less of a relationship. Mostly an ongoing promise they'll hold out until their together again. 

Anyone who's made it work is probably a lot more determined than I am. I think I could maybe do it for a while with an established relationship. but with newer ones I'd be scared there is so much uncertainty. That I could be holding out for a person its not going to work out with.
