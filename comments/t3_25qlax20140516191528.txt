I tried one for awhile and I hated it.  Getting it to unfold was almost impossible, and when it did, I thought I was going to have to go to a doctor to have it removed.  But then I found out that I have vaginismus (my vaginal muscles contract when I try to insert anything, so it causes a ton of pain), which explained why I had such a hard time.
