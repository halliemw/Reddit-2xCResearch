I'm "average" weight. I'm not really fat or skinny. I was wearing short shorts (I have thunder thighs, I'm a hockey skater) mind you I'm not unattractive but I'm not the most attractive girl you'll meet. 
I was wearing short shorts and some asshat in Canada when I lived there said I have "jello legs"
I can't wear shorts confidently ever again.
