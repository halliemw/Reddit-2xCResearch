I don't know her, but I did not pick out my bridesmaids based on who I was clostest to / liked the most. 

My decision was based on the following:
1. Convenience 
I live abroad and wanted my bridesmaid to be someone from my home town where I am getting married in - I know she will be there (no risk for delayed flight, not approved visa or th like) and she can help me with lots of "local" stuff.

2. How much I assume they liked the idea of being bridesmaid

3. Personal reasons. I have plenty of friends who I hold dear, but ruled out some due to things related to them. For instance, I know one of my friends is between jobs, is super stressed and no money. I'm not going to put the burden on her to get a dress and shit. Another one is in the middle of a divorce so... she has a lot on her plate too.


So summa summarum, this does not have to mean that you would not be imporatant to her or something like that. If it bothers you, maybe you could bring it up to her and say that you would really want to be a bridesmaid?
