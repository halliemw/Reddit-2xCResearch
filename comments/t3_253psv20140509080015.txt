Some girls I knew went on birth control before going to college, just so that they'd be prepared. Just something to think about if you think it's likely you'll start having sex in college. That way you don't necessarily need to plan ahead as much.

It's not a problem that you haven't gone, but you'll need to go by the time you're 21 even if you don't start having sex to get a pap smear. I've been seeing a gyno every year since I was 13 because I was on birth control, but I didn't start having pelvic exams until I started having sex (I was 18). This year I'll have my first pap smear because I'm 21. I think that it would be a good idea to see a gyno before going to college, just so that you can have some peace of mind that you're all healthy and to talk to someone about birth control and whether it's a good choice for you to go on it. It could also help to go now because then if something does go wrong (UTI, yeast infection, pregnancy scare, STI, whatever), you'll already have experienced talking to a doctor about your genitals and sex, and it hopefully won't be quite so scary.
