In my opinion, no matter what the crime is, rape or otherwise, there is no point in saying to a victim 'what could you have done differently'? It's a crime for a reason. It's not helpful to say to a victim of a burglary 'well you should have had an alarm system, well you should have had bars on your windows'. After a crime has taken place is not the time or place to pontificate on ~better choices~, nor should society's onus be largely on the victim to protect themselves.
