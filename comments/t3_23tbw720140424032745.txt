I know the feeling. I barely have any friends in the city I live in, and I moved here almost five years ago. Homesickness and the fact that I dated someone who lived in my hometown for the first couple years didn't exactly help me. I'm on good terms with my neighbors now though, and I'm planning to get back into horseback riding soon, maybe even volunteer at a horse shelter. I think we both should try to get out more :)
