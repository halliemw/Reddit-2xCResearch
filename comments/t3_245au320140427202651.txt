> I never bled at all the first time. Guess years of sports/gymnastics/horseriding sorted that out! I was so grateful. 

Bleeding during sex is because the hymen (a membrane in your vagina) is tearing, and it is a bad thing. It means there wasn't enough lube, which usually means you weren't turned on. That you didn't bleed the first time means you were relaxed, turned on, and using enough lube. The second time, well, you said you were tense. The pain you felt the first time may have been from expecting it to hurt or him being large. 

Either way, the issue is probably he isn't spending enough on foreplay and may not be using enough lube. So, yes, for the problems you guys are having, he's the issue.
