I love my mother-in-law dearly.  She loves me just as unconditionally as she does her own children, and it helps fill a little of the hole in my heart that I get when I wish for a mother.  She is not my mom, but she is a wonderful, caring, giving woman, and I am tremendously grateful for her.  It sounds like your husband has found some of the same salve in his relationship with your mother.
