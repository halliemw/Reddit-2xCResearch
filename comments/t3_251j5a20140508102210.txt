She *is* actually planning on moving to Norway to be with him when she's old enough to do so, sorry for not mentioning that in the post. I don't know if her parents are aware of that or not, I don't think they'd be okay with it though.

It's not like that at all, it just seems really odd and out of place that he's always going on about how much of a princess she is, how she's better than any goddess, how she's 'his queen', that sort of thing. 

Thanks!
