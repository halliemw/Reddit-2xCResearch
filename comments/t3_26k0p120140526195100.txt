My guess, having a penis, is that he uses his friends as a buffer so he can keep his space from you and have a part of himself that you dont know about, nor any real influence. Does he have friends? Of course. But he may also be going out and NOT hanging out with those friends when he tells you that he does. Since you dont know them, you would never be able to find out later by accident or by following up later. Hes able to effectively create free time no real questions asked.  What he does with it? Your guess.
