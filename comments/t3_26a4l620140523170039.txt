Yea it seems like a crazy hard situation to deal with. Alcohol sucks. Thats why my girlfriend never drinks enough to get more than just tipsy when she's not around me. Even though I trust her to never do anything when drunk it still makes me happy knowing she won't get super drunk when i'm not there.
