Boot salesperson here,

boot's 50% 
fit's 50%

And I think what they mean by shank is a plate. To qualify for the highest level of safety (at least here in Canada) You need both a toe guard and plate that mean crushing/puncture resistance. A shank generally refers to a rigid piece of material that supports the center of your foot.

Composite toe and Plates are preferable as they are generally lighter weight, non conductive, and meet all the same safety requirements. 

Waterproofing: A waterproof/breathable sewn in booty is the only way to go but they do impede breath-ability of the footwear

Style wise -  Hikers are comfortable and lightweight but tend not to last as long as a real boot (Welt sewn, full grain uppers, etc etc)

**Fit: Unlaced, make sure you can fit one finger behind your heel when your foot is pressed all the way forward in the boot. Don't listen to the number on the box - It's a guestimation. It should be firm around the mid part of the foot and the heel should fit like a ball into a socket. Toes should be free to wiggle with no pinching - Leather will stretch, protective toe boxes will not. The lacing: the eyelets should have 1" - 1" 3/4 gap across the tongue. Once you walk around in them make sure your heel doesn't slide up and down. Lastly, Use your common sense of comfortable and once you found one you like wear them in the store for 15-20 minutes. The leather will behave differently and you'll get a better idea of how the boots will feel in the long run.

Socks: Look for content and construction. Good padding, fitted to the foot, breathable material (I like a mix of wool, polyester, nylon, pima cotton, rubber/spandex, and/or polypropylene)  

Good luck to all you boot shoppers out there.
