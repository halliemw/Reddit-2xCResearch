As a homeowner in a place where the rental market is insane, I would never meet with someone beforehand and would automatically rule out anyone who requested it. Ain't nobody got time for that. I don't even do one on one interviews. The last time I put a room up for rent I got over 100 replies. I just did an open viewing where people could show up anytime in a 2 hour slot.
