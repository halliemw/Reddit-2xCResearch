I have no idea how the entire visa/moving countries thing works, so I could be wrong. Even if they do stay in a relationship until they're 18, there are plenty of relationships that last for longer where somebody is cheating/being too controlling, so I don't see why that matters all that much. It's a good point none the less, so thanks.

I'm not looking for anything to be concerned about at all, sorry if it looks like I am. My sort of naive, young and impressionable friend is all giddy for a sweet talking guy on the other side of the world who's cheated and seems to be a bit of a player, I'm going to be worried.
