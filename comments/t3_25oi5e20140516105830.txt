I spent 3 years in an abusive relationship, as did my husband. When we started dating, we had a LONG way to go in terms of communication, because all we had were examples of what not to do. First and foremost, get comfortable with talking about your feelings. It sucks at first, it really does, but the more you do it, the easier it gets. Try to keep your cool, too. Take a deep breath and focus your thoughts and say what you need to say. Don't blame, don't yell, and try to remember that you are a team. My husband and I had a fight about his communication, and I'm so embarrassed to look back on it. All I needed to say was, "When you don't talk to me and tell me what's going on, it makes me feel like you don't want to talk to me. If we're going to be successful, we need to talk and we need to know what's going on with one another." It's really, really helped. And this is really cheesy, but look up the Five Love Languages test and both of you take it and read the results. That'll tell you how the other person needs to feel loved, and it really helped us focus on what mattered.
