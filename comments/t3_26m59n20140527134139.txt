I absolutely 100% would NOT be okay with someone else having a key to *my* house/apartment. No way. 

Maybe I'm just paranoid, but my house is my space. If I sign a lease with someone and have a roommate, that's one thing since it was agreed to and there's shared responsibility. Someone who isn't on the lease or paying bills there isn't as likely to respect your home. They don't deal with the consequences if they forget to lock the front door and your things get stolen. 

Also, what happens if they have a nasty breakup? I wouldn't want someone who's pissed at my roommate having a key to my home. 

Aside from that... just nope. I might be okay with an extended guest *if* they were significantly contributing or it was reciprocal (ex: if I frequently eat over at your place, you're welcome to raid my fridge). But things like toilet paper, dish soap, electricity, etc. add up. It might not financially be a big deal right now, but this is a really easy way to form resentments eventually. Six months down the line, things are tense with your roommate for some completely unrelated reason, and then you remember that her girlfriend has been there, using all your stuff... it just adds unnecessary fuel to the fire. 

In conclusion, no. I like my space and privacy and don't want some new chick there all the time.
