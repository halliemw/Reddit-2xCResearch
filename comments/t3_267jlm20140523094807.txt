Oh, no offense possible, there is totally some mental illness involved there. He had some bipolar-type behavior - like having periods when he was REALLY REALLY HAPPY and you'd better be happy too! And then long depressive periods where he constantly talked about how much he hated his life and wanted to kill himself - and he had some behavior I've seen listed on the schizophrenia spectrum, like paranoia, magical thinking, the prophet thing, and a the belief that he was destined to be rich and famous despite having no plan or aptitude for getting there, leading to a lot of get-rich-quick-schemes. He comes from a large family and they all have similar problems to varying degrees, my father probably being the worst. But none of them will see a real doctor because Jesus.
