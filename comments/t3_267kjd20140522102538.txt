I've switched from the pill to the Mirena IUD and that was great. I lost weight ( and my boobs), I felt fine, no bad side effects. But the Mirena made me start constantly spotting after 2 years so I had it taken out and decided to have no hormonal BC for awhile....and it was BAD. I started growing dark hair all over my face, my skin and hair was constantly greasy, I had crazy mood swings. I got back on the pill and everything is good now. I might have gained a couple pounds, but that could be getting my boobs back or lifestyle issues. 

I guess I am one of those few that doesn't have negative effects from BCP.
