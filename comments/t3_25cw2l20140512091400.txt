As. An older person speaking with some experience here:

1) you have dodged a bullet.  He seems like a pretty classic narcissist with a substance abuse issue.  Heal and move on.  Your young, you will.

2)There is a lesson you must learn so as not to repeat this relationship with someone else...you can't fix them, they can help themselves, but you can't do it for them.  No amount of love willpower, and help can fix someone else's mental issues or addiction issues.

3) in my view those pictures are an abuse...but I'm not sure there is anything to be done about it now.  Cut losses here....I would say Run, don't walk, away from this situation.

You DESERVE much better than this.  Don't let anyone treat you like that...it should have been you ending it with him IMO.  Cheer up, the best is yet to come
