please get yourself treated before your boyfriend arrives! otherwise, you'll just transmit the infection to him and then risk passing it back and forth. when you say your mom is conservative, do you mean about sex or "private parts" in general? i would hope she's okay with you saying "hey, i'm experiencing some vaginal discomfort and i would like to see a doctor". do you think she could handle that?
