"Reddit, what's the classiest NSFW picture you know of?"

-no pictures of men in the top 100 posts.

/r/askreddit is a big boy's club. I don't think it's deliberate misogyny, just the majority upvoting what they want to see, but it makes it so any distinctively female voices are unheard and eventually we just stop posting. Unless you say something about giving blowjobs, which opens up a whole other can of worms.
