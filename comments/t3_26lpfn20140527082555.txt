Okay, so you're a part-time student. Frame it differently to yourself. Your focus is school, running your household, and you also have a part time job. If you think about it that way, you already do a lot. Plus you take care of your own bills and contribute half of the groceries; that's really great! Keep it up, but do try to see how much you put into the relationship in the next few days.
