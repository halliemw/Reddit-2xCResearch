Life is the greatest gift you can receive, so be grateful of your mom for that, if nothing else.  It takes away the sting but your sadness is still valid.  This day is really hard for me too, my mom didn't give me up or anything, but I was neglected and emotionally abused my whole life and we don't have much of a relationship now as a result.  I am working through my emotional issues, most of which have been a result of my childhood, and part of that is letting go of the resentment I feel towards her.  It's hard, but realize your mom was probably experiencing  (and still does) a lot of pain that she was not able to cope with in a healthy way.  I had an abortion six months ago so I am dealing with a lot of emotions surrounding this day, I can totally empathize with you.
