I've been happily uterus-free since 1997, and if a hysterectomy had been elective surgery, it would have happened before that. There's not one single thing I miss about menstruating. No more cramping, emotional meltdowns or leakage worries, and I get my estrogen and testosterone in pill form. I do have to stay on top of my mammograms, but that's a good idea whether you take medicine or not. And anybody who says you shouldn't blame your period for being stressed, weepy and overly dramatic is more than likely a man. These symptoms are not psychosomatic; they're very real for many, many women.
