I cycle to feel safe (I'm in the UK too). And you can take a fold-up bike with you on a bus or other public transport.

The idea is that you are moving quickly past so you would be much more of a hassle to any would-be attackers to attack.  But I would avoid narrow alleys where they can easily block your path. Stick to main roads.

Also you can wear androgynous clothing on a bike and the speed gives them less time to assess your gender.

I've never been attacked, although there was that one time where I believe that cycling saved me from being attacked...
