Yep. Mine curl way up behind the cervix.  And since all women are different depths and shaped it can be a difficult task to find those fishing line strings.... they also soften with time, making them even harder to find.

Don't panic until it's time to panic. No need to worry about it until you find out from a doctor if you should worry (way easier said than done, I know)
