That's a pretty toxic and narcissistic way of approaching value-based concerns.

Just because -you- don't care about what he does with his body re: tattoos does not make his concern any less valid. 

Empathy is about understanding a point of view and personal experience that is alien to you. You're dismissing his point of view based on your own criteria, instead of seeking to understand his.
