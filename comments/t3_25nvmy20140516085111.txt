Something to add that I think the helpful cop missed is this comment: "asked how she knows she hadn't consented if she had been drunk"

Look up the laws in your state. Back in Jersey and also now in the military, it's part of the definition of consent that one must be sober to give it so what the cop said makes no sense based on what I know as the legal definition. If you're going to appeal it, knowing your state laws surrounding consent will only help you
