Hey guys, a few updates. We did some brief cleaning, nowhere near the window, then called the police and filed the report. They hadn't heard of anything else in the area, but they'll be on the lookout. We're calling our landlords to ask about getting cameras/fake cameras installed, and we may even offer to foot the bill. We got some little stick-on window alarms that go off when the window opens. They're just temporary until we find something that suits our purposes better, as it's really the screen that concerns us. We also will be getting a security sticker for our window. 
Sadly, we discovered the window locks are not as strong when the window isn't fully closed, so we can't sleep with it halfway open. We'll look into the rods, though. 
We're also going to look into various self-defense tools and techniques, though really we're not comfortable with guns.
