I got Paragard in February of 2013, and it slid out of place and stayed in the opening of my cervix for about a month until I was in so much pain that I went to the ER (I didn't know it was sitting in my cervix!). I had to have the thing taken out a few days later (I went to the ER on a holiday that happened to be on a Thursday, my dr's office is closed on Fridays, and the doctor at the ER refused to remove the IUD because he wasn't the one to put it in). When I finally got it taken out, the doctor asked if I wanted a replacement one put in. I yelled, "HELL NO!!!!"

I HATE THAT THING MORE THAN ANYTHING. I will never get one again. The pain getting it in wasn't nearly as bad as the pain I had while it was chillin there. Also, my periods were so ridiculously heavy - I'd go through 3 **super plus** tampons within **two hours** during the entire first day of all my periods (from Feb-July), and it was moderately heavy (still had to use super plus) for the next 5-6 days. I actually began taking iron supplements to prevent myself from becoming anemic.
