She only sleeps when others sleep over. He's said to me "I don't know why you feel threatened by her, she just Name. I don't like her in that way at all she's nothing but a friend and she knows that as well" so I really don't think he would cheat. I think he would just brake up with me and go out with her, he knows she likes him, he knows that if he asked she would jump into bed with him.
