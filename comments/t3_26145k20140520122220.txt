Lately I've started scolding them like a dog.  I'll stop and say something along the lines of, 'No.  You don't get to say that to me.  That's a no!' The reaction varies from genuine surprise, to anger, to (surprisingly most often) an actual apology.  I'm always shaking with adrenaline afterwards though.  Thankfully I've never been attacked but have been threatened after embarrassing them in front of their friends.
