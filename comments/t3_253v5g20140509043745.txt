I'm so sorry about your pain but I'm pretty sure I know how you feel :( My symptoms got bad so quick within the last 24-48 hours. I've been lying in bed in the fetal position with an ice pack smooshed between my thighs. It's good to know that there's been other reports of dryness, so I can't be the only one.

Thank you so much though. So many people have commented with well wishes and it's so nice to be able to talk to other people about what's going on until I can get into the doctor's tomorrow. :)
