You can talk to your mother like a child looking for redemption or a daughter out for vengeance. She already knows the facts, it's how you present them that matters. When you talk to your mother, know that was she is looking for are signs that her daughter is healthy. The best way to do this is make the conversation reassuring to her about your health (mental, sexual, whatever, mothers aren't allowed to talk to you about this but they worry about it constantly and it manifests itself as compulsive and overbearing behavior).

As an exercise I would consider writing a speech to your mother where you are only allowed to mention topics your mother is concerned about. It can be entirely your own words and your own experience, but your not going to throw ALL of the ugly facts in her face (because this will upset her) only the ones that give her anxiety. Tell her you value yourself, that no one else is going to get that intimate with you again soon without earning a lot of your respect, and that you think your relationships are meaningful.

Remember who you are to your mother. When you speak to her she does not see an outspoken young women, but instead she sees the child that she is so concerned about. She's not worried about all women who sleep with men, she's worries specifically about you. If you talk to your mother about the issues a mother worries about you'll be able to get past her anxiety much easier. Remember that your relationship with your mother is firstly for the family, and your own personal beliefs come 2nd. What's important to her is the family is healthy. If your mother is worried her family isn't well, then you have to reassure her that everything is fine and when you look back in 5 years you'll both realise this is nothing.
