I don't think it's too late especially if you say you've seen prior evidence. The experience I mentioned was somewhat of an odd legal loophole, but in general domestic abuse is treated very seriously. 6 months after the fact I accompanied my ex to the station, she filled a statement, a detective spoke to her a number of times... And this was while the officers knew it was too late, because they also hoped to help. Sometimes the bureaucracy gets in the way, but this is a big deal.

If nothing else, filing a complaint, having a statement from your sister and going through some of the process will be helpful in the future even if by some inconceivable scenario they dismiss the complaint.

It's worth doing it, also they're trained to deal with these situations, it wouldn't be the first time someone lies to the police. Hang in there!
