I completely disagree. How old is too old? Breastfeeding a 12 year old could be considered sexual abuse. So there is clearly some age where it gets too old and should just be a mother's choice. What about those parents whose children die because they choose not to give them medical care for religious reasons? Parents have every right to raise their children how they want, but it still isn't okay to physically or psychologically hurt the child
