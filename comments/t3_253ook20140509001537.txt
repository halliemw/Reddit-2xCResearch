My book club did the following:

We met at a diner for breakfast on the first wednesday of every month. Easy to keep on calendar. 

We took turns bringing 2-3 book options for everyone to choose from. Basically you'd print up an amazon summary or if you had the book on hand you'd bring the book. Everyone would vote on one or the other and that would be the book we'd read the next week. 

Books needed to be 300 pages or less and available in paperback. Sometimes during the summer we'd read longer books, we were all moms so life is easier without school in session. 

I quit my book club when they read 50 shades of grey. I just completely lost interest. I'm in Los Angeles. I'd love to be in a book club where in addition to being interesting the authors need to demonstrate literacy.
