It might seem obvious, but she shouldn't do it unless she's ready to pull the trigger in the event that it doesn't work out.  What I have seen is that the non-initiating partner will do some really pathetic things to get the initiator to come back.  There have to be some real, tangible, permanent changes, not least including professional marriage and family therapy (for the kids too).  Like the other commenter said, Dad needs to figure out how to embrace God and religion "putting God first" while driving his marriage toward love and not something else.

The only thing worse than being stuck in a relationship with a partner who has lost sight of your family's needs is to be cycling in and out of that relationship over the course of months or years.
