I wish you the best of luck, and please stay safe. I've been in these situations before with people I've loved and trusted, and it's not easy to admit to yourself that you suddenly need to be cautious around them. Feel free to PM me any time if you have any problems. I've dealt with it all: abuse, stalkers, restraining orders, the whole shebang. Hopefully you won't need to deal with any of that, but in case you find yourself having trouble again and can't find anyone else to talk to, there will always be resources here.
