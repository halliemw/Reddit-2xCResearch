My coworker told me "Smile, it won't kill ya!" the other night, on a night I had happened to do my makeup because experimentation, why not? I told him that I didn't wanna crack my mask because I'd put a lot of effort into it and I didn't want it to all go to waste. I'm proud of myself because I managed to get that out completely blank-faced, because when I smartass I usually smirk.
