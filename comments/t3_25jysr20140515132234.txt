based on the website, (i think) the boots and gloves don't look modular, just the 'items'; the wings and flames and...jet pack looking things, so you'd be able to switch powers and abilities from figure to figure. i might not be right, but in that case the emphasis would still be on what each figure can do, and less on the clothes. 

HOWEVER, i really dig modular character building, its my favorite part of video games. even if it is still dress up, it would be a neat way to expand what girls are 'supposed' to be interested in. it could act as a gateway toy! today elemental action figures, tomorrow graphic novels.
