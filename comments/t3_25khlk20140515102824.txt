Thanks for sharing!

Transgirl, about 7 months HRT. 

Not really presenting yet, but so much of what you say rings true in my experience.

It's a little scary in a strangely wonderful way to find yourself changing inside without any clue as to the final destination, but the level of self-discovery and self re-definition is amazing!

Sometimes you have to wonder if you're really changing or just bending to societal norms, but when I read testimonials like yours, I know it's real.

Hope your journey continues to go well!
