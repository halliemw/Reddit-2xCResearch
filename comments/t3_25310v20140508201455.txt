I'd say if it's to lighten the mood or cheer people up after training, switch to a standard type of employee appreciation event like a group meal or social gathering. If these employees are largely public-facing and the company wants to defray some of the costs of maintaining their appearance, maybe offer reimbursements for some appearance-related expenses? Even if it isn't strictly "mandatory," putting everyone through these programs at once will make them feel pressured. Allowing them to access similar services at their own discretion and reimbursing the cost would make sure nobody feels uncomfortable.
