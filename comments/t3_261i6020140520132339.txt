My husband and I were long distance when we first started dating.  It was hard, but we made it!  Tips:

1. Call each other instead of texting/emailing/whatever.  Hearing each other's voices will make the communication more emotionally satisfying.

2. When you call each other, give the call your full attention.  Turn off the TV, walk away from the computer, etc.  This too will make the communication more emotionally satisfying.

3. Skype when possible!  Seeing each other will make it easier.
