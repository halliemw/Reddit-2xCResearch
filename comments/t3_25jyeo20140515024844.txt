You're 23 years old now. You should be discovering the world, meeting new people and enjoying life and if this son of a bitch is making your life a living hell just move to another place. Don't expect the legal system to do something about it.
It's sad to have to leave everything and everyone you know behind because of this, but life is short and you deserve to have some peace. Don't let him make you his marionette!
