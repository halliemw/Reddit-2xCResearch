Yeah, I definitely felt as though the system failed me. One of my biggest daydreams/fantasies is seeing him in person someday and (after I overcome the inevitable panic attack) walking up to him and verbally throwing up my two middle fingers by letting him know that he didn't destroy me and that I have lived a successful and happy life haha.  Pretty cheesy, but it makes me smile and that's what's important in life.
