Thank for the perspective. It helps a lot.
I am sort of a very 'RAWR smash mental health stigma' type of person. He came from a family with no such problems , who seem the type to keep quiet very quiet about it. So I don't want to forcibly try and make him change, but rather make moves in the right direction.

   I do see that attitude in men a lot, and tragically its expressed a lot on r/suicidewatch. My SO's often sort of mirrored me. At times I wasn't doing so good he could seem really withdrawn, He seems fine now that I'm doing pretty ok. But I know being with me isn't always the easy. I do my best.

We're in this pretty long term, been two years and we live together.
