This is all just deflecting again.

>3) Actually, this happens to a surprising number of people I know (even ones you wouldn't consider "reckless"). Besides, I'm not saying that everybody would dress crazy scandalous, but they certainly wouldn't keep imposing the dress code on themselves on their own merit. So all-in-all, nothing's really being accomplished by this code.

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. However, the teachers and school are paid to lead you to water. Its their job. Your feelings on the matter don't come into it, nor should they. Also, a "surprising number" of your friends isn't surprising. Your friends likely hold the same views you do.

>Yes, I know. I'm not saying all dress codes are terrible. I'm saying that if dress codes are in place, it should be an all-or-none deal. Either have it in both high school and junior high, our neither. The only one we have (marginal) control over is the one in our school, so that's what we're dealing with.

"All I'm saying is, if you're going to try to get me to follow the rules, you better keep your eyes on me from when I'm 12 to when I'm 18 and you longer are allowed to". This is all self-control.

> I do accept that the posters might have been a bit alienating

Unless you go to an all girls school, or you're omitting details on the poster, it can be taken no other way than "Boys are the reason this happening and they think nothing of you besides wanting to have sex with you."

You may not have made the posters, but you're putting your signature on this message, so you better be ready to defend it when people start asking you to.
