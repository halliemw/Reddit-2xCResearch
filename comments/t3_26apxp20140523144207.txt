Thank you for the response and ideas. Yeah, it can be kind of thankless, and it sucks to have to be the one to say something whenever anyone drops a racial slur or bashes somebody over religion, ect. I can't change their minds I'm sure, but I would feel like a worthless piece of crap if I didn't at least *say* something. Putting it as an issue of professionalism as opposed to getting into a fight about their beliefs might get more traction.
