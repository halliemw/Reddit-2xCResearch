The downvote battle is definitely due to the recent change, a lot of people will just downvote anything they aren't interested in to get it off their page, but honestly even before being defaulted certain specific questions about birth control have always been pretty hit or miss here. (a few other similar topics as well) 

Those posts most often would never hit the hot page, but would generally get a few responses anyway. Votes generally stayed around  2-3 up and 1-2 down. One thing that is definitely different now is that we get more posts overall so even people visiting /new may not have seen your post as it would fall off the page, whereas before it may have stayed within the first /new page or two much longer and more people probably would have chimed in.

We've talked about whether removing and redirecting them was a good idea in the past, but we've generally maintained that if if was lady related it belonged here aside from a few rules. That *might* be something we'll look at in the future. One of the hopes with this change (if it works) is that there will be a side effect of other lady related subreddits getting a boost as well from all the women like OP here that just didn't even know this side of reddit existed. So redirecting to more specific subreddits won't feel so much like we're just blowing you (and others) off if we decide to go that route.

ETA: I hope this doesn't sound like I'm saying your post in particular wasn't welcome here or anything like that. I'm just explaining my perspective on why it didn't do very well. These are definitely all things we are watching and thinking about.
