I really don't think asking for a warning is an attempt at censorship. It's just a warning, and I think that's just considerate. People who want to see it aren't being denied the chance, it's just giving those who don't the chance to decline. 

I can completely understand your feelings though. My best friend committed suicide in 2009 and for the longest time I couldn't watch anything in movies relating to being shot in the head (how he chose to do it). I can deal with it now if I have a warning, so warnings are REALLY helpful in those situations and I don't understand why anyone would be against them. I can deal with it without a warning since this happened years ago, but it still catches me off-guard and I get a little queasy sometimes.

But yeah, fuck that guy. He's clearly just an asshat and I wouldn't give it much thought
