It looks a lot like a [Raleigh](http://i.imgur.com/l7ms6Dm.jpg). Only the handlebars are a bit higher so I really have to sit upright to steer.

The gears and chain is encased which reduce skirt-snagging, I've got spoke covers on my bike because I ride in a skirt often and I also live in a dodgey area and keep coming home from work to find some asshole win tin-snips has had at my spokes.
