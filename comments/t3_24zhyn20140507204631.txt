Your daughter is a newborn, and you're already asking for opinions from reddit about how to be a good father?


To me, the fact that you're asking for input is an indication that you're already more prepared for this than you think you are.  Not because you already instinctively know everything about raising a girl, but because you recognize that you *don't* instinctively know how to raise a girl, so you're going to do everything you can to figure it out.  


And how many new parents instinctively know how to do this, anyway?  Baby boy *or* baby girl, being a parent for the first time is huge.  I think it's great that you're researching and reading and asking for opinions!  I'm not a parent myself, but it seems like a lot of it is learning as you go, and figuring out what works and doesn't work for your specific kid, and then revising that over and over again as they grow and change.  If you just said to yourself, *"Nah, I got this.  I don't need to learn anything new to be a parent to my daughter. How hard can it be?"* you wouldn't be thinking about even a fraction of the stuff you're thinking about now. 


You've got this.  You're going to be a great dad!
