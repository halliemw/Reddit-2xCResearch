This happened to me.  I didn't ask her about it.  Just thought she was trying to keep the guest list for the wedding small.

It wasn't until after the wedding, when one of our mutual friends mentioned that she was wondering why I didn't show up, that I realized that the invitation had been lost. She was mortified that I thought I hadn't been invited.  

Wish I had just asked.
