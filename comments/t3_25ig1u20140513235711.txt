Well, I just used a walk in appointment, and the doctor that I talked to over the phone was different from the one I saw.
Lately, I think I've been under a lot of stress. Literally going haywire and crying at the drop of a hat (which is very unlike me). So, I don't know what's going on with my hormones right now tbh.  

My diet's really bad because I can't use the kitchen in my house but can't afford to eat very well on my own. So I'm sure it's taken a toll on my immune system as well. I've been making a point to eat less sugar and probiotic yogurt everyday though.
