It's actually nine weeks at this point.

I've unfortunately had to have both because of failed birth control (Once with a friggin' IUD!), and I do prefer the pill procedure, because it's much less invasive. The pain reminded me a lot more of extreme constipation pain. Talking to people who have had similar pain and been through childbirth, it's basically the exact same cramping located in a different area.
