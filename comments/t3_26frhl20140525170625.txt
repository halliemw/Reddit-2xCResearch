>Here's what form-fitting jeans look like. Does that look comfortable to you? Because it looks pretty damn painful to me.  
  
If people are wearing things that hurt them, then they either have no right to complain because they *chose* to wear it, or they need new clothes.  
  
While "loose or baggy" isn't "in" or professionally acceptable, there's a *huge* difference between "form-fitting" and a good fit. Funnily enough, it's possible for pants to be somewhere between "loose" and "form-fitting".
