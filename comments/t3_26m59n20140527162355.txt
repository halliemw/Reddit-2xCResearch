Similar thing happened with us. Me, my SO, and his friend all got an apartment together. His friend had been dating his girlfriend for about a month at the time we all moved in. 2 months in she started coming over almost every night. 3 months in she moved all of her stuff in. We were okay with it because we thought we would now be splitting rent in half. But nope. We had the master bedroom so his friend made a big to-do about it and made us pay way more than him. Even though all three of us were on the lease. He got away with paying only 500/mo..his girlfriend didn't even work. Throughout the whole lease they both were horrible and dirty and lazy, never cleaned, did their dishes, or the catbox.

You need to bring it up calmly because you don't want it to cause huge issues. If a third person is going to be there then rent should be divided up differently, too.
