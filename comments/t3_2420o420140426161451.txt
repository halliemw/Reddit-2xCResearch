I haven't watched Felicity so I can't help you there, but I love both Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill! It really just depends on what you're in the mood for. 

Gilmore Girls is an awesome feel-good show. The characters are a little quirky, the drama isn't too big, and you get a lot of mother-daughter bonding time. Plus the dialogue is super fast and funny.

One Tree Hill is a kind of soapy teen drama, but it's one of my favorite guilty pleasures. It's also a bit more well done (at least in the earlier seasons) than some of the other similar shows out there. You've got love triangles, angst, parties, and a lot of people who are way too old and attractive to be playing high school students.

Overall if you're looking for a strong female lead I'd say Gilmore Girls wins by a long shot, but the girls on One Tree Hill can hold their own against the boys as well. Sorry I wrote so much, these shows are two of my favorites!
