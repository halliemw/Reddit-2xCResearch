I should add that I'm not trying to explicitly say DTMFA or anything; interfaith relationships can and do work, but they don't tend to last without serious discussion and compassion and compromise *from all parties*. :)

Faith has an impact on some seriously important parts of life, from free time to raising children. Would it be beneficial to find a couples' counsellor with a specialty in interfaith relationships?
