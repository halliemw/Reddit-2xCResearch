It's sad for your Mum.

But she and your Dad are grown-ups and it's their lives.
She could leave him anytime.

If you don't want to go on vacation, don't go.

It sounds like your Dad loves this women and maybe this is his chance to be happy.
I don't think I would like to deny a parent that and it sounds like your mum isn't happy with him anyway so maybe she will find happiness without him.

End of day, they're old enough to figure this out.

Hate the other lady if you want but life is way to short for that. 

It's a shitty situation for everyone at the moment, but it doesn't have to be a shitty situation for everyone forever.

Life is short. Love is important. Forgiveness is important. Family is important. Marriage isn't always forever. Sometimes we hurt people in order to be happy ourselves. Family can still be family even if not under the same roof or with the same people.
