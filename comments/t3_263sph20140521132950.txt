I used to have a problem with chronic UTIs after sex.  I know it's annoying, but I do pee before and after sex.  I usually empty the tank, and then swig down a whole bunch of water, and then I go at it.  When I'm done I then empty the tank again.

I also do a quick wash before and after.  And I drink organic cranberry juice daily.

So far so good.  I've also been generous with the lube.
