I would recommend that he get into a support group. I joined over eaters anonymous for a while and then switched over to eating disorders anonymous. 

Note: I am NOT religious. The meetings and the philosophy has religious undertones, but it was still one of the most valuable experiences of my life. Hearing the stories of others overcoming the same issues I was/am dealing with was amazing. Both groups have lots of resources. My favorite is "For Today" which is a daily book with snipits encouraging strength against disordered eating. 

I also saw a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. That really changed my life. She gave me so many tools. She helped me find words and strength I never thought I could have. 

As far as talking to him, ask him what he thinks he needs from you. It's pretty likely that he just doesn't know. Tell him that that's okay. Tell him that when he figures out what he needs you're ready to do your best to give it to him. 

Listen when he tells you it's not something he feels like he can control. Bulimia is classified as a disorder for a reasons.

Be patient. It's not an overnight process. I would guess that some people "quit" cold turkey, but it's been almost 5 years since I started therapy and I still slip up. 

I still use exercise to purge (a much more socially acceptable form of purging than throwing up) and I still occasionally find myself with two fingers down my throat. 

Recovery isn't a destination. It's a road. It's a journey. 

Most of all, know that it's only a piece of who he is. He is not just a bulimic. He is not just a man with an eating disorder. He is still all the other things he has always been. He is still strong and kind. He is still capable of being a wonderful partner. He just has a demon that he needs to beat. 

If you ever have questions or need support; I'm just a PM away.
