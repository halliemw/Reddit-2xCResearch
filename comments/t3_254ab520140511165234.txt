You are right that her boyfriend has every right to abstain from sex, for this or any other reason, just as she does. I should be more clear, and maybe I read into the situation beyond the facts that were presented. It sounds like her boyfriend was presenting it as 'my way or the highway', but that may not be the case. 

This is a tangent, but I'm curious about your thoughts on the pill hiding problems with fertility while NFP highlights them, and combined with NaPro, can help to treat them. For example, my fianc√© has low progesterone and found out after she started charting. Low progesterone can heighten the risk of miscarriage and if she had opted for the pill until we are ready to have kids, we wouldn't be doing the work that we are now to correct that problem. I've heard stories of women who have noticed irregularities in their cycle because they charted which turned out to be caused by cancer, but it would have been months before they had any other symptoms. To me, this is one of the huge selling points for NFP.
