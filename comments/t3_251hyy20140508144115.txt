I fully understood the title, my frustration is that I pay the same amount of taxes for the NHS here and yet I get limited services because of my politicians. I understand your teeth thing, I'm going through the exact same thing there.

My point is that the UK government should not allow this to be a topic controlled by individual parts of the UK. Basic women's rights should be equal everywhere, and I'm disappointed that they would rather baby our politicians that force them to treat women with respect.

Don't imply, by the way that I don't actively protest and get involved in pro-choice campaigns and events. Also don't suggest that I lose any right to complain *whether or not* I am involved. I am fully 100% allowed to complain about my backwards politicians that I did not vote for and do not respect, it is nonsense to suggest I not complain.
