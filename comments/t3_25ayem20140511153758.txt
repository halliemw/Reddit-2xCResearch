Thank you so much for posting this. I constantly see misinformation on reddit about women's fertility declining in their thirties. It's amazing to me that the study that cites women becoming less fertile in their thirties is from the 1600's, which is not exactly current. Current studies find that women in their thirties can conceive almost as easily as a woman in her twenties. People face enough pressure in life, and the myth that you have to have babies in your twenties is just making it worse.
