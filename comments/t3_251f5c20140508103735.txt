"Many women are terrified of what will happen when NATO troops leave. They already see the darkness returning."

Interesting quote. Many other women, including the Revolutionary Association of the Women  of Afghanistan, have been opposed to NATO's imperialism from the start. They do not see raids, check points, bombings or war crimes as helpful in their fight for liberation. The intersectionality of the struggles against American hegemony and patriarchy are pretty clear.
