When I was in undergrad, I used to live across the street from what people called "The Village" which was literally an apartment building that was full of people on welfare and dealt drugs. There wasn't a single week that there wasn't an entire apartment's worth of furniture/clothing/junk on the curb from someone getting kicked out and there was always at least one guy just sitting on the front steps. It was right in the heart of downtown and just a couple blocks from campus.

I consider myself to be somewhat attractive (very attractive according to my husband but I've got ugly duckling syndrome and I still see the awkward ugly little girl in the mirror but I digress...) I had to walk past "The Village" (on the other side of the street) almost daily to get to the parking lot where my car was and rather often the guys who were outside would holler at me and say things like, "Hey girl" Hey shorty" etc. Never anything derogatory just hollering like people tend to do and I think I freaked them out because I never reacted negatively. I would just smile and wave and tell them to have a nice day. The first time I did it the one guy's mouth literally fell open. 

What I find hilarious is that my male neighbor would often post on facebook about how they would get harassed by these same men. In my case, I treated the guys who hollered at me like people and I actually think they never yelled derogatory things at me because of this.
