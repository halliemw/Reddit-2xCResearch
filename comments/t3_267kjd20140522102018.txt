From what I've read, doctors who say that are stuck in the past.  Some older models (dalkon shield) of IUDs caused infertility in a significant percentage of women, but the new ones do not.  As I said in my other post, I'm 24 and I asked my gyno for an IUD and she didn't bat an eye.  Only thing she said was that she'd prescribe a cervix softener to take beforehand - insertion tends to be a little more painful for women who haven't given birth.
