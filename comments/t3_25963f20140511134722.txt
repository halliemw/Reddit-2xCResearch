When people tell me to calm down in a way that is clearly intending to make my emotional reactions seem silly/childish/whatever, I usually say something like, "I don't want to calm down - I'm excited!! Aren't you?!"

If they say something nasty in response, I will point out that they're being a "grumpy gills" in an annoying, childish voice with a pouty face.

People like to have fun. When you point out that someone is being a jerk and making your fun less fun, you make them look like the doofus.
