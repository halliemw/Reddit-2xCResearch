I had an amazing relationship with my dad (past tense because he has since passed away, not because it isn't anymore).

He always spent time - or made time - for me, even as a self-employed man who only got paid when he did work. I always knew I was important to him, and that I could count on him for anything.

He supported my interests (it helped that we shared a lot of them, including history and music) and always seemed to think of ways to make them "our thing." I was into Native Americans that week? He'd bring me to a museum on a reservation. I'd read *Black Beauty* and suddenly wanted a horse? He'd ask around and find a stable willing to let me muck out stalls and help with the horses (turns out I really didn't want a horse after that, heh). I wanted to learn how to cook cakes from scratch? We'd go to the store for ingredients, and we'd spend the day trying out different recipes. 

We also spent hours and hours just talking. He was my sounding board for a lot of things, and he seemed willing to discuss just about anything, with no judgment (or at least, no more than the "I want what's best for you" kind).

**tl;dr**: make time for her, because she'll remember it. Do as much as you can with her, especially things she's already interested in. And always be willing to talk to her, and offer advice and opinions (if wanted). You're her dad, and how you treat her will help make her into the woman she'll be when she grows up.

You'll do fine. The fact that you care so much, and are already thinking so seriously about it, shows that you're already doing everything you should.
