Oh, I didn't want to start like an storm, but a lot of the r/science comments referred to many factors that weren't assumed, such as the gender of the teacher corresponding with the gender of the student was correlated with higher grades of the student, or that neater handwriting is associated with higher grades.  

My point is that sure, these are factors that should be considered, but some of these points are like they are fishing for a reason the article isn't true. They're trying to confirm their bias--it may not be true, but it was just the way I read the comments in the section.
