I'm quiet too, and I just let people talk over me and take that time to observe and make judgments (not mean judgments, but you know, size up who I like and who's a douche, lol). Whenever there is a guy who defies that mold, and is very conscientious and cares about my input, it really impresses me. I usually don't even want to say much, just because I'm so used to being shut down, or spoken-over, but I appreciate, and notice this so much when it happens. Big points for guys who are empathetic. Nice guys finish first in my world.
