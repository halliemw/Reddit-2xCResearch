Even though from experience I hadn't really liked giving them to other guys or him, I gave them to him to please him. I remember feeling really upset that he was heavily criticizing me for something that I didn't even want to do in the first place.

We broke up 10 months ago and stopped talking to each other completely after he tried to start a fight with a guy I was dating at a party...well, he didn't get physical but he confronted the guy and said "You suck" and stuff. I thought that was way out of line and ended our contact with each other completely.
