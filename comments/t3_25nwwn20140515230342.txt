I love being complimented on my weight loss. 


I lost 35 pounds this year and when people notice it makes me feel good because I worked for it. I don't think anyone intends it to be hurtful when they mention it. I've never had a reason to be offended about it. 


However, I will say that your coworker had poor boundaries with you in general. He gave you unsolicited advice regarding how to eat and exercise; though not bad advice, it wasn't asked for and you gave no indication of wanting to discuss your weight loss further. 


For instance, if I were to tell a friend they look great after losing weight and they seemed uncomfortable, I would not keep trying to discuss it, let alone give advice. It's rude and poor social skills. 


Your coworker sounds a bit clueless. I think if this happens again you should let him know you don't feel like it's appropriate to discuss your looks/recent body changes.
