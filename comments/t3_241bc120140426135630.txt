Questions like that are not supposed to be asked* and you do not have to answer them. In college, I was told to say "I'm not comfortable answering that question" or just call them out and say "That question is inappropriate/irrelevant/illegal and I will not answer it." I wish I had known this earlier because I have been asked questions like this in the past.

*In Canada (and I'm sure many other places) questions like this are illegal. Here's a list of legal vs illegal interview questions in Canada. http://www.canadahrcentre.com/base/interview-questions/
