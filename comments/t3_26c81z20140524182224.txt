I guess you have the power to step up and not get unhealthy food. But that will take a lot of effort on your part, as I'd imagine you would get a lot of grief. Maybe get a couple treats and hide them for a cheat day, but only prepare healthy food and have healthy food available.

I think the first step is an honest and open conversation with your mom that does not seem like blaming or nagging.

You're in a tough spot, but I think you can do it. I'm here for support.
