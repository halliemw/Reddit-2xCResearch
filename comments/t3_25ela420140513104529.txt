I don't know, perhaps we do need to get used to it, but personally i find the idea of a baby sucking milk out of my nipples really quite creepy and though i'd like to think i'd change my mind if I ever had kids of my own, I can't really see how being forced into seeing more breast feeding is going to do that. And I really really dislike the idea of breast feeding toddlers, sorry.
