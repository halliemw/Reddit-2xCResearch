It's not that unpleasant. It takes no more than 2 seconds, if you wash yourself it's not anywhere you haven't touched, and anyone can do it. They may even let you take the swab yourself if you explain your anxiety. Your GP is fine if you're comfortable with them. You can treat thrush with over the counter medication, but you have to put it inside your vagina so that's not an option for you. Your doctor can prescribe Diflucan, which is just a pill. It's also not recommended to treat your first yeast infection yourself because it's very easy to confuse thrush and bacterial vaginosis if you haven't had them.

Sure, you're fine if you never want to be sexually active in any way and if you're lucky enough to never have fibroids or any other common reproductive problems. Of course it's up to you because it's your health and quality of life at stake and no one else's, but if you had been more proactive about dealing with an irrational phobia, dealing with a very common issue wouldn't be so nerve wracking and you wouldn't have to delay treatment and suffer longer because of an irrational fear. I really think you should address this with a therapist, because chances are you'll have more yeast infections and maybe a case or two of BV in your life and it's not that unlikely that you'll have a fibroid or cyst that needs to be diagnosed and treated at some point, and right now your irrational fear would prevent you from seeking the treatment you need. It's important to your future health that you become comfortable enough with your own body that you can at least handle seeing a doctor about any health problems in any body part.

Edit: that exterior cream isn't going to do anything good for you if the infection is actually inside your vagina. Stop dicking around with your health and see your doctor. Call ahead and tell them how nervous you are, and they may prescribe a single dose of Xanax or something similar to be taken right before the appointment to help you remain calm.
