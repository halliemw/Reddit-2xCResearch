Of course I'm not saying that women can never sexually assault men. Of course I understand that there are differences to this issue when you identify as LGBT or non-gendered. What I'm talking about a very specific kind of sexual assault situation of men abusing women. I don't think it's unreasonable because that's undoubtedly the most common demographic. I do apologise for not being able to deal with every variation of sexual assault in exquisite detail in 800 words. I am simply not that clever.
