*If* he doesn't realize he did something wrong, then it's a good time to teach him that what he's doing is wrong. 

I have seen women shrug off this behavior because 'he just didn't know' but then no one ever called the guy out on it. He won't just magically learn. I'm not saying you have to do it, in fact I think it would be dangerous for you to do this alone. Are there any campus resources you could go to?

edit: this presupposes that this guy isn't fully aware of his actions. *Plenty* of rapists use this as a defense to get away with rape and assault, fully aware of what they are doing.
