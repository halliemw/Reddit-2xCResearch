Wellbutrin did wonders for me. Everyone else has covered the pros and cons in their comments well. The only thing I want to add is that it can lower your seizure threshold. That was why I had to stop taking it, because I was having seizures. Not full-blown ones, but 'simple partial' ones, where time would speed up/slow down and I would get sort of tunnel vision and smell things. If you start having weird moments like that, please tell your doctor.
