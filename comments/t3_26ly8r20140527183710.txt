He might see it that way, but it doesn't change the fact that the "Superior male" was completely overwhelmed and dominated by an inferior female. May not change his worldview, but his ego will always bear that scar no matter how much he may try to forget it. 

Just remember that the next time you feel vulnerable or exposed because of what he put you through. Hope it helps :)
