I was on hormonal birth control for about 15 years. It didn't affect who I was attracted to.  I have also never experienced a lot of the other side effects you've heard about.

I had some issues with my sex drive and they seem to be leveling out some what (I only got an IUD a few weeks ago so my hormones are still sorting themselves out). It wasn't terrible, but I am noticing a real difference in that area of my life.

I think that if your periods are *that* bad, that you really need to further discuss this with your doctor. Talk to them about your concerns. They are going to be your best bet for **accurate** information.
