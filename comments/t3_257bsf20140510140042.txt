About ten years ago I had a pregnancy scare. I went with a friend to the grocery store to buy a few tests because they were open 24/7. The cashier was a middle-aged woman and she looked at me like I was scum. I was miserable and just wanted my food and tests, so I just stared at her. Didn't talk, just stared. She wanted to make me uncomfortable, and I ended up making her stutter my total. I did it again when I had to buy tests for a friend years later when the same thing happened again.
