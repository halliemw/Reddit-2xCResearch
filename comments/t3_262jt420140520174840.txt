Don't feel ashamed. You did everything in your power to prevent this pregnancy and nature got the best of you. That's not your fault. You were making the right choices for yourself and for your situation. 

I think all your feelings are valid, you're in a difficult situation. Sometimes life puts us in the terrible situation of having to make decisions that we wish were never presented to us. Have confidence in your ability to decide what's right for you and your family. You care about your children and the life that you can provide for them and that's incredibly important.
