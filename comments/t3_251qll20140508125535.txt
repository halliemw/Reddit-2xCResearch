Please, I'm aware that many women don't identify as feminist. I'm just saying that to be upset that a **pro-women** community has a strong feminist presence seems very odd to me. In my experience here, there is a mix of discussion that is focused on feminist ideas and on more lighthearted or mundane aspects of being a woman. Are you saying that people who aren't actively feminist aren't wanted in this subreddit? I will agree that people who voice distinctively anti-feminist views are often vilified on here, which I'm fine with because it would be kind of odd to ask all the feminists in the subreddit not to argue with people even when we vehemently disagree with them. But are there instances of people being shamed/ chastised for content that is not explicitly feminist? I've never encountered anything like that here.
