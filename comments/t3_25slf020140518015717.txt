>I need to get home at xyz time because my husband/father thinks it's unsafe for me to be out too late at night" (Welcome to India)


I think that might a part of the problem. Enforces the mentality that it's unsafe for women to work around men. More women out at night, might be a better situation compared to a single woman.
