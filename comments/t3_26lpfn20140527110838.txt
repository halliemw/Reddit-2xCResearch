A student is considered a full time student in most schools if they are taking 15 or more credit hours a semester.  That means there are 15 hours of class (or more for most lab/recitation sections) in addition to studying/writing/assignments that have to be done for those classes.  That can easily add up to 30-40 hours a week of work.
