In short we thought this would be a good thing for the women of reddit that don't know about this space (and all the other related lady-centric subreddits) to know they aren't alone. 

To give women a face on the front page of reddit. This change also added 25 other new defaults to the list, ones that really show off the diversity of what reddit has to offer and women being here is part of that.  We did know that some wouldn't like it, and we are reading everything everyone says about it as well as joining in the discussions where we can. We are absolutely taking in what everyone here is saying, the good and the bad through public posts and private messages. We will be looking at all feedback before making any final decision. 

Our top priority is now and always has been this community. We're here because we love it as much as all of you. I can't give you an official time-line, but we would like to give it more than 2 days and see some of the meta posting die down before deciding how to go forward or if we will undefault. One of the reasons we said yes is because we knew that was an option going in. We do want this to work, but will be listening to everyone in the meantime.
