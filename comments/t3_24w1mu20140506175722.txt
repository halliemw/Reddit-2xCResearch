Thank you, thank you this is really choice advice and I'm really glad you took the time to type that all out. You've captured exactly what I'm going through and it sounds like you've experienced the same. I'm really glad to know I'm not alone and thank you for the kind words. I ry to remember to be kind to myself but I'm my toughest critic. 

I definitely will bring this issue up with my therapist at my next session. I say therapy hasn't been helping with this because we've spent the last few months focusing on getting me back to a point where I can function and do my regular life. I had to take a month and a half medical leave from work because of anxiety and panic attacks. So we've been really focusing on coping techniques and getting me back to a comfortable place where I can get up in the morning and go to the office without breaking down in the parking lot. We haven't had a chance to get to the deeper issue of whether my life is fulfilling or not yet. 

>If that is the case, try to find ways to minimize the things causing you the greatest stress - and if that is your "great" job, that's okay. Your mental health is more important than a fancy paycheck. 

This is what I needed to read right now. Deep down inside I think I know that this is the answer... but I'm terrified (and a whole host of other scary negative emotions) to admit it and do something about it.
