First idea, move. I can't argue that it may sound like dumb advice, but I also can't imagine what job is worth your life or living with the aftermath of rape if you've already got people tracking you. It doesn't sound like you'll ever feel safe there. That feeling has kept you safe so far. Keep your eyes moving and your head on a swivel. Be aware, look aware, don't be an easy target.

Do everything folks are telling you here, get the whistle, the mace, think outside the box. They're not playing by the rules of law or decency. 

If you don't think you can even use your keys in defense, you seriously need to take a self defense class like Krav Maga. Either way, you should take up running, because if you're awareness doesn't fail you, that is your last ticket to safety. Have a plan. There has to be somewhere safe to run to that ISN'T your own home if it's someone who doesn't already know where you live. 

A good read is 'The Gift of Fear' by Gavin DeBecker.
