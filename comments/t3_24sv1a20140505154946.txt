Sometimes friendships just run their course. You find you can't relate to them, and it's better to just cut your losses and move on unless you want to change yourself (and if hollywood has taught me anything, its that it never works). 

Finding a new circle of friends is always hard, but going out to events and activities are always super helpful. Do you live in a moderately populated area? Meetup.com is pretty great for finding people with similar interests.
