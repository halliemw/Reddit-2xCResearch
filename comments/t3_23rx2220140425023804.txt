Yes there are people who use it just for hookups but there are a lot that aren't, though its definitely much worse than it used to be. If you are joining an online meetup you could check references and if the person only has female references chances are he is a bit sleazy. If you are joining a bar meetup its going to be a good mix of men and women, social & sleazy. 

I just went to a meetup in Auckland when I was traveling NZ and it was great. I can't say how the ones in Italy are though :D
