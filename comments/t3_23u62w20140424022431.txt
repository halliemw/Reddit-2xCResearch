If it makes you feel any better, I have pretty severe anxiety and didn't get a pap smear done until I was 21 or 22. I've never been sexually active, though (thanks a fuckin' lot, anxiety).


I don't panic anymore but I still sob uncontrollably and clench up when I have to get them done. It's unpleasant but I've learned to get through it with minimal discomfort.


Even if you're not ready for a pap smear or a vaginal exam you should still see a gynecologist and consider developing a plan that will get you to the point where you can endure the exam. Even if you don't have a history of cancer its a good idea to have a doctor check out your plumbing to make sure nothing's amiss.
