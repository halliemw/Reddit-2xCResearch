I was pleased to see that the author brought up another aspect of beauty/thinness, namely hierarchy. 

Apart from that.. I'd much prefer if we could just stop being all about what men like. Either way, it is hurtful to women in some shape and size. After all, there are men who do love super-thin women and there are those who prefer much curvier ones and many who find other things more important and are not that fixated on size. So how about just drop the whole "who men *really* find attractive"-theme and stop fat- and skinny shaming? (Or muscular shaming... If I'd get a penny every time someone tells me that I may want to be worried over getting too bulky I'd be a millionaire). 

Last but not least... I prefer to dress in clothes that are attractive in my opinion. My SO and guy friends hate certain dresses/pants/tops which I love and seem to love some which I only wear at home out of "embarrassment" (e.g. they are comfy but I would NOT go out in them). So no, I do not and don't want to dress or diet for men as general population when I go out.
