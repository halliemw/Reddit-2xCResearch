I feel compelled to say this: NFP should not be used to prevent pregnancy. My husband and I used it when we first got married; we did it for several months before the wedding, I got very clear on when I ovulated, we thought we had a handle on it. My very first menstrual cycle as a married woman, I got pregnant. I ovulated a full ten days earlier than normal that cycle for no apparent reason, and mistook the cervical mucus I experienced that day for semen. A major risk is that even though it's not a calendar method, you will end up using the calendar because you get used to a certain pattern (my "egg white" day was ALWAYS day 19, until that one time it wasn't) and get caught off guard when your body deviates from the pattern. Luckily for us we were excited to become parents and had already been preparing for a future that included children, but if you're not in that place I would strongly recommend against using NFP as pregnancy prevention. Unless you can *predict* when you're going to ovulate every single month, or plan on being abstinent every month until 2-3 days after you've confirmed ovulation, it's not a surefire method by any means.
