I'm going to agree with everyone else and say that you've got some anxiety issues. The thing with generalised anxiety is that it seems to float above you waiting for something to latch onto - anything. It doesn't have to make sense. In fact, the fears probably *won't* make sense. BF going out for a nice bike ride? What if he has a heart attack and dies?! Never mind that he is perfectly fit and has no risk factors, the fear doesn't care. You'll see yourself identifying the body 100 times over. 

The best part about anxiety is that it gets to be a self perpetuating cycle. You start worrying about your worrying. What if I hound him too much and drive him away? What if my worrying doesn't stop? What if I can't control it? 

The best way I've found to handle it, other than through medication, is distraction, distraction, distraction. Let your boyfriend know that you are having anxiety issues and that there are going to be times when you are unreasonably afraid of random, possibly trivial things. Ask that he help distract you during those times (say, by engaging you in an activity like a game of cards or whatever it is you like to do). Make a list of 10 calming activities and keep it on your fridge. Then you don't have to try and think of something when you are already freaking out (my list has certain video games, jigsaw puzzles, gardening, etc.).

Exercise helps too, and don't discount medication if you need it. Talk to your doctor if you need to. Good luck.
