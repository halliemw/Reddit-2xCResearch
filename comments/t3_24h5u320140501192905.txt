The fact that it's so anti-feminist removes any legitimacy the sub may otherwise have. The patriarchy that feminists fight is the same patriarchy that causes these issues for men. Things like child custody, men dying in wars, and male DM not being taken seriously aren't caused by patriarchy fading, they're caused by patriarchy backfiring.

If they cared about men's rights, they would be trying to work with feminists. The people that actually care about men's rights either work very closely with feminists or just identify as feminists themselves.
