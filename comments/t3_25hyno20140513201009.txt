a little bit yes. i just had one about a week ago and i was freaking before it too but after it was over, i felt kind of silly for stressing so much. just express your anxiety and concerns to your doctor and he/(hopefully)she should talk you through the whole thing (which from start to finish only takes about 3 or 4 min) honestly, the best thing you can do for yourself is relax and take deep breaths. the more tensed up you are the more uncomfortable the speculum is going to feel. try humming to yourself if you feel comfortable doing so. anything to get your mind off of it. and remember, it's not a feeling that is going to last forever. it will be over soon and you won't have to worry about it for another three years. plus, a little discomfort is worth potentially catching something that may go unnoticed without regular check-ups like this. good luck with everything. just relax and try to stay out of your own head. it'll be over before you know it ;)
