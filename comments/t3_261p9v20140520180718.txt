but... but, I found that site through the article :( 

*i'm just acting sad cause I have to walk people through finding simple links at work all day and it's pretty exhausting, but I oft find it very necessary.

Also, I don't know what mountains you speak of, could you link them? The link I posted is from the census bureau, which, being one of the largest resources of data that prompts statisticians to do further detailed studies, might be worthy of consideration as a primary source in this matter.
