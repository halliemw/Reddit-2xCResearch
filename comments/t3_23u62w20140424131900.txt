Breast cancer was just an example I gave of a cancer that is treatable if caught early. I didn't say a 26 year old should go did I? I was talking about in general, that it is a good idea to go to the doctor periodically for physicals. No doctor would do breast cancer screening (aside from a short manual exam) on someone of her age. Please point out to me where I advocated that the OP get screened for breast cancer.

Of course it is OP's decision and if you look at my other comments you'll see that I have stated that more than once. I gave her some suggestions about therapists, female nurses, and not pushing herself to go to a doctor until she feels ready to give that consent. Unfortunately she is only avoiding the doctor because of severe (and understandable) psychological trauma. Her mental health is at far more risk than anything else right now.
