It's not cheap for a bridesmaid dress. You can get cheap ones for <$100. 

Just step down. No one should have to be in financial trouble for someone else's wedding.

Personally I think brides and grooms should pay for everything for their bridal party, and I cannot understand why it is tradition that people pay significant sums for someone else's wedding.

I've been a bridesmaid three times, it cost a lot of money and I am not having a bridal party at my own wedding as I don't want my friends to have to pay for things, and I don't want to spend the money myself.
