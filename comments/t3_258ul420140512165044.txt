It's definitely a construct that falls apart under scrutiny. First, when you tell kids that sex is bad and they should stay away from each other until they're married, you have nebulous boundaries: is kissing ok, but nothing else? Can it go as far as dry humping? Can any clothes come off? Can they all come off, but no penetration? Where is the "moral" line?

But then you have all the practical issues with virginity: what about same-sex couples? There's never any PIV penetration, so are they really just never having sex? Or is anything they do with each other considered sex? So does that mean any of those acts (e.g., oral, anal, fingering, etc.) also count as sex for heterosexual couples? It's definitely more complicated than they lead you to believe in middle school.
