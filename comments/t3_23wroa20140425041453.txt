It's not necessarily the implication of being *gay*, it's the fact that someone isn't actually listening and believing you when you tell them the truth about your own sexuality. It's not for them to determine.

If I was gay and anyone kept insisting I was straight, despite me saying otherwise, I'd be extremely angry at their insistence that they know my mind better than I do myself.
