Bleaching makes your hair fragile. Combined with blowdrying this leads to a dull, sad hair that doesnt hold volume and repeated bleaching (incorrectly done in particular) can even damage your scalp. Fragile hair wont grow as good, because it breaks off after repeated mishandling.


Stopping it will not give you more hair, but it can help with making your hair more lively and not so bland, superstraight and...well boring?
