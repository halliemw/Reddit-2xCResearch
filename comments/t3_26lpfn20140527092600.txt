It sounds to me that it's not that you're not doing enough, it's that you're criticizing everything about yourself. All the people below gave really great encouragement/advice, and you blew each and every one of them off with excuses as to why you're not good enough. Time for some tough love. It's not that you're not doing enough, it's that you probably feel like your SO is doing more because you're depressed and going to reject anything positive about yourself. SNAP OUT OF IT. I have dealt with depression for over half of my life, and that shit isn't easy, but it's all about perspective. Yeah, it can feel all encompassing, but don't come on a site to ask for advice, when all you really want to hear is pity for your struggles. You have an amazing opportunity with someone who seems to truly love you, but you're so caught up on hating yourself that you can't seem to appreciate it. Sometimes all it takes is seeing a silver lining and a little bit of a push to make what you want come true. You can feel fulfilled by doing anything OP, but only if you're willing to see the positives in life and not let all the negative bullshit overwhelm you. Who cares what people think about you as long as you're happy? Stop making excuses and make it come true.
