Wash my face, put on some toner and thick moisturizer in my dry areas on my face (have been using the Body Shop's Hemp hand cream lately...really good for dry patches). Brush my teeth, chuck on my PJ's, take my pill and sit in bed on my phone for about 15 minutes. I am happy with everything in that routine except for the last bit!! Damn technology... Oh and my PJ's are usually the least-glamorous tee shirt I own and flannelette pants!
