Then US law and I don't agree. The wording in your cited paragraph fixates too much on verbal expression, even though much of communication does not involve verbal cues. (eg. the "freezing" you describe in my eyes equals non-verbal refusal, which would - in a hypothetical scenario - in my opinion make it rape, even if she said yes. if we were to judge by your word-focused standards, this wouldn't be rape as long as she said yes, and he acted on this verbal expression - still assuming both were inebriated.)

In any case, I am still confident that my point is valid. I sadly can't argue with you if you claim that her being drunk left her too confused to react, but his being drunk didn't leave him too confused to understand that body language supposedly doesn't mean anything. 

You cited:
> the misdemeanor charge applies to "whoever engages in a sexual act or sexual contact with another person and who should have knowledge or reason to know that the act was committed without that other person's permission."

Which is the point of my argumentation. What if he didn't have knowledge or reason to know, considering he was as drunk as her? With what right are we assuming knowledge?
