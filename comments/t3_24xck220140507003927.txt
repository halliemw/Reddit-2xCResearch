I think then, you need to invent a new term to discuss. Because I've never met someone who considered themselves pro-life who wasn't actually anti-abortion. (Except for the idea that "the only moral abortion is my abortion" hypocrites.) 

I also think you're bringing up a strawman (straw lady?) here in saying people are just fine with abortion being birth control. I've never seen someone trying intentionally to get pregnant and then decide to have an abortion. I'm sure it happens, people's lives may change on a dime, but it's not the norm.

It's not like giving birth is without risks either, and that seems to be where you're headed in this. Birth control itself can lead to problems like perforated uteruses and hormonal changes and infections, depending in the method.

I agree preventative care is best. Most people would. Abortions aren't a mole removal in level of risk... But they aren't heart surgery either. Emotional trauma varies from person to person, and so does physical trauma from person to person and procedure to procedure.
