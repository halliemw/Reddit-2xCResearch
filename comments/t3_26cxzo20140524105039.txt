Wine may not be your best move.  I have been told in the past that alcohol can affect being turned on and natural lubrication.  I have never been able to be penetrated or use tampons either and I tried to insert a small vibrator while I was drunk thinking that I would be more "relaxed" and for me it just sucked.  

You may also want to consider looking into medical dilators that trans* women use after they have bottom surgery or intended for vaginismus.  If you go see a gyno and talk to them about it, you may even be able to get a prescription for them.  That would probably be a more comfortable way to stretch things because they start with much small sizes and increase in size gradually.
