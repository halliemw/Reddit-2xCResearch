> I get to go into a room filled with a committee of middle-aged men whose primary concern is upholding the college’s reputation and recount in explicit detail the circumstances of my rape at the hands of another student—I can’t wait.

Well...
>Middle-aged men

Not exactly who I would want to talk to about this trauma.

>Upholding the college's reputation

I.e. they don't care about *her*, they just want the issue to go away.

>Detail the circumstances of my rape

Because that just sounds so exciting, especially so soon after it happened.

*No one* would be happy in that situation. And not all victims even get this chance, adding to the irony of the situation.

The Onion writes about absurd things.
