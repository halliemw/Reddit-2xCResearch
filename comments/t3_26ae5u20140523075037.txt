This isn't what you're looking for, as I've never done or taken someone to counseling.  But I would like to make a point for you.  Remind your SO that you aren't taking him to "therapy" because you think he "has issues", but that your counselor would like to speak to the two of you together.  FOR YOU.  You're taking him with you to HELP YOU.

I guess you could prepare him by letting him know that there might not be tangible "results", as most of the results will be emotional and maybe unseen.  From what I understand, it's like a guided conversation.  You guys should be great at conversing!

Again, sorry if this wasn't very helpful.  I just want to make sure that you don't go in with lowered expectations because someone else doesn't think that being there will help them--because it's to help you.
