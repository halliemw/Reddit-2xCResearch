I believe you can mitigate some of it, but you're right, there's no way to *know* you won't be in a situation.  But overall I'd rather keep my way of viewing things then to think there is someone lurking around every corner waiting to sexually assault me.  There is no 100% sure thing outside of just staying locked up all the time, but I'd like to think my choices and those of my family and friends have kept me away from some of it. :)
