I agree with /u/Luder714. Small offices in particular are very territorial and that territory extends from the tasks you're expected to do to the people and relationships you have with your co-workers.

This is going to sound sexist as hell but whatever. A good way to deflect hostility you might be experiencing because the men are offering to help you is to whenever possible refer to one of the other women and ask permission to receive the help.

Glenda? Is it okay if Morey helps me xxx?

There are a number of ways of going about this. Morey may not mind helping Glenda with something (assuming it's in his bailiwick). So whenever possible, try to share the help.

It may be a losing battle. Some offices are just plain toxic. If the women want to continue being assholes though, it's on them. If you're good at what you do they'll need you whether they like it or not. Watch your back.
