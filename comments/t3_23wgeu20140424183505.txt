I'm a firm believer that alcohol consumption isn't an excuse. He told me that wasn't what he meant, that he loves me for who my past made me, and he loves my tattoos. He says that's what he meant. 

I've sort of shut off though. I don't know if I believe him. Why would you say something that even SOUNDS negative?
