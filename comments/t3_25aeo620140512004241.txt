This is so insulting. Just because I detailed the ethnicity of the person who sexually assaulted me, he's the victim?! I think you need to re-evaluate your perspective on right and wrong because somewhere along the line your moral compass has become skewed. You don't know what its like to be in that situation. I always thought i'd do the same, but you become frozen with fear and unable to react.
