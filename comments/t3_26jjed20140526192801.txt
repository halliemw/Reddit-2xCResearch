Assuming you have double pane windows, there are locks you can get that limit the distance they can open.  They are little contraptions that you attach to the track guide.  They don't damage the window, so it is good for rentals.

There are also security systems you can get that basically are a device that sits in the room that act as a motion detector and control pad and then you can have wireless sensors that you put on the windows and door. They talk to a command center via a cellular link so you don't need a phone line.   An example is this one: http://www.cnet.com/products/simplisafe-home-security/  

Alternatively, there are cheap ($5?) alarms that just stick on the window and if they are opened without being deactivated they go off.  You might be able to get two of them and have 2 positions (open and closed) so if someone opens it further it will go off.  You can get these at Lowes or Home Depot.
