That's a good place for a picture of it lol. It was so...tissue-y. This part is why it scared the shit out of me too. I literally poked it with a toilet cleaner stick to see it's texture, I was convinced I'd had a miscarriage though the timing wouldn't have worked out. 

Now that I know what's up I think it's more impressive than anything though lol
