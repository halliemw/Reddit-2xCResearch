I know you say you can't do "anything too sex based," but God would it have benefited me if someone had taught me about healthy relationships and consent.

Sex ed in grades 5 to 9 in North Carolina 10+ years ago was abstinence, STDs, how baby is formed, marriage (= one man + one woman) is the only relationship we should ever have. Never mind the fact that many students in these grades were already starting their first relationships and had *no idea* what they were doing. That lack of knowledge and experience goes well beyond social awkwardness and right into some dark places.

What is the age of consent? When is one "allowed" to say no? How do you protect yourself from repeated harassment? What does one do if something bad does happen? **What forms does abuse/assault take *other than* violent strangers leaping out from dark alleyways and/or drugs in a drink?**

Please see how many questions like this you can answer in lessons about body image and health. They belong in sex ed too, but if you can't teach them explicitly that way, please find another way. It would've helped me a lot at that age.
