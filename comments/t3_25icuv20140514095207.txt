I would private message whomever else was in charge of the event, and just say that "I'm aware that we were both drunk, but I am (rightfully so) uncomfortable with that."

If he asks you what happened if you ignore him, just say, "I had fun, but after a few drinks, you kept touching me inappropriately, and although I didn't say anything at the time, I'm still incredibly uncomfortable about it."
