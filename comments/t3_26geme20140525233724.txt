The thin veneer of civilization is particularly thin when it comes to weight, and even thinner when it comes to women's weight. Discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, and national origin are generally viewed as in poor taste, but obesity hasn't quite made the list.

A big part of this is that most people think fat people lack "will power". Being fat is viewed as a character flaw. Break a leg and everyone is sympathetic. Gain weight, and they lecture you about how you need to "take charge of your life."

Not many people in the civilized parts of the world would sit down with a homosexual and lecture them on how they "lacked the will power" to "straighten themselves out." But that's more-or-less routine with fat people.

The tide has begun to turn, but painfully slowly.

Aside from the usual comebacks ("So, why have you gotten stupid?"), I've found that many people's ignorance runs deep, and their prejudice deeper. Faced with a disease condition where research is only now beginning to provide answers to fundamental questions, and where the usual "treatments" are of dubious long term value, I can really only recommend one medication that is reasonably effective: [qsymia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qsymia). (Note: I use the term "disease condition" in the technical sense that morbidity and mortality generally increase with increasing obesity, although even here quite a few studies show reversing the specific conditions associated with obesity, such as hypertension, largely eliminate these increases. Other than that, a "desirable weight" has no more significance than a fashion trend. Some people like to wear their hair long, others like it short, others like to dye it green.)

However, there is good reason for hope. The research being done on the fundamental mechanisms of weight regulation is likely to produce effective treatments within the next five to ten years.
