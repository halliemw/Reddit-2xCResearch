I used to get so sick on my period when I was in highschool and before I was taking birth control to regulate them that I would have to miss the first few blocks of school sometimes. My dad, not willing to understand anything about womens' issues, would force me to go to the school and I would spend first and second blocks in the bathroom. Tried to explain this to my male English Lit teacher who caught me in the hall after my last block, having missed his class earlier that day... He was like, "That's not a real thing. You girls are always trying to skip gym and skip assemblies for your *womanly issues*, but you're not fooling me! I may be a man but I know how these things work!" I was already mortified at having to talk about my period to an old guy that I had to see five days a week without having to deal with the threat of suspension and being accused of lying...
