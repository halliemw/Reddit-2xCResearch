I said nothing that isn't factual. I merely reported what is happening in Iran. You are deluded if you think facts equal Islamaphobia. Name one specific thing that I said that is Islamaphobic? I lived in Turkey for a year and I saw how moderate, decent Muslims live. That bears no resemblance to the oppressive Islam of Iran. Fact check, Shadban.
