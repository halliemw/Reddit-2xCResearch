I'm not sure how reliable this is, but Susan Katz Miller runs a blog called [On Being Both](http://onbeingboth.wordpress.com); she was raised in an interfaith household (Jewish and Christian) and identifies as Jewish. She's now in an interfaith marriage herself, and has blogged for The Huffington Post as well.

She also has a book coming out in October this year. [Being Both: Embracing Two Religions in One Interfaith Family](http://www.amazon.ca/Being-Both-Embracing-Religions-Interfaith/dp/0807061166/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1400595749&sr=8-2&keywords=interfaith+relationships) looks like it might be useful. Everything I'm finding is targeted towards multiple faiths as opposed to believer and nonbeliever, but I would guess most advice would still apply.

I hope you and your SO can find a common ground. :)
