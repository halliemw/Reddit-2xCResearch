I know it's after the fact, but for anyone else reading this and wondering:

I've become a guru of removing blood stains because I have a feeding tube in my belly and the stoma seeps blood when irritated.

It's ok to let it sit even up to a week and dry before washing, (though if you're near a sink a cold water rinse before tossing dirty laundry won't hurt)! Before washing, place all soiled garments (moms and dads, this works on poo, pee, and vomit too) in a diluted cold water/hydrogen peroxide mix. Agitate lightly and let soak for up to an hour. Apply a paste of borax, dish soap (dawn is preferred by some but if I have a coupon, screw that), and water to any conspicuously stained areas and rub in gently. Throw everything in with your normal wash cycle (we use tide pods, but when broke I've used the dollar store brands) adding borax to the load per instructions on the box for the size of your washer/load. (Even on a front loader, put borax directly in with the clothing, not in the dispenser). We also put vinegar in the fabric softener dispenser, but stains should be gone by then so it's not necessary. We just have crappy hard water and vinegar is the only thing that keeps our laundry from feeling like steel wool.

I hope this helps someone.
