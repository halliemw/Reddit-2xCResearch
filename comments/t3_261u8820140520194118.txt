The neat thing about doing something fun and risky (pronounced risk-eh) is that you DID it.  You've done something most people will never do (and perhaps never should do).  You seemed to come out decently on the other side.  And now it's an exciting memory.  

Don't let sex/money/power ever be what "validates" you though.  Because you'll quickly fall in the trap of only validating others on those same qualities.  And many of those traits don't make for "good" people. 

I had a few (one held most high) love-of-my lifes come and go.  I don't miss them as much as I appreciate ever feeling that happy at all.  It's a lot more excitement and love than many people will ever get in their lives.  That's probably how you could look at it. 

The idea of writing about it could be fun too.  (and imagination is a little safer than re-trying the real thing)
