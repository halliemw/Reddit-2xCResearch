But there are no interchangeable accessories here, not as far as I can see. Did you even look at their website? [They go into detail of each figure](http://iamelemental.com/elements/). They certainly don't look like they are "dress-up" dolls to me. Besides, even if they are, so what? Are you afraid they won't be effective action figures because they also have changeable accessories?
