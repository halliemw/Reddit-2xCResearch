It's not nearly as painful as I thought it would be. I did try it on just my bikini line and while I had pretty good results, it was hard to get all of it because I'm very flabby and if you don't hold the skin very taut, it grabs you instead of the hair, which hurts a lot. I think doing your entire bikini area would take pretty high pain tolerance just because the skin is so sensitive.
