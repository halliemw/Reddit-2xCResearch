>I'm with someone and you've got 0 chance stranger.

I have to go with the original post and disagree on this. I don't think it indicates to the guy that he clearly has zero chance. It can be inferred as a mere roadblock to eventually getting to be with you. You're not available *this moment* but give it time ... Now if this is a one off encounter that might not be such a big deal but as another poster mentioned that in the age of social media this person could easily continue their pursuance of you via the internet not to mention in person if the encounter occurred at one of your regular haunts. In saying that, I don't think there is a simple solution to whether or not mentioning a boyfriend is the best course or potentially harmful as the original post suggests. An asshole can potentially ruin your night no matter what you tell him.
