I want to comment here because I would like to know that too! 

Also: have you tried youtube? There are many many many hair-tutorials on there, just look for somebody who has similar hair to you and see if they can teah you something. It's really great because you don't just get an abstract explaination, but you also can look ar what they are doing and rewing a hundred times, if you have to.
