My situation is almost nothing like your mom's except that I was in an emotionally abusive thing, but there is one suggestion I have for you that I advise you to hold above all others.

Make sure your mom knows you want to stay in communication with her and to be supportive with her. 

Abusers often pull off what they do by going out of their way to isolate the victim from outside contacts: friends, family, etc. Some of them do this by limiting access in a concrete way or by sewing doubt and distrust in the victim, but some are actually clever enough to do it by making the victim think they're not wanted or distrusted. That's what my abuser did to me. 

Realizing that my family loved me and wanted me around, even if they were the dysfunctional psychos my ex acted like they were, was part of what gave me the courage to get out. If my family hadn't made it clear that I was always welcome and they always wanted to hear from me, I would still be with the son of a bitch. 

SO make sure your mom knows that you want to hear from her, that you love her, etc. Subtly imply you'll help her as much as you actually plan to help her. I mean, don't promise a bed and then not give her a bed or anything, but accurately represent how much you're willing to help her in a subtle, non-specific way that doesn't suggest you want her to split from the abuser. "Hey, if you ever need to talk, I'm here" kinda stuff.

The other suggestions you're going to get, and what Lil Boots has said already, are fantastic, but you might save a life just by keeping the lines open. Remember that.
