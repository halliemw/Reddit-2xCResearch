>For one, I'm not saying they deserve to be left in the dark. I'm saying that they don't deserve to not be left in the dark.

That is a ridiculous distinction.

>I'm saying if they refuse to respond as these people did, then they're obviously not interested in discussing it any further.

That's where we completely disagree. I think that people like this are putting out a strawman to somebody who has studied the subject to try to engage with her and learn more about it. As a means of interaction. Not as a means of putting her in her place. 

You seem to have a pretty pessimistic outlook on people.
