I see it as sexist because the advertisers aren't saying, "We need to use emotion to relate to *people.*" They're saying, "We need to use emotion to relate to *women.*" To me this is in the same vein as the common sexist argument that women can't lead because they're ruled by their emotions.

The un-sexist approach would be, let's give women facts and numbers of how the GOP is protecting women's rights and issues, and for *everyone* let's try to be more personable with stories. But they are upfront saying they're using emotion to get to women.
