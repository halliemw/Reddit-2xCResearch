If you're afraid to tell your mother, you are not ready for marriage. IMO, you really need to live together first, get to know one another, get comfortable. Six months is nothing in a relationship--you're still in the honeymoon period. You're also both very young and very inexperienced in life. Even if you don't want to olive together first, continue the relationship for a couple of years. Learn each other's bad, annoying habits. Let him get to a point where he can support himself financially. Then think about getting married.
