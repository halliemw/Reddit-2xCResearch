We are talking about what the law should be.  As such, you can't depend upon relying on what the law already says to support your argument.

Given that, telling a 17 year old woman she isn't allowed to have sex with whomever she wants because you think it is bad for her to do so, and making a law based on it, is forcing your beliefs on her.  You are limiting what she is allowed to do because of your own beliefs.

Why is this allowed while saying she can't have an abortion isn't?  (And remember, we are talking about what the law should be, so don't depend upon what the law currently says, because what the law currently says is already forcing morals onto others.)
