I like this idea a lot! I'm now thinking the best option would be a searchable database of existing resources (some mentioned in this thread) that we could expand upon in the future, with the added option of requesting a fund be setup for you through the clinic you're visiting. So if there aren't any resources for you in your state, you could still get a hotel room and maybe bus fare from friendly redditors.
