I feel the same way reading other women's stories, there are some facebook groups I joined just for the sake of seeing them and offering support to women struggling with the decision.  I feel that if it can become less taboo to discuss it that maybe more of the true stories from women who don't regret their abortions can start to counteract the horrors of those sites where men make up fake horror stories to scare women into keeping a fetus that ultimately suffers for the decision.
