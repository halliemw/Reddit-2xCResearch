I live in a sorta small college town in the midwest.  It's pretty rare for me here, like, I can probably count the number of times I can remember being catcalled/honked at in my life here on one hand.  (Although strangely two of them have happened in the past couple weeks--once when I was getting on my scooter in the parking lot and once when I was weed-whacking along the side of the road.  Yay summer, I guess.)

However, I can say that it happened CONSTANTLY when I went on a study abroad trip and spent two week living in Lima, Peru.  Talk about culture shock.  I had extremely short hair and was looking pretty butch back then but I still got it all the time.  Didn't matter if I was alone (which was rare, because I didn't really feel comfortable walking alone there) or with a group of other girls; getting honked at/catcalled/whistled at/whatever was pretty much guaranteed to happen every time we went outside.  I also spent a week in Cusco and I don't remember it really happening there, maybe because Cusco is a lot more touristy/old-timey (or at least the parts I was in were).
