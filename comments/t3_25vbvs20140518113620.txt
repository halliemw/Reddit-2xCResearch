This probably isn't what you want to hear, but I think that dress is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. I would wear that dress if I was getting married and I'm very particular. On how to deal with your friend; I can't see myself being able to say that to someone I really care about, I think she should have handled it a bit better. Does she have any resentment towards you getting married? Either way, you found a dress that you felt beautiful in, there's no reason to let it be more than that. A dress is just a prop on your wedding day-I don't even think there's such a thing as a "perfect dress". I would say keep the dress, don't let it add to your stress!! You have other things to worry about and plan. I don't agree with your friend, and I would hope she has more tact in the future when giving you her opinion.
