Look, as a trans woman who feels the same way about "getting roles" in films, I would agree. However, it's VERY difficult to find the niche that we are looking for in this video. 

The casting call would be as follows: 

PROTAGONIST, 25-M, - A pretransition transgender woman. Must be pre-hormones, must be willing to out oneself in order to gain exposure. 

But then you have the "star status" aspect of it, too. Who do we really know who is out as trans who has not begun their medical transition yet?  And who in the community has the star status of Andrew Garfield? 

I feel like this parallels between this representation and the Avicii music video are very close. The lead actor in the Avicii music video is a cis man named Oscar Lindblad. Both were representations of "before" statuses and it was clear that the gender binary was supposed to be there as a symbol. It's hard to find a pretransition trans actress, especially a skilled one. It's a niche that only lands you drag queen or prostitute roles.
