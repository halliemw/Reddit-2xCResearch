Yeah of course I couldn't be angry if I didn't know but I still don't think it's fair to leave him in the dark.  Something can still be wrong objectively even if he's ignorant about it.  If she feels *unsafe* because of it, then she definitely should feel fine not too tell him, but otherwise I think she should.  Just because the woman is the one who gets pregnant, it doesn't mean he has no right to know she is pregnant with his embryo and potential future child.
