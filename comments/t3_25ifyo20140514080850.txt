Well you could say "because I just don't". If he insists then you can tell him you find him arrogant &amp;amp; no longer enjoy hanging out with him. You have a right to your experiences, and maybe that's something he should be aware of. That doesn't mean he's a terrible person, we all have flaws. What it means is you guys aren't a match. There may be another lady out there that loves hanging with him and loves his arrogance.  You ain't it, and that's ok. 

And then you leave. :) if he continues to persist (and especially if he follows you or keeps calling you when you've asked him to stop) then you got my permission to tell him to fuck off and die in a fire. Some folks need a sledgehammer to get a hint.
