Tough situation, all I can say is don't focus on trying to win. If you have a lot of the same friends you'll have a tough time avoiding him. Over time you'll care less what he does, and the more you can show it to him and your friends the better. I'd try to focus as little as possible on him, why would you want to work in the same place as him?
