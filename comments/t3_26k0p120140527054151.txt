To be fair, I've heard this excuse... buuuuut it's either for VERY small/limited gatherings (we're talking only a handful of family/friends invited at all), or if the person isn't in a serious relationship. Usually meaning - please don't just show up with a date you met two weeks ago that'll cost us $300/plate.

Even if they're not married, but they'd been together for 6 years and had a kid - they'd pass the second test.

The first one is a little unusual, but not unheard of (especially if neither the bride nor groom know the SO at all).

It's pretty odd to me this has happened more than once though.
