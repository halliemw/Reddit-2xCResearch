So, I think that if you're sleeping with him, you should be able to sit down and have a serious talk with him. There's a best case and worst case scenario here.  Either way, here's what I suggest. 

Pick a time when you're both calm and calmly explain to him why him taking photos of you like that without permission is not okay with you.  Be clear. Say, precisely "I did not want you to take those photos of me. I did not give you permission to do so, and it is not okay with me for you to have or take pictures of me naked or in a state of undress." Explain to him what your discomfort is, or anything else. Use "I" statements, be nice, be whatever else you have to, but make sure you get those two sentences out. 

And record the whole thing on your phone (check to see if your state is a [one party consent state first\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_recording_laws). If it's legal, turn on your phone and record the conversation and make sure you state, clearly those words. 

If you ever find out that he took and posted photos of you, you can most likely sue his ass off for invasion of privacy and/or disclosure of private facts. A voice recording will make the lawyer's case much easier and you'll probably get legal fees in whatever settlement you get. 

Please note that I am not a lawyer and this does not constitute legal advice. But I would strongly recommend, if it's legal, to get a recording of thatâ€”for your own insurance.
