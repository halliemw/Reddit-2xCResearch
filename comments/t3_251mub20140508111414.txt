Heh, I like that I come off as knowledgeable. It makes me happy. :)

It's never wrong to critique an ideology, especially not when you also lay out well-thought-out reasons for it. Equally, shutting down discussion with the response "Criticism is sexist" is wrong and accomplishes nothing for anyone. That said, I can address your concerns about feminism, if you'd like. I'm not out to convert people, but it is a movement that has a definition - generally, anyway, it means different things to different people, as any movement does - and zealotry is far from the norm. I think we are always very quick to judge a movement by its extremes, especially when that movement is in some way challenging our societal or personal beliefs, and so it's understandable that people associate feminism with crazy people yelling about chopping off penises and what have you. But it's also entirely inaccurate and harmful. As this thread points out, we really are dreadfully sane people who are in favour of equality for everyone, and I doubt that few if any of us are particularly radical about it. 

Feminism is about gender equality, no worries. It's never wrong to critique aspects of it and decide if it's something you're in favour of, but criticism should always be thought out and based on what's there rather than a perception of what's there.
