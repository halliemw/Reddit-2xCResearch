A 25-year-old woman doesn't "run away from home." A 25-year-old woman moves on to start her own life, and there are many ways to do this. 

I think you should formulate a sustainable plan, whether that means taking a second job to increase income, or finding a viable roommate situation, or doing what you can to improve your earning power at your current place of employment. Your local domestic violence center may have a list of helpful resources for people like yourself who want to move on but have no real idea how to. Give yourself a target moving date and do whatever it takes to make that happen.

At the same time, you'll have to come to grips with whatever makes you hesitant to leave your parents' home - whether it's concern about your mother, or the relative financial ease, or just plain fear. Whatever it is, figure it out and place your eyes unswervingly on the future you want. Then go get it.
