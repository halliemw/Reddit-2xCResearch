> We are truly happy together

No you aren't. You have happy moments, and other moments where he hurts you immensely by saying these things. Even the worst abusive relationships have their 'we are so happy' moments.

The fact that he knows this hurts you and he continues to do it is something you need to think long and hard about. If you knew jokingly telling him he was fat or his penis is small would upset him and wreck his self-esteem, would you continue to do it? No, you wouldn't, because that would be cruel. So why are you giving him a pass on this and making it the 'I'm so happy, except for....' in your relationship?

No relationship is perfect, but the 'except for...' should never be a huge red flag for abuse. I have an incredibly happy marriage 'except for' the fact that my husband pulls clothes out and leaves them on top of the dryer and it drives me bananas. When your 'except for...' is such a bad thing that you have to make up a throwaway to even ask the question, it's time to take a very honest look at whether or not you want to be treated this way for the rest of your life.

(Hint: you don't.)
