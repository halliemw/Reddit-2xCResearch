i had a similar job to this. only i despised the job more than i've ever despised anything in my life. it wasn't the bosses or anything, it was all the bitchy cliquey passive-aggressive divorced bitter hags i worked with. they made my life miserable and i don't think they had any semblance of a heart to realize this. i was nice to them, but i kept to myself mostly. when i spoke to any of them, they would roll their eyes or talk down to me like i was a child. or they would tattle on me saying that "omfgjanne asked a question that she asked yesterday, she didn't write down the answer." really...? i was 26 at the time and would cry in the bathroom over my breaks. this should not happen. 

fortunately i got laid off. best day of my life. 

anyway, my story isn't helping your situation, i agree with what fakemoose said. at my awful job i sort of "opened up" to one woman eventually. she was a real person (read: not fake cliquey bitch) and we became office friends, we shared the misery of that job. i bet if you talk to any of them one-on-one, that "clique" mentality won't be there as much and you can end up making friends, or at least office friends.
