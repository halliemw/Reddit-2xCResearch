Well, yeah. I didn't mean that you should call 15 year olds, women. Maybe ladies would be better. Unfortunately, I think it might depends on where you're living. I'm just guessing here, but I think that in the American south, "ladies" might be best, but that on the west coast, "women" might go over better. It's unfortunate that it's not a simple subject. It seems odd that it can be so complicated. 

I agree with you that many "girls" don't like to be called women. I think that in conversation that makes a lot of sense. It rarely comes off as isnsensitve, unless it is in a work environment. But in text, especially on reddit, (where there is a sort of anti women vibe), it comes off as weird and vaguely "othering".
