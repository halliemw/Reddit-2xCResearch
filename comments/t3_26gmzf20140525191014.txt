Hypothetical question: You're playing a game, and someone plays dirty and hurts you in the process. And they Continue to cheat. You have the power to tell the referee and stop it, but you don't. You're the dumb ass for letting it continue, does that make a aggressor innocent? Nope, they're an asshole still, but they get away with it because you're to spineless to act.
