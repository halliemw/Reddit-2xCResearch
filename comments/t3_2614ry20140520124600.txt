Great article.  It sort of states the obvious in a way (or at least what I suspected all along), but it's refreshing.  More important I think, is that it tells us that there is hope for the future, as the participation of women in the field grows and more and more women will join.  A great thing that communities and schools could do regarding that is to attempt to host women working in STEM as guest speakers more often.
