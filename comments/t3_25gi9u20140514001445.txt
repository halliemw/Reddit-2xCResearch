The article or the comment?

It's obviously understandable if you literally can't breastfeed. Having HIV, being on certain meds, etc, don't fucking endanger your baby just to do what's best, because in that case it isn't. However, I have a friend who chose formula because her boyfriend didn't want anyone else touching her boobs. That's a shitty reason to deny your baby all the benefits of breastmilk.
