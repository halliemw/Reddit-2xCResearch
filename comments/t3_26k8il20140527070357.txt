Is your goal to look good - yes - pick a flattering style

Is your goal to have fun - yes - pick whatever style strikes your fancy and is comfortable

The message to me is not just about empowerment, it's about realizing that women are not automatically public decoration. You can choose all the flattering cuts you like, if you are a certain weight or shape you will simply not be generally considered hot. The message is - even if that happens, you should not feel pressured to not wear a bikini. As a woman you should feel confortable in wearing something unflattering for whatever reason.
