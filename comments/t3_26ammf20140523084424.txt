Honestly I'm probably going to come off as offensive and I'm so sorry but a lot of special needs people know exactly what they are doing if it's something wrong, I have had a sexual assault experience with a special needs person. Everyone would always enable him touching girls inappropriately. 

In your case he may not actually know what he's doing wrong because people were laughing. Someone needs to tell him what he did wrong and why it was wrong. Or he may know that it's wrong to touch someone like that but he still does it because he knows he can get away with it. 

I wouldn't go as far as reporting it, but that's just what I would do if I were in your place.
