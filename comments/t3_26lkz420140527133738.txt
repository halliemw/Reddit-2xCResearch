Drymax Socks. I snowboard and even after a full day of wet sloshy conditions, these things have saved my feet more than once. Fairly light too and perfect for summer, just a little pricey. (NOTE: I only wear these for a winter sport because of the moisture wicking awesomeness! Yes, my feet get cold but I live with it)
