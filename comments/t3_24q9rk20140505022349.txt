I agree with this entirely.  If I'm approached by a woman, and though seldom it does happen, I always say "I have a girlfriend."  Am I succumbing to feminism by saying so?  What would be the equivalent opposite to patriarchy?  Does that discredit me as a person?  Should I just say I'm not interested?  I feel like that's more hurtful to the person, and that being honest with my current life situation makes more sense in a situation requiring it.

If I'm married, do I say something besides "I'm married?"  I don't get the argument, saying something factual like "I have a boyfriend" is not, in my opinion, glorifying the patriarchy.  Hell, I think that's a shit argument, all things considered.
