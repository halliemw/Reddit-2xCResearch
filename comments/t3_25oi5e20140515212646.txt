You sound really aware of the specific issues they have, and that's the best way to avoid becoming like that. You can slip sometimes, especially when you're angry, but if you make a conscious effort to communicate/never stonewall/not use other people in your arguments, you'll be able to do it. I believe in you!

Also, talking to your SO about this might help you, if you haven't already.
