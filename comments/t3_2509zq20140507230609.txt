this exactly. I hope people just hold on a second or two. /r/gaming had a bad deal not too long ago about some mod removing a post that only showed a pc because of whatever reason. For almost 3 days straight, the sub was full of nothing but pc gaming posts. Like, it was pretty damn impressive how many there were. It was like a flood. Like that scene in 300 when you see the Persian army for the first time. It was wild. Eventually everything went back to normal and people moved on.
