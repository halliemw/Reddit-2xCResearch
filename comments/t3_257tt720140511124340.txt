First off - FUCK CANCER!

Yes do get your yearly pap, even when they tell you ever 3 years.  It is so important!

I am happy to hear that you are doing very well after your hysterectomy!  I replied to your original post, but I too have had a hysterectomy - at 29.
(Reason - Severe Endometreosis - total laparoscopic hysterectomy with removal of uterus, both fallopian tubes and left ovary that had an 8cm cyst attached to it.  All that remains is my right ovary so I do not have to take hormone add-back therapy.)

My choice to have this done was the drug regimen I was on (IUD with combination of Norethindrone) did not help me.  I tried every drug combo I could, and nothing worked.  I was also very fearful of the effects from long term use (cancer).  

You are going to feel different than you did before. I wish I had someone to tell me these things.  So I will let you know what I am now dealing with.  You can feel your bladder when it is full.  You get gassy. You are already healing very fast!  This is wonderful to hear!  You will get fatigued, at least the first few weeks. You do lose more weight as time goes on too!  Not just from the radiation you are about to go through.

Please do enjoy your life!  I wish the best for you, and I really do hope for you to beat this cancer cold in its tracks.
