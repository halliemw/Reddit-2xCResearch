Though I had the same inclination as you to say these things, do you not see the irony in your post that she get a fitness/nutrition lecture? I mean, I agree, she probably isn't doing things right, but right away, a lecture. Also, I'm sure you're not trying to do it to be mean or condescending or anything like that, you're probably trying to help. 

Kind of interesting.
