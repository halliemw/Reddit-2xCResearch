>**XY here; am I allowed to post?**  

>All are welcome.  It's not really about who you are, but about the quality of the discussion you'll generate.  Absolutely feel free to comment.  You should probably refrain from posting pictures of yourself and asking whether you're attractive. 

>Any question written by a dude that starts with "Ladies of Reddit..."  are welcome to post in the [ relationship community,](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships+dating_advice+breakups+ihaveissues+relationship_tips/new)[ relationship_advice](/r/relationship_advice/about/sidebar) [askwomen](/r/askwomen/about/sidebar), or [AskFeminists](/r/AskFeminists/about/sidebar)

>Please refrain from starting every comment here with "As a man" or similar. If it is really and truly relevant then by all means mention it, but remember we ladies don't mention that we're women on the rest of the site unless it matters. Just as we're often assumed to be men outside of 2xc and related communities you might be assumed to be a women here. And that's okay! All that matters is that we talk openly with each other.

>Please also refrain from telling us what turns you on in most threads here, it's almost never relevant to the discussion. There are times when it *might* be, but please think long and hard (tee hee!) if this is one of those times before sharing that information.
