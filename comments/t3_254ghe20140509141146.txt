On the flip side, I am getting sick of going for a hair cut and never getting it as short as I want it. I got it cut today, showed her a picture of a style I liked (mentioned the length specifically) and showed her on myself where I wanted it (just below the nape). She cut it shoulder length and started blowdrying. I had to stop her and tell her I wanted it shorter, then she was mad because she had already cut layers and had to redo it. But if she had cut it where I wanted to begin with (or stopped and asked how the length was before doing layers!) we wouldn't be in that situation.
