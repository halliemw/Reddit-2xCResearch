Is anyone here in perimenopause?  If not, brace yasselfs, ladies.

There is a hormone you produce and every month, that hormone signals to your uterine lining, "Hey!  Thick enough.   Stop."

A few days later, with no implantation of a fertilized egg, all that uterine lining sloughs off.

When you are in perimenopause, that hormone level fluctuates wildly and sometimes you have NONE of it, which means your uterus keeps happily thickening up and packing on more layers of red cooter putty to the uterine wall.

When you finally DO have a period...you experience "flooding".   

There is nothing quite so satisfying as bearing down in the shower and watching liver slabs the size of a New York Strip steak splash on the floor.   

I always feel a quart low after my period these days...the saving grace is that the time in between them is lengthening as I approach 50.
