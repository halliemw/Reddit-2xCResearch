I thought men had dicks like small pencils until I was around 13. I couldnt imagine anything larger "fitting". 


Oh, and a lot of women Ive met think all men dislike having their balls and/or nipples touched, that it doesnt do anything at all and only women have erogenous zones except the gentials. Its a matter of preference.
