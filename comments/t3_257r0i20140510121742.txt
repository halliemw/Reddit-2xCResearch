I got this with my second implant (though strangely not my first). I went to the GP and was prescribed another BC called Cerazette (a progesterone only pill) to take which has eliminated the spotting entirely. 

If you go and talk to your GP they will talk through your options with you and probably suggest taking the pill to regulate your cycles. The type of pill will depend on your medical history (I take progesterone only as I am unable to have pills containing oestrogen), but don't worry about not being super reliable when it comes to taking them (I'm sure as hell not, hence the implant). They don't affect your protection, they just control the bleeding, so you'll still be protected even if you forget to take one. 

Hope that helps.
