It is very normal for practitioners to "tuck" the strings behind the cervix after we place the IUD. We do this so they do not stick into the vagina too far and therefore are hopefully less bothersome to both the patient and any partner. Once someone visualizes the strings (using a speculum), ask if you can feel the strings in the office so you know what you are looking for. Sometimes it is helpful to try to feel them when sitting on the toilet as this can make it easier to feel your cervix.
