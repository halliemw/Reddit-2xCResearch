It is very simple as to why it is humorous; it is because the portrayal does not fit that societies cultural perception of mainstream "sexy" . In the societies where these things are portrayed, it is feminine to act the way that these actors do, therefore humorous because of the conflicting image of what is meant to be portrayed. It would be the same reaction as a non muscular woman flexing on the cover of a body building magazine; muscles are associated with men (for obvious reasons) and seeing a non muscular woman on a media form which is clearly meant to be portrayed by a male to emphasize a trait associated with masculinity would cause cognitive dissonance and be seen as so absurd and opposite from mainstream polarity that it would be seen as satire, which in reality, is what these gender reversed examples truly are, as a true gender role reversal would result in the same scenario, but played out differently.

To cite an example, the first part they showed in the video of your first link is satire because the man was in the same feminine pose to portray his "sexiness", rather than exuding his sexiness in a more masculine way, hence why it is satire rather than an example of true gender role reversal.

So you see, it's really simple, isn't it?
