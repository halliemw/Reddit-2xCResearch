Becoming a default has thrown TwoX into the limelight. I wouldn't be reading any of this if not for that fact. 

SO PLEASE DON'T LET THE HARASSERS SILENCE YOU! 
-Though I'm not in your position, and so I can't say what I would ultimately do. Make you own choice.-

But..
The negative energy thrown your way by men that only want to speak may be turned into a positive force directed at the men who are willing to learn and listen.

If many of the people that post here are driven away by asshats, then this place becomes pointless. No discussion will take place. The value of TwoX diminishes, and the haters win.
