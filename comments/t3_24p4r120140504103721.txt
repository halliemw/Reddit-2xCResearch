Start small! Just try eating smaller portions, try going for walks, build up some endurance. It is hard work, I won't lie to you. But one of the biggest things I found helped me the most was to make a list of things you need to do to be healthier, then tackle them one at a time. It will take time, but don't get discouraged. Take monthly progress pics and measurements (not just scale, but waist too!). 

You can do it! It will require patience and time, but it is possible! 

Edit: also, join communities like r/xxfitness and r/loseit because they are fantastic resources for you at every stage of your journey :)
