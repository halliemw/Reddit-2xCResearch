Sexism on the customers part undeniably, but it's difficult to say whether the management was also sexist or if they were just following the typical customers always right employees are disposable mindset of the low wage corporate world.  Reprehensible either way, and possibly grounds for a suit.  Can employers knowingly allow the harassment of their employees by their customers?  Obviously they can get away with it, but is it legal?
