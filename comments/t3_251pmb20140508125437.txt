Also, it's interesting that the same basic toy is often gendered, e.g. A motorized flying machine is marketed as an army chopper for boys and as a winged fairy for girls.  

The worst offender for me in toys marketed to young girls is the Bratz toy line, which even has babies wearing thongs. There are all sorts of reasons related to race as well that it's a horrible concept.
