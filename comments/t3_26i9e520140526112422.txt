The school district kept him as a teacher for a couple years after I was there. It sucks feeling like your entire community that you grew up in betrayed you. 

Googling him is actually something that I do on a fairly regular basis. Whenever I have a nightmare or experience a trigger and I'm upset I desperately try to find him to no avail. I think that if I did finally find where he resides, it would give me some peace of mind.
