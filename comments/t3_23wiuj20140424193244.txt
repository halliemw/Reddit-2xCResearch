I'm the only girl in my department at a digital print shop. I run the giant presses that print big Nike banners etc. Being around only dudes is fine for me, I have a pretty morbid and dirty sense of humor that fits in well with dudes but sometimes it feels like they think I'm an invader or I can't hack it, when I've worked there for over a year. Clearly, I can and do. Just feels like a dudes club a lot. I just do better work than them and it seems to shut em up for a bit.
