Thank you so much for the details on fitting! It's good to know the Diva cup might be too long.

I've read some good reviews of the Yuuki, and it looks like their small one is pretty short without being overly narrow. They're cheap on Amazon, too, so even if it's the wrong size, I'm not out too much money. I should be able to compare it to others on the chart (which is AWESOME by the way!) and find one with the perfect fit.
