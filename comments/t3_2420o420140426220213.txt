I think I avoided GG to begin with because I have no sisters (3 brothers) and I'm not close with my mother. I was worried it would make me sad to not have that mother/daughter connection- but as I get older I think I'll try it.
And I love me a good guilty pleasure teen drama. I just finished Gossip Girl a few months ago and it was all juice, no (real) substance.

Hahaha, so true!
