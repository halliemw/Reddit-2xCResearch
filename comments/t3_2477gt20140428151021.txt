> There isn't much that can be done in most cases

This is true, the boyfriend probably could've worded it better, but giving the cat away would likely be the best solution. The example of communication the OP gives just sounds like 'average level communication' that's been aggravated by OP's sleep depreivation and the bf's defensiveness, both of which are understandable in the circumstances. Perhaps there are much more serious examples than the one above, but in any long term relationship you will have to deal with annoying issues like this occasionally. Part of 'good communication' is being aware of your own, and your partner's emotional state so you can discuss things at an appropriate time. I feel like this situation would've gone down a lot better after OP had chance to have a good nights sleep.
