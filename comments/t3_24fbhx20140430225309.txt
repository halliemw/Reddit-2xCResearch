Wow, I'm honestly sorry to hear that.
I hope she realizes how awful she was to you.

However, if she doesn't, please don't just let her scream at you. Some people truly don't get why it's bad to treat others so badly and will continue if you let them. I really hope she isn't like this, but if she does, your best option would be to hang up/walk away. It might help get your point across that you will not let her do that to you.
