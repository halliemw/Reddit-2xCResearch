I'm a stay at home father with a  daughter and there's non-gender specific toys that do the exact same thing but with better quality and  less restrictive peg type set-ups.

[The Melissa and Doug Magnetic Switch and Spin Gear Board](http://www.cooltoysfortots.ca/assets/images/3745a.jpg) is what we use.


The fact that Goldie-Blox was gendered so much seemed antithetical to the goal....
