It takes practice for both of you! At first for me, it was just something... odd that I tolerated because my husband wanted to do it, to bring me pleasure. 

Practice for him to read your non verbal cues and really find out how to press your buttons using nothing but his mouth. I wiggle, I squirm, sometimes i get frantic. It took a while for my husband to figure out which type of wiggles and squirms were because I LIKED it, and which ones were me trying to get away because it was unpleasant. 

Practice for you to learn the new sensations, and create those new brain pathways. Then you have to figure out what was GOOD, what part was EXCELLENT, and which part was merely ok and go from there!
