To my parents: "When you barely acknowledge my accomplishments, it makes me feel unloved."

To my sister: "When you won't listen to what I'm saying, it makes me feel frustrated."

To my friends: "When you spend time with me, it makes me feel so much happier and less alone in the world."

Frankly, I'm forced to spend too much time alone. Either no one's there to listen to what I have to say, or they just ignore me, and it makes me incredibly sad and angry. I'm not the most emotionally stable person, and sometimes I just need someone to talk to, but right now, I don't really have anyone. My friends are either finishing up exams or already home with their parents, and my family members aren't around. I don't like being alone like this.
