Did you read your own source?

Quote from the article: "Carothers, who completed the research as part of her doctoral dissertation at the University of Rochester, and her colleagues *are not denying that men and women often do differ from one another.*"

My point still stands.

EDIT:

Also:

"But researchers haven't spent much time examining the structure of these differences, Carothers wrote."

I was talking about structure as well. Structurally, the male and female brains are vastly different. This article does not even look at the structural differences.

EDIT2: The amount of scientific illiteracy in this thread is astonishing.
