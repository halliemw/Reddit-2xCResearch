At 45yo after 3 babies I'm thrilled I've done my kegels and have strong lady muscles still, I have no real discernable wrinkles (yet) and due to a nasty case of IBS-D, I weigh the same I did in high school.

Conversely, I'm none too thrilled that my hair is falling out in gobs and it's very thin now. Also, some areas of my skin feel...crepe-like to me and that's icky, my period cramps are exactly the same but now it's somewhat irregular and I always seem to stop for a day or so and then get a bonus day tacked on out of the blue! grrr  

One thing I'm hating; I have these irritating Sebaceous cysts showing up, now. Years ago, I had one that turned to a bump on my eyelid. Now, I get one or two around my eyes that I have to deal with and I now have literally 20-30 showing up in...a most...delicate area that is mortifying to me. :sigh:
