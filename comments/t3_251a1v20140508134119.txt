They definitely need to find a way to make sure that minimum wage is changed to deal with the current economic situation. 
Although I think if they also tried to work with massive employers like Walmart and work out a scheme where people are paid a living wage but still keep the minimum wage as a country wide instead of state wide level for smaller companies to use it could be of much more use than the current system. 
This wouldn't just benefit all the people who work at Walmart, it would also benefit the small companies as they would be able to keep all their current employees in a job due to costs not being increased too much.
