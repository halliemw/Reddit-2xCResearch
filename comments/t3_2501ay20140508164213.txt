>Both are legal

False. I can't speak for elsewhere, but in the US, recording a conversation when only one party of the conversation knows you are recording is legal in 38 states. Taking a photograph of someone nude in private is illegal in most; and specifically disclosing it without their consent is illegal everywhere in the US.

Our word choice has power over how we think of things. Trying to abstract back until you can vaguely use the same phrase to describe these is attempting to leverage the moral outrage of a peep shot with recording a disclosure for legal evidence. If you want to explain why the latter is bad, please do it without trying to slop moral opinions across boundaries. It's just bad communication.
