This is not about anything being wrong with how you look.  This is about falling for his fantasy of what you represented, not who you are.  Falling in love, so to speak, without ever meeting someone has some pretty big risks. One of those risks is having no physical chemistry in person.  The fact that this went as far as it did (L word and sex) is unfortunate, but is all too common.   You are a perfect for someone, probably multiple someones, as a full package.  I am a proponent of meeting someone in person early.  Chemistry in person is important, you guys didn't have it.  Being a good emotional match but a bad physical one is a tough pill to swallow, especially after a relationship has gotten serious.  Out of billions of people on earth you now know one is all wrong for you.  Not your fault.  If you respect yourself, learn from this, and get back out there you will find a good person who finds you attractive on all levels.
