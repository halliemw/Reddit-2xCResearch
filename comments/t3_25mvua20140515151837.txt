I'm a biologist, and some of what I do overlaps with cancer research. I would LOVE for full-genome testing, or at least thorough SNP analysis to be covered by insurance and considered a routine procedure. We have some very real ethical considerations to work out first, but it seems strange to have all this information available and not use it.

EDIT: Also, I think it was great that Angelina Jolie was public about her medical decision. It's "raising awareness for breast cancer" in the best sense possible. That a woman revered for her sexual attractiveness can do this and still be considered attractive and womanly is amazing. Great example of using celebrity for good.
