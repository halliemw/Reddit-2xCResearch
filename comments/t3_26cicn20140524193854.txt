I hadn't heard of engagement photos until very recently (I know, I know)... but now I see them everywhere. I could never get my boyfriend to do some kind of cheesy photoshoot at a barn during sunset with silly props. I love your photo! It's all about the love and just feels so authentic. Good luck to the two of you!
