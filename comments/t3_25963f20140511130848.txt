same here - I hate when people tell me to calm down!  When someone does that to me I say "hey, look, I'm just trying to tell a story and I get excited.  This is who I am.  If you don't like how I tell stories, that's fine but please let me finish and we can talk about it at a more appropriate time." It usually does the trick and if it doesn't, they're the one who ends up looking like a jerk.

Most people LOVE how animated/excited/energetic I am - it's my personality and is what draws some people to me.  SOme people are bothered by it or hear the excitement and think it means I'm upset or bothered by something.  That's their problem not mine (or yours).
