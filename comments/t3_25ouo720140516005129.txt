Personally, I think it's easy to look at the world and hate it. Hate the expectations. Hate how cruel and ignorant society can be.. But is's also easy to forget that sexism happens to guys too. It's easy to forget that the world kind of sucks equally, if in different ways for most everybody. I know that's not comforting, but life sucks.

At the same time, though, I think because life sucks for everybody in some way shape or form, we have to look for the best. Life is just as wonderful as it is terrible. It's not that hard to find joy, though, once you learn to love yourself and who you are. 

At first, it's like forcing yourself to smile. It feels weird and you have to focus, but then you find yourself doing it more often and more naturally. Once you start looking, it's easy to see the positive. To dwell in the good that you see and let that light your life. When you dwell in the negative, it's easy to forget about the person who treated you kindly or the random act of love you saw between two people earlier in the day... Especially when you hear the stories on the news.  but if you remind your eyes and soul to taste the sweetness in life, it gets easier. Basically, you have to make a conscious decision to change how you feel about life. Once you do and once you practice, it'll come.

As much as life can make you feel like the world is against you or your gender, you just kind of have to stay soft. Don't let the world harden you. If you spend time reveling in the good, the laughs, time spent with friends,  the good reads, etc., it's easy to love. You are in charge of your happiness. Go get it :)
