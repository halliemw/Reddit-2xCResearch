Without agreeing or disagreeing with you: this is one of those topics where very precise grammatical structures are required. What do "it", "sexist" and "wrong" mean here?

Again, I do not agree or disagree with you, just a difficult topic to precisely communicate about.

edit: on the same note, "have to" also kind of warrants a more precise definition I think, but less so than the above terms.
