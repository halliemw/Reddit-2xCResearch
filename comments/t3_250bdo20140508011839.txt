Yes I get massive bloating. My only hope is to eat very small amounts. That way it doesn't feel like it effects me. I can't seem to narrow down what foods cause it and what don't. It seems like every food does, and that it is the amount I consume that determines the size. A regular bowel movement helps to get rid of it faster, but nothing I have done seems to actually prevent it happening.
