Seriously, the more I read her replies the more I am impressed! I had difficulty making friends when I was moved across the country from California to Ohio my sophomore year (my grandparents moved back there to buy my maternal great grandpa's house/farm since he was too physically ill to stay there. Everyone wanted the house to stay in the family), and my mom made special days like that for us every week. I always looked forward to it since the kids at my new school were mostly really conservative and we just didn't mesh. I did make a best friend and some others within the first couple months of moving (non conservative ones who were mostly transplants as well), but she and they got distant for part of my junior year because some people thought I was too weird and uncool or some bullshit. We ended up figuring out that one girl just felt threatened by me-she wanted to be the "original, artsy, indie music girl" in our grade, but she was really extremely conventional in every way. She got pissed when I won "most original" for senior superlatives the next year. High school is stupid sometimes, right? I'm glad to be a decade past. Anyway, they all apologized for sort of ditching me by our senior year, but my mom and I continued our once a week ritual, it was great. Teenagers typically aren't embarrassed to hang out with their parents like you see in the movies all the frickin' time, they want parent time as well as friend time!

 edit:  I'm happily back on the west coat in Seattle and have been for a couple years :D Also corrected grammar & paternal to maternal.
