time to whip out one of my favorite quotes: "Sometimes I wish I was a woman, just so that I could have an abortion." - John Waters, what a fabulous cad, eh?

seriously, though: selection bias. if you were to go on a gun rights forum and start talking about how no one should own a gun because of your own personal belief that they're immoral, then I'd assume you'd be downvoted. 

similarly, if you go onto the forum of a group of people singularly affected by a parasite (however cute it is) to give them advice that amounts to "this parasite has more rights to your body than you do" then you're likely going to get some push back.

it's a private medical procedure; another person's beliefs are irrelevant. and that's the that of it.
