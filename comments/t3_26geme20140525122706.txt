When our good, solid friends speak up about something it's because they notice something's up, because they care and want to help. The phrase is echoing because I'm guessing that this is something you've been avoiding dealing with for a while now and when someone else brought it up you couldn't escape it, push it to the side or rationalize it. You are forced to look at what ever is making you feel this way, which as a result has made you gain weight I'm guessing you don't want. 

I'm dealing with this right now OP. I've gained 30 pounds, stopped doing my hair and make up as nicely as I used to and stopped wearing my contacts. I've done all of this for various reasons but none of them are positive. If your bodily change makes you happy (which it doesn't due to your reaction) then you wouldn't be feeling this way. 

Go hang out with them again and talk to both of them when you're alone with the them. They obviously care for you and it might make you feel better to admit how caught off guard you were by the statement.
