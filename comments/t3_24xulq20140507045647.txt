I was a virgin before I met my boyfriend (who had 2 partners before me) but I am more 'sex positive' in the sense where I've watched/read more than my boyfriend had done, so things are interesting in the bedroom.

I don't crave for anal play but when it's done to me I'm fine with it for a period of time. My boyfriend really enjoys it when I perform it on him (fingering and tonguing) so when he asks for it, I comply because it turns me on to see him so undone. I'm glad I've allowed him to discover another side of himself as he's never done anything like that previously - and I find it amusingly ironic that the only 'virgin' he slept with turned out to be the most adventurous.
