Thank you for your response! I feel like a need a therapist who will explain stuff in this manner. I have a very scientific mind, which is why this is so frustrating, because I just don't understand whats happening in my brain. Maybe I need someone to say "Look, you have *xyz* disorder happening in your brain right now, the best suggested course of action is *xyz*" I'm just weird like that.
