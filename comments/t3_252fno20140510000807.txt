My first link goes to the murderer example.

I may have made some additional edits since your reply, for it includes "a lookup" (the skepdic link), a reference to an understanding of ad hominem I'd endorse which also points to conflation of calling into question the reliability of testimony (about facts in the world) in virtue of characteristics about a witness and an ad hominem fallacy (which goes to arguments, "reasons" in the language of the entry, that a person may make). A conflation you might be making.

I mean I'm inviting you to demonstrate you know what it is (and that therefore, by contrast, I don't know what it is). Otherwise your assertion that you do know what it is will remain incredible.
