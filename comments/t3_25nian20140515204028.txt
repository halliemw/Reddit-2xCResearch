Hmm. Well, one of my values is compassion, and part of that is seeing the value in people who may be contending with difficult circumstances like mentally ill parents. Maybe even helping them, if both people are open to it. I shudder to think of parents who might not have let my father, who had been shuttled around between shitty apartments and terrifying foster families for years, play with their kids in elementary school because his mother was a drug addict with borderline personality disorder. He had enough trouble making friends as it was, and incidentally, he's done just fine for himself, although for some reason he still has issues with fear of abandonment.
