I think the relationship has gotten worse over the years. I think as I got older and started thinking for myself, I found myself not sharing the same conservative ideals and values as her. Of course, she denounces my personal plans for the future, like living on my own before marriage and not having children (decisions I've been leaning towards since growing up in this suffocating environment) and tells me to "stop being stupid". I feel as though when she had children, she had this perfect plan of how we'd grow up, and who we'd become, and when we'd get married, and having grandchildren...that she doesn't accept that I have my own life and desires that won't necessarily match hers. So, this makes her upset, and sometimes chalks it up to being a bad mother in order to make me feel guilty. Other times, she just gets angry. I don't really talk to her about my future plans anymore.

We used to be close, but I realized in high school that I was sick of being oppressed. I never saw my friends outside school. If I wanted to go outside to ride my bike, I couldn't bike past our street. My best friend happened to be a male, so I was constantly and repeatedly pressured by my mother to stop all contact with him. Of course I didn't, and I'm still under fire for that. 

Going to college, having my own car has helped lead my own life and start doing things I want to do...but it's such a secretive life, that I can't even talk to my own mom about. It's exhausting to lie and hide what I'm doing all day or where I've been to try to keep the peace in our relationship. 

The relationship between my mom and I has developed into a sort of "small talk only" thing. I can't talk to her about my dreams and aspirations and goals, or even the truth about what I did that day, because they don't fit into her idea of what her daughter should be like.
