Oh man, it's so weird how it sneaks up on you sometimes.  I would get PMS big time.

I have a really bad day and be overly emotional  and think, "WHATS WRONG WITH ME, WHY DOES MY LIFE SUCK SO HARD, I WANT TO DIE." And then, next day, I'll realize my period started.  And I'm just like, "Oh. That explains a lot."

I know it's not very helpful to you now, but the right kind of birth control could help. Some of them made me feel worse, but then I got an IUD a few years ago and my periods stopped completely.  Not saying it's for everyone, but I love it. :)
