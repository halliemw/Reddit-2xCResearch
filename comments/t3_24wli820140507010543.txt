> Black Milk attempted to post a few different apologies (one is shown in the article)

Wait, what? The comments from the company shown in the article were explicitly saying that they *weren't* going to apologize. 

But thanks for posting the salon link, which appears to be a complete 180 from what they were saying in the earlier quotes.
