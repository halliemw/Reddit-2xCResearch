Ah! Thank you for this! I didn't know about this website, it looks like a lot of fun. 

About the BF... it seems to be a communication issue. I like to be alone sometimes, and I love listening to music, but if I were to wander off with my headphones he thinks I'm mad. We usually do the walks in the park together because we need to be more active together, as well as apart. But I will certainly take your suggestion into consideration :)
