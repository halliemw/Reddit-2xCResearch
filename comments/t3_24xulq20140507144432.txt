Ehmmmmm I don't think there's a lot to *overcome* if you don't like tonguing chocolate starfish. Talk to him about it for sure, and tell him it's something you really don't enjoy... Stress that it feels completely unsexy for you and just let him know it's something you don't wanna do. 

If he is super adamant about butt stuff, I would offer to try something with toys or digits!
