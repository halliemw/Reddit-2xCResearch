It is damaging. No if ands or buts about it. Even with a normal baby and a normal delivery, your life as you knew it is changed for good. 


I wouldn't change having my kids for anything. They mean the world to me. They are always a great source of joy. They have changed me and my life in so many ways, I coulnd't even begin to describe. It's a wonderful amazing thing. I'm honored to be their Mom.

I just wish they could both be healthy.
