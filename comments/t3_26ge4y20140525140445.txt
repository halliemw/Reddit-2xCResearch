If you think breaking up with him is going to hurt, remind yourself how much more it will hurt both of you guys if you don't. I always did this with the same mentality as ripping off a band-aid. Here are my two cents:

1. It's gotta be done, so do it fast and get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Dudes generally feel awkward enough about their feels; spare as much of their pride as you can and you'll find one day, you have a very good friend instead of an ex you can't talk to. 

2. Do not get drawn into the "why" conversation. Its your decision, you've made it, your reasons are actually not really anybody's business. You do not need to justify yourself to end a relationship. I tried to stick to phrases that sounded like what managers say when they let you go before your probationary period is done: "Its just not working out."
