I bought tuna when I was obviously pregnant with my second. The (male) clerk at the counter felt the need to lecture me about my poor choice and how I was going to give my child brain damage. I tried to rant about it on Reddit afterward and got the same thing here.

High mercury fish is OK in low amounts--like one serving a week. I had been planning to eat one tuna burger in my entire pregnancy. In the end, I lost my appetite.
