Not street harassment but this happened this weekend so I'm proud of myself.

I was in this bar (that in all fairness is known for being sleazy). This guy slapped my ass, I just said "that's no way to introduce yourself to a lady", but then a minute later I went back.

I just asked him why he felt the need to do that and why he thought it would be appropriate and that he shouldn't do it again.

He did apologise. I'm not sure he's going to change his ways but I hope he at least remembers me the next time he goes to slap a girls ass.
