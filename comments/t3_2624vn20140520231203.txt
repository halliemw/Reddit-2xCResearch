I've never heard of classical musicians being heroine addicts. It is a very demanding career and you would quickly lose your job if you had an addiction. Food addiction does exist but not everyone who is fat is addicted to food, and certainly it's not an addiction with the same kind of health effects as heroine. People can be addicted to lots of things. I know lots of people addicted to coffee who would probably be better off not drinking as much of it, but I don't think it's society's job to stigmatize that.   Some of the most respected classical singers have been overweight and being fat actually can help you be a better singer. It is silly to use that to criticize them. I believe smoking is unhealthy but if an actor in a movie is a smoker in his private life, should I use that as a reason to criticize his acting? To me it is irrelevant. People are not supposed to be models of perfection. A singer's job is not to be an idealized person. Their job is to sing well and perform the role well.
