Have the abortion, find a new boyfriend. You should be having a child if and only if you're ready - emotionally, financially, etc. All of them, just not one. You're not. I have a feeling that even if he doesn't break up with you over this, he'll hold it over you for the rest of your relationship. "Oh, you're angry about something trivial? Well you killed our child."

If you can't go to family for help, it's best you go to friends. It may be uncomfortable to ask, but if they're you're friend (and provided they have no huge commitments the day it's scheduled) they shouldn't have too much of a problem going with you. You'll need someone that cares about you and supports you. You need someone to drive you there, back, and then provide some emotional support afterwards. He's not going to give it to you.
