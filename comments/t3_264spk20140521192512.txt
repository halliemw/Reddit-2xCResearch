There are different kinds of therapists, some are more directive (talk more, in-session activities, assign "homework," give advice) and others are non-directive (active listening, unconditional acceptance, validation, no advice-giving) and most fall somewhere in between that. Everything else pretty much depends on the reason the person is coming to counseling (i.e. a child who is adjusting to their parents divorce would not receive the same treatment as an adult suffering from PTSD).
