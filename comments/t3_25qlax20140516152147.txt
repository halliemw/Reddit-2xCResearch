There are sizes....oh my I'm a total noob! My period has gotten heavier with adulthood (25) and at the rate I'm changing tampoons is starting to become a hassle,  i was hoping there was a light somewhere at the end of the tunnel... I'm kind of a idiot when it comes to non penis shaped things going into my vaj so it makes me nervous to buy something so expensive that may or may not work. Maybe I'll just sit around in a diaper at least i know those work haha
