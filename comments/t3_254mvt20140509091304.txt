I would recommend some of the books like [femalia](http://www.amazon.com/Femalia-Joani-Blank/dp/0867197587/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1399644428&sr=8-1&keywords=femalia) where the authors were trying to show the range of shapes, sizes and colors our lady bits can be.

It can be really hard, when the voice in your head has been so negative, to accept someone else's positive. Consider trying again with the girl who said you were beautiful, but with yourself blindfolded so you don't feel judged when she looks (you won't know if she's looking, she could be busy adjusting her own enormous labia for all you know).

Try as hard as you can to let the positive opinions sink in, and cry the negative ones out. I know full well how hard it can be to have someone saying "you're beautiful" when the inner dialog says "you're disgusting" but it will slowly seep in, even if it just changes to "at least SO thinks I'm beautiful" it's still an improvement.

Cunts are gorgeous, whatever shape they come in, and I hope you and yours can get past this.
