I personally think more of the younger people would vote on this one. I can't vote being a yank and all living here, but my SO is Irish so can. He can't stand politics but even he has admitted that on the issue of abortion and gay rights (marriage, adoption etc) he would be down at the polls casting his vote to make both of these things legal because he does feel so strongly about them. I think a lot of the younger generation who doesn't normally vote would feel the same.
