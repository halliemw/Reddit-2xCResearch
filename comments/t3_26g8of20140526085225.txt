To say that the killings are an example of misogyny is not the same thing as claiming that misogyny was the sole cause. I see Penny as making the former claim, the latter would be far too reductionist, as you say.

We ought not to dismiss Rodger's document and videos as merely insane ramblings. I've not read the whole thing but I'm told by those who have that it is clear and lucid, not at all like the hallucinations of a schizophrenic. I know many people who suffer from a mental illness, depression, and yet they are absolutely as capable of rational thought as anyone else. I would never dream of dismissing anything they say on the basis that they are unwell. Rodger was said to be high functioning, he wasn't confined to an institution. It would be very wrong for us to place the blame for this on his Asperger's, though it may well have been a factor in his difficulties in forming close relationships with those around him. I suspect his appalling arrogance may have been more of a factor however.

What's so shocking about this is that many of his misogynistic statements echo, almost eerily so, statements made online within misogynistic parts of the Men's Rights Movement, 'manosphere' or pickup artist communities. There is a legitimate concern, not that they are all killers like Rodger or Sodini, but that lower level violence, especially sexual violence, is being fostered by the expression of such awful attitudes towards women.

These quotes are from a Red Pill 'constitution' to which I won't link:
>Women are irrational and inconsistent

>Women are machiavellian in nature

>Women are more selfish than men
