Our results SUGGEST that it MAY be overrated?

That's not even a full study with complete results. Breastmilk has antibodies, hormones, and plenty of other things formula doesn't. It lowers the risk of SIDS, increases iq, lowers the risk of plenty of diseases. The "study" even states that Breastfed children do better.

When you choose to use formula instead of attempting to nurse (unless you have medical reasons) you are selfishly raising the risk of your baby dying.
