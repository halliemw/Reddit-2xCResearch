> I'll enjoy my introversion, not loathe it. 

I guess that's my main battle. I'm not always very accepting of my introversion. Particularly with society generally preferring (there's another word I want to use, but can't think of it at the moment) the outgoing, extroverted people. I often feel like I'm an introvert that desperately wishes to be extroverted... or perhaps I'm more extroverted than I think am and so the lack of socialization has really been digging at me. 

> Find a hobby you like and go for it. 

I pick up new hobbies all the time (and am always looking for new interesting new ones), but I still find a lot of idle time unfortunately. Even though I have a lot of hobbies, actually finding the motivation to do them on my own time (outside of class) is very difficult. Maybe my problem (in addition to just being accepting of myself) is laziness... =/
