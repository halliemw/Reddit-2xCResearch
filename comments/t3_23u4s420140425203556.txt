This is amazing advice. Thank you! I definitely need a spiel of sorts, but it's still a challenge for me to even come up with answers to the questions! It's definitely something for me to work towards, though. I envy your position...here I am just hoping for one offer; I can't even imagine being in a position with more than one offer on the table. I bet that is a great feeling. 

Thanks for your offer to practice!  That's very generous. I'll definitely be in touch if I find myself ready to practice with another human. LOL :)
