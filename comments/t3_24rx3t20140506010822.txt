> geek culture has grown so polarizing that it seems rare for a woman to even interact with men in publicly defined geeky spaces without getting harassed, bullied, or worse. 

This is definitely unacceptable and we should take all measures to root it out.  However, listening to this debate, I sometimes feel compelled to ask: in what 'publicly defined space' does this *not* happen?  It certainly happens in politics. It certainly happens in sports.  It certainly happens in music, movies and TV.  It certainly happens at colleges, clubs, and the street outside my apartment.

I don't ask this question to excuse the atrocities like this that happen in geek culture.  Instead, I'm asking whether framing this as a geek-culture issue, rather than a general problem women face in almost all public forums, is making us miss the point to some degree, and impeding real progress by throwing out red herrings for us to focus our outrage and efforts on.

Edit: ok, I'm downvoted below threshold, lexiphc made the same point and is at 32 points... does anyone want to actually respond and tell me what they disagree with, so we can communicate?
