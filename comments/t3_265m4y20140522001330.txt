You need a mantra, and to have your bosses backing. Everytime they say something about women. Throw something back at them about men. If they talk over you, or do something that you've told them not to. Say your mantra of 'Why would you do that' 'That is not your job' 'My sex is not relevant' 'I'm interested in food not what's between your legs'. Then start enforcing punishment. 'If that happens again you will be demoted' 'If that happens again I am going to dock your pay'. Institute a 3 strike policy, three big strikes and they're out. And follow through. You don't have to be hyper aggressive. But you do have to be consistent and follow through with your punishments.
