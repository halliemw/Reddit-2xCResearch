This is very helpful. I agree that I'm the common denominator. I hope none of my posts have come across as too defensive--I've actually had to put in a *lot* of work to combat the self-loathing my childhood instilled in me. I'm not completely there yet. But part of that has been learning to think and talk about myself as Just Human. I have deep flaws. I have great qualities. And it's okay to admit the former while also defending the latter and talking up what's good about me. If I am coming across as too defensive, I'm sorry! Because I really am open to learning.

In my case, I clicked the "join" button and was apparently added to some kind of moderation queue. I didn't think anything of it--I figured, "Hey, this is a woman-only group, maybe they're trying to keep out creepers." Then I received a message a day later saying my membership had been declined. 

It was a simple thing, but you know how the straw that breaks the camel's back is always the wispiest piece of goddamn straw? How we crack under the *stupidest* things after weathering storms of Suckage? That's what happened to me last night.

I'll definitely take your advice into consideration. Thank you, again.
