My OB mentioned it as something that would be obviously taken. It was misoprostol. It is supposed to soften up the cervix to prepare it for the insertion. You should definitely see if it's an option for you. I think 2 of them was 12 dollars on my insurance. I think it is well worth it considering how easy the insertion was for me.
