One thing that can help reduce the cramping is to take a high dose of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs - like ibuprofen or Aleve - for 3 days beforehand.  That's what my ob-gyn had me do to reduce my horrible start-of-cycle menstrual cramps in high school: my doctor-prescribed regimen was 6 Aleve per day (2 with each meal) for 3 days beforehand and also on the day of.

It worked like a charm for my IUD insertion.  The insertion was still uncomfortable - and yes, breathing through it helps A LOT - but not blindingly painful.  My cramps afterwards were really mild, not even as bad as a normal period, and were gone 6 hours later.  Your mileage may vary, of course, since everyone's body and biochemistry is different.

**Explanation:** The science behind it is that NSAIDs reduce your body's [production of prostaglandins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug).  These are the chemicals that lead to [inflammation and cramping](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menstrual-cramps/basics/causes/con-20025447). Front loading with Aleve means that you'll be going into the procedure with a lower ability to cramp because you're running low on prostaglandins.

Aleve doesn't interact with [Percocet](http://www.everydayhealth.com/health-questions/drug-interactions/can-i-take-an-anti-inflammatory-along-with-percocet) or [Xanax](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Can_you_take_xanax_and_Aleve_together), so you should be fine to take them in combination.
