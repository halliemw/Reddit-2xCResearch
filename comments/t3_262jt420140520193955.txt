Abortion isn't the only choice.  It may be your best choice, but none of us can fully know.  If you're not sure about having the abortion and afterwards come to regret it, it's entirely possible that a change in your mental health can have a worse impact than just another brother or sister for your kids (and the associated lower standard of living).

I strongly suggest you look into adoption.  Preferably not a random, never meet the parents and never see the kid again type adoption, but one where a couple is looking for a new baby, you get to meet them and varying levels of involvement can be had throughout the child's life.  I strongly suggest looking at Planned Parenthood's site as a quick, naive googling led to a lot of less-than-stellar anti-abortion sites ([Planned Parenthood Adoption Information](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/pregnancy/adoption-21520.htm)).

However, I'm not suggesting it saying that it's even a viable option for you.  Only you can know that, but the worst it can do is give you a more informed opinion over your final decision.  You're understandably uneasy about your decision, but I'd hate to see you make one you later regretted.
