It's really hard to be someone's personal therapist. When most of your conversations are going in circles about what's bad in his or her life, listening to them vent all the time and trying to be their support. There's only so much you can do and so much you can listen to before you have to tell her you're done.

I would tell her firmly, but nicely this is the last time you're having this conversation. If she's unhappy and he's a lazy bum, she needs to make a life choice, but you just cannot continue to listen. Tell her you know she can do better, and he's not the kind of man she should marry or eventually raise a family with. If she intends to stay with him, you'll tacitly support her by not protesting it anymore, but she is no longer allowed to vent to you.

The only thing is if he is ever abusive or if she needs help to actually get away, you're going to be right there for her. And stick by it.
