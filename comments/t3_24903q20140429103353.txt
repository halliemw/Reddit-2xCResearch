My doctor ordered mine for me directly from the pharmacy. She only ordered one at a time. Then the pharmacy called me to get my insurance info, etc, and they biledl directly to the insurance company. My IUD was also free here in TX. Even the extra visit to my doctor they said I would probably have to pay the copay on was covered at 100%.
