I honestly think he was trying to see if he could get over his lack of attraction and see if there was some sexual chemistry.  He tried and it didn't work.  I've done the same thing.  There was a girl, who while being attractive, I just wasn't in to.  She was a red head and for some reason I'm not attracted to them.  But we really clicked on an intellectual and emotional level so I tried to get beyond her looks.  We had sex a few times and I just couldn't get a physical attraction going.  I'm not a bad person.  I tried and it didn't work.  I think the same thing was the case with this guy.
