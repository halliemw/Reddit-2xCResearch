Actions speak louder than words.  We may not have complete control over our thoughts, but we do have control over our actions.  If your SO "eats at home" as opposed to "eating out", he's *choosing* to be with you.

That said, IMO it all depends on *how* he's "getting his appetite".  Is it something that you do (e.g. people watch from a sidewalk cafe), or something that you'd never do (e.g. get a lap dance at a strip club)?  If it's the former, I think that you need to let it go; if it's the latter, you should figure out whether (a) you think that your boundary is reasonable and (b) you're willing to fight for your boundary.
