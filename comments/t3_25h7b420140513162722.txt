All of the Western world is becoming more obese, yet America is the only one where more women are dying in childbirth. If obesity were responsible, we would expect to see all Western countries increasing, or at least not decreasing. It certainly doesn't help, but it doesn't explain the rise when you compare it to other countries who are also getting fatter yet have declining maternal mortality rates. Age at time of pregnancy could also be a valid concern, but the article says mortality rates are increasing the most for women in their prime childbearing years, between 20 and 24. And yes, overall health is definitely contributing to this, because in America, poor people have very little access to healthcare, so their health problems go undiagnosed and untreated. And they have fewer resources when it comes to preventing pregnancy and if they do get pregnant, they may not be able to afford an abortion. So now they're pregnant when their bodies are already under strain and they can't stop the pregnancy. That sounds like a recipe for high maternal mortality rates for me, and cutting Medicaid funding and Planned Parenthood funding is only going to make it all worse.
