The more women breastfeed in public, the less uncomfortable everyone will feel and the more ubiquitous it will become. I always felt like I was doing a small service for my culture every time I nursed in public. I have 3 children and i nursed them EVERYWHERE. And not just as babies, as toddlers too :-)
