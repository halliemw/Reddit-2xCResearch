Ah okay, I take the POP anyway because I had awful side effects from the combined pill. I do get awful headaches and blurred vision together. I've been meaning to get an eye test, so I'll do that :) its just strange because my vision isn't always blurry. After I do exercise/walk for a couple of minutes it will get really blurry to the point that sometimes I won't be able to see the face of someone who is standing 5 metres or so in front of me. I also get really sudden onset headaches which are intense and thorn for a couple of minutes and then go away. 

Thanks for your reply!
