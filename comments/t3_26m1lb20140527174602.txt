You should be aware that when you've done those things - when you've crossed the street before she did (while she was probably mentally telling herself she should cross, or should she wait? how is he approaching?  is he looking at me with intent?  does he look like he's on his way somewhere just minding his own business etcetc) she was probably relieved and thanking you or god or whatever in her head.
You made things just that little bit easier for someone.

In those situations there are thoughts going a mile a minute in a womens head (I'm generalizing here, it may not be true for every woman, but from what I've read it's very common) they are actively surveying their surroundings, do I Have an out if this turns bad?  Is there someone nearby?  How close to the car am I?  Does he have a 'threatening vibe' about him?  Is he noticing me too much?  Why did I wear these shoes today... I don't think I can run that fast in these shoes..  
There's a lot going on.  

I don't know if you've ever experienced these feelings. Men do, for sure, maybe not all men.  It's like... imagine your walking in the bad part of your town, you're carrying something of extreme value to yourself, it's dark, and you can see a few people who belong to a group that could potentially over power you, like a gang or something.
You know how that feels?  The jolt of fear through the stomach, the hypervigilance over your surroundings, trying to guess if that guy is going to make a move... is his posture changing, is he looking at me sizing me up?
Women can feel like that, quite a lot.

No one here is saying suck it up.

You aren't part of the problem if you recognize that a marginalized group has  fear in certain situations and you try to reduce that.  You shouldn't be offended because you aren't being lumped into that group.
