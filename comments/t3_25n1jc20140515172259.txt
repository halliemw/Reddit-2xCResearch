Totally.  :)  My husband and I went through this transition last fall, when we suddenly started actively trying to get pregnant.  It was such a strange mindset...for 34 years I had been actively trying (and succeeding!) to AVOID pregnancy, and suddenly I was wanting this new weird condition.  We didn't have much time to get used to the idea either, as I got pregnant our second month of trying, and am now due in August!  Luckily, the 9+ months of pregnancy gives you a long time to get used to the idea.
