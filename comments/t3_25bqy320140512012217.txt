I'm glad I read this. It touches on exactly what it feels like being a fat woman. In some instances our mere existence is something we should apologize for. We are supposed to just take the abuse because we deserve it for being fat. 

It's no wonder that many of us have crippling low self esteem. I feel like I was told from an early age how my beauty was a direct way to measure my worth. I feel even more unsafe walking home alone because as a fat woman I have less value and am expendable.
