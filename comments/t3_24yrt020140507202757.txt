> Most men don't want to read the stuff on this sub

Is it weird I kind of want to say TOUGH? Lots of people could stand learning periods and birth control are normal, not gross. Or creep shots are gross, not normal.

TwoX having to "educate" them, though, uh... My general feelings are very mixed. I'm glad our mods have been more active than most defaults'!

Still, if everything I encountered was pre-screened to appeal to me I think my life would get more boring.
