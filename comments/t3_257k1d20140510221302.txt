Wow. I had no idea that I could just keep the ring in for four weeks to avoid a period. I thought that the "three week in" thing was because the Nuvaring loses its efficiency after that (like it runs out of estrogen and progesterone..? or something..?). Are there any effects to be worried of for keeping the ring in that extra week?
