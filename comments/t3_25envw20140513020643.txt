TwoX is not exactly designed for debates but polite questions are encouraged. This is more designed as a safe space for women's issues than forum style discussion. I would recommend that you just lurk and read for a bit to get a feel for the sub before diving right in.

Other good subreddits are:
/r/feminisms /r/AskWomen /r/AskFeminists /r/TrollXChromosomes
