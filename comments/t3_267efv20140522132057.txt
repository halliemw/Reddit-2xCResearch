I scrolled through the top few hundred comments and didn't see a single one making fun of her for being fat. The only ones that made reference to her weight were "defending her" from the rude comments that I couldn't find and those comments had received gold.

Then I sorted by controversial and saw only one comment that was making a very benign joke about not liking to eat vegetables... it was at -5 and was below the viewing threshold.
