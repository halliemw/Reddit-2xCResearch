My uncensored opinion is that she needs to put on her fucking grown up pants and deal with her health, and by extension yours. Not sure how old you guys are, but I had an abnormal Pap and colposcopy when I was 17. It wasn't my favorite day ever, but it was survivable and now at 30 I'm glad I didn't take chances with cancer.

Unfortunately you can't make her do anything differently. You can certainly try to talk to her, but if she refuses to get treated you are going to have to decide if this state of affairs is something you can live with, or if it's time to end this relationship.

In the meantime, you should look into getting the Gardasil vaccine. It was approved for males a few years ago. Men can get HPV-related cancers and, of course, can pass these strains on to others.
