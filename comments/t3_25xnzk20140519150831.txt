There's ridiculousness on both sides, but for men it seems to carry more towards giving them huge muscles, etc, whereas for women it puts them in ridiculous poses, gives them skintight or tiny costumes and also gives them huge breasts and curves. It seems far more sexualised on the female side than on the male side.
