Scumbag Stacy, I believe, is generally "look how much this woman sucks", without necessarily having to do with girl/guy relations. For instance, she is used for bad mothers, bad (ex)wives, bad customers, bad friends... Obviously her defining characteristic is "woman who does bad thing". 

Good Girl Gina is, overwhelmingly, about girl-is-good-to-guy. Generally in a dating relationship. Often sexual, but also pertaining to emotional support (encouraging dreams), doing actions (packed lunch with smily face note) and favors (doesn't complain when man plays videogames with his friend all weekend). The Perfect Girlfriend, if you will. 

I think the reason for GGG(f) (hey, I invented a shorthand there!) is obviously that men are the majority of contributors, and most of the women they interact with are their significant others, but it does beg the question why they don't include co-workers/friends/random chicks on the street. 

Obviously the impact is the same as a lot of media... women receive the message that their actions are most important/meaningful when they impact men. 

I suppose the solution would be increasing the exposure of GGG(f) messages about friends, sisters, coworkers, strangers who do good things, to help reframe what GGG(f) means to women (and men!). 

The Scumbag Stacy... She does tend to be more sexual than Scumbag Steve, but I think there's enough diversity in her misbehavior (stealing, drugs, lying, abuse) that it's not too worrisome. The message from her is Don't Be A Horrible Person, which I can't argue with.
