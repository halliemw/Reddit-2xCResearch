She taught me it's never too late to do what you love for a living. She spent 20 years in a cubicle to support me and my sisters when she was a single mom. But the day she got laid off, she took her hobby and turned it into a successful career (she's a belly dance instructor of all things!) She lives alone now that we're all grown up with our own children... teaches a dozen classes per week, crochets baby blankets to sell and spends time volunteering at retirement homes. 

She taught me that success means loving what you do.
