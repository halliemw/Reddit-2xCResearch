I started at 14 because puberty hit my sister (1 year older than me) at 9 and still not it me yet. I had my second visit at 16 when I started having sever periods and mood swings. I have been going yearly since then. 

My daughter is 16 and at her last physical (a year ago), they wanted to give her a pap smear but she was uncomfortable with it, and I did not see a reason for it (regular periods, no emotional problems and not sexually active) so I told them to skip it. She has since come to me and started asking questions on birth control because her and her boyfriend are pretty serious and she wants to be prepared. I let her know she needs a month before they are active, so to let me know when to make the appointment and I explained the pap smear to her.
