I am very comfortable being naked around others. And around the house if I get warm, I might go around in just underwear.

How ever,  your example wasn't about your comfort level with your own body. It was the situation and person you were naked in front if.  In many cultures,  typically women don't show their naked bodies to male friends when in a committed relationship.  Our of respect for your boyfriend feelings,  maybe consider apologizing to him and changing behind a door next time?
