Lol I can. A friend of mine wasn't quite as jealous of my friends, but always treated me as if I was boring. Things came to a head when we argued and she said something pretty awful to me. I broke off the friendships three years later we got back together. She apologized and said she realized what a horrible friend she had become.

I have no advice, but I know how you feel for sure. If she is becoming toxic, maybe a break from each other isn't a bad thing? Maybe she'll learn what a hypocrite she is being? Hugs.
