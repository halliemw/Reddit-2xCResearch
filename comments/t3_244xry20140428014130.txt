This is an amazing company, and I love what they're doing! However, I have a little bit of an issue here...What is "real-sized"? As a naturally small woman, I find it insanely offensive when people refer to my smaller frame as something that somehow does not make me a "real woman". I've been a part of this sub and the body positive one for awhile now, and notice a lot of similar wording. I love this, I really do, and I love the body positive and body love revolution. I just think saying "real women have curves" and similar statements are just as harmful as saying "skinny is sexy". I am a real woman. I have small proportions naturally and I am just as real-sized as a curvy woman. Just my two cents in there..Sorry if it's not an appropriate place for it. I really don't mean to offend or insult, I just have been told the my thighs look hungry one too many times this week...
