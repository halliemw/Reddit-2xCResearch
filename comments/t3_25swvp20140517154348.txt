I never said yelling or groping or being an asshole to them is acceptable. I am as disgusted by how people treat others as you are. Low status men and women are treated like a nothing by the opposite sex and society at large. 

Would it be nice if it stops? Absolutely. But I wouldn't be banking on this prevalent societal norm stopping anytime soon and in the meantime I would play by the rules.
