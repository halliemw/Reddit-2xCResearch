She's going to have her own interests (maybe dolls and tea parties, maybe softball), but she's also going to love spending time with you. So spend time doing what she loves with her, and spend time doing what you love with her. 

When she is a preteen and teenager, you might have trouble realizing you need to give her freedom to grow in certain ways. For example, I had to really fight my husband to allow our daughter to wear the make up I bought her when she was 14. He still sees her as a little girl, and anything grown up she tries to do, he freaks out. So now I have to work with him on letting go. Follow cues from her mom for all of this.
