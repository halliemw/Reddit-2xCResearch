One thing this specific article neglects to mention that I've read about elsewhere regarding professional cheerleading is not simply unfair wages but that they are, though untitled as such, athletes too with high risks for such a physically demanding job, yet they are typically not given any healthcare benefits. Professional cheerleaders practice constantly in preparation for their displays of gymnastic ability and though very fit, accidents still happen both in practice and on the field. These injuries range from simple sprains to broken bones and concussions. Most jobs (and especially athletes) where there is risk of bodily harm are given either high pay and/or healthcare benes.. These young women get neither. It'd be nice to see cheerleading recognized for the athletic activity it is and compensated as such.
