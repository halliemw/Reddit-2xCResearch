>  "I'm 29. What's the point of moving out of my home town at this point? I'm just going to be old starting from now, and life will be less and less fun. What's the point of living in your dream city if you aren't young, glamorous, and vibrant?"

So.. if you have it all at 30, what the hell are you going to do the remaining 40 years? Just sit around and roll your thumbs?

>  People are happy and have fun at any age, no? 

I'm having way more fun now, since I turned 28 than I did ever before. My aunt is almost 50 and has finally managed to fullfill one of her all time dreams. My other aunt is travelling abroad for the first time ever with a small choir she's a member in. My mum is in her mid 50s and she's probably her happiest now. My grandmother is in her mid 90s and she never complains and is always so positive and in good mood. Happiness is a choice.

>  Also, I am not convinced that everyone has an ideal life in the first place - it's just that the media only portrays young people being glamorous and over achieving etc.

It's movies. Ever noticed how people in tv shows spend a looooot of time dating, run every day, spend lots of time with friends and still work 60h weeks? Yeah, that's not doable in real life. Tv shows and movies are adult fairytales and just like there aren't fairy good mothers and happily ever afters there aren't 48h 24h:s for anyone. In real life you choose, sacrifice and prioritize. In real life, bad shit happens.
