Thank you so much for this advice. I know it will be expensive to set up the home security system, but since the place I live at is a very old building/not very secure it will be a worth while investment for my own protection regardless if he were moving in and especially now!

Luckily my boyfriend lives with me and I intend to have him walk with me anytime I'm going farther than my car or at night. I know it sounds extremely paranoid but for one year I'm ok with being extra cautious. My only fear is this one area when I'm going to take out the trash because someone could very easily corner me in. I fear he still has a lot of aggression from the way things didn't turn out the way he wanted them to.
