Thank you for sharing your story.  There seems to be a pattern here of undiagnosed mental illness.  This might seem like a weird question, but do you feel like your mom got worse after menopause?  The reason I ask is because once my mom hit about 45, she took a nosedive and while these bits of her personality were always present, they became magnified by 10000 after she began menopause.
