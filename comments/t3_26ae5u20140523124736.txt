Thanks. I have said that its not 'couples therapy', and its not for him, I just kinda want to bring him in on whats going on with me. Help him understand. 
    I wouldn't want to force him long term. Its mostly that he was super reluctant to go to something he's never tried. He's outright refused to go to a group for relatives of those suffering depression, that runs parallel to the weekly depression support group I attend. But he's never expressed any reasoning for this other than feeling awkward. I think he's only agreed to this because the therapist asked me directly to ask him to come with me.
