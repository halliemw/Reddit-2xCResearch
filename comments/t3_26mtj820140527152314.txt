I work at a store that specializes in bridal registries. Go in and talk to someone at the place she is registered. Most registries list a price point and go for an item in your price range. Depending on your financial situation and how long you've known her, I would suggest something between 20$ - $50. If you don't want to go for something on the registry, there are things that everyone needs that are great gifts. A neutral color set of towels is nice (bath towel, hand towel, and face cloth) and keeps you in that price range. A neutral sheet set works as well, but will probably be more expensive. If you're still not sure, get her a gift card for the place she is registered. Many stores have "completion events" where a bride can come in and get the remaining items on her registry for a discounted price (usually 10-30%), and a giftcard would work great for that in case she doesn't get some important items that she wanted. Some places even wrap the gift for you for free!

Think about the couple. Do you know if they already live together, have they just gotten a new place, etc? That can help in choosing a gift. If they've lived together for a long time and haven't moved, chances are they already have all the basics and would just need things replaced (new silverware set, new towels, new coffee machine, etc). If they just moved to a new place, they might need more than the basics.

Hope that helped :) And good luck! Feel free to message me if you have any more questions about registry shopping, especially if she is registered at Bed Bath and Beyond, because that's where I work! :)
