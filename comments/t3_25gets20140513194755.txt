But you know what I mean about the chest hair thing, right? Ironically, a guys I dated recently trimmed/shaved close but had a hairy chest. I went down on him and I got like nine hairs in my mouth. I imagine they came from his legs, or his chest, or his belly. I don't think a guy has ever gotten nine hairs in his mouth going down on me, and most time someone would get zero or one. This is one of the most insidious myths. It drives me crazy.
