Your feelings aren't wrong at all. If I were you, I would talk to him about it (when you're both alert and sober and calm). I know when it's late and I've been drinking, some times things don't come out right... If he is seeing you for your past rather than as a person, I think that's a pretty big problem to overcome in a relationship.
