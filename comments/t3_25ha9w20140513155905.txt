I'd say it depends on your age. If you're over 21, your doctor will recommend it whether or not you are sexually active. It's highly unlikely, but there is the teeniest, tiniest chance that you can pick up HPV without having sex. 

My college's health clinic refused to prescribe BC to me after I turned 21 unless I got a pap, even though I had never had sex and only took BC for my acne. And now that I'm married (both of us waited until our wedding night and we're both STI free), my gyno still won't renew my prescription unless I have made my yearly pap appointment. Your doctor might have a similar policy. 

So if you are planning on getting any sort of birth control, you'll probably have to do it. But if you don't need that and you aren't sexually active and never have been (I'm assuming this - you didn't specify), then you should still consult your doctor, but it's ultimately up to you.

If you don't want to get the pap because you're afraid, ask your doctor if (s)he has a small speculum suitable for someone who hasn't had sex. That's what my doctor used, and it was completely painless (the campus health clinic used a plastic, disposable one, and it hurt a lot and made me bleed). 

EDIT: I want to emphasize - you should definitely talk to your doctor about this. I am not a medical professional!
