Thank you so much for this.  I really was just reaching out and needing to say it to someone because it makes no sense to me how this could have escalated as it did for me personally.  I have already ended it and I will continue to cut contact in full.  Although I do not want to go into more detail about my own marriage, I thank you for your personal advice. It has helped me in a time of need and although I doubt it will save my marriage, at least I know it is not right to continue until I am in a much healthier place emotionally.
