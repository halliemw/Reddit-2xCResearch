I bought a Diva Cup because I'd just gotten my first paycheck from my first job, and felt like spending money. It took a lot of stuffing to get it to fit in to my virginal orifice, but once in it was much more comfortable than tampons and pads, and it didn't leak. Taking it out is much more difficult, so I still wear tampons if I'm going to be out of the house.
