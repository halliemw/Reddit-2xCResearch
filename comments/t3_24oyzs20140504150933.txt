I think it might also be influenced by their view of non-American Asians. Apparently, Japanese people are often extremely polite to foreigners, since they know they that the foreigners don't know the customs. I've heard that if you study in Japan to learn the language, you have to ask people you're around a lot to critique your Japanese skills because they just don't want to hurt your feelings. I think people take this politeness as an opportunity to be a dominating asshole.

Of course, this is only for Japan and not all of East Asia, but American popular culture often groups all East Asian cultures, and consequently all people of East Asian descent, under the same stereotypes.
