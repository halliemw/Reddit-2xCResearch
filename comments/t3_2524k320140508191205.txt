Yesterday the first page of this sub looked absolutely dismal. Nearly every post had been heavily downvoted. Today, it's looking much better--like the old 2XC we know and love. I'm still not okay with this sub being a default one, but from what I've read, it'll probably be removed from the list in a few months to make room for another sub. Hopefully. I'll just have to ride it out because I like this sub too much to abandon it, even though I rarely post anything on Reddit.

I hope we'll be able to shed some light on women's issues for users who haven't been here before, and learn from them as well. But some users here are trying to paint this sub as feminist (some women don't want to be considered feminists), which I don't really agree with because it rubs a lot of people the wrong way. I think it'll just cause more brigading from TRP and the like. In any case, let's all just try to get along, support each other and report the trolls when they come.
