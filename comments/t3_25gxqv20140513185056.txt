I host through AirBnB. But I travelled through couchsurfing however safety wise I would say Airbnb is better. Though I never had issues with either as a single female.

Pick places with good references, photos & lots of verification email/phone/credit card minimum.  Shit happens and we can't just sit inside the rest of our lives. (a plane might fall on our house anyway)
