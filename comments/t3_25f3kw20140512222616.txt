I don't think that it's something that I can actually stop. It's an involuntary reaction that I get to almost reaching an orgasm, but not being able to.

So to answer your question, I really don't know, but I don't think that continuing with "other" things would really help. I should add - it's very difficult for me to climax and *almost* getting there is rare enough as it is.
