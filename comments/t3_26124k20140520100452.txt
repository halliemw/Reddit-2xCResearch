It's cheaper now, then compared to the bill you get when you have to spend two weeks in the hospital being iv seriously strong antibiotics so your kidneys don't fail.

Like you can rest in a bathtub and chug a lot of water and cranberry juice and say no to sex for the next 2-3 days and you might be fine. But that's only for the first 24 hrs. If you have blood in your pee it's too late. It's doctor time.
