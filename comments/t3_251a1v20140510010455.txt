> From where do you derive the moral authority

Common sense.

If inflation is 3 percent, you shouldn't put your money where it is going to lose value.

That's not moral authority, unless for some reason someone does not want to invest, and if so, they can deal with the repercussions.

>It's even better if prices are lower and they don't have to go into nearly as much debt to afford those things.

If prices haven't gone up people won't be making enough to buy the things anyways, if minimum wage matches inflation.

Why exactly can't minimum wage be raised to match?  That should be common sense to do in the first place.  You didn't exactly outline why, unless you did so without saying "minimum wage" at all.
