My thoughts are that if it's okay for everyone else to eat in public, a baby can too. To deny it is ageism.  
  
I care. I am mum to a 6 month old whom I had planned to breastfeed. I couldn't.  
  
I'm also lucky. I live in a place where breastfeeding in public is 100% legal and anyone discriminating against a breastfeeding woman can have their arse handed to them.  
  
I think anyone who has an issue with public breastfeeding needs to grow the fuck up.  
  
The ads are fantastic. I would love to see them be mass-produced and plastered all over the place.
