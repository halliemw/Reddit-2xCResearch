i've said it before and I'll say it again. I LIKE that 2x is a default. it brings women's issues to the forefront and gives them recognition they deserve.

HOWEVER, i do NOT like that people are able to come in and gaslight and derail threads with "but not ALL men" and "As a man, i think your statistics are bullshit." 

I love hearing from men, but I have the rest of reddit to hear what men think as a man. I want men to come in here and discuss respectfully about the female point of view. 

Edit: Since you asked, /r/femmethoughts has been growing. They're trying to find a good middle ground between 2x and srswomen.
