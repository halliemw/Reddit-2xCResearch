Nah. My little girl friends got offended when I did that in the 1970's, but we've come a long way, and guys is rapidly turning gender neutral. Which I like, because so many masculine terms exclude women from being considered in a positive light, a good guy, may the best man win, a gentleman and a scholar, etc etc.
