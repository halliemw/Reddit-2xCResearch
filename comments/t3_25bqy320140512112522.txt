Don't take women's refusal personally.  Look at it from their perspective.  You know you are just trying to help and would never hurt them, but unfortunately most of us live with the awareness that there are men out there who WILL hurt us, and we have no way of knowing who is who.  There is a lot of fear and distrust built up toward men (and really, strangers in general, regardless of gender) that I don't agree with, but for a woman in a vulnerable position, alone, the very first thing on her mind is that she doesn't know you, and you could be that guy she's been warned about.

I think it's great that you offer to help others!  Try not to get discouraged or bitter about any suspicion that is directed your way.
