I read it. It's 140ish pages btw. Yeah he is a racist self-absorbed hateful person but his obsession with women (specifically tall, beautiful blondes) predominates. His life story is being wronged by women who date nonwhite people who don't dress as nice as he does. He drops several classes because he can't bare to be in the presence of attractive women who ignore him. He throws coffee at them from his car. He rants and muses about destroying them. His happy childhood memories are framed as the time before women ruined everything by not having sex with him. He lacked the capacity for empathy for anyone but women were the focus of his deepest and most intense hatred.
