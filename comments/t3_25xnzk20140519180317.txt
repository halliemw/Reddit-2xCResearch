nope i have been reading these comics since the early 1980's. marvel comics have been written for me for quite a long time. now if you want to make a magazine or buy magazines that are aimed for you, that is perfectly fine. all i am saying is quit trying to change marvel. its not like there is only one comic company out there. but you want to take my traditionally sexist comics and remove the sexism from them. either you like the product or you don't. get off my media, i want sexy x men. i want the invisible girl to be hot. 

i'm not saying you can't make your own invisible girl. i'm not saying that that i would oppose a second release of marvel characters specifically for customers like you. x men classic for guys like me, and x men new age for women like you. what i am saying is get off MY COMICS. that is to mean, don't be trying to censor the stuff i buy. don't be taking things out of my hands. i'm not saying you shouldn't have stuff you want for you, just don't take stuff i want from me in the process.
