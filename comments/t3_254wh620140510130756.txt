While I disagree with the idea that this shouldn't be a place for debate, your point really isn't coherent:

You seem to be saying people don't like the switch to default because they don't want the sub to have a lot of debatd, but if you don't want debate, then don't debate with the mods (or anyone else) about the switch to default?
