I've been there. Not as the person fired, but someone like you (a lynchpin) who left. If it makes you feel better, they will regret their decision very quickly.

Also, they don't pay you anything. Don't do any more work for them. If they ever hit you up for additional help, make sure they pay you for it. Under the table if you're drawing unemployment.
