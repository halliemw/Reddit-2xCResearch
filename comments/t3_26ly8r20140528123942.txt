Hate to say this, but most S&W knives are shoddy Chinese manufacture and fall apart readily. Hopefully/apparently OP's is the exception. 

You can't go wrong with anything made by Buck, and if anything does break just send it to Buck's factory in Idaho and they'll send it back looking and working like new without charge.

For what OP's suggesting, though, I would look at a Kershaw Leek. Flat, good pocket clip (knife goes inside the waistband of your jeans, clip on the outside) and spring loaded to flip open and lock. I keep mine in the back pocket of my pants across from my wallet and tend to forget it's there- sits right in the hollow of my butt cheek. Whether that would work on a female butt I don't know. I think you would have to be fairly thin to carry it the way OP suggests without it digging into your abdomen when you sit down, and unfortunately I wouldn't fit that description.
