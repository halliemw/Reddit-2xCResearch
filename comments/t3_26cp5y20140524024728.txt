No, putting a condom is not like wearing a seatbelt. It's like driving on the wrong side of the road, hoping you won't hit a car coming from the other direction. 

If you choose to drive on a rather sparsely driven street on the wrong side of the road, you are committing to getting into an accident. You *may* get away without one if it's your lucky day but otherwise it ms a godsdamned certainty.
