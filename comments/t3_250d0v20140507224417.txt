I'm kind of in the same boat. I've had a few experiences in my life where people who weren't "supposed" to die just suddenly did and I think this has had a huge impact on my anxiety. I'm pretty consistently terrified anytime my boyfriend has to drive somewhere and I find myself thinking about it often. I have dreams where he dies and I wake up in a frantic state and am depressed/anxious for a while after that. Car wrecks are my biggest worry since they seem more likely, and I feel so stupid every time I tell him to "drive safe" or "text me when you get there" because I know it's so irrational but I just can't help it. 

As a side note, I'm not so worried about him just leaving. Partly because it doesn't seem like that will ever happen but also because if it did happen, I just want him to be happy. If he feels like our relationship wasn't working it would suck a lot for me, but if he felt like it would make him happy then that would, in a weird way, be a comfort to me.

So, the short answer is: I don't know how to get out of this rut. I think evaporater is probably right about counseling (too expensive for me though) and it definitely has to do with anxiety so it might be helpful to get prescribed anxiety medication as well. I mainly just wanted to let you know that you aren't alone, because sometimes I get caught up thinking about all of these fears and then I feel worse because I think of how stupid I am for thinking like that. Sorry I couldn't help more, I'm still trying to figure it out myself, but I hope it gets better for you.
