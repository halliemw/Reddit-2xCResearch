So, while all the risks and such that people are bringing up are true, they are also very, very unlikely. The regulations for when a person should get a pap smear have actually changed recently, because at some point they realized it was causing more stress than it was preventing cancer. Cervical cancer is a very slow-moving, highly treatable form of cancer, so the main reason for getting tested is to catch it in its early stages.

My personal experience with getting the same result was similar in many ways. I felt afraid and paranoid about what might happen as a result of my having this virus. But I went to get the colposcopy and another pap smear nonetheless. The colposcopy was an unpleasant procedure, and really killed off my sex drive since then (was I traumatized by a medical procedure? In hindsight, maybe), but the result of that pap smear came back normal. So has every pap smear I've taken since.

Because that's the thing - most people's bodies clear HPV within two years. And going back to the doctor again, talking with compassionate doctors and nurses who knew how stressful it could be and emphasized to me the reality, that this was not that bad - these were the things that really helped out. And now I'm free from the virus for well over a year, I don't need to worry about another pap smear for three years, and I can just live my life without focusing on that sort of thing.

So, really, I would advise her to go back in, just so that she can see that "normal" result and begin the process of recovering from that first test she got.
