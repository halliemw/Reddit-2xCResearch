I am going to answer your question with a question, and try to reassure you that I am not being dismissive or intentionally disrespectful to the valid concern you have raised...  
If I am a college student and I have the best sex of my life with a woman that I met on campus, do I have the right to discuss the experience with my friends? Besides the general caddishness of this behavior, I hope you could see that there are some ways in which you might argue that I do have the right. OK, now...would it be OK if I published the name of the person with whom I had this sexual encounter and distributed throughout the University?
