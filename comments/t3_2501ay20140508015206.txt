Just to give you some reverse perspective, one morning a girl who I had been sleeping with and recently started dating got out of bed to get ready for work. She was putting her clothes on, I was texting a friend and she freaked out because she thought I was attempting to take pictures, as she said someone had tried it before.

On my end I was actually just hurt that she thought I was the kind of person who would do that. I was kinda defensive because I was shocked she didn't trust me, but her seriousness of feeling violated prompted me to instantly let her evaluate my phone for her own peace of mind.  

If you felt seriously concerned about it and he didn't do anything to confirm his honesty and calm your fears, especially if he admitted to taking you a picture right then...well he's hiding others and isn't forthcoming.

Just two cents from the other side of the coin, good luck.
