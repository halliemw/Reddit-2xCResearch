From a guy's perspective. I am in my mid 20's and not yet married, in a 3 year relationship.

I had friends that got married early, and I could watch their marriages from the outside. At one point a friend went out with a few friends to a strip club. The man came home and honestly told his wife about it. She went almost insane saying things like "My man doesnt need to be looking at any other women". The issue here is a self confidence issue, much like your seems to be. It doesnt hurt to look, most every modern guy is going to on some level or another.

I understand the point of being suspicious, its hard not to be in any relationship even just a little bit with someone who has been entirely honest. But you have to TRUST that person to do the right thing. Being suspicious and confronting him about things that have not happened is not going to sit well with any guy. If something happens, then you have grounds to go off and be upset over this. 

If he is going to do something stupid with his ex, there is nothing you can do to stop him. In addition to that, if he is willing to gamble with your relationship like that and does actually do something you deem to be unforgivable all you have to do is dump him and move on.

My advise is simple, trust him until he screws up. If he does screw up, dont argue with him, dont reason with him, break things off then and there without a word and move on. Overly dramatic confrontation solves nothing.
