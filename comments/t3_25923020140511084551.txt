Seriously, thanks for this! I'm a trans woman, and I tend to be fairly "meh" about shaving my legs and pits (especially during winter... Sweet sweet extra layer), but I live in constant paranoia of the strip of hair on my stomach outing me to people if I don't shave it. It's important to be reminded that it's just hair, and cis women have it too, and I should try to be at peace with it.
