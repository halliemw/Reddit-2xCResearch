What's really a necessary activity for a bridesmaid? I mean very necessary, like something bad will happen at the wedding if it doesn't happen. I think the list is actually pretty short, it's 1. Stay somewhat sober 2. Don't make a scene 3. Go with the dress/hair/shoe guidelines 4. Rehearsal dinner 5. Walk and stand at the right times. Sounds like she's being a bit flaky, but you'll be OK. If you kick her out of your wedding party, it probably means the friendship is over for good. You'd be cutting her out of a big day in your life, that's not easy to forgive.
