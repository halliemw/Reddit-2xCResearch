"Calm down" is automatically the best way to make someone more angry.

From the sounds of it, by telling you to calm down, she's really saying saying "I find your feelings bothersome, please stop having them. I'm going to blame them on your ovaries because I don't want to deal with how your excitement gains positive attention from men because I'm insecure and want to prove how I'm not like other girls"
