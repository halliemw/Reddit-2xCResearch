I'm late on this post, but the comments to your post have me literally trembling a little... 
I really hope you have found some help, either with the authorities or someone you trust, and you are doing well today. It took courage just to post.
If that time has passed and you and your family is away from any direct harm, find someone to talk to. Abuse can be seriously damaging and can affect how you relate to your work, other people, and how you see and interpret the world, and it may be difficult to navigate on your own.
