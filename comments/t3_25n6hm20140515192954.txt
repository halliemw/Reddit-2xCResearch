Ugh. I hate this. What does it achieve? They can't expect me to chase them down and give them my number or anything, so there's clearly no endgame except to make a woman feel...what? Based on how vulgar it usually it, I think we can rule out valued and/or flattered.

Just today, I was walking to work and a middle aged guy shouted "God, I hope you have daddy issues!" (I'm 24). And at lunch someone yelled "Your dress would look even better on my floor!" Okay, not super original, but gross.

I did what I always do. Roll my eyes, look annoyed, and keep walking. In the past, that's earned me a few choice words like, "Don't be such a fucking bitch" and my favorite "Come home with me and I'll cure your bitch face." Great. In that case, I'll usually flip 'em off or, if I'm feeling fesity, the suck-it motion. 


That's the shitty part of it all. It happens so quick, sometimes from cars, sometimes as you're walking by, etc., that you don't have time to express to them just what a damper they've put on your mood. So just think happy thoughts. Feel bad for whoever it is they go home to or end up with. Be glad they're gone. Daydream about what Ryan Gosling would have said to them. Anything that makes you feel a little bit better and able to shake it off. They like getting a reaction from you most of all. Think of how satisfied they'd be if they knew you were still thinking about it hours/days/weeks later. Don't give them that.
