You look great! All of the lines are clean and precise, something I totally fail at. My eyeliner usually looks like it's been done by a five year old. What foundation do you use? I'm a similar skin tone and have yet to find a brand that I'm happy with. :/

**Edit:** I looked thorough your comment history to see if you'd posted info about your makeup routine in subs like /r/makeupadiction, and you did! Also, I noticed a few comments about being trans... I had absolutely no idea. Do you mind me asking how your transition is going (or went, if you've fully transitioned)?

By the way, I noticed you said you're a "makeup newbie", which makes me feel even worse about my lack of makeup skills, since I've been doing it for years. You have some amazing talent! :P
