The post was about wanting to be a "geeky goddess" (which, I can assume means sexy nerd) - which is very different from the big bang theory character pictured. Although, the poster should have chosen a different photo of the character, because she looks rather attractive there, so the point of the joke isn't so strong. Overall, the post ins't that funny, and kinda mean, especially in the context of its intended audience (girls who admire and are fans of the character).
