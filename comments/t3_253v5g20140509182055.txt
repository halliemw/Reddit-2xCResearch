/HUGS/ Thank you for the reply! It definitely ranks pretty high on the suck list for me. And gosh that sounds awful D: I don't think I've ever had a UTI quite that bad. 

This morning when I was showering I let just a little super gentle stream of cool water run over my ladybits. It was so refreshing and made me feel normal at least for a little bit. I might try a hot bath later, I'm just so worried about doing anything that might make it worse or (god forbid) peel off any more skin down there.
