if he still thinks you're cheating on him and doesn't trust you after *three years*, do you really think it's going to get any better? it is in no way your fault that he thinks you're cheating, you're not responsible for his insecurities and you need to stop concerning yourself with them. if he won't trust you, there's no point in having a relationship with him.
