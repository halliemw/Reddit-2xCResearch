I switched schools and went from a class of about 80 to a class of 250~.  It was SO much better.  It won't solve all problems as teenagers can be assholes but it gives you *options* you don't have when you're stuck in a small class and know everyone.  It's also nice to be able to start over with a fresh slate.
