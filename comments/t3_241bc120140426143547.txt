They absolutely can't (in most states) ask you about your plans for children. I would answer, "Is that relevant to the position?" if asked. 


If you feel you have to answer about your marital status, I still would not embellish about your plan not to have children. It perpetuates a misogynist assumption that a woman who isn't going to have kids is a better employee. Also, you may change your mind one day (not saying you will, but... Things change sometimes) and people could construe it as though you misrepresented it. Honestly, I think it should be kept out of the conversation as much as possible, why introduce it if you don't have to?
