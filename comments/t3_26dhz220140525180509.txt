I went through something similar to this in my last relationship. One day I felt the need to check his phone and found more than I bargained for, he was sincerely sorry so I forgave him. Four months later I caught him again and ended the relationship. There were lots of red flags before this and I ignored them because I fear being alone, but I wish I had paid attention sooner. Every relationship is different though, look at it from every angle. If he truly wants to make it work, he will give you time to decide what you want to do.

It's okay to forgive him if you believe he is sorry he did it and is ready to start making amends. If you do decide to forgive him, remember that it has become a part of the past and should never be used as ammo in arguments. I wish you the best of luck in your relationship and the strength to make the best decision for you.
