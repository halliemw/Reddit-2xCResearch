Have you considered telling someone at that firm about this? Like that guy's boss or if there's an HR dept. to work with.

Sexual harassment in the workplace is seen as both the components you mentioned verbal and physical, both of which are intolerable because it leads to a hostile work environment. 

My advice is to tell someone about your experience there that can deal with it and return the scarf.
