Wow thank you for your reply! It doesn't sound that bad at all. I'm glad.

I try not to judge women wearing the hijab, as I had a good Jordanian friend in elementary who wore one, and especially since I saw this comic https://thegreatantagonizer.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cartoon.jpg .  however i remember reading post from an ex Muslim woman who mentioned how much she enjoyed feeling the wind in her hair when she no longer wore it. I really like hearing perspectives from "the other side"
