"talking about how women and girls are represented in geek media has come to be seen as a "feminist agenda" instead of an issue of fairness, representation, and respect."

My one issue with this article, which was pretty well-written, is that FAIRNESS, REPRESENTATION, AND RESPECT **IS** THE FUCKING "FEMINIST AGENDA" ARRGHRGHRHGHG

Can we please stop giving ground to the opposing side's push to make feminism a dirty word? It's like the way the right-wing have tried to make "liberal" an insult. Concessions like this are why so many young women I meet seem to be OK with saying, "I'm not a feminist, but ..." Yes you are! You are a feminist! And that's OK! It's better than OK!
