I have no problem with women breastfeeding in public and they definitely shouldn't be forced to do it in a bathroom... however this does make me think that maybe there needs to be more rooms in public places designated for breastfeeding women. Just a nice, quiet, clean and comfortable environment where women can go to breastfeed their kids without disturbance. While many mothers are fine with breastfeeding in public if they have to, I'm sure that given the choice between that and privacy, they'll pick privacy every time. 

People who have a problem with women doing it in public are just fuckwits though. Oh no, the woman is using her breast for its intended natural purpose! Such horror.
