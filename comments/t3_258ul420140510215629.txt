I do like the cups of clear liquid one though. I feel like it does visualize the possible consequences of having **unprotected** sex with people who have **unprotected** sex with others.

However, I don't think it should be used as a "DON'T HAVE SEX" scare tactic. More like, "This is a possibility, so be smart, use protection."
