If you were pregnant, would you consider adoption? I have a daughter, I don't know how old yours is, but I know how hard that could be explaining why mommys belly got so big, etc but it's something to think about. Do you have any reason to believe he really is infertile, like he's had a sperm count done? Totally different situation but when my fianc√© and I were trying for the baby I'm carrying now, he had been working at a factory with chemicals that can make a man infertile. Right before we had sex one day he said "this is never gonna work, we've been trying for months. I'm pretty sure I'm infertile" that was the sex that got us pregnant. I also know a guy that was certain he was infertile because as he said "I've fucked 45 girls with no protection, never had a scare yet!" And number 46 got pregnant. Not just trying to freak you out more than I'm sure you already are, but just some things to think about. Good luck!
