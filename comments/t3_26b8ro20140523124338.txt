> I, for one, would never have found it otherwise nor would have even thought to look for it, and I've enjoyed reading it since it became a default.

That's kinda the point. Not that people aren't welcome at 2X, but making it a default very much takes it from being a meeting space, to a space about educating or engaging the whole of Reddit. I see it as a fundamental change to what 2X is about.

Not that there shouldn't be a default about/for women. But taking over an existing women's sub to serve Reddit as a whole (rather than, for example making anew sub and heavily advertising to 2X, trollX, AskWomen, etc) was, to my mind, not a good choice and not a choice that supports women participating in Reddit.
