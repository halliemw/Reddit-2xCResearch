I was taking probiotics in like a gel tab form already actually for bad digestive issues. I ran out about 3 weeks ago and since they weren't helping my digestive problems but I'll probably start again soon. My antibiotics actually have a little warning on them not to take them with yogurt or probiotics. I'm not sure if it means simultaneously or while taking them? And thank you!!
