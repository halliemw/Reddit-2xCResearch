One thing I'm very curious about is the gender of the professors e-mailed. I couldn't find anything in the study that said how many of them were male. In my own department (history), 60% of the teachers are women, not men, and most of their work is gender-influenced. I have also had extensive contact with the English and the Classics departments in my university, the majority of which are staffed by women. To be fair, I'm in one of those public schools and humanities departments that were less likely to discriminate, but my own experience in academia has been much more positive.
