No no, I don't even mean the votes, reddit is fickle with them anywhere anyway, it's just that there's a lot of suspicion and aggression going around right now, and I'm just not used to seeing it here. In a way, that was the biggest shift in this sub I noticed since it went frontpage, ironically coming from those most opposed to this recent change.

Then again, I'm just a casual visitor, most often just lurking now and then. I can see how many users are genuinely afraid to lose something they care about, after all most of them never asked for this. And I don't get sent rape threats and dick pics, either, so it's easy for me to stay calm and just take a wait and see aproach... :| I hope this works out.
