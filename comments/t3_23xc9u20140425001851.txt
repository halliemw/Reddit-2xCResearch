Funnily enough I get a similar attitude from my mom who can stay skinny eating loads of calories and she only approves of certain foods no matter how many calories is in it,she thinks it doesn't count at all.lol.She usually has no concept of calories one bit and thinks she can tell me how to lose weight.Once I realized that I was able to not take her words very seriously and do my own research.


I like iatemysocks advice a lot.Maybe explain BMR to them a bit?Usually once you are smaller you need a smaller amount of food.The amount of food they are eating is probably "normal" for their body weight according to BMR and it can be pretty hard to break out of that once your body is used to that (say especially past 30 years of age),since it will do all it can to drive you nuts to eat to stay that size,for most people anyways.They should be proud you were able to turn it around at a young age.
