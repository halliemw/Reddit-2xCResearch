I'm a little bit confused about the number of pills & packs you have left, but here's what I would do:

Keep taking 1 pill per day, for the regular pattern of 21 pills + 7 days placebo until you run out of pills. At this point, use a back-up method of birth control until you get a new pack. If you can only do 20 pills for one month, start using a condom or whatever.

Meanwhile, call PP - the worst they can say is no, and then at least you tried.
