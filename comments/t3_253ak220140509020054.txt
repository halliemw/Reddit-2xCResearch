I ran out to walmart once, and since I was "only going to walmart" I basically didn't give a fuck.  Hair in a ponytail (not washed), no makeup, sweat pants, SLIPPERS (Ugg slippers, but still slippers), hoodie - and some dude hit on me.  I turned around and spread my arms out and was like, "REALLY?  SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  You're hitting on THIS?"  and shook my head, turned around, and kept walking.  
Edit: Just want to clarify that this was a northern walmart, and not a southern one, because apparently there is quite a difference.
