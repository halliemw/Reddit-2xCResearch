I have to pay $25 per month for my BC, and was told the IUD is not covered at all when I asked my insurance company about it. 

Someone else told me that the coverage is being rolled out over time so it could be a while before I see it yet. 

**Edit**: Clarified - It's the IUD that's not covered at all, not my BC pills.
