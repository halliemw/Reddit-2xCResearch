Howdy,

Important part is, as it always is for everyone of every gender, race, creed, or any other demographic I'm too lazy to list, do what's right for you. If you honestly feel like you need to do this then, well, you need to do this. Whether that's true or not is up to you.

But semi-related, it seems like there was a breakdown in communication at some point. You say that you had a discussion with him and you talked about how you should apply to suburban schools, then you went and applied to/got a job with an urban school? If that's the order of events, then I feel like there was a communication breakdown somewhere. You should think about that a bit.

The important part is still up to you though, at the end of the day. You won't be able to live with the regret of "I never did X but I still want to, even though it's far too late now."
