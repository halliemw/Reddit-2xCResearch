Yes, of course. I've been mugged 3 times in broad daylight, by multiple people. I remember being at a kickback and talking about our war stories, and like 6 out of 7 of the guys have been jumped before, the women seemed shocked and had no idea what its like for us. I'm afraid of this one ATM at night because someone I know was murdered there for $60. He was 19, the kid who shot him was 16. He was a better person than me, everyone liked him. He was going to be a doctor. 

Its not just outside, no where feels safe. One time in a public bathroom 5 or 6 guys came in and as I was about to leave, blocked the exit and started asking me where I was from and whatnot. I was sure I was about to be robbed, but luckily someone in the group said "Just let him go", and they did. 

Nothing has happened to me in many years (since I got a car), but all this stays with you forever, and I never walk if I can avoid it. I don't really know what a "good area" is like, but I'm sure I would still be afraid there too.
