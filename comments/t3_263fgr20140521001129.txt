Sometimes, for me, it IS a chore. My husband never makes me feel bad about saying no, but we also agreed that at the very beginning of our marriage, that "I don't want to" just isn't a valid reason for either one of us to deny sex to the other. We understand that we have different libidos, and different reasons for wanting to have sex, and agreed that the emotional closeness we get from sex is more important than trivial things that so often get in the way. So many times, it has saved us from days of arguments, because we just can't stay mad at each other once we start having sex.

Not feeling well, being too tired, being too stressed, those are valid reasons for us.
