I felt this exact same way when I broke it off with a guy I had been seeing for a few years. I felt that I couldn't be happy with another person, and that if things didn't work out with him they couldn't work out with anyone.
I took several months being single, being out and trying to enjoy myself. I then started rebound dating, and saw a guy for several months.
It gets better little by little. It fades every day till you forget it was there, like a scar.
