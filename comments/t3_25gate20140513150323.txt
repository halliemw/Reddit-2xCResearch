My 2 cents: Dave needs to be in counseling about his past relationship, as he sounds a little unsure about how to be in a good relationship now, and those waters are much easier to navigate with help.  Some work on assertiveness and trusting himself would help too, as even subtle abuse teach the opposite.

At this point, is try for friendship/a casual relationship.  His future move may help your relationship, or it may hurt it, but if you're not sure that you love him and he's not in a good mental space to be in a relationship, adding the stress of distance will make it more complicated.
