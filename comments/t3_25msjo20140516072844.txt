Asking for *evidence* to support or refute a theory instead of redditing on assumptions and groupthink is never stupid.

Certainly it's pretty well taken as read here that there's no correlation between what clothes you wear and your chances of being raped, but I'd wager a pretty large sum of money that *most* of us have never read a well-constructed scientific study actually *demonstrating* it.
