It might be in your best interest to distance yourself from him. Personally, I would confront him because this kind of behavior is just not okay, but don't do anything you're not comfortable with. (On that note, please don't confront him alone, either.) He doesn't seem to respect the fact that you told him *more than once* that you have no romantic interest in him, and that's a big red flag for me. Reading about him gives me the creeps. I'm so sorry this happened to you. :(
