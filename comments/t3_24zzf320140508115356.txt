Posture and language. When you talk to people, do all of your sentences rise as if you're asking a questions? Do you say "um"/"like"/"uhhh" a lot? Do you stutter/stammer? Do you use incomplete sentences and slang all the time? Do you mumble? These are the things that make you seem unsure and inexperienced. 

You're in charge. Stand up straight and take charge. Go lady go! :)
