The thing is though, I'm not sure ANYONE is ever completely and entirely sure about having kids. I think it's completely normal to experience doubt and insecurity about bringing a new person into the world, and it's up to each woman/couple to decide for themselves if it's worth it. I think I'm doing the right thing by seeking professional guidance so I can work through the issues I'm having personally.
