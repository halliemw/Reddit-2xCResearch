My suggestion for finding more sexual partners is to ask more people if they would like to be your sexual partner, which I believe I did mention. One of the few good things about the pickup artist literature is the emphasis on practicing by actively approaching people and talking to them.

On the subject of generalities, I would generally argue that the wants of most humans boil down to food, shelter, sex and sleep, but that doesn't always hold, nor does it allow me to make any accurate predictions of behaviour.
