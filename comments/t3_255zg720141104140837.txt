I'm so sorry to hear about your father.  I can't imagine the pain it was turning 18 and suddenly losing him, suddenly having to be a full adult and help your siblings through it.

We talk a lot in chemo about whether it is better to die quick or slow.  Our consensus: we'd rather not die, thank you very much.  :)  But seriously, a lot of us think slow is better because we can do these things: make videos, write letters, tell the people we love on a daily basis how much we love them, etc...

I have made videos for my kids, and I'm working on recordings too.  I want to make sure they can always hear me say "I love you" whenever they need it. 

Thank you so much for sharing your story, it means a lot to me, and I hope that my kids will be as brave as you, and share their story in order to help others.  You are a good man, and your father was lucky to have the time with you he got.
