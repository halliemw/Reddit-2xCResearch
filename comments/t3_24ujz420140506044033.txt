I call it passive aggression why my boyfriend knows that I've done something wrong yet doesn't try me through words, but by actions that hurt me in hopes I will realise my mistake. Passive aggression does not work.

Be straightforward and tell him you are hurt he did not get you anything for your birthday. Do not tell him he is wrong to forget or whatever, but tell him how you *feel* as a result of his actions.

My boyfriend is terrible at remembering dates as well but well before it was my birthday, we had a discussion and I told him it's important to me that my birthday is celebrated. I brought it up some weeks down the line and he forgot when my birthdate was (in his credit this was a few months after we started dating) and I got upset. I reminded him again that I find birthdays important. For my 21st, he surprised me with the best surprise I could ask for. 

Communication is the key to every successful relationship. It's only when you tell him and he continues to forget that you have a problem.
