But how often do you hear anyone talking about "The Top 10 Men in Music" or "The hottest men in music!" It's always just "Top 10 drummers!" and they're all dudes.

It's an assumption that men dominate the world of music and that women are new to it or something. And for Neko Case, she ends up on a LOT of "Women in music" lists but not as often "humans in music".
