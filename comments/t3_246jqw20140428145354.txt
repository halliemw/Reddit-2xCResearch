You sound like an ideal version of me. I'm signed to do a 5k in two weeks but still struggling to run for 20 mins. I've lost my motivation because it's so hard now. Can you give me any advice?

Just over 2 months ago I hurt my hip, the doctor said it was because of my sedentary lifestyle so I took up running to help me not have old lady problems at 29!
