I've mentioned this before, but there's a free service called [Kitestring](https://www.kitestring.io/) that you should check out. You set a time you expect to be home by, and if you don't check in with the app, it sends a personalized message to your emergency contacts. It makes me feel a bit more at ease knowing that somebody will know if I didn't get home safely.
