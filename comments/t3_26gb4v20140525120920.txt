Can we stop giving this guy so much attention? He is a obviously a grade A narcissist, he wanted everyone to talk about him and for the things he said to be spread across the media. He'd LOVE the fact that people are listening to what he said and watching those videos he made. You're just making his wish come true and diverting peoples attention to the killer rather than the victims. Stop it.
