Could you find somewhere to volunteer? Girl Scouts or something. That's a good, free way to meet people. 

You can also check your local subreddit to see if they have meetups. If not you could start one. A picnic in a public park is often a good one.

And as the other poster mentioned meetup.com is great, you can find all sorts of groups there, and join events for free.
