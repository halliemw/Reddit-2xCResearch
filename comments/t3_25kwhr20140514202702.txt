You're right, I may have phrased my post badly. I was just fed up with trying to have discussions with people here and watching their comments get severely downvoted for having an unpopular opinion. It just doesn't seem fair.

If you don't have time or want to expend the effort to disagree with someone in a comment, why not just leave their comment un-voted on? It takes even less time than downvoting them, and maintains the integrity of downvotes being used for disrespectful or trolling posts.
