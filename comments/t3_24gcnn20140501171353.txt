Yup! Nice name, by the way. Terry Pratchett does an amazing job of writing really human characters, with like, actual interesting problems and things... even the women. They don't even tend to often have typical-safe-female-character-issues, like, I dunno, having to reconcile their femininity with their strength, or whatever. No, straight up, their problem is like, they're a werewolf, or an openly female dwarf, or they need to go save Santa, or there's a bunch of angry blue pixies all up in their barn. It's beautiful. He treats his female characters like PEOPLE, and not just archetypes! And not even to make some point, most of the time, but just because like... he's a good writer!

Also he's super funny, so that too.
