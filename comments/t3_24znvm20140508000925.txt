Mod of /r/jokes here, we recently became a new default also. As far as the community not having a warning or input, there are 2 things at play here.  /r/jokes was asked on Monday about becoming a default, so there wasn't a ton of time to think things over and we were asked to keep quite about the changes. I would imagine this subs mods were under the same short time span and request for silence. 

Granted, the mods of /r/jokes are not at all regretting the decision, but I could see how some subs with very tight communities could have problems.
