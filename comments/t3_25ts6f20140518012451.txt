NO. WAY. 
Either I saw that very same turd or this is just a regular occurance. My sister lives in Melbourne, so I go down to visit her whenever I can and we always go to Myer. On 3 separate occasions I have now stumbled across bodily fluids in and around the change rooms. The first one was a [type 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale) on the Bristol stool scale, the second was as liquid as shit can get and the third time was a huge spew, up the wall and dripping to the floor into a massive pile. 
Myer, what a place.
