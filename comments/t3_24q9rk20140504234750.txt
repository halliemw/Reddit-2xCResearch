> and I was suddenly really pissed that all these guys respect my boyfriends' and male friends' ownership of me, but not my ownership of myself. 

Another example of this phenomenon is how when cheating occurs, men will sometimes get voilent with the guy who their gf cheated with, rather than the girl herself.  

The property thing is a good analogy; apologize to the "owner" when you realize she's "owned", and beat the shit out of the "thief" who tried to "steal" your girl.
