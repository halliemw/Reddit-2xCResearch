I don't think this is a sex issue, I think it's a control issue.

She gets bullied and pushed around by other kids. Her parents are probably constantly trying to control her with rules (and although I'm certain they're all very fair and even-handed, that is not how she is going to view it). 

She has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome so she most likely has a hard time with impulse decisions, ie she can't even control herself.

This is the one thing she can control. She can go sleep with someone and have it be her decision that no one else can take back from her or stop her from doing. 

And no she doesn't have much of a grasp on the consequences of sexual behavior at 13. That being said, she is fully physically capable of sex at that age, and she knows it. The emotional issues with the right guidance can probably be minimized or even turned into a learning experience, if and when the time comes. That's probably the best you can do for her if she's hell-bent on following through with her plan.
