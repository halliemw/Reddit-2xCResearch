I am sorry to had a scary childbirth. I can't imagine, and especially then getting pregnant with a fetus that had serious abnormalities on top of your husband just getting off chemo. 

> I was abused and neglected. I firmly believe if someone is not ready to parent and they don't want to be a parent then they sure as shit should not be forced to. 

I completely understand that, as I too was, and I never believed someone should be forced to have a child, nor had I mentioned that in my original post. I agree with you there big time. 

However, I know you don't want to hear this, but I do find your abortion more valid (for a lack of a better word or phrase) than someone who  knowingly was neglectful with using birth control and essentially used abortions are their method of birth control. But then again do I want someone like that being a parent, not particularly, so I don't know. 

But I do know, I would never stop them from getting an abortion. 

Adoption holds a heavy place in my heart, as many family members of mine were adopted, so I suppose I always think if only they could continue on with the pregnancy, a have a family who desperately wants  a child could adopt it. 

In regards to premature babies, I know they can have serious health risks, and life long health issues, but they can just as well as a baby born at 40 weeks. A dear friend of mine was born (a twin) at 25 weeks, and at 31 years old today has never had any health problems. Unlike myself, who has been plagued by health issues most of my life, and my mother had a healthy pregnancy. I think there are so many factors and attributes that come into play with health issues and illness, whether a baby is born premature or not.
