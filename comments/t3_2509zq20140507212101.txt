Yes, especially on the new posts I'm noticing it.

I have a proposal that I hope the mods take seriously:

**We should remove the downvote from submissions.** We can still have it for comments,  but that way submissions that are good or that people want to see will still get to the top and we can prevent the downvote brigades.

I have seen other subreddits that do this and I think it's a good idea.

Edit: clarity
