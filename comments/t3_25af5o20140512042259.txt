I lost my mother last July so it is my second Mother's Day without her too. I was 23 when she passed away, so far every major day/milestone has been a real battle. I often tuck good news away because the only person I want to share it with is gone. So hard. I hope you have many happy memories of your Mum, and I hope it gets easier.
