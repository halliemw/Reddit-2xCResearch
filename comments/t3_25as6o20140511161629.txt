"Toughest"? How? "Most draining"... sounds like this person's never worked on a suicide hotline or in a coal mine, two jobs I imagine would be a lot more draining. "Emotionally and physically exhausting"... yeah, I get that. My son's only 6 months old, and manages to wear me out almost daily. "Thankless"... there are BILLIONS of thankless jobs out there. Ever worked on an IT service desk? "Never-ending" is dead-on.
