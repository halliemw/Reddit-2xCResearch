The idea that it is the woman's decision is a little off-base when there is a caring father around, too.  I'm so glad you included him in your decision.  If you still aren't sure, better to use the condoms and eliminate the need for such an awful decision process (awful because you don't agree on everything so it will be hard either way.)  Thanks for the insight and the restored faith in humanity.
