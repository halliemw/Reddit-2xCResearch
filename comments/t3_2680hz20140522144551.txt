Exactly. I can think of one time a guy took an interest in me purely based on the physical and I walked away with a positive impression of him. I was grocery shopping (I always get hit on at the grocery store, I have no idea why) and was up on my toes reaching for something on the top shelf which does, admittedly, do awesome things with my curves - my boobs go up, my torso goes slim, my butt pops out, and my hips keep doing their big ol' hips thing. As I came down, I caught this cute black guy (well-dressed, about my age) checking me out out of the corner of his eye. When he saw I'd caught him, he went back to shopping, but as I passed him exiting the aisle, he said, 

> Excuse me, ma'am, may just I say something to you?

I gave him the affirmative, and he shook his head and said,

>You have an absolutely ... phenomenal figure. I just ... [gestures to all of me] ... wow. I just wanted to tell you that. 

I thanked him, blushing furiously, and he smiled and walked away. No further hit-upons, no asking if I'm single or trying to push his number on me or anything - just hit-and-run, compliment-and-depart. When I passed him again a few minutes later, I caught his eye and he was the one to blush this time, but still - no phone number, no further flirting. 

It's been like 4-5 years, but I haven't forgotten that guy or how politely he complimented me and my big ol butt/hips. If I'd been single, I probably would have chatted him upon on that second encounter.
