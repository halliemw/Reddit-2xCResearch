My mother doesn't use reddit, but it's about the birth of myself. The tale shall be at least interesting to some, I hope!

It was a dark night when she went into contractions, harsh enough that she collapsed to the floor and was rushed immediately to the hospital by my grandfather. Hours of examining and panic later, I was not ready to emerge onto the world. A small amount of painkillers and a drive back to home, hoping all was well, was the last adventure of that day. Or not. Roughly 4:30 am it happens again, and again my grandfather rushes my mother to the hospital. About an hour later, no dice; still not happening. This happens off and on for a couple of days until they decide I've been in for too long.

A C-section is decided upon. The procedure goes rather well...Until I am taken out. My mother's uterus had dried up, causing me to come out like some horrible lizard mutant, layer upon layer of skin sloughing off of me as if I was the star in a bad horror B-movie. Roughly 3.1 ounces of dead skin had to be removed from my body, and more yet had come off over the following couple of hours. But wait, something's wrong with my mom. What could it be? The surgeon does some minor probing around to figure it out, and finds something terrible. The pressure from my body on my mother's stomach had caused her upper intestine to tear, as well as rupturing her gallbladder. The surgeon had to do an emergency cavity pump to remove a liter and a half of bile and tainted blood, and then perform a snap stitch job on said organs.

The damage caused near-permanent atrophy of her upper GI muscles, causing her to have severe IBS even today (23 years later) as well as a recurring two-to-three yearly visit to remove the old meshing and replace it with new mesh. The procedure required the surgeon to put metal bolts into the tops of her pelvic bone to hold the mesh in place.
