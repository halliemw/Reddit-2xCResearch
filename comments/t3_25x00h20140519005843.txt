Sorry for the confusion.

• She posted them to my husbands fb page. Im assuming the he was still logged on through the app.

• The woman posted every photo of other women on the phone. And there were others that were not me. So i can only guess that the person who stole it just added photos of other women that they are seeing/friends with.

He did change his password and removed all photos. We have tried to get ahold of the person with his phone through emails and texts and have been ignored.

And once again sorry for the confusion.
