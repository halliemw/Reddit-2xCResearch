> or to debate with men

I understand this view, but then the mods of this subreddit shouldn't have allowed it to be made default... of course it will invite debates with men if it's on the frontpage. (It also invites learning, so don't think it's all bad, even if you didn't plan to become an educator. But that's really something you'd need to take to your mods...)

Lurking here for a few days, I think the balance isn't too bad. It's overwhelmingly women's perspective, lots of deletions :) and a few healthy debates strewn in.
