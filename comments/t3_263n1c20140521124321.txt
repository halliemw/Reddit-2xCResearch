I've dealt with some crappy situations from Queen Bee types over the years, and I too more easily bond with men. In fact, it's not really until the past couple of years that I've developed any true close female friendships.

The best thing to do is to extend an invitation to a woman you think is cool, or have a shared interest with. Just meet and chat. Treat it like going on a date with someone you don't know that well--maybe you will hit it off, or maybe not. Either way, there are other fish in the sea. And similarly, maybe don't go all in on someone (I mean, don't start revealing your deepest darkest secrets on day 1) until you can get to know her a little better and know she is worthy of your trust. 

It's possible to guard your heart and also be open to making new connections.

As far as the other girl goes: good on you. Those other people can have her. Chances are that they will get fed up one day too.
