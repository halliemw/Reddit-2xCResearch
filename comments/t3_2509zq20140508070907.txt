Ha! Safe space. Not anymore.

Edit: I want to say that I already didn't feel super safe, and now I feel much less so. I wasn't an especially avid commenter in this sub, but I did enjoy reading, and have derived comfort from a lot of the content here. I hope that doesn't change. My initial reaction upon finding out it is a default is that, no, it is no longer a "safe space." I really hope my first reaction turns out to be incorrect.
