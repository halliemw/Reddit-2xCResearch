> Why not?

If the staff makes a customer uncomfortable then the customer would stop going to that place of business, and obviously the business does not want to lose customers. People (usually) don't go out to eat to get hit on or deal with creepers making passes at them. They go out to eat to relax and enjoy some time with friends and family. I'm not saying OP is a creeper, obviously :)
