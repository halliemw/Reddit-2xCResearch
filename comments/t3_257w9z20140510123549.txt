Wow, that is a lot of arguing about a cartoon.

To me, it is silly to imply it has anything to do with feminism.  It's about the love between sisters, the guys are just a convenient villain and comic relief.  Cute movie, nice music, no long lasting impact on anyone who doesn't have to watch it every day with a toddler.
