> false rape claims

I don't think there are a lot of *malicious* false rape claims.  I think there are a lot of *confused* statements made about sexual encounters that may, or may not, specifically make a claim of rape.

I think the next biggest problem on this issue (next to the problem of actual rape) is situations where a girl *honestly* believes she was raped (or sexually assaulted) and the guy *honestly* believes that the activities were consensual.

That is an education process on both sides.  Too often, we only hear that men need to be educated in regard to that ("teach men not to rape").  Women need to also be taught what isn't rape.
