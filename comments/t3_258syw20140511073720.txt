>A statutory rape plea deal is much better than an acquittal.

Is it?

With an acquittal, you are saying 'we think there was a case of rape, but there wasn't enough evidence'.  In other words, you are saying you believed the victim but just couldn't meet the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' evidence level.

With a plea to statutory rape, you are saying 'The victim was untruthful about the events and actually had consented, but it was legally invalid'.  Thus a slap in the face.  Also, seeing how light the punishment for statutory rape is, they might as well have been acquitted (and if your response to that is to up the minimum sentences, then you are punishing a lot of innocent* couples).

*I do say innocent here.  Please read the prior link to the Texas state law.  Look at their 'close in age exception'.  Namely the part where it only applies to couples that could legally marry, meaning that the Romeo and Juliet laws do not protect homosexual couples.  I think it is fair to say that a couple in the age range of Romeo and Juliet but who are not protected because of their genders is really an innocent couple.
