My ex-boyfriend and I were best friends for all of college, and we then dated for 6 months before breaking up. Even after 5 years, I was still learning about him. On top of that, just because you're best friends does not mean you necessarily know them from a romantic relationship standpoint. It's a completely different dynamic, especially during the honeymoon phase of a relationship.
