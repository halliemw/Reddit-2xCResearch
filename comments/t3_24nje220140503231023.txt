I got my period when I was nine (and a half). I had small breasts and was a full B cup by grade 6 (11 yo). I had to shave at 9, and all that. I have been pretty much fully developed since 9 or 10. I grew since then, of course, but all my bodily changes were done by 10. I was the only one I knew who started so early. By the time my friends started I was a seasoned pro. Lol. She's lucky to have you to talk to. I had my mom, but it really wasn't the same. At 9, my mom was old and it was weird. I don't know what else to tell you but feel free to ask questions. I'm open to talking about any of it.
