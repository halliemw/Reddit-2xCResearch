Well thats what I would argue against, actually. IF you could learn and retain all that information in residency, then yes, longer would be better. But I don't think that is how it would work. 

4 hour case or 8 hour surgery? Plus the peri-operative recovery time? You can't really split that up, its just how it is. Following someone to understand the healing process. If you aren't at the hospital, you won't be there to experience and manage the bumps in the path to recovery.  If you aren't in the clinic for the bumps in the road, you won't see them, and you won't know how to deal with them.  

Same thing with the boards. You don't take a test in one thing and then a test in another, as you have to be able to see the big picture. 

After you have gained that competence it is easier to maintain. I still look things up everyday, and probably should, because things also change quite rapidly. Still taking a week off is wonderful and doesn't make a huge difference in competency. 
 




Payment is another issue entirely, and yes, there is really no justification for the low pay that residents receive other than greed.
