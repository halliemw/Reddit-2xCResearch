I'm just asking as someone who has never been in a relationship, I saw that you included shouting as something you had never done in your relationship, is shouting during an argument considered abusive behavior? Or is it the way that he was shouting at you abusive? I always considered occasional arguments to be part of a relationship, but I'm young and have never been in one.

Thank you for sharing this story, the part about the lady in the cop car made me smile.
