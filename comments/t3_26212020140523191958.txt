How about a filter that whenever someone submits a comment containing "as a man" or "as a guy", a pop-up box shows up asking if their comment is respectful and supports women's perspective, as per the purpose of this subreddit. If they click yes then they can still comment. It doesn't block their comments but may make them think twice.
