I totally agree - I did offer him a copy of the key, but he refused. I guess he didn't want to get "caught" again. I don't blame him, especially since it was my roommate's GF (who once again went to our place in the middle of the day using HER key to pick up a birthday cake for her son that she made in OUR kitchen!) that told him. 

And yeah, you're right. At this point, it does feel like it's too late. I'll just ride out the last 4 months, save up my deposit and first months rent, and start actively looking in August. Thanks so much for your reply. :)
