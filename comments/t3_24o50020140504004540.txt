Have you tried looking confused and asking him to explain exactly why that's funny? Sometimes that will mess someone up as they have to try and explain why sexism is hilarious in front of a bunch of people. 


If he keeps it up though I'd talk to fiance and stop inviting this doucheasaurus rex around when you can.
