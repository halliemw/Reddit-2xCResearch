I picked The Triangle Shirtwaist fire because it was domestic, and the outcome of unregulated business practices before workers demands of safety at work were acted upon by the addition of things like OSHA.  [If you'd like a contemporary example, you'll have to look at a modern unregulated economy like Bangladesh's](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/fashion/trends/Bangladeshs-factory-collapse-cause-of-concern-for-India/articleshow/21051783.cms).


Unions currently cannot adequately represent workers, not because of the unions themselves, but by excessive government restrictions on their ability to exert themselves on their industries.  Unions in the U.S. were nearly crippled at the end of WWII by [the Taft-Hartley Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Management_Relations_Act_of_1947),  and this has caused a 60 year decrease in their power to advance worker's rights.  A great majority of it's provisions are still in effect.

I would argue that if unions could operate at their full strength we would have better paid sick/family leave for workers,  stronger enforcement of OSHA to protect worker's from injury and toxic exposure, and an end to the corporate "race to the bottom" with wages while making huge profits.

It absolutely has to be regulated, otherwise industry would poison and starve the world for the sake of profits.
