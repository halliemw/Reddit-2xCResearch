>It says that women should wait until marriage to have sex - they will be happier that way. There is a less of a chance they will get their heartbroken or become attached to somebody who doesn't like you. 

There is absolutely no truth to this. A blanket statement which benefits only a handful of people, at best. I am so glad I did not wait until marriage to have sex, because I know what I want and need from my future husband to be sexually content. And there's nothing wrong with that. If anything it will help me avoid relationships where I have to sacrifice my sexual desires for an otherwise "good" relationship.
