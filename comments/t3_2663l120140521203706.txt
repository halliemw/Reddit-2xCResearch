Is there anyone else that brings sexually-themed comics? Do you think if you brought up a 'no explicit sexual content' rule you'd get support for it?

I'd confront him during a meeting saying that rape isn't cool, it's disgusting, and he's been chasing women out of club. He's not going to understand subtlety, he needs to be called on his bullshit in a venue where he can't just explain it away to one person.
