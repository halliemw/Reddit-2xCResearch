oh this again. men are not *excluded* from this sub, they're just not the topic. i know it's hurtful when one out of 50 default subs is not circling around your penis.
eating (which all people do) isn't a focus in /r/Fitness but you don't see me throwing a tantrum on how eating ramen just isn't relevant to that particular sub. BUT EATING IS IMPORTANT TOO.

yeah, but go to /r/food for that. want to talk about experiences as a man? hit up /r/AskReddit or /r/gaming or any other super popular subs.

also i don't see why twox shouldn't be default? i'm exempt from gaming because i can't be bothered with all the "my dick was hard for two minutes" jokes, you can skip trollx if you don't care for reading about women. problem solved. sure, i could participate in gaming - prerequisite is that i'd game something that is of interest to the community. you can also participate in this sub - prerequisite is that you educate yourself about sexism or know when to stop talking over women.
