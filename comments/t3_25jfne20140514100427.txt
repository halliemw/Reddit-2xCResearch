Verification would be hard if we all still want to maintain anonymity, and given Reddit's frequent hostility toward women, I'd definitely want to maintain my anonymity.  I think it might be good enough to take it on trust, and if someone starts behaving in obviously shitty ways, we can call them out on it, redflag for mods, and ban for repeatedly bad behavior.
