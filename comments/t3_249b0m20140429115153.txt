Unless you track your temperature and other fertile signs, the phone app won't be able to tell you when you ovulate.  It is making a guess based on your cycle length and when the "average" woman ovulates.  Even with consistent cycle length you may well ovulate at different times in different months.  I consistently ovulate around day 16 - 18 in my cycles.  I know because I track it.  The month I got pregnant (not an accident) I ovulated on day 14.  

That said, if you did ovulate later than normal this cycle your period would be later than normal, but that doesn't mean it is actually late because the 2nd phase of your cycle is a standard number of days from when you ovulate.  

My suggestion is that you wait a day or two and keep testing.  If it doesn't show up in the next couple of days, make a doctor's appointment.  If your body doesn't generate a ton of HCG a blood test will still come back positive even when a urine test may  not; and if you're not pregnant then the doctor can talk to you about options for getting things going again.  

Stress over things like potential pregnancy can also delay your period, so, try to relax if you can.
