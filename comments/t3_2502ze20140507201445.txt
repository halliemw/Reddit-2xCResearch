"If your body is male but your mind is female, you're welcome here." Taken straight from a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9283g/addressing_the_genetics_issue_you_dont_have_to_be/) linked in the sidebar about inclusivity. Feel free to post and contribute to your heart's content! Trans men and women post here fairly often and more than welcome in this community.
