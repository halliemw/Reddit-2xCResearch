I just wanted to add that although I have never been pregnant, my heart goes out to you. As a women myself, I wish there was more support and compassion available for pregnant women. Please talk to someone understanding, whether that may be a doctor, therapist, friend or your husband. In any case, I'm happy that you've reached out to this online community and I know that you will in some form receive support and kindness from us here. Stay strong and know that our thoughts are with you!
