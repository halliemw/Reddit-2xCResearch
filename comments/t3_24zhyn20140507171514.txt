She's just a tiny person, just like a son would be. Teach her everything you would teach a son, including how to change a tire, how to use a chainsaw, how to split wood, how to make a perfect pie crust, and how to do minor household repairs, or whatever your specialties are. Let her decide what she's interested in as she grows up, whether that's sports or music or fashion or whatever, and support her in it. Do be careful not to constantly comment on other people's appearances in front of her. That's true for boys and girls, but it's something that's only really been talked about in the context of girls' self-esteem and body image so far.

But most of all, love her. You're going to fuck up. Every single parent has fucked up. You might drop her, she might break a bone or two and need some stitches, you might consistently do something that she later feels wasn't the best, but every single parent has done or dealt with at least 3 of those things, most more than that. The best thing you can do is love her no matter what and seek the advice of professional or more experienced people if you're in over your head on something.
