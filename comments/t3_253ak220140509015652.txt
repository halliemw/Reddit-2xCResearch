I feel that this occurs for you a lot, but not every time... Now, hear me out:

Anxiety is a nasty thing.  It feeds itself.  You have had it happen frequently enough that it is possible that it now feels as if it is every single time.  The first way you can combat that, or find out exactly how often it happens, is to keep a journal.  For example, tomorrow - you go outside 4 times.  Write each of them down, where you went.  1.  Went from home to work, stopped at Starbucks.  2.  Went from work to pick up sandwich for lunch, back to work.  3.  Went from work to gym.  4.  Went from gym to home.  Make a note of every time this happens, with the type of thing that occurred.  After a week or so of this, do some analysis.  Is it every time? Is it 90%?  Is it 20%?  Does 20% FEEL like 90% because you're now at the point where the anxiety makes you so anxious all of the time that going outside has become a fear in itself?

If in reality it is 90%, then you know that you're not losing your mind, and you have to find a way to combat it.  I like some of the comments about the shoulders back, head up, confident thing - the "don't fuck with me, not today" appearance.  You could also directly ask some of these people "Why?" to try and find out.

If in reality its the 20%, you can start by telling your anxiety to shove it and take a walk, and then you can find a way to handle the 20%.  I really hope that you try this, and that it turns out to be your anxiety amplifying itself.  

Note that I am not trying to downplay your own observations; I just know how anxiety can work to make things so much worse than they actually are by building up over time.  If this is in fact the anxiety that is making this worse, then you will have something you can actually combat  - your brain - versus complete strangers.  Best wishes!
