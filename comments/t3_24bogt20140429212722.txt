> Your mother sounds kinda batshit

Oh absolutely! She was an awful woman. 

I was required to sleep in bed with her until I was 11 years old (and then the state intervened) and she made me share a tiny room with her until I was 19. I move out 6 months after my 19th birthday and moved 3000 miles away in April of '09, she died June '09.  

When she passed away I cried tears of joy because I didn't have to be subject to her abuse anymore. It was very freeing.
