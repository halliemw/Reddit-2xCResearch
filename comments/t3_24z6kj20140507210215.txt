You realize that the post you quoted was from a discussion of an article about outspoken feminists staging a protest to stop a conversation put on by CAFE about men's issues.  They prevented a professor from speaking on the issue by sitting in the audience and blowing a vuvuzela and hollering. This was the third such protest.  This is at a UNIVERSITY.  It should be condemned.  I think the article even had a video that you could watch if you didnt believe that university students would act like that.  

I would question how anyone could call themselves a feminist and NOT call those people out.  It does nothing for any movement of equality when its members for whatever reason are so blinded by hate that they refuse to even listen much less at least let the other side speak.  And yes ultimately it sets feminism back when feminists do things like that (which I think was even suggested in the title of the article).
