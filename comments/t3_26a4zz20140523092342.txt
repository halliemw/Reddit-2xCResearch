"Being the bigger person" in this case sounds kinda like... just ignoring people being dicks and letting them walk all over you.

I've tried that strategy. It doesn't even really feel like being a big person. It feels like being a doormat. And then, these jerks go on being jerks to others without any consequence and the next person they pick on is stuck deciding whether or not to "be the bigger person" too. Maybe if someone would ACTUALLY be big and stand up to them from time to time they would stop picking on people and learn not to be obnoxious.
