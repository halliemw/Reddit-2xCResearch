Yeah seriously. On instagram, tumblr etc I see a lot of romanticizing inpatient treatment (they put in their bios "almost inpatient" etc) but when I was 14, I was inpatient at a mental facility and it was *not* romantic. If I hadn't blocked most of it out then id write a damn novel and scare these girls out of their romantic minds. Something that makes you wake up in fear seven years later is *not* romantic. Not washing your hair for three weeks is not romantic. Having close friends actually be *dead* is SO not romantic. 

It is SO easy to spiral down though. You see these girls, mostly normal but with a few issues (and most teens have some issues) join a crowd on tumblr, instagram, and suddenly all these people seem to them to be "cooler" than they are. So they try to fit in, and then they start believing it, and living it, and it eventually gets uncontrollable. When you spend all your free time looking at instagram photos of size zero girls who call themselves fat, eventually they become the norm, and you start beliving you must be, too.

It makes me both angry and sad as I have no idea what to do about it.


Sorry I got carried away writing!
