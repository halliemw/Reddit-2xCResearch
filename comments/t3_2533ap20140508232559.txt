The main problem seems to be: OP was not asking for an opinion regarding her apperance or seeking approval about her hair. Rather she was simply explaining that she is about to undergo a drastic change of appearance. She was not asking for positive or negative comments either way. 

Male opinions are not considered irrelevant or offensive, it is simply a case of time and place. OP did not ask "Hey Bob, do you like short hair on women?", therefore his statement saying that short hair is unattractive is not only weird but also implies to the OP that if she wants to remain attractive in Bob's eyes, she must not cut her hair. 

Maybe the co-worker just had serious case of foot in mouth, but as other posters have pointed out it is the assumption made that OP should care about how attractive she seems to other men. If anything, the guy who said "I don't like short hair" is the passive aggressive one, not OP.
