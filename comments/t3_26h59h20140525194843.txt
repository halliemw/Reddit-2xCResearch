It could be, depending on what caused it. Or you may be able to breastfeed with the proper support from a certified lactation consultant, or other experts.

My personal experience-- I was not able to breastfeed my daughter much beyond 3 months. My mom also was not able to breastfeed me or my brother past a similar timeframe. I suspect a genetic factor in my case. My milk "letdown" was always very quick, and once my daughter got to a certain age it just wasn't enough milk for her. I tried to keep going with it, but she began losing weight. 

I finally, after trying for a full week as she lost weight, tearfully began supplementing with formula. A couple months later I switched to formula entirely. 

In retrospect, I am much, much happier with how things are now, and I've realized that breastfeeding is not right for everyone or every situation. So good luck, and please get the support and education to heighten your chance of achieving your breastfeeding goals, but please don't beat yourself up if it doesn't work out!
