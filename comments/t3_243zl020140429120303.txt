I get the [Now Foods capsules](http://www.amazon.com/D-Mannose-500-mg-120-Caps/dp/B000JN4CR0/), but they really just contain the powder, so either form is fine. You can get it at any Vitamin Shoppe or on Amazon as linked. It seriously changed my life. I think it's awful that it's not more well known as a treatment, and that every sexually active woman doesn't have some D-Mannose in her house! For me, it was the only thing I needed to do -- and believe me, I tried *everything* before I stumbled across it.
