I had a similar experience.

I'm a huge horror fan. One day, at a party, my friend introduced me to a friend of hers who is also a huge horror fan. The very first thing that came out of his mouth to me was 'if you're really a horror fan then answer this: who was Michael Myers original mask modelled off?'. No greeting, no pleasantries, just - bam - 'prove yourself'!

It struck me as odd because I highly doubt his first reaction to meeting another male horror fan would be to quiz him to confirm his status as a 'true horror fan' by his definition.

It also had a real 'gate keeper' aspect to it. As though it was already well established that his fandom was legitimate - that should've gone without saying - and that he was some sort of authority to judge whether I would be considered a 'true horror fan' or not.

(The answer is William Shatner.)
