Gosh! I really appreciate that you've thought about this. As far as cultural appropriation goes, I think anyone can get away with wearing a sari if she finds the proper occasion (ie at a wedding or similar celebration where saris are the traditional attire) and a welcoming, open-minded community that is willing to teach and share about their culture. Generally, if you ask an aunty to put a sari on for you, she'll be more than happy to oblige.
