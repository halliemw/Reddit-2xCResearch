Aw, I quit a minimum wage job to leave for a "real job" once. I really, really liked the owners/managers they had looked after me essentially during my time of under-employment. It was like breaking up with a really nice guy you just don't love, for real. In fact, I googled breakup conversation tips.

Two weeks notice is considered the normal, polite thing to do if at all possible. Lots of times, one week notice isn't the end of the world, though. In my case, I was just a few days shy of two weeks but I offered to work the weekend/evening for the week after my new job started to help with training my replacement to make sure I left with no hard feelings and didn't leave my work friends in a lurch.
