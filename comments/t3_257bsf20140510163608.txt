Plan B can prevent pregnancy, so can condoms and not having sex. Some people don't like the idea of teenagers having sex. If people were judging you, it want because you were responsibly preventing pregnancy but were in a situation like that so young. In the end, it is no one elses business and you are a good friend. Though, I would suggest helping your friend get more steady birth control and condoms. (I am a big fan of two forms at once.)
