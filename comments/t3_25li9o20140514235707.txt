I have shaved my head twice in my life just for the fun of it.  Something interesting I learned, people are much nicer to you if they think you're sick.  The people staring aren't staring because you're ugly, they're probably staring because they're concerned.  I rocked the look, and loved wearing hat with it (one of the times I did it was right before winter started).  If you start to freak out, just remember IT WILL GROW BACK.  Enjoy the wind wrapping itself around your head and be happy you have someone who's not so hung up on looks as to make a big deal out of you doing it.  Above all, you are still sexy.  Rock that baldness!
