That's why I've never gone to anything else, there's nothing else that really limits periods the way that I can skip pills. I used to have a very outdoorsy set of jobs, and I couldn't always stop to change a tampon, or backpacking while carrying the waste out was a smelly hassle. Plus I relish buying non-dark colored undies and not having to worry that they'll be stained that horrid dark brown color.
