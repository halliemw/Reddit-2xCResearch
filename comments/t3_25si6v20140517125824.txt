I just seriously think that the whole "as a man" thing is ridiculous. It honestly doesn't matter that you're a man. Every post here doesn't start with "as a woman." Granted- being female is implied in a sub that is y'know... about women, but men have always been part of TwoX and have had some wonderfully insightful things to say. 

I very much agree with everything the OP has said. Men aren't unwelcome here, but it is unwelcome to treat this sub as something else.  We are dedicated to thoughtful and meaningful content, not bickering and fighting about men vs. women. But above all.. INTENDED FOR WOMEN'S PERSPECTIVE. This means that everything will be focussed on the woman's side, not the men's. Therefore "not all men" is a silly thing, because we just plain aren't talking about that.
