Bullies don't bully because they're jealous, bullies bully because they love seeing their victims suffer. My bullies loved seeing me cry in school every single day and have panic attacks. They loved to laugh about it. They weren't jealous of anything, they just loved to pick on the weakest, ugliest girl with the low self-esteem.
