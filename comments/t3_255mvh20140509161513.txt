Of course. I basically trawled craigslist for most of it, which if you have the patience for and access to a truck or trailer I definitely recommend. Approximate because I have a terrible memory, but:

$450 for the rubber coated bumper plates and a 45lb oly bars (New the plates are around $400 if you can find free shipping, about $250 for an oly bar)  
$250 for the women's bruiser bar (had to buy that one new)  
$300 for the rack, steel plates, bench and extra bar because I lucked the heck out on CL  
$150ish for the mats  

So I've probably put in a little over a grand so far. Which is why there is so much still on my 'one day I'll add this' list....
