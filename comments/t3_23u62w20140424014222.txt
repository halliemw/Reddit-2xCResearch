the biggest thing for you, i think, will be finding a doc you can trust.

when i was finally ready to see a doctor, a friend recommended the wife of her doc.  she was fantastic.  i'm in bc, ps.  

she let me bring my robe from home for the first physical so i wouldn't feel weird in a paper gown.  

if you live in a bigger city, ...well, anywhere it might take awhile to find a doctor who's taking new patients.  your first appointment can be basically an interview..   

my doctor now is also fantastic.  she, too, came recommended by friends.

you've got this, Ayaas
