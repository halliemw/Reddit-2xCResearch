I'm not saying anything about free speech, I'm just saying it's somewhat in bad tastes. There is a huge differance. Telling someone "I don't think this work of art is entirely good" and "I'm seizing and burning the books" are two ENTIRELY differant notions. It sometimes feels like a few of the rape scenes are there just to be "dark" or "edgy". Hell I love most what I've experianced so far of the series, but it's always been a sort of issue I've had.
