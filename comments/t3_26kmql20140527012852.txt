Dana White and the people involved with the UFC have done a pretty great job with the women's division.  The female fighters seem to be treated/promoted exactly the same as the male fighters, and it seems like the fans have responded positively. 

The only thing that worries me is fans may start to get a little bored of this.  The womens champion, Ronda Rousey, has so far shown herself to be MILES ahead of any other woman out there.  Since there's so few female fighters out there, the talent pool really isnt that deep.  It may get tough for the UFC to continue to put on entertaining, competitive fights.
