I get my period twice a month because of my birth control. I figured that it would light spotting with little to no pms, but every other week I am in hell. I'm either having terrible cramps one week or bloating the next, I'm either super hungry or can't eat at all. I will get so emotional that I am crying for hours and accusing my SO he is doing something wrong, anything, even if it is as simple as taking out the kitchen trash but not the bathroom.  I hate it. Being a female is torturous.
