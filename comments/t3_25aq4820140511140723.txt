you can also help keep them cleaner if you get a daily brush cleaner! elf makes a cheapo one, but what i did is put some of the wet n wild makeup remover in a spray bottle (because i hated it as a makeup remover on my face and didnt want it to go to waste). then when you're done for the day, you can spritz a little on there and swirl it on a paper towel or washcloth to clean them up a little! helps keep the colors from getting muddy after a few days too.
