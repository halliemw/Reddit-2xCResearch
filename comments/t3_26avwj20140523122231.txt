I would recommend reducing refined sugars and looking into the B Complex vitamins (B-100 Complex or B-50 Complex) and folic acid supplementation. Are you on the pill by any chance? Studies have shown that oral BCP can interfere with the body's ability to absorb folate (natural form of folic acid) which is vital to cervical health and can contribute to your body's ability to more quickly suppress HPV. 

You don't have to make any really drastic changes, just a few small adjustments can do wonders! Good luck, you'll be just fine! 

EDIT: Should add that BCP users just need to increase their folic acid supplementation to at least 800 mcg per day to help your body absorb the necessary amount. Sorry for all the details... I've done so much research on this due to being in exactly your position!
