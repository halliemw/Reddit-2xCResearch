I'm too far to be your friend, but I was basically in a very similar place at 20. I had to really take initiative to meet people and try to be friends with them, even though it was uncomfortable and inconvenient and awkward. I'm 24 now, and I have more amazing friends than I can count. The first step for me was getting involved in my local Reddit community and meetups. Yeah, there are some weirdos, but I met tons of great people that are still friends almost four years later. If not Reddit, there's meetup.com. If not meetup, there are classes and other types of community events. You have to go out there and reach out to people. They want new friends too! Once you make a few friends, I find that it becomes easier to make more. You can do it!
