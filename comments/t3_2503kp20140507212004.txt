I assume that an educated human being would know the difference between a fetus and a baby.

As someone who has given birth AND had an abortion, I am very clear on these two definitions, my apologies if you mistook my words for condescension.

Definitions are very important.

He may have rights if the fetus is carried to viability and then it would be a baby but he does not have control over her body.
