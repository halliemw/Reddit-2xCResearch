I know this is gonna blow your mind, but there are still men out there who **prefer** their partner stays unshaven. That's right, they love the bush. Love it. And there are a lot of men out there who are either indifferent, or who are going to put your physical comfort way, way, way above their preferences for how your pubes look. 

I too am incapable of shaving or waxing. I met a new guy over Christmas and asked him what his preferences were. He wanted cleaned up and trimmed down, which I figured was only fair since I was asking him to go bald (for oral purposes). I just recovered from the last ingrown hair a few days ago. He has been more than understanding, and we have both agreed that just keeping things trimmed is okie dokie. 

I am also never waxing again.

So you can do one of two things - work on being more at peace with your body, or try electrolysis/laser hair removal.  Accepting and becoming more comfortable with yourself is obviously the cheaper choice, but if you really don't think you can manage it, then there's no point in not investigating permanent hair removal further. 

P.S. FWIW I'm still working on accepting my appearance - there's a lot of things I don't like. But having partners who compliment you and take the time to make sure you enjoy yourself has sure helped me make progress. Just something to consider :)

Edit: Sorry, I assumed you're heterosexual. If you're not, the advice still applies. Regardless of sexual orientation, I guarantee there are people out there who share your orientation and love a hairy vulva. Good luck OP!
