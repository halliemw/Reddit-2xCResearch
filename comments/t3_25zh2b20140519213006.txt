It's a tricky situation, and it's hard to really say with certainty whats best to do. I'm a guy who was molested as a kid, so I might have a little insight, but reactions and thoughts vary so much for each victim it's hard to tell. No matter what, don't pressure him into anything, reporting it or not seeing his dad or even seeing a counselor. All of those things might sound  good, might even be healthy, but he has to come to them on his own. You can suggest them or discuss them with him, but sexual abuse involves a huge loss of control and there's a good chance he wants to maintain control over things related to the abuse. 

Bringing it up is really tricky, too. It could lead to him feeling he was "caught" and put a cloud over everything. Many victims feel a lot of guilt and self blame, and even if they know intellectually it's not their fault it's hard to shake the feeling. Unearned guilt is a nasty thing, even harder to deal with than guilt over something truly your fault because there's not much you can do about it. 

The sexual issues could be related to the molestation, or really a million things. Work stress, illness, self esteem, anything. Did it start after that visit? It could have been triggered by a confrontation. 

Sorry if this was full of non-answers. The most important thing is to be understanding and considerate. The internet is full of resources for loved ones of survivors, these kinds of things are tragically common.
