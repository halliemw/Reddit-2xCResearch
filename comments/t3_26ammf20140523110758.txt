Sounds like the school handled the situation well, you on the other hand have no training on how to deal with people with special needs and mental disorders.  You even admitted he never did anything specifically wrong which I assumed meant never hurt anyone.  His mistake was using a public computer to look at porn.  Something that even normal, healthy people sometimes do, albeit more discreetly.  I don't think they would appreciate being loudly shamed and ordered to apologize to everyone in the room.  You could have tapped him on the shoulder, pulled him aside and had a quiet word with him.  If he refused to comply then you take it further.


Unless I'm missing something, it sounds like you really took it personal and refuse to communicate with the guy afterwards..  did he make a move on you or say anything inappropriate to offend you?  And to state that the guy in OP's story knew what he was doing as a fact further shows you have little to no experience in actually working with the mentally disabled.  He could have felt remorseful because he truly did not know OP would be so upset and hurt by his actions.
