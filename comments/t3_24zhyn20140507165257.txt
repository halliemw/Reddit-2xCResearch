My dad was amazing and I'll never stop missing him.  He taught me to fish when I was really little - I mean it when I say almost *every* childhood & baby picture of me involves fish, a rod, or a boat.  

He taught me what was important to him, how to do the things he loved, and to be accepting of others even though he wasn't good at it.  He always, always told me "it takes all kinds" and I didn't really understand that until I was in my mid-20's.  He never went out of his way to scare my friends/boyfriends, and he let me make my own mistakes... but he was there for me when I realized I'd fucked up and needed help.  He was a smartass and made the most awful, hilarious puns you could ever imagine.  He taught me to love trivia and nerdy things, to fish, to do minor work on cars, and to really appreciate nature.  

He was an amazing person and I wish he was still here, because I'm pregnant and this would've been his first grandkid.  But he was amazing because he was just an honest, open kind of person and he had a heart of gold, because that's just who he was.  

Be yourself, dude.  Your daughter is going to love you for *who you are*.  Love her and support her, let her know she can come to you with anything.  Do fun stuff with her.  Carve out time for just the two of you, do silly stuff together that only the two of you will share.
