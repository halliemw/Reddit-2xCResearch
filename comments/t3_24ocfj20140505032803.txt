OB were the first tampons ever and I think applicators were introduced a lot later. The name just meant that you now had an alternative to pads,  if I remember correctly. 

Edit: oh, I was wrong... Actually the first tampons came with applicators. And ob weren't the first ones. But the part about the name was correct.
