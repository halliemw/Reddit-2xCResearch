"real grey" 

You are a child. Enjoy your continued "Success" via stealing artwork and breaking the very black and white laws. 

P.S. I know a person who sells at craft fairs and he is makes a legit living off it (50k+), but he is always hiding his work and often gets threats. It's not Mega-man, it's 8-bit man. He knows he's breaking the law, he at least owns it.
