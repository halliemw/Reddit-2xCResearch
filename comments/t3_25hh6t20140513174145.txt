Honestly I've stopped coming here as frequently as I have in the past because of this. I can almost predict what the most upvoted comment in threads will be, and I know some views of mine will be downvoted no matter how politely and articulately I express them, just because it's not in line with what gets upvoted now. I think people need to keep in mind basic reddiquette - downvotes are for comments that do not add to the discussion, not ones that you personally disagree with.
