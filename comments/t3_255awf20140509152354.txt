The calls being recorded is great for you!  Further proof of this ridiculousness.

Occassionally asking for constant repetition is a really good deterrent:

Guy: Well I should come by your house later, sugar tits.

You:  I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, I didn't hear that.

Guy: I said I should come by after work.

You:  Ahh, I think the line is just a little fuzzy, do you mind repeating it one more time?

Guy: Nevermind.

(I LOVE using this tactic.  Forcing people to repeat their comments, sexist jokes, or other inappropriate behavior more slowly and clearly takes all the fun away from them.)

Or you could be sickly sweet and straightforward - both this and the above tactic will be great on a recorded phonecall.

Guy:  So is a sweet girl like you single?

Me:  Oh sorry Mr. Jones, I am not allowed to discuss my personal life in any way on company time.  As these calls are all recorded and listened to by management, I would prefer to follow the rules because I enjoy my job and helping people.  I hope you had a good experience with (bank) today and thank you for being a great customer.

Guy: Oh...yeah...ok thank you for your help.

Maybe the second one won't be as easy or smooth, but emphasize that the phone call is recorded so other people will hear the inappropriate comments, and you like your job and don't want to do anything to get in trouble.  Keep emphasizing those points as much as possible.
