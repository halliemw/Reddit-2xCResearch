You raise a lot of interesting points. I did consider that women shouldn't be encouraging this, but I didn't have space to put it in the article. I've never even thought about male prisoners or the male role model to make it seem like not all men are avid sex machines. The more I think about this issue, the more complex it seems and I wonder how we're ever going to combat current social trends.
