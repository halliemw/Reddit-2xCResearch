Speaking as someone who's new, I can agree with you that I'm not that interested in most of the front page material. That's just not me. But, I didn't feel annoyed - I felt welcomed. I was happy to see that, if I wanted to, I could participate in those discussions in a space that values women's perspectives.

And so far, I've been lurking in the new section of this sub, and I've had pretty decent experiences. People here are willing to engage in other topics, and I've met some nice people that accepted the fact that I'm new.

Just speaking from my perspective though. I'm sure that there could have been people that were turned away by the front page. But I would like if they could look past that and see what I've seen as a new person.
