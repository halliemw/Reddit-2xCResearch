Wedding customs are so different from place to place. 50-80 guests would definitely not be considered a small wedding in my  place. :) You know how many people came to my weeding - 14. And it was great. No bridesmaids or best men, just us having a really sweet, small ceremony with me being as awkward as I am (almost dropping the ring, giving my signature in my worst handwriting since I managed to almost cut one of my fingers off a few days before and all pictures focusing on our rings/hands show the huge bandage) and then a nice dinner in a fancy restaurant my mother paid for.

It was fun. And I love to remember it. I don't think we would've felt comfortable with a dead-serious, super romantic ceremony with people weeping and doves flying - not saying any of this is bad, it's just not for us. So my advise is, don't think about tradition, this weding is about you and your SO and you can make it anything you like.
