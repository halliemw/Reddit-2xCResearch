Thanks! We've been married for 5 years. 

Whenever he has felt/feels jealous towards any male friend of mine, I've always just asked, "Well, would you like to meet him so you can get your own impression of him?" Usually he ends up liking the dude and sometimes they even become friends so we all get to hang out together. :)

When he doesn't like one  of my friends, we talk about why and based on whether I think his reason is legitimate or not, I either remain friends or cut ties to a ' I'll only talk to you if it's necessary while being as tactful and non-cunty as possible.'
