Anyone who reds this and is thinking about reporting what your going through, what you have been through please just do it. 

If you think your partner has a past you don't know about you can make an application under 'Claires law'  and request information about your partners offending history in relationships. If you've seen 'that side' of your partner don't wait until your trapped in a cycle of abuse.
