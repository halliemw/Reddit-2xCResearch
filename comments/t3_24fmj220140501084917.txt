I was in a sorority in college and we had a certain GPA we had to keep. At the beginning of the semester they would say who was on the Dean's List for last semester and one time they said, "And we have one person on the Dean's List." I found out it was me! I'd been on the dean's list a couple times in college but they NEVER gave me a letter which everyone else got.
