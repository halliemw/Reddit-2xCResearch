I had a similar problem for about 3 years.  Now I drink a lot of water, pee before sex, drink a lot of water + cranberry extract, have sex and then pee again. Sex is often spontaneous, so just stay well hydrated throughout the day.  I cut down on sugar (<100g/d) and that helped a lot as well.  Another thing is to make sure you use lubricant during sex.  I'm a small person and husband is large, so there is often swelling in the general genital area.  I think the swelling and irritation around my urethra made it easier for bacteria to colonize the area, or at least made it more difficult to sweep away the bacteria when I went to pee.  Hydration, lowering using pH, and wiping front to back are the most important things.  If all that doesn't work, you may have an anatomical issue and need to see a doctor.  Good luck!  UTI's are miserable.
