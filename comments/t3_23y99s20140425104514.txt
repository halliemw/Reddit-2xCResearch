They're not necessarily bad news, but they do require maintenance and adjustment sometimes. Fuel injection automatically adjusts the air-fuel mixture for optimal performance, so there's no choke involved.

All modern cars are fuel injected, and they used to be carbureted. Bikes are gradually changing over to FI. That being said, my boyfriend has a truck and a bike that are both carbed and they run wonderfully.
