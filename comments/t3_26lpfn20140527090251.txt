I've considered volunteering at the Humane Society, but I am not sure how to go about doing that. Am I just supposed to show up and say "hey, I'm here to help!" and BAM, it's all done? I've tried looking at their website to see if there was like a volunteer application, but so far that has proven to be... hm, futile.
