Any chance you're going to a religious school? I got the same "sex is like tape" talk in high school.

This is rather disappointing that they're still trying to scare and misinform kids (I've been out of hs for a while, now). But at least you're smart enough to know that even if something isn't 100% proof it's better than 0%!

I'm not sure why schools even bother teaching sex ed when they're only going to cover it like this.
