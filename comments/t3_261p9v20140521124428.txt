I'm not denying that. I'm saying I don't believe they "try harder" in early grades to combat a gender stereotype. I fully believe that [stereotype threat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat) decreases their performance in later grades. It doesn't retroactively affect earlier grades, though.
