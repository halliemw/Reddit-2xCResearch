Oh man.. I really wish I could speak to you in person. I think all of this is what I needed to hear. It's good to know I'm not the only one who fakes it every day. I've been seeing my school counselor a lot lately, and she's very helpful. Hopefully I can talk to her tomorrow, and I also am actively looking for therapists. Sometimes it's so hard to fight my own thoughts, since they're sometimes so powerful and loud that I lose control, like today. I have the most loving friends, but it's like when I see him.. nothing really counts anymore. I try to shut him out constantly, but I just really don't know how I'll do that prom night. I wish I could hate him as much as I should.

Again, thanks so much for taking the time and typing all that out. I'm glad there's someone out there who knows what I've been through. More importantly, that someone out there believes in me.
