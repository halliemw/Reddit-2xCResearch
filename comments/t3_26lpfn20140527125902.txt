>  I do 99% of all housework

If I was your SO, that actually sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me...

To be "happy with" my SO all I'd want to know is that they're actively trying to get somewhere in life. If you're currently achieving that through your schooling, as *well* as helping me out domestically, I would be happy as larry for you.
