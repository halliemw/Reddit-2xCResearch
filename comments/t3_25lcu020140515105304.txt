When it's your money, you can do with it as you please.  For a gift, you can state a preference and give explanations, but having a loud argument in the store and calling them a hateful bigot and still accepting the gift is terribly rude and ungrateful.

Would you loudly argue with your grandmother in a store about something she picked out for you as a gift?  Would you go behind her back to a group of people to call her names?

The tactful thing to do is explain a preference, elaborate if they don't understand, and if they are still set on getting something else, let them.  You can even exchange it later without raising a big fuss and claim it didn't work out right.

That's the adult way to handle a situation.  There aren't hurt feelings (at the cost of you feeling like a martyr) and they don't feel like they got attacked for trying to do something nice.
