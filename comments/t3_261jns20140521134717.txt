spy alley doesn't have a lot of reading, (aside from a couple of special cards) it's mostly about collecting tokens and guessing out your opponents  so it's got a lot of room for fakeouts and double crossing. I used to play it with my dad and my little sister and she'd win most of the time. 

I talked about these things in counselling. I talk about it with my dad all the time. it's probably just as you say, mostly just a conflict of inherent style.
