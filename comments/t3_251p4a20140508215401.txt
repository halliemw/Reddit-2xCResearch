I'm surprised and disappointed that got removed. They're going hard with the ban-hammer; I guess some collateral damage is to be expected, but it's unfortunate. 

I still think it's a valid point. I would encourage you to make it again - possibly after a cooling down period, and maybe reframe it with a softer approach? 2xC has always been sort of a squishy place, (which has its benefits and detractions, obviously) often it's helpful to approach problems from a very clear position of good faith - even if such overtures of goodwill would be overkill in other subs.
