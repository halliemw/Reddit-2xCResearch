Abortions do not have to be a huge, emotional struggle. Sometimes they are, and sometimes they are not. To the people here and on the comments section of that video:: simply because *you* feel like *your* reaction to the decision/procedure would be highly emotional doesn't mean that every other woman going through with an abortion will feel that way, *and that's okay.* It's also okay if you couldn't connect with her message because you think your experience would be/was different, but she is not abnormal/messed up/wrong/bad for being unaffected.
