You don't have to answer this, but I'm genuinely curious.

When you say you gained weight with depression, did you end up in the 10-35 lb extra range? (Depends on frame, of course)

I gained about twenty pounds a few years ago and kept it because it's *awesome*, but I've noticed that I seem to have slipped into this realm of squishy invisibility, which is a *fantastic* bonus. I know my fat friends and thin friends still get harassed in public, but it's like I just disappeared when I gained just the right amount of weight.
