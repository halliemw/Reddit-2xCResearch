I'm still surprised that my partner of 16+ years finds me attractive. I don't think I'm anything special, so I understand where you're coming from. 

For me, my body image is helped by exercise. Not because it's going to change how my body looks (I will never be less than a size 10-12) but because I feel good about the effort I've put in and end up taking pride in what my body is able to accomplish. 

And in case it matters to you, screw the downvoters. Kudos to you for being brave enough to talk about this, even anonymously. Like another comment said, most likely everyone has felt this way at one time or another, but not everyone is brave enough to talk about it publicly.
