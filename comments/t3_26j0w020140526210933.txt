Some people do.  If you did a poll, I certainly believe you'd get a diversity of viewpoints.

And it depends on context.  In the context of most of the situations where these guys hope to apply their method like bars, clubs, etc. , I think it's cheesy.

In terms of most of the contexts where it could be used in every day conversation, I don't see anything wrong with it being used.

Also, sex doesn't have to equal relationships (for me personally, that's what I'm looking for.  But if other people wanted more casual encounters and it was consensual, what do I care and who am I to judge?)

By the way, thanks for engaging in the conversation.  It helps me think through these things.
