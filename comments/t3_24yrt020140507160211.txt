I'm really sad and disappointed in the mods for making this decision with no consultation of the community. There were a few trolls and ignorant people on here before but most people on here were serious subscribers and there were enough of us to counteract them with downvotes and report. Not anymore. We can all say goodbye to a safe place on reddit for women. I know I won't feel comfortable here anymore.
