Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.  I hate text, because it usually get's read by the reader in their own perceived voice.


You're absolutely right, it's not unbelievable, but most people don't hide being an asshole.  Unless they're psychotic. It's generally a fairly present trait, because it usually effects most of their behavior.  

If someone is an asshole only about how you touch their favorite guitar, that doesn't make them an asshole.

I wasn't talking about the OP when I started talking about the douche bag guys.  

Nor was I talking about her ex being an asshole.  I was just saying, he's probably your ex for a reason.  
It's just uncanny how many women, no matter how badly their ex treated them, would go back to their shit ex in exchange for a little comfort and security. Again, this is not about the OP, nor does it apply to every situation.  Just in general.

And yet again, I haven't blamed ANY WOMEN.  Not once.  Not even a quarter of half of once.  This just comes down to not being able to hear the tonality of what I'm saying.

It's seems like obvious projecting when a girl jumps to the defense of this non-existent female that I use to explain my feelings in suggesting that I'm blaming women as a whole and then calls me a "nice guy" in quotes.  Obviously, that person has a situation in their life that, from the guys perspective in their whatever relationship, could have the guy's point of view be similar my point of view and that makes them butthurt.


It seems that in your rush to tell me I'm generalizing about women, you've generalized about me.
