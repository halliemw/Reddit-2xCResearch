Agreed. I want to visit the subreddit tomorrow in order to upvote the pictures that I like and support people who are still brave enough to post them, and to help downvote the bad comments. I really hope people who do post pictures let us know (as a public) if they are being harassed in PMs so that the moderators can see how being a default subreddit has changed the entire dynamic of this sub for the worse.
