I just sat and pictured myself in this situation, and I don't think I'd be upset. For him it's just an excuse - a good one at that. He probably wasn't thinking about how it would affect you. He just wanted a day off. I think there are more important things for you to focus on, it would be sad for you to be mad at a time like this <3
