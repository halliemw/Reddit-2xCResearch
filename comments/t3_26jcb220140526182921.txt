There are two in my town.  They are in the sweetest looking little cottages.  They offer free pregnancy tests and "pre-natal counseling."  People stand outside planned parenthood and hand out cards to these places, but many women just wander in (they're on a major boulevard).

Then, the women are hit with all the reasons why they shouldn't abort and why adoption is so wonderful and shown a portfolio of wonderful parents for their upcoming fetuses to enjoy.

But from the outside, the words and signs look very much liked planned parenthood.
