You're awesome, thanks for the reply! I know, I totally understand what's happening but I didn't want to not post. It's not *quality* content but it is in line with what TwoX is about, so, you know, I want to contribute. Plus it's a nice place if you ignore the current default thing. ;-)

I know, I'm really bad at saying no to stuff, and I do enjoy being busy. Most of the time it works...just not this week. And when I start feeling overwhelmed, it's like this huge concrete wall that comes up and you can't get over it and suddenly everything is insurmountable, even basic things like showering (I haven't been there for a long time now, but I've been there and I didn't like it much!).

As for crazy drunk guy...it's tricky because I live in Europe where people just seem to let that sort of thing slide. I guess. I don't understand it. Everyone here can put on a pretty impressive set of blinkers.

So yeah, thanks for responding!
