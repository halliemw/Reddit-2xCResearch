> To be fair that's also where I learned about cervical mucus. Let's just say that was a huge relief to learn about too. 

Yeah, I learned my discharge is normal from the internet in my 20's.  I don't remember where, exactly, but I do remember staying up late many, many nights because I was convinced I was actually a boy and my mucus was from my hidden penis ejaculating.  It didn't help that I went spelunking and found my cervix.. which has a little "dip" in it that I assumed would be the pee/sperm hole.

That drove me crazy for years and I was too ashamed to ask anyone about it.  I didn't want to ask my mom because I didn't want her to hate me since I was her only daughter and if I told her "I'm a boy, there's a penis inside of me" she would have three sons and no daughters, so I kept up a facade and pretended to be a girl.

That started when I was in my early teens.  :/  Now I know it's just when I'm ovulating and it's totally normal.
