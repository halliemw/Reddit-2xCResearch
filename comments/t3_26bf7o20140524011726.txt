"Toning" your arms isn't really a goal. It's a generic word that describes how you'd like your arms to look eventually. There's no such thing as toning though; you can lose body fat, you can gain muscle, or you can try to do both at the same time which is known as "recomposition" (which is an ineffective and slow way to achieve any fitness goal). 

If you want to build arm muscles, you should do bicep and tricep exercises and eat more calories, protein in particular, to build more muscle. 

If you don't want bigger arms, but want them to be smaller but more defined, you should lose body fat by eating less and, again, doing arm workouts to maintain muscle mass.

Trying to "tone" tends to waste people's time; you can workout as much as you want, but if you aren't eating for your goals and doing proper exercises, you won't see any changes whatsoever in your body.

I don't like the /r/fitness sub, but the wiki there is a useful guide for effective workouts. The best fitness sub is /r/bodybuilding IMO, but that's your choice if you feel comfortable posting there.
