I had an experience not entirely unlike this. I had a best friend in HS who suddenly turned on me (my brother didn't want to date her friend, and my mom was a teacher of hers who gave her bad grades for not turning in work, so I guess she took it out on me) and many others in that group of friends also grew hostile towards me. I decided to stop hanging out with the people who were mean to me. Two girls I was close with around that time were in that same group of friends, but stuck by me even when things got bad, and I'm still friends with them. The whole debacle was six or seven years ago, when I was in high school.

I'm not sure exactly what your situation is, but you might not have to reject your good friend and your best friend just because you want to stop spending time with the group. Either way, it sucks to have people you thought were friends turn on you like that. I'm sorry you're going through that.
