I really appreciate your response. It does feel like my anger is useless, and I'm trying to let go. My mother also has some very clear anxiety and depression (and possibly bipolar disorder) that's gone untreated, so that's where I try to direct my anger for the moment until I can make peace with it--at the dark clouds that were hanging above *her* head, rather than her.

Good luck to you as well, and I hope you and your father only become closer. :)
