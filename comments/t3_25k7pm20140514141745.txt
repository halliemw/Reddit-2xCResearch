Well, you did get a couple things right: those cats are her comfort fill-ins since her children are gone, and that you need to try and be close with her.  She probably could use a dependable and reliable source of company now.  Maybe a call to look forward to every (or every other) night, a visit monthly if you can manage it (or any of the kids, or course), and a lot of time.  Everything's being turned on its head in her world and there's nothing coming in to fill in the gaps.  She's lucky to have a daughter that cares, at least.
