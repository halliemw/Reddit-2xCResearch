Hmm.  Sexual assault = definitely criminal. 

Sexual abuse of adults, well, that's different.  Some forms of sexual abuse are assault (and therefore clearly criminal).  But sexual harassment (which is also abuse) is a civil matter.

That's how we have the laws set up in the US of A.  There's a lot to change (federal to state) if women decide they think this is a problem.
