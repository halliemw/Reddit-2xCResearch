:( I'm sorry. Personally, I don't think I would send the gift just because I would feel like I was putting myself out there to be hurt too much. Suppose you do send it - you know that you will be hopeful that he will respond and everything will be okay. But chances are, he won't respond to that either. That really sucks. If you haven't already purchased the gift, use the money for YOU! :)
