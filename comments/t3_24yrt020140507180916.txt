On a completely unrelated note on your poll- the geographical spread is pretty interesting.  Smatterings in the U.S., focused on California and the New York area, with a big presence from the U.K.

With double the normal amount of subs, hopefully the differences won't be too noticeable.  The first few days might be rough, but the mods can always opt out at a later point in time.
