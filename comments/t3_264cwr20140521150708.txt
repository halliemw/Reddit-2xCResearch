I would agree, except with your original post: 

> after reading this subreddit I am beginning to think that I should take issue with this

If you didn't have issue with something before, don't let a bunch of other people in different situations make you "think you should take issue" with anything. 


Anywho, if it hurts you, talk to him about it. He seems pretty sensible but also pretty down to earth. I joke with my GF all the time, though she thinks women are pretty too, so we can commiserate about the cute blonde that walks by and how we wish her shorts were a bit shorter, etc. We watch tv shows and talk about which one of us gets which girl - but at the same time, I would be comfortable with her joking about sleeping with guys too (rare, but she does come out with the occasional "oh I would tear his clothes off" or similar) 

The "joking" about friends thing is where the line gets crossed for me. Because I know there are many of my GFs friends that I find cute and would be interested in if I were single. I just don't let myself get to that point because she IS the only person I am interested in, and having cheated on past ex's, I recognize the pattern and do not ever want to step foot on that path again. 

But in the end, it's up to you two to discuss, maybe he doesn't have a filter for when he should and shouldn't joke about good looking women. Maybe he is a cheater. Maybe he is devoted to you and just likes to joke around. If you aren't happy, talk to him. It is possible for two people to be great, but not great together. I do know, though, that I'm definitely using that line later tonight while I'm working and my GF comes out to bug me while I'm elbow deep inside my computer chassis ;-)
