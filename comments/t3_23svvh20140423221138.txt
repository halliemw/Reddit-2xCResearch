I had a buddy in college who would go to the bar and say to women who walked by "I'd lick your pussy." His exact explanation to me was, "19 times out of 20, it's probably not going to work. Hell, I may even get slapped. But there's that 1 time in 20 when I'll be taking someone home with me." The thing is, he was right. He certainly saw more action than I did (and I didn't do bad myself.)

The question is what do things like this artist's drawing achieve? If you're like the men being drawn, or like my friend, it probably isn't going to effect you. If you're willing to message some stranger "I wanna tongue punch your fart box," you probably don't care enough about their opinion to take anything away from their judgmental doodles of your caricatured noodle. And to everyone else, this just becomes preaching to the choir.
