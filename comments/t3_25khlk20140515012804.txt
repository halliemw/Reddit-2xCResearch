From what I've seen, if it's a group of women who don't know each other very well and a man enters the group, the man will get more attention (I think this is true in reverse as well). But in a group of close girl friends, a guy is much more likely to get pushed to the side of the conversation or wind up playing on his phone. I think it has less to do with a lack of respect for the opinion of the minority in the group, and more to do with the differences in communication between genders. A conversation between a group of girls follows a very different structure than a group of guys, it can be difficult to assimilate smoothly.
