Some a little more positive 

"I am a feminist. And I'm so glad that Lena Dunham exists, because she is one too, and she's quite vocal about it. Yes, women have more freedom and more influence than ever, but it's hardly equal. It's just not. It's really f*cking crazy. I'm sorry I'm cursing. But it's wild that women are underrepresented [in Hollywood]. I have real anxiety about directing, and that's something to question and challenge and correct." -Claire Danes

"I think if you're not from America you read this stuff and you're like, 'What?' But I don't know why people are so reluctant to say they're feminists. Maybe some women just don't care. But how could it be any more obvious that we still live in a patriarchal world when feminism is a bad word? Feminism always gets associated with being a radical movement â€“ good. It should be. A lot of what the radical feminists [in the 1970s] were saying, I don't disagree with it." - Ellen Page

"The answer is yes, I consider myself a feminist, and it informs my work only in that it's just who I am, in the same way that I'm a woman, or I'm 5'2" or whatever. I was lucky that I came through a system that had many people who did much more hard work and road-clearing before I got there." - Amy Poehler
