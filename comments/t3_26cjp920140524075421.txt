Girl you look good! Super cute!

I wear pastels all the time so I run into the ~shit if I stain this, it will be super noticeable.~ What is comes down to is, just rock it out while you have it. 

Clothing get ruined all the time - might as well enjoy it. With that said, look before you sit down. I do a little stealthy patting of my seat or I'll smooth down my dress as I sit, it makes it so you can feel if there is anything gross/stainy on the seat. 

Put a napkin in you lap when you eat. Don't be a slob. 

The more you worry about it, the more likely you are to stain it. I don't know why - but that's what always happens. So just relax and know you look fierce.
