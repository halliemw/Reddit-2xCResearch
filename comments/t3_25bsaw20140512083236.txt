I look at self-harm as a way of self-medicating. I don't think it is the correct way to react, but for people in mental pain some kind of physical pain can be very relieving. I know that in my worst days in the past I'd do great self harm(usually hitting myself. Once I took frying pan to my noggin') as it just felt so much better to feel actual real pain instead of the hopeless sadness within. The strange thing it worked really fucking well.

I personally love myself greatly, but at the same time I just can't get bothered with this existence anymore. One could say I love myself too much to bother playing the game. :)
