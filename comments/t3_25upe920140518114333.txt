It's not the same intense, stressful sort of fun; there is tension and anxiety but everyone really seems to get on, even Paul Hollywood's harsh criticism is constructive and honest rather than rude. It feels quite genteel (which is odd because of the aforementioned tension...). I absolutely adore it.
