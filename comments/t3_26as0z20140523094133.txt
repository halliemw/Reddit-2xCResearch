I completely agree with what you are saying. I think both partners should be responsible for invisible and visible labor. But as a recently married woman, I have to chime in: Please don't expect your future husband to know this stuff (or change!) just because you got married. You know how he is right now? That's pretty much how he's going to be.

If you want to work on this division of labor problem with him, do it as a relationship exercise. It has nothing to do with getting married. If he wasn't open to the idea then, he's not going to be open to it with a ring on his finger.
