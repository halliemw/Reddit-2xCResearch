> In terms of the second paragraph, from what I understand the idea is that a woman without FGM will get pleasure from sex and be a 'slut', therefore shaming her family and ensuring that no man wants to marry her. In the ocumentary I first linked, many of the teenage boys even believed that, saying the wouldn't want a girl who hadn't been cut as it meant she probably slept around and was a nympohmaniac. They said they would much rather a cut girl because it meant she would only have sex with her husband. Though as you say tradition is also a big part, many uncut girls are told that they cannot tell anyone about it as nobody would give them a job or let their sons date them or anything.

Thanks for relating that part. I try as much as possible to get the story from the people whose culture it is actually a part of. Personally I'm of the same opinion as you that it's done to lessen sexual enjoyment. I just don't think that the purpose (whatever it is) is what makes it wrong. If they believed it made girls immune to disease or gave them superhuman powers, it would still be just as wrong to cut a young girl's genitals. This is why I don't understand why people say "it's different from circumcision because it's done to control sexuality". No matter what reasoning parents give, it is still violating bodily autonomy of a child.

> I think we can both agree, hopefully, that they are both horrific practices and that it's essential that both are stopped.

Agreed.
