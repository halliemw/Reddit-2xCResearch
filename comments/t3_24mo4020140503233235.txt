You know, when I left the house for college and then got a job right after, things *did* get better between us and the verbal/emotional abuse subsided for a while. Even up until today things were pretty stable until I took my mom's side and defended her from his abuse. That was the tipping point and as the day has worn on, he's been trying really hard to be friendly and make eye contact/talk to me but I haven't looked at his face or spoken to him directly. My boyfriend thinks he's embarrassed, but I don't care. I'm not giving in this time.
