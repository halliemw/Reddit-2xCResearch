I was horrible HORRIBLE at small talk and would just stare awkwardly at people, then my (social butterfly)  sister told me "Small talk is a skill, you have to practice it." So I started small talking everyone. Cashiers, customers where I worked, people at the bus, people on the bus. I would ask people how their day was, have conversations about the weather ten times a day until I got a grasp on what people talked about when they didn't have anything to talk about. I can't say I am great at shooting the shit, but I remembered to fill in awkward silences at last. :)
