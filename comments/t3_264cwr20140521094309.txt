Guy here, and I can say without a doubt that your boyfriend sounds like a jerk with some control issues. Nobody should just assume dominance and for any good relationship to work, NEITHER of you should "wear the pants." Do you get what I'm saying? You can't make a relationship work if one person is always calling the shots, there has to be some give and take.

As for him talking openly about sleeping with your friends or co-workers etc. that's just messed up. He's messing with your head and that ain't cool. You should tell him how you feel and if he won't change you should get out of this relationship before it's too late. I feel if you continue on this path, he will cheat while messing with your mental in the process. My advice is dump him, but that's easy for me to say typing from a keyboard.
