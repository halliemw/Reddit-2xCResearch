Newsflash:  Discrimination against women, in hiring and other matters still exists.  This isn't about "Feelings" which of course we shouldn't care about (/s for the literal), it's about actual documented with double blind studies discrimination against women.

Acknowledging the reality on the ground makes you a rational person.  Claiming that it doesn't exist because you don't wanna deal makes you a fool.
